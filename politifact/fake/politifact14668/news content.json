Our country is going to hell.\" Trump claims that those born on U.S. soil to illegal immigrants don't have full citizens' rights. \"What happens is they're in Mexico, they're going to have a baby, they move over here for a couple of days, they have the baby,\" he told O'Reilly. Trump asserted, \"Many lawyers are saying that's not the way it is in terms of this,\" and went on to say, \"They are saying it is not going to hold up in court. It will have to be tested but they say it will not hold up in court.\" The GOP presidential hopeful does not, however, support amending the Constitution to repeal birthright citizenship, saying it would be a \"long process.\" \"I think it would take too long,\" he told Fox News. \"I'd much rather find out whether or not anchor babies are citizens because a lot of people don't think they are. We're going to test it out.\" Trump will begin the process to locate and deport illegal immigrants along with \"Anchor Babies\" as early as next week. Any immigrant who has illegally overstayed a visa or entered the country illegally, along with any children of illegal immigrants, no matter what age or how long they have resided in the United States, will be deported beginning as early as mid-February.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/6/d/b/8/c/6db8c6c6ce4f1800b5b5e4f6b645da67e3618054.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/8/3/f/c/0/83fc083716be2d94358c3b00d84505c0b15ef4ab.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/2/d/b/0/0/2db0019a16963016ac852c9831d7b3c54d9a91c9.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/6/e/1/6/f/6e16f0e96757ad38d6c349d6af104e094df3e5d3.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/a/4/9/e/2/a49e241684e650d81a783b7ba5bbb12803675754.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/2/9/1/e/6/291e6f01d7f88b3845e0568467784f7e2412232e.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/8/b/1/f/1/8b1f16ddbd30c018cfd7e88e96a9c27bb7069e67.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/b/d/6/1/8/bd6189f60e9dac46929cac4cdb0219f8983d64ad.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/8/0/d/f/4/80df4d7827db2df3beaebfe1924c28f1bab120b5.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/e/0/3/1/1/e0311c69318214f1457d7598300d992d17bb5959.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/f/4/6/d/d/f46dd6940de47f2362d18b664e0d279cdc3ed695.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/1/6/7/2/7/16727a003ca2cec71a6333894f15d8d6134f7283.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112im_/http://www.react365.com/cache/images/f/4/6/d/d/f46dd6940de47f2362d18b664e0d279cdc3ed695.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171024001112/http://www.react365.com/59ed36a3cf5bb/tulsa-school-closes-after-brutal-fire.html", "title": "Tulsa School closes after brutal fire.", "meta_data": {"description": "Tulsa school East Central High School closes down after fire set on purpose.
