Of course we were dismissed as conspiracy theorists.\n\n\n\n\n\nNow it has been reported that former D.C. homicide detective Rod Wheeler had been hired by Rich\u2019s family to run a parallel investigation to the one being conducted by the F.B.I.\n\nBoth the D.C. police and the F.B.I. had been involved but Wheeler revealed that neither, \u201cThe police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming. They haven\u2019t been cooperating at all.\n\nWheeler also confirmed that his sources have told him that \u201cabsolutely\u201d there is information on Rich\u2019s laptop that links Rich to Wikileaks.\n\nWheeler also was told by his source inside the D.C. Police Department, \u201cRod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can\u2019t share any information with you.\u201d\n\nAccording to Wheeler, \u201cThat is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don\u2019t think it comes from the chief\u2019s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor\u2019s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out.\u201d [Tuesday].\n\nIt\u2019s apparent that Wheeler was being guarded in giving his statement but the fact is the F.B.I. has been in possession of Rich\u2019s laptop and the agency\u2019s director at the time, James Comey locked down the contents to protect either certain people at the DNC, or members of Hillary\u2019s campaign team, or Hillary Clinton, or likely all three.\n\nComey\u2019s contention that the DNC server contained proof that Russia hackers affected the election is falling apart as we watch the mad scramble that is ensuing following the recent ransomware attacks.\n\nIn explained the ransomware attack, experts are shooting holes in Comey\u2019s claim that the F.B.I. is capable of tracking attacks backwards.\n\nHector Monsegur, Director of Security Assessments for Rhino Security Labs and a former computer hacker who had been arrested by the FBI informant before turning informant said:\n\n\u201cAttribution is probably the hardest thing the FBI is dealing with here.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s nearly impossible because you have various hackers from pretty much anywhere. Also, they are aware of techniques to track them down. So you could have an Egyptian hacker who uses Russian software so it looks like it\u2019s Russian but is actually from Egypt.\u201d\n\nComey was definitive that Russia had hacked the DNC\u2019s computers with the intention of helping Donald Trump get elected. Here\u2019s what we\u2019ve learned since Comey made that declaration to congress:\n\nThe F.B.I. never did a forensic examination of the DNC servers. Instead they took the word of the company the DNC hired to look into it.\n\nExperts, ones who worked for the F.B.I., admit that attribution is nearly impossible even if you are in possession of the computers that were hacked.\n\nComey \u201cconcluded\u201d that Hillary Clinton did not intend to commit espionage despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary but that the Russians intended to help Donald Trump without presenting a single shred of evidence that the Russians were even involved.\n\nRevelations such as this continue to surface. They are the reason that former Federal Prosecutor Joseph DiGenova said of Comey, \u201che\u2019s a dirty cop.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxbusiness.com\n\nComey had to go and President Trump did the right thing in firing him. Contrary to the talking points coming out of the D.C. swamp, Trump gave Comey every opportunity to prove his fealty to the law once he had been freed from the constraints put on him by Obama and Loretta Lynch. When Comey continued protecting known criminal behavior to save the swamp he left Donald Trump no choice but to fire him.\n\nAmerica deserves an F.B.I. director who is determined to prosecute criminal behavior no matter where he finds it.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170524182427im_/http://patriotcrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seth-rich-2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170524182427im_/http://patriotcrier.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seth-rich-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170524182427/http://patriotcrier.com/1-6kk-0/", "title": "BOMBSHELL: COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE & COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BOMBSHELL: COMEY KNEW MURDERED DNC STAFFER, SETH RICH, WAS WIKILEAKS SOURCE & COVERED IT UP FOR HILLARY", "description": "ELDER PATRIOT \u2013 New evidence has been uncovered by a private investigator that proves Jim Comey was a dirty cop who had to go.
