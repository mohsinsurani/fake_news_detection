When we realised what was happening, it was too late. We shut down the heating system, but he was already dead.\u201d\n\nMs. Davis claims that the young coworker who caused the accident was a new employee and had forgotten to check for the toe tag to make sure he had the right body.\n\nThe police have opened an investigation to determine the exact circumstances surrounding Mr. Johnson\u2019s death.\n\nInvestigators have not ruled out the possibility of filing criminal charges against the employee who caused his death.\n\nThe young man could possibly be accused of criminal negligence causing death.", "images": ["http://worldnewsdailyreport.com//worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morguedeath.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/manurevilla2-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/fishermanshark-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/pizzaman-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/dermalstud2-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/saudibacon-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fb8ef1441b97e1436ec724ea791f44db?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/themes/mh_newsdesk/images/factsdontmatter3.png", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/crazygirlfriend-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/cotapaxi3-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morgueemployee.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Rushmorerescue-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/mermaidrape3-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/oldalienprobes-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Ukrainianlover3-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6f73721764d9bdbd20ed91a50caf9bca?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/voodoohairdresser-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/01/flamegame-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/afghansheep-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/braintransplant-180x101.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/TSAflashlight-120x67.jpg", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/brosis-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/73d96e5b9017be2f453584c5e9149a51?s=70&d=mm&r=g", "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/squirrelman3-120x67.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a80b974e33cdddf8ed513db82d4f6042?s=70&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morgueemployee.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Barbara Jennnings"], "canonical_link": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-employee-cremated-by-mistake-while-taking-a-nap/", "title": "Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "generator": "WordPress 4.9.21", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Morgue employee cremated by mistake while taking a nap", "url": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/morgue-employee-cremated-by-mistake-while-taking-a-nap/", "type": "article", "description": "Beaumont, Texas | An employee of the Jefferson County morgue died this morning after being accidentally cremated by one of his coworkers.\r\nAccording to the Beaumont Police Department, 48-year old Henri Paul Johnson decided to take a nap on a stretcher after working for sixteen hours straight.\r\n\r\nWhi", "image": {"identifier": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morgueemployee.jpg", "url": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morgueemployee.jpg", "secure_url": "https://worldnewsdailyreport.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/morgueemployee.jpg", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "updated_time": "2020-02-05T18:13:46+00:00"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-03-01T13:48:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-02-05T18:13:46+00:00", "section": "Tragedy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1688449734707868}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488376082.0, "source": "http://worldnewsdailyreport.com", "summary": ""}
