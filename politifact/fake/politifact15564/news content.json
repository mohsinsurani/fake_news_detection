These right-wing judges don't think for themselves, they just do whatever the Constitution says. And it's time for that to end.\"\n\nSenate Democrats have vowed to make sure that any new nominee isn't going to be beholden to outside influences like the Constitution, the founding fathers, or the rule of law. \"We need judges to be advocates of progressive laws,\" Senator Elizabeth Warren added. \"Not people who will bow to the whims of the Constitution, pitting its extremist values of freedom of speech and freedom of religion against our agenda.\"\n\n\"We're sick and tired of the Constitution sitting in the National Archives, manipulating everything we do,\" stated Senator Cory Booker, trying to emote for the cameras but failing. Booker then called a ten-minute recess for him to refresh his supply of fake tears before he could continue.\n\nAsked about their concerns, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he \"doesn't care\" and plans to \"completely ignore\" the Democrats in the nomination process since \"there's nothing they can do\" and he is \"literally unstoppable.\"", "images": ["https://babylonbee.com/bee/img/logo.png", "https://babylonbee.com/bee/img/logo-darkmode.png", "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1946.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=326751097945685&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1946.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://babylonbee.com/news/senate-democrats-demand-supreme-court-nominee-not-be-unduly-influenced-by-u-s-constitution", "title": "Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "csrf-token": "Mwa4VNYQhgEqlU9J4lfdWrrKD4BLlsxbW2fBZVse", "og": {"title": "Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution", "type": "article", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C.&mdash;Still reeling from Trump&rsquo;s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn&rsquo;t yet another crony of something called &ldquo;The Constitution,&rdquo; Senate Democrats announced Friday.", "url": "https://babylonbee.com/news/senate-democrats-demand-supreme-court-nominee-not-be-unduly-influenced-by-u-s-constitution", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1946.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1946.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Babylon Bee"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TheBabylonBee", "creator": "TheBabylonBee", "title": "Senate Democrats Demand Supreme Court Nominee Not Be Unduly Influenced By U.S. Constitution", "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C.&mdash;Still reeling from Trump&rsquo;s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn&rsquo;t yet another crony of something called &ldquo;The Constitution,&rdquo; Senate Democrats announced Friday.", "image": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1946.jpg"}, "description": "WASHINGTON, D.C.\u2014Still reeling from Trump\u2019s previous Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch, Democrats plan to scrutinize any new nominee to ensure that he or she isn\u2019t yet another crony of something called \u201cThe Constitution,\u201d Senate Democrats announced Friday.", "published_at": "2018-06-29 00:00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "74b89ff439eb687e5a3300aa30d15a83"}, "fb": {"pages": 1752689034960996}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1549587642, affiliate-data=, app-argument=https://notthebee.com/news/senate-democrats-demand-supreme-court-nominee-not-be-unduly-influenced-by-u-s-constitution", "reaActive": "\"\"", "reaTypes": "\"\"", "editor_badge_class": "text-blue-600 fas fa-badge-check ml-1 pb-1", "verified_badge_class": "text-yellow-400 fas fa-badge-check ml-1 pb-1", "freeBadgeClass": "text-gray-400 fa-xs fas fa-user-lock ml-1 pb-0.5", "isBee": 1}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://babylonbee.com", "summary": ""}
