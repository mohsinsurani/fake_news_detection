It's all so clear now,\" he added.\n\nAfter the video started to go viral in ISIS cave networks and strongholds, thousands of terrorists began pouring out into the streets of Mayadin, giving one another spontaneous group hugs, destroying their weapons, and planting trees and flowers in an attempt to begin rebuilding the Middle East into a utopian wonderland.\n\nAccording to reports, al-Baghdadi further confirmed that a recent advertisement in which Kendall Jenner offered a group of riot police a Pepsi was also influential in his decision to immediately cease their murderous reign of terror and lead ISIS down a path of peace.", "images": ["https://babylonbee.com/bee/img/logo.png", "https://babylonbee.com/bee/img/logo-darkmode.png", "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=326751097945685&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://babylonbee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist", "title": "ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "csrf-token": "xjLglEHDScBsRqPrWLwJ5O3gc3wWA9O0YEkEFhmw", "og": {"title": "ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'", "type": "article", "description": "MAYADIN, SYRIA&mdash;Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, &ldquo;The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.&rdquo;", "url": "https://babylonbee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg", "width": 750, "height": 500}, "locale": "en_US", "site_name": "The Babylon Bee"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "TheBabylonBee", "creator": "TheBabylonBee", "title": "ISIS Lays Down Arms After Katy Perry's Impassioned Plea To 'Like, Just Co-Exist'", "description": "MAYADIN, SYRIA&mdash;Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, &ldquo;The greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.&rdquo;", "image": "https://media.babylonbee.com/articles/article-1000.jpg"}, "description": "MAYADIN, SYRIA\u2014Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, the leader of the Islamic State, released a statement Wednesday confirming that ISIS would be immediately surrendering its fight to establish a powerful caliphate after viewing an interview in which pop singer Katy Perry said, \u201cThe greatest thing we can do just unite and love on each other and like, no barriers, no borders, like, we all need to just co-exist.\u201d", "published_at": "2017-05-24 00:00:00", "p": {"domain_verify": "74b89ff439eb687e5a3300aa30d15a83"}, "fb": {"pages": 1752689034960996}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1549587642, affiliate-data=, app-argument=https://notthebee.com/news/isis-lays-arms-katy-perrys-impassioned-plea-like-just-co-exist", "reaActive": "\"\"", "reaTypes": "\"\"", "editor_badge_class": "text-blue-600 fas fa-badge-check ml-1 pb-1", "verified_badge_class": "text-yellow-400 fas fa-badge-check ml-1 pb-1", "freeBadgeClass": "text-gray-400 fa-xs fas fa-user-lock ml-1 pb-0.5", "isBee": 1}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://babylonbee.com", "summary": ""}
