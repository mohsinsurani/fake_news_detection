A recent 2015 state-wide study revealed that more than 60% of adults aged 21 and higher have tried crystal meth at least once and close to 40% of respondents believed crystal meth should be decriminalized as a schedule 2 drug for medical use in treatment.", "images": ["https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/logo-new.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/Malia-Obama-Selfie.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Woman-Stabbed-Man-With-Stiletto-350x199.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/Walmart-attacks.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Woman-Finds-Photos-Husband-With-Mother-350x199.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Mother-Stabs-and-Dumps-Body-in-Lake.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/homeless-couple.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/BreakingBad.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/kylie-jenner-toy-tyga.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/crystal-spiderman.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Minion-Cursing.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/police-missouri.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/babysitter-gets-jailed.jpg", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/Central-Park.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/Meth-Addict-Made-Stew.png", "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/methlab.jpg"], "top_img": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"description": "De Soto, Missouri - Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when | Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "url": "https://notallowedto.com/babysitter-on-drug-eats-toddler/", "site_name": "News And Entertainment", "image": {"identifier": "https://notallowedto.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/babysitter-on-drugs.png", "width": 680, "height": 354, "type": "image/png"}}, "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, height=device-height, width=device-width", "description": "De Soto, Missouri - Parents of a three-month old baby were horrified to discover their babysitter had turned into a crystal meth-smoking cannibal when | Babysitter on Crystal Meth Eats 3-Month-Old Baby", "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-21T15:47:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-20T19:22:21+00:00"}, "author": "George", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "George", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1453391265.0, "source": "https://notallowedto.com", "summary": ""}
