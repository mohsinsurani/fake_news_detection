Kennedy International Airport. This marks the first successful story following President Trump's executive order to protect the nation from foreign terrorist entry into the United States. Muhammad, 32, was questioned due to the heightened security measures that resulted from the presidential executive order. The suspect attempted to enter the country with a tourist visa and claimed to be visiting family in order to attend this year's Super Bowl LI.The story is definitely fake, even though fact checking websites like Snopes haven't debunked this hoax yet at the time of writing. There are several important clues that indicate the article is made up:", "images": ["https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/25/25212.jpg?1379810617", "data:image/png;base64,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", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/9/9508.jpg?1430780279", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/18/18443.jpg?1377270180", "https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/acadiaforum_net_profile.png", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/attachments/3/3803-f7515f3468437f1f33b8d7b15e9c9e7b.jpg", "https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/masscops_com.svg", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/24/24786.jpg?1479908066", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/1/1361.jpg?1325869203", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/0/89.jpg?1381623768", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://i0.wp.com/times.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/terrorist.jpg?zoom=2&resize=249%2C175", "https://www.masscops.com/cdn-cgi/image/format=auto,onerror=redirect,quality=50,width=1920,fit=scale-down/https://images.platforum.cloud/banners/masscops_com_banner_720w.jpg", "https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/c-classforum_com_profile.png", "https://images.platforum.cloud/logos/e46fanatics_com_profile.png", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/5/5826.jpg?1464622397", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/3/3369.jpg?1370302695", "https://www.masscops.com/d3/avatars/m/4/4753.jpg?1326071335"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/times.com.mx/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/terrorist.jpg?zoom=2&resize=249%2C175", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.masscops.com/threads/executive-order-leads-to-capture-of-isis-leader-rasheed-muhammad.185305/", "title": "Executive Order Leads to Capture of ISIS Leader, Rasheed Muhammad", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Executive Order Leads to Capture of ISIS Leader, Rasheed Muhammad\nJanuary 31, 2017NewPolitics0 Comment\n\n\n\nTerror suspect, Rasheed Muhammad, was arrested on...", "og": {"description": "Executive Order Leads to Capture of ISIS Leader, Rasheed Muhammad\nJanuary 31, 2017NewPolitics0 Comment\n\n\n\nTerror suspect, Rasheed Muhammad, was arrested on Tuesday, January 30, at approximately 1:32AM EST at John F.
