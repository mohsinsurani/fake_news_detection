Photograph: Albemarle County Jail/AFP/Getty Images\n\n\u201cHe has been charged with second degree murder, three counts of malicious wounding and failing to stop at an accident that resulted in a death,\u201d Kumer said in an email.\n\nDonald Trump condemned the \u201cviolence on many sides\u201d, but faced criticism for failing to directly denounce the far-right demonstrators.\n\nIn a separate incident, two police officers died when their helicopter, which was monitoring the far-right rally, crashed outside Charlottesville.\n\nState police said in a statement the helicopter was \u201cassisting public safety resources with the ongoing situation\u201d when it crashed in a wooded area. The pilot, Lieutenant H Jay Cullen, 48, of Midlothian, Virginia, and Trooper-pilot Berke Bates of Quinton, Virginia, died at the scene.\n\nThe deaths came at the end of a day marked by violent clashes between far-right nationalists and people who had come to protest against their occupation of a downtown park containing a statue of the Confederate general Robert E Lee.\n\nWitnesses said those hit by the car were peacefully protesting against the white supremacist rally and footage showed the vehicle crashing into another car, throwing people over the top of it.\n\n01:34 Virginia governor says 'go home' to white supremacists and nazis \u2013 video\n\nThe photographer Pat Jarrett, who witnessed the incident, said: \u201cA gray Dodge Charger plowed into a sedan and then into a minivan. Bodies flew. People were terrified and screaming. Those closest to it said it was definitely a violent attack. The driver, who people later described as a skinny white guy with a straggly beard, reversed out of there and drove off, the front end of his car all smashed up.\u201d\n\nCharlottesville mayor Mike Signer tweeted: \u201cI am heartbroken that a life has been lost here. I urge all people of good will \u2013 go home.\u201d\n\nSpeaking at a press conference on Saturday evening, the governor of Virginia, Terry McAuliffe, who had earlier declared a state of emergency, told the white supremacists: \u201cGo home \u2026 Shame on you. You pretend you are patriots, but you are anything but a patriot.\u201d\n\nThe mother of Fields told the Associated Press on Saturday night that she knew her son was attending a rally in Virginia but didn\u2019t know it was a white supremacist rally.\n\n\u201cI thought it had something to do with Trump. Trump\u2019s not a white supremacist,\u201d Samantha Bloom said, before becoming visibly upset as she learned of the injuries and deaths at the rally \u201cHe had an African-American friend \u2026,\u201d she said before her voice trailed off.\n\nResponding to the events in Charlottesville from Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump: \u201cWe condemn in the strongest possible terms this egregious display of hatred, bigotry and violence on many sides, on many sides.\u201d\n\nBut the Republican senator Marco Rubio tweeted that it was important for Trump to describe the events as a \u201cterror attack by white supremacists\u201d.\n\nThe FBI said it was opening a civil rights investigation into the accident along with the justice department\u2019s civil rights division and the district attorney\u2019s office.\n\nThe US attorney general, Jeff Sessions, said: \u201cThe violence and deaths in Charlottesville strike at the heart of American law and justice. When such actions arise from racial bigotry and hatred, they betray our core values and cannot be tolerated.\n\nWATCH: White nationalists and counter-protesters clash at Charlottesville rally https://t.co/4qH1yJjrGy \u2014 NBC News (@NBCNews) August 12, 2017\n\nThe car attack came about two hours after state police in riot gear had cleared Emancipation Park, the site of the Robert E Lee statue. The city\u2019s decision in February to remove the statue drew earlier protests by the \u201calt-right\u201d and the Ku Klux Klan.\n\nRiot police cleared the park after almost an hour of clashes. The far-right groups were largely compliant, but had to run the gauntlet of counter-protesters as they walked west along Market Street.After a brief stalemate, a hard core of about 100 far-right protesters moved to a park two miles away and gathered to hear speakers who had been scheduled for the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d event.\n\nOne of the speakers, the far-right figurehead Richard Spencer, said he had been maced on the way in and lashed out at police and city authorities.\n\nRescue personnel help injured people after a car ran into a large group. Photograph: Steve Helber/AP\n\n\u201cNever in my life have I felt like the government was cracking down on me until today,\u201d said Spencer. \u201cWe came in peace and we were effectively thrown to the wolves.\u201d\n\nHe said that they would not back down from protesting against the statue. When he mentioned Mayor Signer by name, the crowd chanted: \u201cJew! Jew! Jew!\u201d\n\nAround the park, members of the far right were nursing and treating minor wounds. One of them, who declined to give his name, was bleeding from the head, and claimed to have been struck with an iron bar. Another young man, with a swastika tattoo on his chest and blood on his forehead, told photographers: \u201cIf you take my picture, I\u2019ll cut you. I\u2019m not even kidding.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, counter-protesters were trying to stop the far-right groups from entering the park. Some counter-protesters, including many marching under red and black anti-fascist banners, tried to block the streets. This led to altercations with far-right groups, who were seen using chemical weapons, sticks and shields on people.\n\nA group of clergy linked arms to block a set of stairs leading into the park. The Rev Seth Wispelwey, of Sojourners United Church of Christ in Charlottesville, said: \u201cWe\u2019re here to counteract white supremacy, and to let people know that it is a system of evil and a system of sin.\u201d\n\nSteve Thomas, from Lynchburg, Virginia, who also protested against the far-right groups, said: \u201cI think that what we are witnessing here has always been simmering beneath the surface, and now has been emboldened and enabled by the Trump administration\u2019s politics and rhetoric.\u201d\n\nStatue controversy\n\nIn February, the city council narrowly voted to remove and sell the Robert Lee statue, and to rename the park in which it stands from Lee Park to Emancipation Park. This was the culmination of a campaign to remove the statue started by a local high school student, Zyahna Bryant.\n\n\n\nIt was part of a wave of such removals of Confederate monuments across the south, which began after Dylann Roof massacred nine African American churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina.\n\nIn response, last May, Richard Spencer led a torchlit white nationalist parade around the park. Then, on 8 July, about 50 members of the Loyal White Knights of the Ku Klux Klan held a rally in the park, and were greeted by about 1,000 counter-protesters. The day ended in turmoil after police used tear gas on some counter-protesters following the Klan\u2019s departure, and made 23 arrests.\n\nBen Jacobs and the Associated Press contributed to this
