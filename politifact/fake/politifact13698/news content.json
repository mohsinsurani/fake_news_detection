In 2017, Obama\u2019s image will replace George Washington\u2019s\n\n\u201cWe thought about creating a new denomination for Obama, but George Washington has had plenty of time in the sun,\u201d John Apple from the Federal Reserve said. \u201cWe\u2019ve needed to change things up for a while now.\u201dThe Bureau of Engraving and Printing has released several comps but a design has not been finalized. The Bureau will release all compositions in early 2016 and poll the American public letting them help decide which design works best.\n\nMany presidents were bandied about as the new face of the one-dollar bill including Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan. Reportedly, Reagan almost got the nod to replace Washington, but people within the Federal Reserve felt Obama brought a much needed multiracial mix to American currency.\n\n\u201cObama being of mixed-race was probably what tipped things; however, we looked at overall accomplishments as well. Frankly, he [Obama] has done more for the betterment of this country than Reagan did, and he still has a year left. More importantly, the racial complexion of America has changed and putting Obama on the dollar bill really, really helps express that.\u201d\n\nAn official republican response has not been issued, but Reserve leaders are confident that everyone will agree that this is a progressive step forward.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i2.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image47.jpg?resize=478%2C204", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i0.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/tump-exec_0.jpg?resize=310%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i1.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/hillarybreaking-696x378-678x378.jpg?resize=310%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i1.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/16443248_786683191479191_777616953_n.jpg?resize=310%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i1.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/fff-640x444.png?resize=310%2C165", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i2.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image47.jpg?resize=640%2C274", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/04f7369b6a0345de4feea23dc6ef9952?s=90&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i2.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image47.jpg?resize=640%2C274", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728/http://trueamericans.me/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017", "title": "Barrack Obama Will Be On New $1 Dollar Bill 2017 \u2013 TRUEAMERICANS", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Barrack Obama Will Be On New $1 Dollar Bill 2017 - TRUEAMERICANS", "type": "article", "description": "Barrack Obama Will Be On New $1 Dollar Bill 2017 \u00a0A longtime push to honor modern presidents on curr", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728/http://trueamericans.me/barrack-obama-will-be-on-new-1-dollar-bill-2017", "site_name": "TRUEAMERICANS", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170201234728im_/https://i2.wp.com/trueamericans.me/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/image47.jpg?resize=640%2C274"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.7.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Barrack Obama Will Be On New $1 Dollar Bill 2017 | TRUEAMERICANS", "description": "Barrack Obama Will Be On New $1 Dollar Bill 2017 \u00a0A longtime push to honor modern presidents on currency has finally come to fruition.
