Nothing came of it since President Trump nor any of his campaign staff have ever been to, spoken with or had anything to do with Russia or its agents.\n\nTrump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama\u2019s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News: Trump first disclosed the bombshell in an early morning tweetstorm, knowing already that the FBI was preparing charges and asking a judge to sign a warrant for Obama\u2019s arrest. Todd McMartin, a spokesman for the FBI, told Fox News:\n\n\u201cThe proof is undeniable. Obama basically confessed in a private call to one of Hillary Clinton\u2019s aides that he had the Trump Tower tapped and we can\u2019t find any federal order legally authorized by a judge to do so.\u201d \u201cThe proof is undeniable.

That tap was authorized by executive order for national security reasons. If convicted, Obama could face up to 40 years in prison, and no President will", "images": ["http://ads.vionservices.com/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=61&campaignid=14&zoneid=42&loc=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2Fbreaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap%2F&referer=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2F&cb=5d35200dd8", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Judith-Machiwenyika-310x165.jpg", "http://ads.vionservices.com/delivery/lg.php?bannerid=62&campaignid=14&zoneid=43&loc=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2Fbreaking-fbi-issues-warrant-for-obamas-arrest-after-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap%2F&referer=http%3A%2F%2Famericainformer.com%2F&cb=877be57af1", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/High-Court-310x165.jpg", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ObamaCuffed-680x365-660x330.jpg", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot_2-310x165.png", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Screenshot_2-1-110x75.png", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Screenshot_1-310x165.png", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/mugabe-09.jpg", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/torture.jpg", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/36-1-110x75.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/IMG_8648.png"], "top_img": "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://zimbabwe-today.com/breaking-fbi-issues-warrant-obamas-arrest-confirming-illegal-trump-tower-wiretap/", "title": "BREAKING: FBI Issues Warrant For Obama\u2019s Arrest After Confirming Illegal Trump Tower Wiretap", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "author": "ZimbabweToday", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "ZimbabweToday", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.78.0", "google-site-verification": "FOIUR4fl52P4Rq8KaXYV0pFosAJRLgHKRgRl3NGBNVU", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-2644536267352236", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "sitekit.withgoogle.com", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://zimbabwe-today.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/05/cropped-Zimbabwe-Today-Logo-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://zimbabwe-today.com", "summary": ""}
