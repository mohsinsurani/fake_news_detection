PA Wire/AP\n\nWhile the Queen still reportedly owns several other dogs, Willow was the only remaining descendant of Susan, the original corgi given to then-Princess Elizabeth on her 18th birthday in 1944.\n\nShe received Susan as a gift after becoming attached to her father King George VI\u2019s corgi called Dookie, the Daily Mail reported.\n\nSince then, she has owned dozens of the breed, known for its distinctive short legs and standing-up ears.\n\nSuch was Queen Elilzabeth\u2019s attachment to Susan, she reportedly took the dog on honeymoon with Prince Philip in 1947.\n\nThe royal couple have also owned \"dorgies\" -- a cross between a dachshund and a corgi.
