Debbie Wasserman Schultz, D-Fla., has been arrested for attempting to flee the country and charged with bank fraud, officials said.\n\nImran Awan, 37, was arrested on Monday by FBI agents and U.S. Capitol Police at Dulles International Airport trying to fly to Lahore, Pakistan.\n\nAwan was arraigned in U.S. District Court on Tuesday with one count of bank fraud, a federal offense, and he pleaded not guilty.\n\nOfficials said Awan and his wife, Hina Alvi, defrauded the Congressional Federal Credit Union for $165,000 by lying on a home equity loan application, according to federal court documents.\n\nAwan worked as an information technology staffer for Wasserman Schultz, a former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee. David Damron, a spokesman for her office, said he was fired Tuesday.\n\nCongresswoman and DNC Chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz on December 19, 2015.

However, through surveillance, federal agents noted in court records that the couple was also residing at two other residences.\n\nAwan's wife initiated a $283,000 wire transfer in January 2017 through the credit union to Faisalabad, Pakistan, which included the $165,000 loan, according to court documents.\n\nHis wife and their three children left the country in March with $12,700 cash from Dulles International Airport to Lahore, according to court documents.\n\nOfficials said they do not believe that his wife plans to return to the U.S.\n\nAwan was released after his arraignment and is under a \"high-intensity supervision program,\" said Bill Miller, a U.S. Attorney\u2019s office spokesman.\n\nAwan received a GPS monitor and has a 10 p.m. to 6 a.m. curfew. He also must remain in a 50-mile radius of his Virginia residence. Awan was also ordered to turn over all of his passports.\n\nA hearing is slated for August 21.\n\nAwan\u2019s lawyer, Christopher Gowen, said the charges are politically-motivated and \"began as part of a frenzy of anti-Muslim bigotry in the literal heart of our democracy, the House of Representatives.\"\n\n\"For months we have had utterly unsupported, outlandish, and slanderous statements targeting Mr. Awan coming not just from the ultra-right-wing 'pizzagate' media but from sitting members of Congress,\" Gowen said in an emailed statement.\n\n\"Now we have the Justice Department showing up with a complaint about disclosures on a modest real estate matter. To an extent, the situation speaks for itself.\"", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_30/1636016/160724-debbie-wasserman-schultz-jpo-435p.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_27/2923716/190612-dartunorro-clark-byline-30402.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_30/1636016/160724-debbie-wasserman-schultz-jpo-435p.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_30/1636016/160724-debbie-wasserman-schultz-jpo-435p.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms", "Dartunorro Clark", "Dartunorro Clark Covered National Politics", "Including The Recovery", "For Nbc News."], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrested-trying-flee-country-n786651", "title": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz Aide Arrested Trying to Flee the Country", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/debbie-wasserman-schultz-aide-arrested-trying-flee-country-n786651", "title": "Debbie Wasserman Schultz aide arrested trying to flee the country", "description": "Imran Awan, an aide for Rep.
