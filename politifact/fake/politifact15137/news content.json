On Wednesday, the Dead Petz singer continued lobbying against the GOP frontrunner with a photo of Trump's delegate totals over Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio and a caption where Cyrus playfully threatened to move out of the country if Trump is elected and a hashtag #aintapartyindausaanymo.\n\nDonald Trump is a fucking nightmare! A photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Feb 29, 2016 at 12:35pm PST\n\ngonna vom / move out da country. #aintapartyindausaanymo A photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Mar 1, 2016 at 6:32pm PST\n\nCyrus' Instagram then took aim at self-proclaimed \"most hated woman in the world\" Rebecca Francis, a woman who uses her social media to showcase her hunting prowess, and the hunter's allegiance to Trump.\n\nCyrus isn't the only artist to lament a possible future with Trump as commander in chief: Red Hot Chili Peppers' Flea recently told Rolling Stone, \"I can't take Donald Trump or anything he says seriously. I just think that he's a silly reality-show bozo and blustering guy who likes getting attention. I don't think he wants to be president, and I don't think he has a chance to be the president. He's just some egotistical, silly person whose main concern in life is getting a blowjob. He wants to be on TV and he wants everyone to thinks he's important.\"", "images":
