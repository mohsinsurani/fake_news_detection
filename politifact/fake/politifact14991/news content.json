Joe Kennedy III (D-MA) claimed the host-city of his response to President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address, Fall River, Massachusetts was \u201cbuilt by immigrants.\u201d\n\nFact-Check: MOSTLY FALSE\n\nWhat is now Fall River was first established in the 1600s by English settlers who were not \u201cimmigrants\u201d but colonists. A native-born family, the Bordens ran a mill in what became the town for generations before and after the American revolution. Industrialization began when Col. Joseph Durfee, a native-born Revolutionary War hero built the first factory in 1811. Later, at the end of the 19th Century a wave of immigrants swelled the town\u2019s population. Immigrants, however, never made up a majority of the population of Bristol County, where Fall River lies, even at their early 20th Century peak.", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/07/AP22188735055493-200x150.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/11/Hunter_Biden-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/08/kanyewestsuesohio1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/07/Zelensky-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/BND-POD-AJo-640x480-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/GettyImages-1336602098-2-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/AP22273816344008-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/eric_adams2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/03/Michaocan-Mexican-Army-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/Biden-Midterms-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/03/joe-biden-putin-3-26-22-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/GettyImages-1053624346-e1665075832331-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/06/climate-change-protester-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/06/Old-Glory-200x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1233978266-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/06/kanyewestfloyd1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/hunter-biden-laptop-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/AP22280054254909-1-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2019/12/maryopera2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/Florida-firefighter-battles-Tesla-fire-200x150.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/01/ThePrivileged1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ian Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/live/state-union-fact-check-analysis-livewire/fact-check-no-falls-river-massachusetts-was-not-built-by-immigrants/", "title": "Fact-Check: No, Fall River, Massachusetts, Was Not \u2018Built by Immigrants\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "Rep.
