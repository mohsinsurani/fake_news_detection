Grace Beahm/Pool / Reuters\n\nIn January, a jury sentenced the self-proclaimed white supremacist to death for killing nine black worshipers in June 2015 at Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston during a Bible study. The 23-year-old told FBI agents that he was trying to start a race war.\n\nHe also pleaded guilty to nine counts of state murder charges on April 10.\n\nRoof is now among the long list of well-known criminals who have spent time in the Indiana facility. Others include murderer and drug trafficker Raul Garza and Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh.\n\nRead more about the lethal injection controversy here\n\nAs of Feb. 9, there were 62 federal inmates on death row, according to the Death Penalty Information Center. Three inmates have been on death row since 1993 \u2014 drug gang members Richard Tipton, James Roane Jr. and Corey Johnson, who were convicted of killing nine people to protect their crack trade.\n\nBoston bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, who a jury in 2015 recommended be put to death, remains in a federal lockup in Colorado, where officials say they can better handle his \"unique\" security arrangements.\n\nAfter the federal death penalty was suspended by a 1972 U.S. Supreme Court decision, it was brought back 16 years later and three people have since been executed under it.\n\nLike his fellow death row inmates, it isn't likely Roof will be executed anytime soon.\n\nLegal battles are underway in a number of states, including Arkansas and Ohio, over the constitutionality of controversial lethal injection methods. Prosecutors and defense lawyers are arguing over whether one of the three drugs used in the process, called midazolam, constitutes \"cruel and unusual punishment\" because it fails to render inmates unconscious before two other drugs are injected.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/__NEW/p_debunk_capital_140227.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Avalon Zoppo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-moved-death-row-terre-haute-federal-n749671", "title": "Charleston Shooter Dylann Roof Moved to Death Row in Terre Haute Federal Prison", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/charleston-church-shooting/charleston-shooter-dylann-roof-moved-death-row-terre-haute-federal-n749671", "title": "Charleston shooter Dylann Roof now on death row at Indiana facility", "description": "Roof has been transferred to death row at a facility that houses most male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG", "title": "Charleston shooter Dylann Roof now on death row at Indiana facility", "description": "Roof has been transferred to death row at a facility that houses most male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Roof has been transferred to death row at a facility that houses most male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "Charleston shooter Dylann Roof now on death row at Indiana facility", "description": "Roof has been transferred to death row at a facility that houses most male inmates awaiting execution under the federal government.", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG", "type": "article", "unibrow": "U.S. news", "authorName1": "Avalon Zoppo"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Sat Apr 22 2017 16:49:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Sun Apr 23 2017 17:13:46 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_16/1973556/170422-dylann-roof-1113a-rs.JPG", "next-head-count": 100}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492879740.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
