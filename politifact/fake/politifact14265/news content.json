His little stand-up routine, that wasn\u2019t funny, has now landed him in the back of a black SUV on the way to a federal holding facility for questioning.\n\n\u201cPeople just assume he was kidding. What they don\u2019t know is that Depp actually had maps and timetables and plans to assassinate President Trump if he ever visited Concord, New Hampshire again, which he certainly would during the 2020 general election season. Depp is a dangerous criminal. Some of the content on his computer indicate that he may have been radicalized while he was studying in Muslim waters for his Captain Jack Sparrow role.\u201d\n\nThere you have it. If they find out that Depp is a Muslim convert with plans to kill the President he may never see the light of day again. It\u2019s difficult to think of our favorite actors as such horrible people sometimes, but Hollywood is just filled with tree-hugging, self-righteous, Prius driving freaks.
