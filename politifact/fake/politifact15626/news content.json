The famous actor, 89, says he\u2019ll be lucky to see 2019:\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had a good run. They say I\u2019m probably gonna be on the list of dead people at the awards show next year. Me and that damned empty chair. Guaranteed. Why can\u2019t folks just let that go?\u201d\n\nEastwood, always in good spirits, says that he\u2019s made a good life for his family and taken care of them with trust funds, homes and large insurance policies and that he\u2019d like to see his personal estate go to something\u2026bigger:\n\n\u201cI have been able to sit here in this magnificent ranch watching as President Trump made America great again in just a few months. He\u2019ll persevere through the witch hunt and I will do what I can to make his journey easier.\u201d\n\nEastwood is donating his Northern California ranch, 40K acres of grazing land in Nevada and more than $7 million in cash and other assets to Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign. The campaign has said they will be delighted to accept the donation and will use the ranch as a command center for the entire Pacific Northwest:\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll be able to sit up there, far from the prying eyes of Obama and the deep state and the deep levels of corruption still inside the Justice department and FBI, and strategize without worrying about being called before a federal prosecutor for it.\u201d\n\nClint Eastwood will be remembered for a lot of things after he\u2019s gone, but this may be the biggest. Thanks for a lifetime of entertaining us, Clint!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/paul_ryan_facts_051717-400x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/themes/zox-news/images/logos/logo-large.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://sstatic1.histats.com/0.gif?4066930&101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/paul_ryan_facts_051717-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/04-trump-unwell.w710.h473-400x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/themes/zox-news/images/logos/logo-nav.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/clint-678x381-534x300.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/b7afd9d81d7b82753493f5744fd093cf?s=46&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5a82cfcbd03072da0f8b4574-960-639-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/324-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9e76b6ac06f96ba37b13c42d30875506-400x240.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/04-trump-unwell.w710.h473-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/324-400x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/clint-678x381.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/9e76b6ac06f96ba37b13c42d30875506-80x80.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robertmueller-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/trump-michelle-obama-400x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bushgeorgew_120714getty-400x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/bushgeorgew_120714getty-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/robertmueller-400x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/trump-michelle-obama-80x80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/5a82cfcbd03072da0f8b4574-960-639-400x240.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/clint-678x381.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338/http://maga2020.us/news/clint-eastwood-leaves-his-estate-to-the-trump-2020-campaign/", "title": "Clint Eastwood Leaves His Estate To The Trump 2020 Campaign", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338im_/http://maga2020.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/clint-678x381.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180721124338/http://maga2020.us/news/clint-eastwood-leaves-his-estate-to-the-trump-2020-campaign/", "title": "Clint Eastwood Leaves His Estate To The Trump 2020 Campaign", "description": "Clint Eastwood says his doctors have put him on notice to get his affairs in order and prepare for that final trip in one of those limousine station wagons we call a hearse.
