Several congressional committees and a special counsel are investigating whether Trump associates colluded with the Russians during the presidential campaign.\n\n\"We're still not clean on this, Chris,\" Smith told fellow Fox anchor Chris Wallace. \"Why all these lies? Why is it lie after lie after lie? If you clean, come on clean.\"\n\nShep Smith: \"The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling...why are we getting told all these lies?\"\n\n\n\nChris Wallace: \"I don't know what to say\" pic.twitter.com/DQKOAC8a2o \u2014 Leanne Naramore (@LeanneNaramore) July 14, 2017\n\nSmith, who has chided President Trump for his treatment of the media, continued.\n\n\"The deception, Chris, is mind-boggling,\" he said. \"And there are still people out there who believe we're making it up and one day they're going to realize we're not.\"\n\nThe diatribe left Wallace speechless.\n\n\"I don't know what to say,\" he said. \"I think there's a lot of truth to everything you've said.\"\n\nSmith's statements quickly spread across the Internet, where some called for his firing.\n\nAnti-Trump, Shepard Smith is a Fungus !!\n\n\n\nRETWEET If you agree @FoxNews should Send Him PACKING !!#SaturdayMorning Kick Him to the Curb\ud83d\udc47\u2714\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/Y6D62fNxe7 \u2014 \ud83d\udc8eSTOCK MONSTER\ud83d\udc8e (@StockMonsterUSA) July 15, 2017\n\nIt would be so great if Shepard Smith left foxnews and went to either CNN or MSNBC where he can be with liberal journalists like himself. \u2014 Lonman (@Lonman06) July 14, 2017\n\nSmith went on the offensive against Trump and his administration earlier this year. In February, Smith defended CNN as \"not fake news,\" an accusation often lobbed by the president and his supporters.\n\nFollow Sean Rossman on Twitter: @SeanRossman", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1fecae5856e58374cc9e1c0fd6dcc3c6aae79d4e/c=0-293-5760-3547/local/-/media/2017/07/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636357149097578176-AP-TV-Fox-Smith.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/dfd18086b204d13ea814432e447bf496dfde5579/c=326-0-5433-3840/local/-/media/2017/07/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636357149097578176-AP-TV-Fox-Smith.jpg?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1fecae5856e58374cc9e1c0fd6dcc3c6aae79d4e/c=0-293-5760-3547/local/-/media/2017/07/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636357149097578176-AP-TV-Fox-Smith.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sean Rossman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/07/15/fox-news-shepard-smith-lie-after-lie-after-lie-russia-meeting/481751001/", "title": "Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why is it lie after lie after lie?' on Russia meeting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/onpolitics/2017/07/15/fox-news-shepard-smith-lie-after-lie-after-lie-russia-meeting/481751001/news/politics/onpolitics", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Fox News' Shepard Smith: 'Why is it lie after lie after lie?' on Russia meeting", "description": "The host launched into a tirade over\\u00a0Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing\\u00a0even as details show the meeting now included eight people.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1fecae5856e58374cc9e1c0fd6dcc3c6aae79d4e/c=0-293-5760-3547/local/-/media/2017/07/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636357149097578176-AP-TV-Fox-Smith.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "The host launched into a tirade over\\u00a0Trump Jr.'s stance the meeting equated to nothing\\u00a0even as details show the meeting now included eight people.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500073200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
