Brown of the Tampa Bay Lightning jumped on the \u201chate our troops\u201d bandwagon and made a \u201cblack power\u201d fist \u2013 a gesture assembled with black supremacist groups \u2013 during the National Anthem.\n\nBrown was counting on P.C. culture winning out and letting him keep his job, but what happened next ruined his life.\n\n\u201cThis is not, and has never been, about the military or disrespecting the flag,\u201d Brown said in an interview with ESPN after he raised his fist. \u201cIt is about police brutality, racial injustice, and inequality in this country. It is something that I as well as many others feel needs to be addressed. I love my country, but that doesn\u2019t mean I cannot acknowledge that it is not perfect.\u201d\n\nUnfortunately, the owner of the team disagrees. Burt Lancaster announced a few hours later that the team will be seeking a new forward to replace Brown.\n\n\u201cWe wish Mr. Brown the best, but we feel that he does not embody the values of the Tampa Bay Lightning,\u201d Lancaster says. \u201cWe support our country, we support our troops, we support our police, and we support our President.\u201d\n\nBrown will continue to be paid until the end of the season as per the terms of his contract, but will then be looking for a job.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://i0.wp.com/conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/101-DOLPHINS-vs-49ers-112816-728x511-326x245.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/13b61922427d30f362eb62aaf3214ced?s=80&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://i0.wp.com/conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/c_scalefl_progressiveq_80w_800-326x245.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/20a1932b48700f04bf32b71c3d392053?s=80&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://i0.wp.com/conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/breaking-news-diagonal.6fc21b5c13554253ad2eb33f8b099cc0-326x245.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/62CF9C9A-9658-495F-85CB-7A7D6F9B0CD3-678x381.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://i0.wp.com/conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/62CF9C9A-9658-495F-85CB-7A7D6F9B0CD3-678x381-326x245.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://i0.wp.com/conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/62CF9C9A-9658-495F-85CB-7A7D6F9B0CD3-678x381.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://i0.wp.com/conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-conservative7-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://i0.wp.com/conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/171011_jihawg.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/62CF9C9A-9658-495F-85CB-7A7D6F9B0CD3-678x381.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jake Barnes", "George Jones"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127/http://conservative7.com/2017/10/10/breaking-black-hockey-player-fired-raising-fist-national-anthem/", "title": "BREAKING: Black Hockey Player FIRED After Raising Fist During National Anthem", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "BREAKING: Black Hockey Player FIRED After Raising Fist During National Anthem", "description": "The NFL may be coddling black athletes who are protesting our police force, our flag, and our veterans by kneeling, but the National Hockey League [...]", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127/http://conservative7.com/2017/10/10/breaking-black-hockey-player-fired-raising-fist-national-anthem/", "site_name": "Conservative7", "updated_time": "2017-10-13T13:24:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/62CF9C9A-9658-495F-85CB-7A7D6F9B0CD3-678x381.jpeg", "width": 678, "height": 381}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Conservative7-1998343217064980/", "section": "News", "published_time": "2017-10-10T15:57:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-13T13:24:50+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "The NFL may be coddling black athletes who are protesting our police force, our flag, and our veterans by kneeling, but the National Hockey League [...]", "title": "BREAKING: Black Hockey Player FIRED After Raising Fist During National Anthem", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171014020127im_/http://conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/62CF9C9A-9658-495F-85CB-7A7D6F9B0CD3-678x381.jpeg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.8.2", "fb": {"pages": 210227342748336}, "ia": {"markup_url": "http://conservative7.com/2017/10/10/breaking-black-hockey-player-fired-raising-fist-national-anthem/?ia_markup=1"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://conservative7.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/cropped-conservative7-logo-1-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507590000.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
