We need a great match. Not another rigged result that doesn\u2019t pass the sniff test.\n\n\u201cI like money as much as the next guy. But I like football more. I can\u2019t stand by and allow rampant greed and cynicism to destroy the game I love. The little boy in me won\u2019t allow it.\n\n\u201cFootball in America won\u2019t recover from this.\u201d\n\nEarly reports stating Goodes had been shot dead in an \u201cgangland-style execution\u201d in New York City have also been scrubbed from the internet, but not before alert readers captured screenshots of the story.\n\nAccording to Goodes, the NFL have organized a \u201crigged game\u201d that will earn \u201cmaximum revenue\u201d for the league, and hundreds of millions for broadcasters and advertisers, but will leave increasingly jaded Americans with a bad taste in their mouth.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest scam in sports history,\u201d Goodes said in Minneapolis, according to reports. \u201cThe Super Bowl is already completely scripted out.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow do I know it\u2019s scripted? I\u2019ve read the damn thing.\u201c\n\n\u201cYou need to understand the NFL is a $35 billion shared revenue corporation. Outcomes can\u2019t be left to chance. Total league revenues are shared equally by all franchises, so they don\u2019t care who wins or loses. Let me be perfectly clear here. It doesn\u2019t matter to the franchise owners. It doesn\u2019t matter to the players. But it matters to the league. Outcomes have been fixed to maximize profits ever since my early days here.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe sad thing is that it\u2019s legal. Can you believe that? It\u2019s legal thanks to guys [entertainment laywers] like me.\u201d\n\nExplaining that the NFL is officially registered as \u201centertainment,\u201d Goodes said \u201cThe NFL has more in common with WWE than you could possibly imagine.\u201d\n\nThe NFL possesses an Anti-Trust Exemption to the law granted to it by President John F. Kennedy, which ultimately allows the NFL to classify itself as \u201centertainment\u201d rather than sport, as well as incorporate itself as a single entity, instead of the 32 separate \u201cfranchises\u201d they would want you to believe.\n\nIn a 2004 lawsuit, the NFL argued they are not a collection of 32 teams in competition with each other. They argued they are a single entity, providing \u201centertainment\u201d in the marketplace, and as such they are not subject to Anti-Trust laws.\n\nThe only other \u201csport\u201d that occupies this legal position is the WWE.\n\nHow are games rigged?\n\nAccording to Goodes, the fat cat franchise owners and their pampered players do not care who wins, as long as they continue reaping the lucrative financial benefits provided by the system.\n\n\u201cHave you ever stopped to wonder how Vegas makes the point spread line and over under so close every week? There is not one game where the result totally blows away the point spread or the over under. It doesn\u2019t happen. Are they that good? Hell, no they\u2019re not. Even the best of the best cannot get it so close every single game. So how is it fixed?\n\n\u201cRefs manipulate who wins for the overall benefit of the NFL. The NFL splits its revenue between teams, so do the players care? I\u2019m telling you now, they don\u2019t care. What player would care if they get an extra $5 million when the salary cap goes up thanks to more revenues built on scripted outcomes?\u201d\n\n\u201cThe players have an awareness about it and the refs also make penalty calls in key situations to manipulate the score and outcomes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow come zero players call out the refs? How come zero coaches call out the refs, despite the outrageous calls that change the results of games?\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone is on the same side, that\u2019s why.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese NFL refs are part-time employees of the NFL. They sign the tightest contracts you will ever see in your life. They work for the league, period. They are bound by NFL mandated gag orders. They can\u2019t open their mouth and say a single word to the media or their ass is toast.\u201d\n\nWhy doesn\u2019t anyone speak out?\n\nAccording to Goodes, people do speak out. But nobody wants to hear.\n\n\u201cRemember the Harbaugh Bowl? Arthur Blank, the Atlanta Falcons owner, admitted the results were fixed.\n\n\u201cIt is predetermined that these two teams would be here, I was my team was selected to be in the Super Bowl.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd the NFL admitted it themselves in court. \u201cWe are entertainment and we can manage outcomes as we see fit. We\u2019re exempt.\u201d\n\nSuper Bowl LII will be the 52nd Super Bowl and the 48th modern-era NFL championship game, contested between New England Patriots and Philadelphia Eagles at the US Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Sunday.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/econewsmedia-6.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/plugins/custom-share-buttons-with-floating-sidebar/images/hide-l.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NFL-execution-678x381.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/plugins/custom-share-buttons-with-floating-sidebar/images/hide.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://www.beaware.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/27479952_10156463941410715_460628881_o.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/ext_tw_video_thumb/955215557543976960/pu/img/jPlLzqAbqId52RfH?format=jpg&name=small", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/https://pbs.twimg.com/profile_images/910984334202589186/LrIt_0SD_normal.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://www.beaware.one/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/shopsbusinesses-nfl-headquarters.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NFL-execution-678x381.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357/http://econewsmedia.org/2018/02/01/nfl-lawyer-claimed-super-bowl-rigged-found-dead/", "title": "NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is \u2018Rigged\u2019, Found Dead", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is \u2018Rigged\u2019, Found Dead", "description": "An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357/http://econewsmedia.org/2018/02/01/nfl-lawyer-claimed-super-bowl-rigged-found-dead/", "site_name": "Eco News Media", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NFL-execution-678x381.jpg", "width": 778, "height": 437}}, "article": {"section": "Eco-Defense", "published_time": "2018-02-01T20:23:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "An NFL entertainment lawyer, who has worked for the corporation for more than 15 years, has been found dead in", "title": "NFL Lawyer, Who Claimed Super Bowl Is \u2018Rigged\u2019, Found Dead", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180202231357im_/http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/NFL-execution-678x381.jpg"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://econewsmedia.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/econewsmedia-2.gif"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517443200.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
