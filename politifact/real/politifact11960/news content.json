Each ad has its own canonical web page (sample here), and associated downloadable metadata. Some metadata are added by the Internet Archive; some generated via the media itself (such as count of ads, how many times an ad has aired, etc.); and some come from our partners.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20160215070151im_/http://politicaladarchive.org/wp-content/themes/archivepoliticalads/img/twitter.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160215070151im_/http://politicaladarchive.org/wp-content/themes/archivepoliticalads/img/mail.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20160215070151im_/http://politicaladarchive.org/wp-content/themes/archivepoliticalads/img/brand_logo.png"], "top_img": "", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20160215070151/http://politicaladarchive.org/ad/polad_hillaryclinton_lul1s/", "title": "Political TV Ad Archive \u00bb PolAd", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "generator": "WordPress 4.4.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
