But at least 18 senators have not traveled there at all.\n\n\n\nAs debate over the war reaches a tipping point in Washington, visiting Iraq has become a rite of passage for many lawmakers looking to bolster their credibility on national security. Many lawmakers feel that making a trip is important for their credibility when they are asked to weigh in on the war.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cHave you been to Iraq?\u201d Graham charged. \u201cHave you ever been and talked to them?\u201d\n\n\n\nWebb, who has not made a trip to the country, replied by disparaging the congressional delegations as \u201cdog and pony shows\u201d that do not confront the reality on the ground.\n\n\n\nWebb\u2019s views may well be the exception, as many senators still make the visit. Topping the list is Sen. Jack Reed (D-R.I.), who has visited Iraq 10 times. That includes three trips in the past year and makes him one of nine senators who have made at least a half-dozen trips to the country since the war started.\n\n\n\nOn the other side of the aisle, neither George Voinovich (Ohio) nor Pete Domenici (N.M.) \u2014 two Senate Republicans who recently made headlines by breaking with the Bush administration and calling for a new direction in Iraq \u2014 has visited the country. But similarly critical Republicans John Warner (Va.), Olympia Snowe (Maine) and Gordon Smith (Ore.) have all made the trip more than once.\n\n\n\nJames Thurber, professor of political science and director of the Center for Congressional and Presidential Studies at American University, said that Iraq visits give lawmakers more credibility on the war.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe more trips you go give you more authority,\u201d Thurber said.\n\n\n\nBut seeing the situation and speaking with the troops on the ground can reinforce pre-existing notions about the war, Thurber said. He added that \u201csome senators have already made up their minds about what\u2019s going on\u201d before making a trip.\n\n\n\nIndeed, many of the more outspoken lawmakers on both sides of the Iraq debate are among the most traveled, and few have changed their minds after returning. Besides Reed, war critics such as Sens. Carl Levin (D-Mich.), Joseph Biden (D-Del.), Chuck Hagel (R-Neb.) and John Kerry (D-Mass.) have all made multiple trips. Levin tops that group with eight visits.\n\n\n\nSen. James Inhofe (R-Okla.), an ardent defender of the war effort, has gone to Iraq eight times, while Sens. John McCain (R-Ariz.) and Joe Lieberman (I-Conn.) have each made six trips.\n\n\n\nSenators of both parties have made visiting Iraq a priority. Of the 11 senators who have made more than four trips, seven are Republicans, three are Democrats and one, Lieberman, is an Independent who caucuses with Democrats.\n\n\n\nThe common thread linking senators with the highest trip totals appears to be membership on either the Senate Armed Services Committee or the Foreign Relations Committee. The dozen lawmakers who have made more than three trips are all on one of these two prominent panels.\n\n\n\nAt least 38 senators have visited Iraq in the past 12 months, led by Reed, Graham and McCain, who have each visited the country three times in that span.\n\n\n\nAmong the 2008 presidential candidates, the numerous trips by Biden (seven) and McCain (six) lead the field, largely due to their leadership positions on relevant committees. Biden is chairman of Foreign Relations, while McCain is ranking member on Armed Services.\n\n\n\nAmong the other contenders, Sens. Hillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.) and Chris Dodd (D-Conn.) each boast three trips to Iraq. Sen. Sam Brownback (R-Kan.) has made the trip twice, while Sen. Barack Obama (D-Ill.) has visited Iraq once.\n\n\n\nWho has gone, and how often 10 visits\n\nJack Reed (D-R.I.)\n\n\n\n9 visits\n\nJohn Warner (R-Va.)\n\n\n\n8 visits\n\nJames Inhofe (R-Okla.)\n\nCarl Levin (D-Mich.)\n\n\n\n7 visits\n\nJoseph Biden (D-Del.)\n\nLindsey Graham (R-S.C.)\n\n\n\n6 visits\n\nJoe Lieberman (I-Conn.)\n\nJohn McCain (R-Ariz.)\n\nJeff Sessions (R-Ala.)\n\n\n\n5 visits\n\nSaxby Chambliss (R-Ga.)\n\nChuck Hagel (R-Neb.)\n\n\n\n4 visits\n\nJohn Kerry (D-Mass.)\n\n\n\n3 visits\n\nWayne Allard (R-Colo.)\n\nEvan Bayh (D-Ind.)\n\nHillary Rodham Clinton (D-N.Y.)\n\nNorm Coleman (R-Minn.)\n\nSusan Collins (R-Maine)\n\nChris Dodd (D-Conn.)\n\nMitch McConnell (R-Ky.)\n\nBen Nelson (D-Neb.)\n\nGordon Smith (R-Ore.)\n\nJohn Thune (R-S.D.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n2 visits\n\nDaniel Akaka (D-Hawaii)\n\nBob Bennett (R-Utah)\n\nJeff Bingaman (D-N.M.)\n\nKit Bond (R-Mo.)\n\nSam Brownback (R-Kan.)\n\nRichard Burr (R-N.C.)\n\nTom Carper (D-Del.)\n\nLarry Craig (R-Idaho)\n\nJim DeMint (R-S.C.)\n\nJohn Ensign (R-Nev.)\n\nOrrin Hatch (R-Utah)\n\nJohnny Isakson (R-Ga.)\n\nJon Kyl (R-Ariz.)\n\nBill Nelson (D-Fla.)\n\nPat Roberts (R-Kan.)\n\nKen Salazar (D-Colo.)\n\nOlympia Snowe (R-Maine)\n\nTed Stevens (R-Alaska)\n\nJohn Sununu (R-N.H)\n\n\n\n1 visit\n\nLamar Alexander (R-Tenn.)\n\nBarbara Boxer (D-Calif.)\n\nJim Bunning (R-Ky.)\n\nBen Cardin (D-Md.)\n\nTom Coburn (R-Okla.)\n\nThad Cochran (R-Miss.)\n\nBob Corker (R-Tenn.)\n\nMike Crapo (R-Idaho)\n\nMike Enzi (R-Wyo.)\n\nJudd Gregg (R-N.H.)\n\nKay Bailey Hutchison (R-Texas)\n\nDianne Feinstein (D-Calif.)\n\nAmy Klobuchar (D-Minn.)\n\nMary Landrieu (D-La.)\n\nFrank Lautenberg (D-N.J.)\n\nRichard Lugar (R-Ind.)\n\nMel Martinez (R-Fla.)\n\nClaire McCaskill (D-Mo.)\n\nLisa Murkowski (R-Alaska)\n\nPatty Murray (D-Wash.)\n\nBarack Obama (D-Ill.)\n\nMark Pryor (D-Ark.)\n\nHarry Reid (D-Nev.)\n\nJay Rockefeller (D-W.Va.)\n\nRichard Shelby (R-Ala.)\n\nArlen Specter (R-Pa.)\n\nSheldon Whitehouse (D-R.I.)\n\nRon Wyden (D-Ore.)\n\n\n\n\n\nNever visited\n\nJohn Barrasso (R-Wyo.)\n\nSherrod Brown (D-Ohio)\n\nRobert Byrd (D-W.Va.)\n\nBob Casey Jr. (D-Pa.)\n\nKent Conrad (D-N.D.)\n\nPete Domenici (R-N.M.)\n\nChuck Grassley (R-Iowa)\n\nTom Harkin (D-Iowa)\n\nDaniel Inouye (D-Hawaii)\n\nTim Johnson (D-S.D.)\n\nHerb Kohl (D-Wis.)\n\nPatrick Leahy (D-Vt.)\n\nBlanche Lincoln (D-Ark.)\n\nBarbara Mikulski (D-Md.)\n\nBernie Sanders (I-Vt.)\n\nJon Tester (D-Mont.)\n\nGeorge Voinovich (R-Ohio)\n\nJim Webb (D-Va.)\n\n\n\nDidn\u2019t return calls/would not comment\n\nMax Baucus (D-Mont.)\n\nByron Dorgan (D-N.D.)\n\nEdward Kennedy (D-Mass.)\n\nRobert Menendez (D-N.J.)\n\nTrent Lott (R-Miss.)\n\nCharles Schumer (D-N.Y.)\n\n\n\nDidn\u2019t return calls, but has gone to Iraq*\n\nMaria Cantwell (D-Wash.)\n\nJohn Cornyn (R-Texas)\n\nElizabeth Dole (R-N.C.)\n\nDick Durbin (D-Ill.)\n\nRuss Feingold (D-Wis.)\n\nDebbie Stabenow (D-Mich.)\n\nDavid Vitter (R-La.)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n*Some offices did not return phone calls.
