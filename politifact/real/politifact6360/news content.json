Sanders warns of \u2018frightening trend\u2019 towards oligarchy\n\nBy Eric W. Dolan\n\nTuesday, July 17, 2012 23:01 EDT\n\nThe defeat of the DISCLOSE Act in the Senate is part of a \u201cfrightening\u201d trend, according to Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont.\n\nDuring an appearance on Current TV\u2019s Viewpoint on Tuesday, Sanders blasted Republicans for blocking the legislation.\n\n\u201cWhat really frightens me is not just the disastrous nature of Citizens United, but the whole trend that we are seeing lately, economically, of moving this country toward an oligarchic form of government,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat you have right now is incredibly unequal distribution of wealth and income\u2026 the Walton family of Walmart itself owns more wealth \u2014 one family \u2014 than the bottom 40 percent of the American people.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve got that reality out there, and then what\u2019s happening now \u2014 what Citizens United is about \u2014 is these guys are not content to own the economy, to own the wealth of America, they now want to own lock, stock and barrel the political process as well.\u201d\n\nThe DISCLOSE Act would have required outside campaign groups to disclose those who contribute $10,000 or more. But it failed to move forward on Tuesday after Senate Republicans unanimously voted against it.\n\nWatch video, courtesy of Current TV, below:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-Shot-stewart-223x105.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/05/Money-via-AFP-298x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Julie-Goodridge-Mitt-Gets-Worse-298x150.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/styles/white/videoiconrsred.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/martinfamily-screen-223x105.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-includes/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bob-Herbert-screenshot-223x105.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/Screen-shot-2012-07-19-at-9.25.21-AM-223x105.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/images/framework/social/twitter.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/raw_story_logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/images/pandagon-logo-300.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/images/raw-meat-logo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://s35.sitemeter.com/meter.asp?site=s35rawstory", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2012/07/Bernie-Sanders-screenshot.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/images/framework/social/digg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/images/culture-clutch-logo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/rawfavicon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-76DHYTY06o6yQ.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/images/framework/social/facebook.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/images/framework/social/feed.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/themes/blognewsv131/styles/white/print_bottom.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-da12qeST0GrE6.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20120719134112im_/http://www.rawstory.com/rs/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/rawfavicon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eric W.
