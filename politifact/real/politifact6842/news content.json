I\u2019m Jim Lehrer of the \u201cPBS NewsHour,\u201d and I welcome you to the first of the 2012 presidential debates between President Barack Obama, the Democratic nominee, and former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, the Republican nominee.\n\nThis debate and the next three \u2013 two presidential, one vice presidential \u2013 are sponsored by the Commission on Presidential Debates. Tonight\u2019s 90 minutes will be about domestic issues and will follow a format designed by the commission. There will be six roughly 15-minute segments with two-minute answers for the first question, then open discussion for the remainder of each segment.\n\nThousands of people offered suggestions on segment subjects or questions via the Internet and other means, but I made the final selections. And for the record, they were not submitted for approval to the commission or the candidates.\n\nThe segments as I announced in advance will be three on the economy and one each on health care, the role of government and governing, with an emphasis throughout on differences, specifics and choices. Both candidates will also have two-minute closing statements.\n\nThe audience here in the hall has promised to remain silent \u2013 no cheers, applause, boos, hisses, among other noisy distracting things, so we may all concentrate on what the candidates have to say. There is a noise exception right now, though, as we welcome President Obama and Governor Romney.\n\n(APPLAUSE)\n\nGentlemen, welcome to you both. Let\u2019s start the economy, segment one, and let\u2019s begin with jobs. What are the major differences between the two of you about how you would go about creating new jobs?\n\nYou have two minutes. Each of you have two minutes to start. A coin toss has determined, Mr. President, you go first.\n\n21:04:24: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA: Well, thank you very much, Jim, for this opportunity. I want to thank Governor Romney and the University of Denver for your hospitality.\n\nThere are a lot of points I want to make tonight, but the most important one is that 20 years ago I became the luckiest man on Earth because Michelle Obama agreed to marry me.\n\nAnd so I just want to wish, Sweetie, you happy anniversary and let you know that a year from now we will not be celebrating it in front of 40 million people.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nYou know, four years ago we went through the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression. Millions of jobs were lost, the auto industry was on the brink of collapse. The financial system had frozen up.\n\nAnd because of the resilience and the determination of the American people, we\u2019ve begun to fight our way back. Over the last 30 months, we\u2019ve seen 5 million jobs in the private sector created. The auto industry has come roaring back. And housing has begun to rise.\n\nBut we all know that we\u2019ve still got a lot of work to do. And so the question here tonight is not where we\u2019ve been, but where we\u2019re going.\n\nGovernor Romney has a perspective that says if we cut taxes, skewed towards the wealthy, and roll back regulations, that we\u2019ll be better off. I\u2019ve got a different view.\n\nI think we\u2019ve got to invest in education and training. I think it\u2019s important for us to develop new sources of energy here in America, that we change our tax code to make sure that we\u2019re helping small businesses and companies that are investing here in the United States, that we take some of the money that we\u2019re saving as we wind down two wars to rebuild America and that we reduce our deficit in a balanced way that allows us to make these critical investments.\n\nNow, it ultimately is going to be up to the voters \u2013 to you \u2013 which path we should take. Are we going to double on top-down economic policies that helped to get us into this mess or do we embrace a new economic patriotism that says America does best when the middle class does best? And I\u2019m looking forward to having that debate.\n\n21: 06:31: LEHRER: Governor Romney, two minutes.\n\n21:06:32: FORMER GOV. MITT ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim. It\u2019s an honor to be here with you, and I appreciate the chance to be with the president. I\u2019m pleased to be at the University of Denver, appreciate their welcome, and also the Presidential Commission on these debates.\n\nAnd congratulations to you, Mr. President, on your anniversary. I\u2019m sure this was the most romantic place you could imagine, here \u2013 here with me. So I\u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThis is obviously a very tender topic. I\u2019ve had the occasion over the last couple of years of meeting people across the country. I was in Dayton, Ohio, and a woman grabbed my arm and she said, \u201cI\u2019ve been out of work since May. Can you help me?\u201d\n\nAnn yesterday was at a rally in Denver and a woman came up to her with a baby in her arms and said, \u201cAnn, my husband has had four jobs in three years, part-time jobs. He\u2019s lost his most recent job and we\u2019ve now just lost our home. Can you help us?\u201d\n\nAnd the answer is, yes, we can help, but it\u2019s going to take a different path. Not the one we\u2019ve been on, not the one the president describes as a top-down, cut taxes for the rich. That\u2019s not what I\u2019m going to do.\n\nMy plan has five basic parts. One, get us energy independent, North American energy independent. That creates about 4 million jobs.\n\nNumber two, open up more trade, particularly in Latin America. Crack down on China, if and when they cheat.\n\nNumber three, make sure our people have the skills they need to succeed and the best schools in the world. We\u2019re far away from that now.\n\nNumber four, get to us a balanced budget.\n\nNumber five, champion small business. It\u2019s small business that creates the jobs in America, and over the last four years, small business people have decided that America may not be the place to open a new business because new business startups are down to a 30-year low.\n\nNow, I\u2019m concerned that the path that we\u2019re on has just been unsuccessful. The president has a view very similar to the view he had when he ran four years, that a bigger government, spending more, taxing more, regulating more \u2013 if you will, trickle-down government \u2013 would work.\n\nThat\u2019s not the right answer for America. I\u2019ll restore the vitality that gets America working again. Thank you.\n\n21:08:40: LEHRER: Mr. President, please respond directly to what the governor just said about trickle-down \u2013 his trick-down approach, as he said yours is.\n\n21:08:50: OBAMA: Well, let me talk specifically about what I think we need to do. First, we\u2019ve got to improve our education system and we\u2019ve made enormous progress drawing on ideas both from Democrats and Republicans that are already starting to show gains in some of the toughest to deal with schools. We\u2019ve got a program called Race to the Top that has prompted reforms in 46 states around the country, raising standards, improving how we train teachers.\n\nSo now I want to hire another 100,000 new math and science teachers, and create 2 million more slots in our community colleges so that people can get trained for the jobs that are out there right now. And I want to make sure that we keep tuition low for our young people.\n\nWhen it comes to our tax code, Governor Romney and I both agree that our corporate tax rate is too high, so I want to lower it, particularly for manufacturing, taking it down to 25 percent. But I also want to close those loopholes that are giving incentives for companies that are shipping jobs overseas. I want to provide tax breaks for companies that are investing here in the United States.\n\nOn energy, Governor Romney and I, we both agree that we\u2019ve got to boost American energy production, and oil and natural gas production are higher than they\u2019ve been in years. But I also believe that we\u2019ve got to look at the energy sources of the future, like wind and solar and biofuels, and make those investments.\n\nSo all of this is possible. Now, in order for us to do it, we do have to close our deficit, and one of the things I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll be discussing tonight is, how do we deal with our tax code? And how do we make sure that we are reducing spending in a responsible way, but also, how do we have enough revenue to make those investments?\n\nAnd this is where there\u2019s a difference, because Governor Romney\u2019s central economic plan calls for a $5 trillion tax cut \u2013 on top of the extension of the Bush tax cuts \u2013 that\u2019s another trillion dollars \u2013 and $2 trillion in additional military spending that the military hasn\u2019t asked for. That\u2019s $8 trillion. How we pay for that, reduce the deficit, and make the investments that we need to make, without dumping those costs onto middle-class Americans, I think is one of the central questions of this campaign.\n\n21:11:03: LEHRER: Both of you have spoken about a lot of different things, and we\u2019re going to try to get through them in as specific a way as we possibly can.\n\nBut, first, Governor Romney, do you have a question that you\u2019d like to ask the president directly about something he just said?\n\n21:11:03: ROMNEY: Well, sure. I\u2019d like to clear up the record and go through it piece by piece.\n\nFirst of all, I don\u2019t have a $5 trillion tax cut. I don\u2019t have a tax cut of a scale that you\u2019re talking about. My view is that we ought to provide tax relief to people in the middle class. But I\u2019m not going to reduce the share of taxes paid by high-income people. High-income people are doing just fine in this economy. They\u2019ll do fine whether you\u2019re president or I am.\n\nThe people who are having the hard time right now are middle- income Americans. Under the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried. They\u2019re just being crushed. Middle- income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a \u2013 this is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing.\n\nAt the same time, gasoline prices have doubled under the president. Electric rates are up. Food prices are up. Health care costs have gone up by $2,500 a family. Middle-income families are being crushed.\n\nAnd so the question is how to get them going again. And I\u2019ve described it. It\u2019s energy and trade, the right kind of training programs, balancing our budget and helping small business. Those are the \u2013 the cornerstones of my plan.\n\nBut the president mentioned a couple of other ideas I\u2019ll just note. First, education. I agree: Education is key, particularly the future of our economy. But our training programs right now, we\u2019ve got 47 of them, housed in the federal government, reporting to eight different agencies. Overhead is overwhelming. We\u2019ve got to get those dollars back to the states and go to the workers so they can create their own pathways to get in the training they need for jobs that will really help them.\n\nThe second area, taxation, we agree, we ought to bring the tax rates down. And I do, both for corporations and for individuals. But in order for us not to lose revenue, have the government run out of money, I also lower deductions and credits and exemptions, so that we keep taking in the same money when you also account for growth.\n\nThe third area, energy. Energy is critical, and the president pointed out correctly that production of oil and gas in the U.S. is up. But not due to his policies. In spite of his policies.\n\nMr. President, all of the increase in natural gas and oil has happened on private land, not on government land. On government land, your administration has cut the number of permits and licenses in half. If I\u2019m president, I\u2019ll double them, and also get the \u2013 the oil from offshore and Alaska. And I\u2019ll bring that pipeline in from Canada.\n\nAnd, by the way, I like coal. I\u2019m going to make sure we can continue to burn clean coal. People in the coal industry feel like it\u2019s getting crushed by your policies. I want to get America and North America energy independent so we can create those jobs.\n\nAnd finally, with regards to that tax cut, look, I\u2019m not looking to cut massive taxes and to reduce the \u2013 the revenues going to the government. My \u2013 my number-one principal is, there will be no tax cut that adds to the deficit. I want to underline that: no tax cut that adds to the deficit.\n\nBut I do want to reduce the burden being paid by middle-income Americans. And I \u2013 and to do that, that also means I cannot reduce the burden paid by high-income Americans. So any \u2013 any language to the contrary is simply not accurate. LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:14:22: OBAMA: Well, I think \u2013 let\u2019s talk about taxes, because I think it\u2019s instructive. Now, four years ago, when I stood on this stage, I said that I would cut taxes for middle-class families. And that\u2019s exactly what I did. We cut taxes for middle-class families by about $3,600.\n\nAnd the reason is, because I believe that we do best when the middle class is doing well. And by giving them those tax cuts, they had a little more money in their pocket, and so maybe they can buy a new car. They are certainly in a better position to weather the extraordinary recession that we went through. They can buy a computer for their kid who\u2019s going off to college, which means they\u2019re spending more money, businesses have more customers, businesses make more profits, and then hire more workers.\n\nNow, Governor Romney\u2019s proposal that he has been promoting for 18 months calls for a $5 trillion tax cut, on top of $2 trillion of additional spending for our military. And he is saying that he is going to pay for it by closing loopholes and deductions. The problem is that he\u2019s been asked over 100 times how you would close those deductions and loopholes, and he hasn\u2019t been able to identify them.\n\nBut I\u2019m going to make an important point here, Jim.\n\n21:16:34: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:36: OBAMA: When you add up all the loopholes and deductions that upper-income individuals can \u2013 are currently taking advantage of, you take those all away, you don\u2019t come close to paying for $5 trillion in tax cuts and $2 trillion in additional military spending.\n\nOBAMA: And that\u2019s why independent studies looking at this said the only way to meet Governor Romney\u2019s pledge of not reducing the deficit or \u2013 or \u2013 or not adding to the deficit is by burdening middle-class families. The average middle-class family with children would pay about $2,000 more.\n\nNow, that\u2019s not my analysis. That\u2019s the analysis of economists who have looked at this. And \u2013 and that kind of top \u2013 top-down economics, where folks at the top are doing well, so the average person making $3 million is getting a $250,000 tax break, while middle-class families are burdened further, that\u2019s not what I believe is a recipe for economic growth.\n\n21:16:37: LEHRER: All right. What is the difference? Let\u2019s just stay on taxes.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Just \u2013 let\u2019s just stay on taxes for (inaudible).\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: What is the difference\u2026\n\n21:16:42: ROMNEY: Well, but \u2013 but virtually \u2013 virtually everything he just said about my tax plan is inaccurate.\n\n21:16:43: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:16:44: ROMNEY: So if the tax plan he described were a tax plan I was asked to support, I\u2019d say absolutely not. I\u2019m not looking for a $5 trillion tax cut. What I\u2019ve said is I won\u2019t put in place a tax cut that adds to the deficit. That\u2019s part one. So there\u2019s no economist that can say Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan adds $5 trillion if I say I will not add to the deficit with my tax plan.\n\nNumber two, I will not reduce the share paid by high-income individuals. I know that you and your running mate keep saying that and I know it\u2019s a popular thing to say with a lot of people, but it\u2019s just not the case. Look, I\u2019ve got five boys. I\u2019m used to people saying something that\u2019s not always true, but just keep on repeating it and ultimately hoping I\u2019ll believe it. But that \u2013 that is not the case. All right? I will not reduce the taxes paid by high-income Americans.\n\nAnd number three, I will not under any circumstances raise taxes on middle-income families. I will lower taxes on middle-income families. Now, you cite a study. There are six other studies that looked at the study you describe and say it\u2019s completely wrong. I saw a study that came out today that said you\u2019re going to raise taxes by $3,000 to $4,000 on middle-income families.\n\nThere are all these studies out there. But let\u2019s get at the bottom line. That is, I want to bring down rates. I want to bring the rates down, at the same time lower deductions and exemptions and credits and so forth, so we keep getting the revenue we need. And you\u2019d think, well, then why lower the rates.\n\nAnd the reason is because small business pays that individual rate; 54 percent of America\u2019s workers work in businesses that are taxed not at the corporate tax rate, but at the individual tax rate. And if we lower that rate, they will be able to hire more people. For me, this is about jobs. This is about getting jobs for the American people.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:18:30: LEHRER: That\u2019s where we started. Yeah.\n\nDo you challenge what the governor just said about his own plan?\n\n21:18:34: OBAMA: Well, for 18 months he\u2019s been running on this tax plan. And now, five weeks before the election, he\u2019s saying that his big, bold idea is, \u201cNever mind.\u201d\n\nAnd the fact is that if you are lowering the rates the way you described, Governor, then it is not possible to come up with enough deductions and loopholes that only affect high-income individuals to avoid either raising the deficit or burdening the middle class. It\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s math. It\u2019s arithmetic.\n\nNow, Governor Romney and I do share a deep interest in encouraging small-business growth. So at the same time that my tax plan has already lowered taxes for 98 percent of families, I also lowered taxes for small businesses 18 times. And what I want to do is continue the tax rates \u2013 the tax cuts that we put into place for small businesses and families.\n\nBut I have said that for incomes over $250,000 a year, that we should go back to the rates that we had when Bill Clinton was president, when we created 23 million new jobs, went from deficit to surplus, and created a whole lot of millionaires to boot.\n\nAnd the reason this is important is because by doing that, we cannot only reduce the deficit, we cannot only encourage job growth through small businesses, but we\u2019re also able to make the investments that are necessary in education or in energy.\n\nAnd we do have a difference, though, when it comes to definitions of small business. Under \u2013 under my plan, 97 percent of small businesses would not see their income taxes go up. Governor Romney says, well, those top 3 percent, they\u2019re the job creators, they\u2019d be burdened.\n\nBut under Governor Romney\u2019s definition, there are a whole bunch of millionaires and billionaires who are small businesses. Donald Trump is a small business. Now, I know Donald Trump doesn\u2019t like to think of himself as small anything, but \u2013 but that\u2019s how you define small businesses if you\u2019re getting business income.\n\nAnd that kind of approach, I believe, will not grow our economy, because the only way to pay for it without either burdening the middle class or blowing up our deficit is to make drastic cuts in things like education, making sure that we are continuing to invest in basic science and research, all the things that are helping America grow. And I think that would be a mistake.\n\n21:21:01: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:21:03: ROMNEY: Jim, let me just come back on that \u2013 on that point, which is these\u2026\n\n21:21:04: LEHRER: Just for the \u2013 just for record\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:21:07: ROMNEY: \u2026 the small businesses we\u2019re talking about\u2026\n\n21:21:09: LEHRER: Excuse me. Excuse me. Just so everybody understands, we\u2019re way over our first 15 minutes.\n\n21:21:10: ROMNEY: It\u2019s fun, isn\u2019t it?\n\n21:21:11: LEHRER: It\u2019s OK, it\u2019s great. No problem. Well, you all don\u2019t have \u2013 you don\u2019t have a problem, I don\u2019t have a problem, because we\u2019re still on the economy. We\u2019re going to come back to taxes. I want move on to the deficit and a lot of other things, too.\n\nOK, but go ahead, sir.\n\n21:21:38: ROMNEY: You bet. Well, President, you\u2019re \u2013 Mr. President, you\u2019re absolutely right, which is that, with regards to 97 percent of the businesses are not \u2013 not taxed at the 35 percent tax rate, they\u2019re taxed at a lower rate. But those businesses that are in the last 3 percent of businesses happen to employ half \u2013 half of all the people who work in small business. Those are the businesses that employ one-quarter of all the workers in America. And your plan is to take their tax rate from 35 percent to 40 percent.\n\nNow, and \u2013 and I\u2019ve talked to a guy who has a very small business. He\u2019s in the electronics business in \u2013 in St. Louis. He has four employees. He said he and his son calculated how much they pay in taxes, federal income tax, federal payroll tax, state income tax, state sales tax, state property tax, gasoline tax. It added up to well over 50 percent of what they earned. And your plan is to take the tax rate on successful small businesses from 35 percent to 40 percent. The National Federation of Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cost jobs. My priority is jobs. And so what I do is I bring down the tax rates, lower deductions and exemptions, the same idea behind Bowles-Simpson, by the way, get the rates down, lower deductions and exemptions, to create more jobs, because there\u2019s nothing better for getting us to a balanced budget than having more people working, earning more money, paying more taxes. That\u2019s by far the most effective and efficient way to get this budget balanced.\n\n21:22:58: OBAMA: Jim, I \u2013 you may want to move onto another topic, but I \u2013 I would just say this to the American people. If you believe that we can cut taxes by $5 trillion and add $2 trillion in additional spending that the military is not asking for, $7 trillion \u2013 just to give you a sense, over 10 years, that\u2019s more than our entire defense budget \u2013 and you think that by closing loopholes and deductions for the well-to-do, somehow you will not end up picking up the tab, then Governor Romney\u2019s plan may work for you.\n\nBut I think math, common sense, and our history shows us that\u2019s not a recipe for job growth. Look, we\u2019ve tried this. We\u2019ve tried both approaches. The approach that Governor Romney\u2019s talking about is the same sales pitch that was made in 2001 and 2003, and we ended up with the slowest job growth in 50 years, we ended up moving from surplus to deficits, and it all culminated in the worst financial crisis since the Great Depression.\n\nBill Clinton tried the approach that I\u2019m talking about. We created 23 million new jobs. We went from deficit to surplus. And businesses did very well. So, in some ways, we\u2019ve got some data on which approach is more likely to create jobs and opportunity for Americans and I believe that the economy works best when middle-class families are getting tax breaks so that they\u2019ve got some money in their pockets, and those of us who have done extraordinarily well because of this magnificent country that we live in, that we can afford to do a little bit more to make sure we\u2019re not blowing up the deficit.\n\n21:24:40: ROMNEY: Jim, the president began this segment, so I think I get the last word.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:42: LEHRER: Well, you\u2019re going to get the first word in the next segment.\n\n21:24:48: ROMNEY: All right. Well, but he gets the first word of that segment. I get the last word (inaudible) I hope. Let me just make this comment.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:24:50: ROMNEY: I think first of all, let me \u2013 let me repeat \u2013 let me repeat what I said. I\u2019m not in favor of a $5 trillion tax cut. That\u2019s not my plan. My plan is not to put in place any tax cut that will add to the deficit. That\u2019s point one.\n\nSo you may keep referring to it as a $5 trillion tax cut, but that\u2019s not my plan.\n\nNumber two, let\u2019s look at history. My plan is not like anything that\u2019s been tried before. My plan is to bring down rates, but also bring down deductions and exemptions and credits at the same time so the revenue stays in, but that we bring down rates to get more people working.\n\nMy priority is putting people back to work in America. They\u2019re suffering in this country. And we talk about evidence. Look at the evidence of the last four years. It\u2019s absolutely extraordinary. We\u2019ve got 23 million people out of work or stopped looking for work in this country. It\u2019s just \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 when the president took office, 32 million people on food stamps; 47 million on food stamps today; economic growth this year slower than last year, and last year slower than the year before.\n\nGoing forward with the status quo is not going to cut it for the American people who are struggling today.\n\n21:26:01: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s talk \u2013 we\u2019re still on the economy. This is, theoretically now, a second segment still on the economy, and specifically on what to do about the federal deficit, the federal debt.\n\nAnd the question, you each have two minutes on this, and Governor Romney, you \u2013 you go first because the president went first on segment one. And the question is this, what are the differences between the two of you as to how you would go about tackling the deficit problem in this country?\n\n21:26:31: ROMNEY: Good. I\u2019m glad you raised that, and it\u2019s a \u2013 it\u2019s a critical issue. I think it\u2019s not just an economic issue, I think it\u2019s a moral issue. I think it\u2019s, frankly, not moral for my generation to keep spending massively more than we take in, knowing those burdens are going to be passed on to the next generation and they\u2019re going to be paying the interest and the principal all their lives.\n\nAnd the amount of debt we\u2019re adding, at a trillion a year, is simply not moral.\n\nSo how do we deal with it? Well, mathematically, there are three ways that you can cut a deficit. One, of course, is to raise taxes. Number two is to cut spending. And number is to grow the economy, because if more people work in a growing economy, they\u2019re paying taxes, and you can get the job done that way.\n\nThe presidents would \u2013 president would prefer raising taxes. I understand. The problem with raising taxes is that it slows down the rate of growth. And you could never quite get the job done. I want to lower spending and encourage economic growth at the same time.\n\nWhat things would I cut from spending? Well, first of all, I will eliminate all programs by this test, if they don\u2019t pass it: Is the program so critical it\u2019s worth borrowing money from China to pay for it? And if not, I\u2019ll get rid of it. Obamacare\u2019s on my list.\n\nI apologize, Mr. President. I use that term with all respect, by the way.\n\nOBAMA: I like it.\n\nROMNEY: Good. OK, good. So I\u2019ll get rid of that.\n\nI\u2019m sorry, Jim, I\u2019m going to stop the subsidy to PBS. I\u2019m going to stop other things. I like PBS, I love Big Bird. Actually like you, too. But I\u2019m not going to \u2013 I\u2019m not going to keep on spending money on things to borrow money from China to pay for. That\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two, I\u2019ll take programs that are currently good programs but I think could be run more efficiently at the state level and send them to the state.\n\nNumber three, I\u2019ll make government more efficient and to cut back the number of employees, combine some agencies and departments. My cutbacks will be done through attrition, by the way.\n\nThis is the approach we have to take to get America to a balanced budget.\n\nThe president said he\u2019d cut the deficit in half. Unfortunately, he doubled it. Trillion-dollar deficits for the last four years. The president\u2019s put it in place as much public debt \u2013 almost as much debt held by the public as al prior presidents combined.\n\n21:28:35: LEHRER: Mr. President, two minutes.\n\n21:28:37: OBAMA: When I walked into the Oval Office, I had more than a trillion-dollar deficit greeting me. And we know where it came from: two wars that were paid for on a credit card; two tax cuts that were not paid for; and a whole bunch of programs that were not paid for; and then a massive economic crisis.\n\nAnd despite that, what we\u2019ve said is, yes, we had to take some initial emergency measures to make sure we didn\u2019t slip into a Great Depression, but what we\u2019ve also said is, let\u2019s make sure that we are cutting out those things that are not helping us grow.\n\nSo 77 government programs, everything from aircrafts that the Air Force had ordered but weren\u2019t working very well, 18 government \u2013 18 government programs for education that were well-intentioned, not weren\u2019t helping kids learn, we went after medical fraud in Medicare and Medicaid very aggressively, more aggressively than ever before, and have saved tens of billions of dollars, $50 billion of waste taken out of the system.\n\nAnd I worked with Democrats and Republicans to cut a trillion dollars out of our discretionary domestic budget. That\u2019s the largest cut in the discretionary domestic budget since Dwight Eisenhower.\n\nNow, we all know that we\u2019ve got to do more. And so I\u2019ve put forward a specific $4 trillion deficit reduction plan. It\u2019s on a website. You can look at all the numbers, what cuts we make and what revenue we raise.\n\nAnd the way we do it is $2.50 for every cut, we ask for $1 of additional revenue, paid for, as I indicated earlier, by asking those of us who have done very well in this country to contribute a little bit more to reduce the deficit. Governor Romney earlier mentioned the Bowles-Simpson commission. Well, that\u2019s how the commission \u2013 bipartisan commission that talked about how we should move forward suggested we have to do it, in a balanced way with some revenue and some spending cuts. And this is a major difference that Governor Romney and I have.\n\nLet \u2013 let me just finish their point, because you\u2019re looking for contrast. You know, when Governor Romney stood on a stage with other Republican candidates for the nomination and he was asked, would you take $10 of spending cuts for just $1 of revenue? And he said no.\n\nNow, if you take such an unbalanced approach, then that means you are going to be gutting our investments in schools and education. It means that Governor Romney\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:15: OBAMA: \u2026 talked about Medicaid and how we could send it back to the states, but effectively this means a 30 percent cut in the primary program we help for seniors who are in nursing homes, for kids who are with disabilities.\n\n21:31:22: LEHRER: Mr. President, I\u2019m sorry.\n\n21:31:26: OBAMA: And \u2013 and that is not a right strategy for us to move forward.\n\n21:31:28: LEHRER: Way over the two minutes.\n\n21:31:28: OBAMA: Sorry.\n\n21:31:34: LEHRER: Governor, what about Simpson-Bowles? Do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:34: ROMNEY: Simpson-Bowles, the president should have grabbed that.\n\n21:31:35: LEHRER: No, I mean, do you support Simpson-Bowles?\n\n21:31:36: ROMNEY: I have my own plan. It\u2019s not the same as Simpson- Bowles. But in my view, the president should have grabbed it. If you wanted to make some adjustments to it, take it, go to Congress, fight for it.\n\n21:31:48: OBAMA: That\u2019s what we\u2019ve done, made some adjustments to it, and we\u2019re putting it forward before Congress right now, a $4 trillion plan\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But you\u2019ve been \u2013 but you\u2019ve been president four years\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:31:54: ROMNEY: You\u2019ve been president four years. You said you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. It\u2019s now four years later. We still have trillion-dollar deficits. The CBO says we\u2019ll have a trillion-dollar deficit each of the next four years. If you\u2019re re-elected, we\u2019ll get to a trillion-dollar debt.\n\nI mean, you have said before you\u2019d cut the deficit in half. And this \u2013 I love this idea of $4 trillion in cuts. You found $4 trillion of ways to reduce or to get closer to a balanced budget, except we still show trillion-dollar deficits every year. That doesn\u2019t get the job done.\n\nLet me come back and say, why is it that I don\u2019t want to raise taxes? Why don\u2019t I want to raise taxes on people? And actually, you said it back in 2010. You said, \u201cLook, I\u2019m going to extend the tax policies that we have now; I\u2019m not going to raise taxes on anyone, because when the economy is growing slow like this, when we\u2019re in recession, you shouldn\u2019t raise taxes on anyone.\u201d\n\nWell, the economy is still growing slow. As a matter of fact, it\u2019s growing much more slowly now than when you made that statement. And so if you believe the same thing, you just don\u2019t want to raise taxes on people. And the reality is it\u2019s not just wealthy people \u2013 you mentioned Donald Trump. It\u2019s not just Donald Trump you\u2019re taxing. It\u2019s all those businesses that employ one-quarter of the workers in America; these small businesses that are taxed as individuals.\n\nYou raise taxes and you kill jobs. That\u2019s why the National Federation of Independent Businesses said your plan will kill 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to kill jobs in this environment.\n\nI\u2019ll make one more point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:21: LEHRER: (inaudible) answer the taxes thing for a moment.\n\n21:33:22: ROMNEY: OK.\n\n21:33:23: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:33:24: OBAMA: Well, we\u2019ve had this discussion before.\n\n21:33:26: LEHRER: About the idea that in order to reduce the deficit, there has to be revenue in addition to cuts.\n\n21:33:30: OBAMA: There has to be revenue in addition to cuts. Now, Governor Romney has ruled out revenue. He\u2019s ruled out revenue.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:31: ROMNEY: Absolutely. (CROSSTALK)\n\n21:33:30: ROMNEY: Look, the revenue I get is by more people working, getting higher pay, paying more taxes. That\u2019s how we get growth and how we balance the budget. But the idea of taxing people more, putting more people out of work, you\u2019ll never get there. You\u2019ll never balance the budget by raising taxes.\n\nSpain \u2013 Spain spends 42 percent of their total economy on government. We\u2019re now spending 42 percent of our economy on government. I don\u2019t want to go down the path to Spain. I want to go down the path of growth that puts Americans to work with more money coming in because they\u2019re working.\n\n21:34:11: LEHRER: But \u2013 but Mr. President, you\u2019re saying in order to \u2013 to get the job done, it\u2019s got to be balanced. You\u2019ve got to have\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:34:16: OBAMA: If \u2013 if we\u2019re serious, we\u2019ve got to take a balanced, responsible approach. And by the way, this is not just when it comes to individual taxes. Let\u2019s talk about corporate taxes.\n\nNow, I\u2019ve identified areas where we can, right away, make a change that I believe would actually help the economy.\n\nThe oil industry gets $4 billion a year in corporate welfare. Basically, they get deductions that those small businesses that Governor Romney refers to, they don\u2019t get.\n\nNow, does anybody think that ExxonMobil needs some extra money, when they\u2019re making money every time you go to the pump? Why wouldn\u2019t we want to eliminate that? Why wouldn\u2019t we eliminate tax breaks for corporate jets? My attitude is, if you got a corporate jet, you can probably afford to pay full freight, not get a special break for it.\n\nWhen it comes to corporate taxes, Governor Romney has said he wants to, in a revenue neutral way, close loopholes, deductions \u2013 he hasn\u2019t identified which ones they are \u2013 but that thereby bring down the corporate rate.\n\nWell, I want to do the same thing, but I\u2019ve actually identified how we can do that. And part of the way to do it is to not give tax breaks to companies that are shipping jobs overseas.\n\nRight now, you can actually take a deduction for moving a plant overseas. I think most Americans would say that doesn\u2019t make sense. And all that raises revenue.\n\nAnd so if we take a balanced approach, what that then allows us to do is also to help young people, the way we already have during my administration, make sure that they can afford to go to college.\n\nIt means that the teacher that I met in Las Vegas, a wonderful young lady, who describes to me \u2013 she\u2019s got 42 kids in her class. The first two weeks she\u2019s got them, some of them sitting on the floor until finally they get reassigned. They\u2019re using text books that are 10 years old.\n\nThat is not a recipe for growth. That\u2019s not how America was built. And so budgets reflect choices.\n\nUltimately, we\u2019re going to have to make some decisions. And if we\u2019re asking for no revenue, then that means that we\u2019ve got to get rid of a whole bunch of stuff.\n\nAnd the magnitude of the tax cuts that you\u2019re talking about, Governor, would end up resulting in severe hardship for people, but more importantly, would not help us grow.\n\nAs I indicated before, when you talk about shifting Medicaid to states, we\u2019re talking about potentially a 30 \u2013 a 30 percent cut in Medicaid over time.\n\nNow, you know, that may not seem like a big deal when it just is, you know, numbers on a sheet of paper, but if we\u2019re talking about a family who\u2019s got an autistic kid and is depending on that Medicaid, that\u2019s a big problem.\n\nAnd governors are creative. There\u2019s no doubt about it. But they\u2019re not creative enough to make up for 30 percent of revenue on something like Medicaid. What ends up happening is some people end up not getting help.\n\n21:37:19: ROMNEY: Jim, let\u2019s \u2013 we\u2019ve gone on a lot of topics there, and so it\u2019s going to take a minute to go from Medicaid to schools\u2026\n\n21:37:22: LEHRER: Come back to\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:37:25: ROMNEY: \u2026 to oil, to tax breaks, then companies going overseas. So let\u2019s go through them one by one.\n\nFirst of all, the Department of Energy has said the tax break for oil companies is $2.8 billion a year. And it\u2019s actually an accounting treatment, as you know, that\u2019s been in place for a hundred years. Now\u2026\n\nOBAMA: It\u2019s time to end it.\n\nROMNEY: And in one year, you provided $90 billion in breaks to the green energy world.\n\nNow, I like green energy as well, but that\u2019s about 50 years\u2019 worth of what oil and gas receives. And you say Exxon and Mobil. Actually, this $2.8 billion goes largely to small companies, to drilling operators and so forth.\n\nBut, you know, if we get that tax rate from 35 percent down to 25 percent, why that $2.8 billion is on the table. Of course it\u2019s on the table. That\u2019s probably not going to survive you get that rate down to 25 percent.\n\nBut don\u2019t forget, you put $90 billion, like 50 years\u2019 worth of breaks, into \u2013 into solar and wind, to Solyndra and Fisker and Tester and Ener1. I mean, I had a friend who said you don\u2019t just pick the winners and losers, you pick the losers, all right? So this \u2013 this is not \u2013 this is not the kind of policy you want to have if you want to get America energy secure.\n\nThe second topic, which is you said you get a deduction for taking a plant overseas. Look, I\u2019ve been in business for 25 years. I have no idea what you\u2019re talking about. I maybe need to get a new accountant.\n\nLEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\nROMNEY: But \u2013 but the idea that you get a break for shipping jobs overseas is simply not the case.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nROMNEY: What we do have right now is a setting where I\u2019d like to bring money from overseas back to this country.\n\nAnd, finally, Medicaid to states? I\u2019m not quite sure where that came in, except this, which is, I would like to take the Medicaid dollars that go to states and say to a state, you\u2019re going to get what you got last year, plus inflation, plus 1 percent, and then you\u2019re going to manage your care for your poor in the way you think best.\n\nAnd I remember, as a governor, when this idea was floated by Tommy Thompson, the governors \u2013 Republican and Democrats \u2013 said, please let us do that. We can care for our own poor in so much better and more effective a way than having the federal government tell us how to care for our poor.\n\nSo \u2013 so let\u2019s state \u2013 one of the magnificent things about this country is the whole idea that states are the laboratories of democracy. Don\u2019t have the federal government tell everybody what kind of training programs they have to have and what kind of Medicaid they have to have. Let states do this.\n\nAnd, by the way, if a state gets in trouble, well, we can step in and see if we can find a way to help them.\n\n21:39:49: LEHRER: Let\u2019s go.\n\n21:39:48: ROMNEY: But \u2013 but the right \u2013 the right approach is one which relies on the brilliance of our people and states, not the federal government.\n\n21:39:52: LEHRER: (inaudible) and we\u2019re going on \u2013 still on the economy, on another \u2013 but another part of it\u2026\n\nOBAMA: OK.\n\n21:39:56: LEHRER: All right? All right. This is segment three, the economy. Entitlements. First \u2013 first answer goes to you, two minutes, Mr. President. Do you see a major difference between the two of you on Social Security?\n\n21:40:15: OBAMA: You know, I suspect that, on Social Security, we\u2019ve got a somewhat similar position. Social Security is structurally sound. It\u2019s going to have to be tweaked the way it was by Ronald Reagan and Speaker \u2013 Democratic Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill. But it is \u2013 the basic structure is sound.\n\nBut \u2013 but I want to talk about the values behind Social Security and Medicare, and then talk about Medicare, because that\u2019s the big driver of our deficits right now.\n\nYou know, my grandmother \u2013 some of you know \u2013 helped to raise me. My grandparents did. My grandfather died a while back. My grandmother died three days before I was elected president. And she was fiercely independent. She worked her way up, only had a high school education, started as a secretary, ended up being the vice president of a local bank. And she ended up living alone by choice.\n\nAnd the reason she could be independent was because of Social Security and Medicare. She had worked all her life, put in this money, and understood that there was a basic guarantee, a floor under which she could not go.\n\nAnd that\u2019s the perspective I bring when I think about what\u2019s called entitlements. You know, the name itself implies some sense of dependency on the part of these folks. These are folks who\u2019ve worked hard, like my grandmother, and there are millions of people out there who are counting on this.\n\nSo my approach is to say, how do we strengthen the system over the long term? And in Medicare, what we did was we said, we are going to have to bring down the costs if we\u2019re going to deal with our long-term deficits, but to do that, let\u2019s look where some of the money\u2019s going.\n\n$716 billion we were able to save from the Medicare program by no longer overpaying insurance companies by making sure that we weren\u2019t overpaying providers. And using that money, we were actually able to lower prescription drug costs for seniors by an average of $600, and we were also able to make a \u2013 make a significant dent in providing them the kind of preventive care that will ultimately save money through the \u2013 throughout the system.\n\nSo the way for us to deal with Medicare in particular is to lower health care costs. When it comes to Social Security, as I said, you don\u2019t need a major structural change in order to make sure that Social Security is there for the future.\n\n21:42:38: LEHRER: We\u2019ll follow up on this.\n\nFirst, Governor Romney, you have two minutes on Social Security and entitlements.\n\n21:42:41: ROMNEY: Well, Jim, our seniors depend on these programs, and I know anytime we talk about entitlements, people become concerned that something\u2019s going to happen that\u2019s going to change their life for the worse.\n\nAnd the answer is neither the president nor I are proposing any changes for any current retirees or near retirees, either to Social Security or Medicare. So if you\u2019re 60 or around 60 or older, you don\u2019t need to listen any further.\n\nBut for younger people, we need to talk about what changes are going to be occurring. Oh, I just thought about one. And that is, in fact, I was wrong when I said the president isn\u2019t proposing any changes for current retirees. In fact he is on Medicare. On Social Security he\u2019s not.\n\nBut on Medicare, for current retirees, he\u2019s cutting $716 billion from the program. Now, he says by not overpaying hospitals and providers. Actually just going to them and saying, \u201cWe\u2019re going to reduce the rates you get paid across the board, everybody\u2019s going to get a lower rate.\u201d That\u2019s not just going after places where there\u2019s abuse. That\u2019s saying we\u2019re cutting the rates. Some 15 percent of hospitals and nursing homes say they won\u2019t take anymore Medicare patients under that scenario.\n\nWe also have 50 percent of doctors who say they won\u2019t take more Medicare patients.\n\nThis \u2013 we have 4 million people on Medicare Advantage that will lose Medicare Advantage because of those $716 billion in cuts. I can\u2019t understand how you can cut Medicare $716 billion for current recipients of Medicare.\n\nNow, you point out, well, we\u2019re putting some back. We\u2019re going to give a better prescription program. That\u2019s $1 \u2013 that\u2019s $1 for every $15 you\u2019ve cut. They\u2019re smart enough to know that\u2019s not a good trade.\n\nI want to take that $716 billion you\u2019ve cut and put it back into Medicare. By the way, we can include a prescription program if we need to improve it.\n\nBut the idea of cutting $716 billion from Medicare to be able to balance the additional cost of Obamacare is, in my opinion, a mistake.\n\nAnd with regards to young people coming along, I\u2019ve got proposals to make sure Medicare and Social Security are there for them without any question.\n\n21:44:43: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n21:44:44: OBAMA: First of all, I think it\u2019s important for Governor Romney to present this plan that he says will only affect folks in the future.\n\nAnd the essence of the plan is that you would turn Medicare into a voucher program. It\u2019s called premium support, but it\u2019s understood to be a voucher program. His running mate\u2026\n\n21:45:05: LEHRER: And you don\u2019t support that?\n\n21:45:07: OBAMA: I don\u2019t. And let me explain why.\n\n21:45:08: ROMNEY: Again, that\u2019s for future\u2026\n\n21:45:09: OBAMA: I understand.\n\n21:45:10: ROMNEY: \u2026 people, right, not for current retirees.\n\n21:45:12: OBAMA: For \u2013 so if you\u2019re \u2013 if you\u2019re 54 or 55, you might want to listen \u2018cause this \u2013 this will affect you.\n\nThe idea, which was originally presented by Congressman Ryan, your running mate, is that we would give a voucher to seniors and they could go out in the private marketplace and buy their own health insurance.\n\nThe problem is that because the voucher wouldn\u2019t necessarily keep up with health care inflation, it was estimated that this would cost the average senior about $6,000 a year.\n\nNow, in fairness, what Governor Romney has now said is he\u2019ll maintain traditional Medicare alongside it. But there\u2019s still a problem, because what happens is, those insurance companies are pretty clever at figuring out who are the younger and healthier seniors. They recruit them, leaving the older, sicker seniors in Medicare. And every health care economist that looks at it says, over time, what\u2019ll happen is the traditional Medicare system will collapse.\n\nAnd then what you\u2019ve got is folks like my grandmother at the mercy of the private insurance system precisely at the time when they are most in need of decent health care.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think vouchers are the right way to go. And this is not my own \u2013 only my opinion. AARP thinks that the \u2013 the savings that we obtained from Medicare bolster the system, lengthen the Medicare trust fund by eight years. Benefits were not affected at all. And ironically, if you repeal Obamacare, and I have become fond of this term, \u201cObamacare,\u201d if you repeal it, what happens is those seniors right away are going to be paying $600 more in prescription care. They\u2019re now going to have to be paying copays for basic checkups that can keep them healthier.\n\nAnd the primary beneficiary of that repeal are insurance companies that are estimated to gain billions of dollars back when they aren\u2019t making seniors any healthier. And I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the right approach when it comes to making sure that Medicare is stronger over the long term.\n\n21:47:21: LEHRER: We\u2019ll talk about \u2013 specifically about health care in a moment. But what \u2013 do you support the voucher system, Governor?\n\n21:47:27: ROMNEY: What I support is no change for current retirees and near-retirees to Medicare. And the president supports taking $716 billion out of that program.\n\n21:47:32: LEHRER: And what about the vouchers?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:47:36: ROMNEY: So that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s number one.\n\nNumber two is for people coming along that are young, what I do to make sure that we can keep Medicare in place for them is to allow them either to choose the current Medicare program or a private plan. Their choice.\n\nThey get to choose \u2013 and they\u2019ll have at least two plans that will be entirely at no cost to them. So they don\u2019t have to pay additional money, no additional $6,000. That\u2019s not going to happen. They\u2019ll have at least two plans.\n\nAnd by the way, if the government can be as efficient as the private sector and offer premiums that are as low as the private sector, people will be happy to get traditional Medicare or they\u2019ll be able to get a private plan.\n\nI know my own view is I\u2019d rather have a private plan. I\u2019d just assume not have the government telling me what kind of health care I get. I\u2019d rather be able to have an insurance company. If I don\u2019t like them, I can get rid of them and find a different insurance company. But people make their own choice.\n\nThe other thing we have to do to save Medicare? We have to have the benefits high for those that are low income, but for higher income people, we\u2019re going to have to lower some of the benefits. We have to make sure this program is there for the long term. That\u2019s the plan that I\u2019ve put forward.\n\nAnd, by the way the idea came not even from Paul Ryan or \u2013 or Senator Wyden, who\u2019s the co-author of the bill with \u2013 with Paul Ryan in the Senate, but also it came from Bill \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s chief of staff. This is an idea that\u2019s been around a long time, which is saying, hey, let\u2019s see if we can\u2019t get competition into the Medicare world so that people can get the choice of different plans at lower cost, better quality. I believe in competition.\n\n21:49:05: OBAMA: Jim, if I \u2013 if I can just respond very quickly, first of all, every study has shown that Medicare has lower administrative costs than private insurance does, which is why seniors are generally pretty happy with it.\n\nAnd private insurers have to make a profit. Nothing wrong with that. That\u2019s what they do. And so you\u2019ve got higher administrative costs, plus profit on top of that. And if you are going to save any money through what Governor Romney\u2019s proposing, what has to happen is, is that the money has to come from somewhere.\n\nAnd when you move to a voucher system, you are putting seniors at the mercy of those insurance companies. And over time, if traditional Medicare has decayed or fallen apart, then they\u2019re stuck.\n\nAnd this is the reason why AARP has said that your plan would weaken Medicare substantially. And that\u2019s why they were supportive of the approach that we took.\n\nOne last point I want to make. We do have to lower the cost of health care, not just in Medicare and Medicaid\u2026 LEHRER: Talk about that in a minute.\n\nOBAMA: \u2026 but \u2013 but \u2013 but overall.\n\nLEHRER: OK.\n\nOBAMA: And so\u2026\n\nROMNEY: That\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a big topic. Can we \u2013 can we stay on Medicare?\n\nOBAMA: Is that a \u2013 is that a separate topic?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nLEHRER: Yeah, we\u2019re going to \u2013 yeah, I want to get to it.\n\nOBAMA: I\u2019m sorry.\n\nLEHRER: But all I want to do is go very quickly\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 before we leave the economy\u2026\n\nROMNEY: Let\u2019s get back to Medicare.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:50:20: ROMNEY: The president said that the government can provide the service at lower cost and without a profit.\n\n21:50:25: LEHRER: All right.\n\n21:50:27: ROMNEY: If that\u2019s the case, then it will always be the best product that people can purchase.\n\n21:50:30: LEHRER: Wait a minute, Governor.\n\n21:50:32: ROMNEY: But my experience \u2013 my experience the private sector typically is able to provide a better product at a lower cost.\n\n21:50:38: LEHRER: All right. Can we \u2013 can the two of you agree that the voters have a choice \u2013 a clear choice between the two\u2026\n\n21:50:40: ROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nLEHRER: \u2026 of you on Medicare?\n\nROMNEY: Absolutely.\n\nOBAMA: Absolutely.\n\n21:50:42: LEHRER: All right. So to finish quickly, briefly, on the economy, what is your view about the level of federal regulation of the economy right now? Is there too much? And in your case, Mr. President, is there \u2013 should there be more?\n\nBeginning with you. This is not a new two-minute segment to start. And we\u2019ll go for a few minutes, and then we\u2019re going to go to health care, OK?\n\n21:51:07: ROMNEY: Regulation is essential. You can\u2019t have a free market work if you don\u2019t have regulation. As a businessperson, I had to have \u2013 I need to know the regulations. I needed them there. You couldn\u2019t have people opening up banks in their \u2013 in their garage and making loans. I mean, you have to have regulations so that you can have an economy work. Every free economy has good regulation. At the same time, regulation can become excessive.\n\n21:51:30: LEHRER: Is it excessive now, do you think?\n\n21:51:31: ROMNEY: In some places, yes. Other places, no.\n\n21:51:32: LEHRER: Like where?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:51:37: ROMNEY: No, it can become out of date. And what\u2019s happened with some of the legislation that\u2019s been passed during the president\u2019s term, you\u2019ve seen regulation become excessive, and it\u2019s hurt \u2013 it\u2019s hurt the economy. Let me give you an example.\n\nDodd-Frank was passed. And it includes within it a number of provisions that I think has some unintended consequences that are harmful to the economy. One is it designates a number of banks as too big to fail, and they\u2019re effectively guaranteed by the federal government. This is the biggest kiss that\u2019s been given to \u2013 to New York banks I\u2019ve ever seen. This is an enormous boon for them. There\u2019ve been 122 community and small banks have closed since Dodd- Frank.\n\nSo there\u2019s one example. Here\u2019s another. In Dodd-Frank\u2026\n\n21:52:15: LEHRER: Do you want to repeal Dodd-Frank?\n\n21:52:17: ROMNEY: Well, I would repeal and replace it. We\u2019re not going to get rid of all regulation. You have to have regulation. And there are some parts of Dodd-Frank that make all the sense in the world. You need transparency, you need to have leverage limits for\u2026\n\n21:52:25: LEHRER: Well, here\u2019s a specific\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:28: ROMNEY: But let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s mention \u2013 let me mention the other one. Let\u2019s talk\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n21:52:33: LEHRER: No, let\u2019s not. Let\u2019s let him respond \u2013 let\u2019s let him respond to this specific on Dodd-Frank and what the governor just said.\n\n21:52:41: OBAMA: I think this is a great example. The reason we have been in such a enormous economic crisis was prompted by reckless behavior across the board.\n\nNow, it wasn\u2019t just on Wall Street. You had loan officers were \u2013 that were giving loans and mortgages that really shouldn\u2019t have been given, because the folks didn\u2019t qualify. You had people who were borrowing money to buy a house that they couldn\u2019t afford. You had credit agencies that were stamping these as A1 great investments when they weren\u2019t.\n\nBut you also had banks making money hand over fist, churning out products that the bankers themselves didn\u2019t even understand, in order to make big profits, but knowing that it made the entire system vulnerable.\n\nSo what did we do? We stepped in and had the toughest reforms on Wall Street since the 1930s. We said you\u2019ve got \u2013 banks, you\u2019ve got to raise your capital requirements. You can\u2019t engage in some of this risky behavior that is putting Main Street at risk. We\u2019ve going to make sure that you\u2019ve got to have a living will so \u2013 so we can know how you\u2019re going to wind things down if you make a bad bet so we don\u2019t have other taxpayer bailouts.\n\nIn the meantime, by the way, we also made sure that all the help that we provided those banks was paid back every single dime, with interest.\n\nNow, Governor Romney has said he wants to repeal Dodd-Frank.\n\nAnd, you know, I appreciate and it appears we\u2019ve got some agreement that a marketplace to work has to have some regulation. But in the past, Governor Romney has said he just want to repeal Dodd- Frank, roll it back.\n\nAnd so the question is: Does anybody out there think that the big problem we had is that there was too much oversight and regulation of Wall Street? Because if you do, then Governor Romney is your candidate. But that\u2019s not what I believe.\n\n21:54:42: ROMNEY: Sorry, but that\u2019s just not \u2013 that\u2019s just not the facts. Look, we have to have regulation on Wall Street. That\u2019s why I\u2019d have regulation. But I wouldn\u2019t designate five banks as too big to fail and give them a blank check. That\u2019s one of the unintended consequences of Dodd-Frank. It wasn\u2019t thought through properly. We need to get rid of that provision because it\u2019s killing regional and small banks. They\u2019re getting hurt.\n\nLet me mention another regulation in Dodd-Frank. You say we were giving mortgages to people who weren\u2019t qualified. That\u2019s exactly right. It\u2019s one of the reasons for the great financial calamity we had. And so Dodd-Frank correctly says we need to have qualified mortgages, and if you give a mortgage that\u2019s not qualified, there are big penalties, except they didn\u2019t ever go on and define what a qualified mortgage was.\n\nIt\u2019s been two years. We don\u2019t know what a qualified mortgage is yet. So banks are reluctant to make loans, mortgages. Try and get a mortgage these days. It\u2019s hurt the housing market because Dodd-Frank didn\u2019t anticipate putting in place the kinds of regulations you have to have. It\u2019s not that Dodd-Frank always was wrong with too much regulation. Sometimes they didn\u2019t come out with a clear regulation.\n\nI will make sure we don\u2019t hurt the functioning of our \u2013 of our marketplace and our business, because I want to bring back housing and get good jobs.\n\n21:55:55: LEHRER: All right. I think we have another clear difference between the two of you. Now, let\u2019s move to health care where I know there is a clear difference, and that has to do with the Affordable Care Act, Obamacare. And it\u2019s a two-minute new \u2013 new segment, and that means two minutes each. And you go first, Governor Romney.\n\nYou want it repealed. You want the Affordable Care Act repealed. Why?\n\n21:56:20: ROMNEY: I sure do. Well, in part, it comes, again, from my experience. You know, I was in New Hampshire. A woman came to me and she said, look, I can\u2019t afford insurance for myself or my son. I met a couple in Appleton, Wisconsin, and they said, we\u2019re thinking of dropping our insurance, we can\u2019t afford it.\n\nAnd the number of small businesses I\u2019ve gone to that are saying they\u2019re dropping insurance because they can\u2019t afford it, the cost of health care is just prohibitive. And \u2013 and we\u2019ve got to deal with cost.\n\nAnd, unfortunately, when \u2013 when \u2013 when you look at Obamacare, the Congressional Budget Office has said it will cost $2,500 a year more than traditional insurance. So it\u2019s adding to cost. And as a matter of fact, when the president ran for office, he said that, by this year, he would have brought down the cost of insurance for each family by $2,500 a family. Instead, it\u2019s gone up by that amount. So it\u2019s expensive. Expensive things hurt families. So that\u2019s one reason I don\u2019t want it.\n\nSecond reason, it cuts $716 billion from Medicare to pay for it. I want to put that money back in Medicare for our seniors.\n\nNumber three, it puts in place an unelected board that\u2019s going to tell people ultimately what kind of treatments they can have. I don\u2019t like that idea.\n\nFourth, there was a survey done of small businesses across the country, said, what\u2019s been the effect of Obamacare on your hiring plans? And three-quarters of them said it makes us less likely to hire people. I just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2013 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people. It has killed jobs.\n\nAnd the best course for health care is to do what we did in my state: craft a plan at the state level that fits the needs of the state. And then let\u2019s focus on getting the costs down for people, rather than raising it with the $2,500 additional premium.\n\n21:58:19: LEHRER: Mr. President, the argument against repeal?\n\n21:58:20: OBAMA: Well, four years ago, when I was running for office, I was traveling around and having those same conversations that Governor Romney talks about. And it wasn\u2019t just that small businesses were seeing costs skyrocket and they couldn\u2019t get affordable coverage even if they wanted to provide it to their employees. It wasn\u2019t just that this was the biggest driver of our federal deficit, our overall health care costs, but it was families who were worried about going bankrupt if they got sick, millions of families, all across the country.\n\nIf they had a pre-existing condition, they might not be able to get coverage at all. If they did have coverage, insurance companies might impose an arbitrary limit. And so as a consequence, they\u2019re paying their premiums, somebody gets really sick, lo and behold, they don\u2019t have enough money to pay the bills, because the insurance companies say that they\u2019ve hit the limit.\n\nSo we did work on this, alongside working on jobs, because this is part of making sure that middle-class families are secure in this country.\n\nAnd let me tell you exactly what Obamacare did. Number one, if you\u2019ve got health insurance, it doesn\u2019t mean a government takeover. You keep your own insurance. You keep your own doctor. But it does say insurance companies can\u2019t jerk you around. They can\u2019t impose arbitrary lifetime limits. They have to let you keep your kid on their insurance \u2013 your insurance plan until you\u2019re 26 years old. And it also says that you\u2019re going to have to get rebates if insurance companies are spending more on administrative costs and profits than they are on actual care.\n\nNumber two, if you don\u2019t have health insurance, we\u2019re essentially setting up a group plan that allows you to benefit from group rates that are typically 18 percent lower than if you\u2019re out there trying to get insurance on the individual market.\n\nNow, the last point I\u2019d make before\u2026\n\nLEHRER: Two minutes \u2013 two minutes is up, sir.\n\nOBAMA: No, I think \u2013 I had five seconds before you interrupted me, was \u2026\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\n\u2026 the irony is that we\u2019ve seen this model work really well in Massachusetts, because Governor Romney did a good thing, working with Democrats in the state to set up what is essentially the identical model and as a consequence people are covered there. It hasn\u2019t destroyed jobs. And as a consequence, we now have a system in which we have the opportunity to start bringing down costs, as opposed to just leaving millions of people out in the cold.\n\n22:01:01: LEHRER: Your five seconds went away a long time ago.\n\nAll right, Governor. Governor, tell \u2013 tell the president directly why you think what he just said is wrong about Obamacare?\n\n22:01:10: ROMNEY: Well, I did with my first statement.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:01:13: ROMNEY: First of all, I like the way we did it in Massachusetts. I like the fact that in my state, we had Republicans and Democrats come together and work together. What you did instead was to push through a plan without a single Republican vote. As a matter of fact, when Massachusetts did something quite extraordinary \u2013 elected a Republican senator to stop Obamacare, you pushed it through anyway.\n\nSo entirely on a partisan basis, instead of bringing America together and having a discussion on this important topic, you pushed through something that you and Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid thought was the best answer and drove it through.\n\nWhat we did in a legislature 87 percent Democrat, we worked together; 200 legislators in my legislature, only two voted against the plan by the time we were finished. What were some differences? We didn\u2019t raise taxes. You\u2019ve raised them by $1 trillion under Obamacare. We didn\u2019t cut Medicare. Of course, we don\u2019t have Medicare, but we didn\u2019t cut Medicare by $716 billion.\n\nWe didn\u2019t put in place a board that can tell people ultimately what treatments they\u2019re going to receive. We didn\u2019t also do something that I think a number of people across this country recognize, which is put \u2013 put people in a position where they\u2019re going to lose the insurance they had and they wanted.\n\nRight now, the CBO says up to 20 million people will lose their insurance as Obamacare goes into effect next year. And likewise, a study by McKinsey and Company of American businesses said 30 percent of them are anticipating dropping people from coverage.\n\nSo for those reasons, for the tax, for Medicare, for this board, and for people losing their insurance, this is why the American people don\u2019t want Medicare \u2013 don\u2019t want Obamacare. It\u2019s why Republicans said, do not do this, and the Republicans had \u2013 had the plan. They put a plan out. They put out a plan, a bipartisan plan. It was swept aside.\n\nI think something this big, this important has to be done on a bipartisan basis. And we have to have a president who can reach across the aisle and fashion important legislation with the input from both parties.\n\n22:03:12: OBAMA: Governor Romney said this has to be done on a bipartisan basis. This was a bipartisan idea. In fact, it was a Republican idea. And Governor Romney at the beginning of this debate wrote and said what we did in Massachusetts could be a model for the nation.\n\nAnd I agree that the Democratic legislators in Massachusetts might have given some advice to Republicans in Congress about how to cooperate, but the fact of the matter is, we used the same advisers, and they say it\u2019s the same plan.\n\nIt \u2013 when Governor Romney talks about this board, for example, unelected board that we\u2019ve created, what this is, is a group of health care experts, doctors, et cetera, to figure out, how can we reduce the cost of care in the system overall?\n\nBecause there \u2013 there are two ways of dealing with our health care crisis. One is to simply leave a whole bunch of people uninsured and let them fend for themselves, to let businesses figure out how long they can continue to pay premiums until finally they just give up, and their workers are no longer getting insured, and that\u2019s been the trend line.\n\nOr, alternatively, we can figure out, how do we make the cost of care more effective? And there are ways of doing it.\n\nSo at Cleveland Clinic, one of the best health care systems in the world, they actually provide great care cheaper than average. And the reason they do is because they do some smart things. They \u2013 they say, if a patient\u2019s coming in, let\u2019s get all the doctors together at once, do one test instead of having the patient run around with 10 tests. Let\u2019s make sure that we\u2019re providing preventive care so we\u2019re catching the onset of something like diabetes. Let\u2019s \u2013 let\u2019s pay providers on the basis of performance as opposed to on the basis of how many procedures they\u2019ve \u2013 they\u2019ve engaged in.\n\nNow, so what this board does is basically identifies best practices and says, let\u2019s use the purchasing power of Medicare and Medicaid to help to institutionalize all these good things that we do.\n\nAnd the fact of the matter is that, when Obamacare is fully implemented, we\u2019re going to be in a position to show that costs are going down. And over the last two years, health care premiums have gone up \u2013 it\u2019s true \u2013 but they\u2019ve gone up slower than any time in the last 50 years. So we\u2019re already beginning to see progress. In the meantime, folks out there with insurance, you\u2019re already getting a rebate.\n\nLet me make one last point. Governor Romney says, we should replace it, I\u2019m just going to repeal it, but \u2013 but we can replace it with something. But the problem is, he hasn\u2019t described what exactly we\u2019d replace it with, other than saying we\u2019re going to leave it to the states.\n\nBut the fact of the matter is that some of the prescriptions that he\u2019s offered, like letting you buy insurance across state lines, there\u2019s no indication that that somehow is going to help somebody who\u2019s got a pre-existing condition be able to finally buy insurance. In fact, it\u2019s estimated that by repealing Obamacare, you\u2019re looking at 50 million people losing health insurance\u2026\n\n22:06:24: LEHRER: Let\u2019s\u2026\n\n22:06:25: OBAMA: \u2026 at a time when it\u2019s vitally important.\n\n22:06:26: LEHRER: Let\u2019s let the governor explain what you would do\u2026\n\n22:06:27: ROMNEY: Well\u2026\n\n22:06:28: LEHRER: \u2026 if Obamacare is repealed. How would you replace it?\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:06:33: ROMNEY: Well, actually it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s \u2013 it\u2019s a lengthy description. But, number one, preexisting conditions are covered under my plan. Number two, young people are able to stay on their family plan. That\u2019s already offered in the private marketplace. You don\u2019t have to have the government mandate that for that to occur.\n\nBut let\u2019s come back to something the president and I agree on, which is the key task we have in health care is to get the cost down so it\u2019s more affordable for families. And then he has as a model for doing that a board of people at the government, an unelected board, appointed board, who are going to decide what kind of treatment you ought to have.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\nIn my opinion, the government is not effective in \u2013 in bringing down the cost of almost anything. As a matter of fact, free people and free enterprises trying to find ways to do things better are able to be more effective in bringing down the cost than the government will ever be.\n\nYour example of the Cleveland Clinic is my case in point, along with several others I could describe.\n\nThis is the private market. These are small \u2013 these are enterprises competing with each other, learning how to do better and better jobs. I used to consult to businesses \u2013 excuse me, to hospitals and to health care providers. I was astonished at the creativity and innovation that exists in the American people.\n\nIn order to bring the cost of health care down, we don\u2019t need to have a board of 15 people telling us what kinds of treatments we should have. We instead need to put insurance plans, providers, hospitals, doctors on target such that they have an incentive, as you say, performance pay, for doing an excellent job, for keeping costs down, and that\u2019s happening. Innermountain Healthcare does it superbly well, Mayo Clinic is doing it superbly well, Cleveland Clinic, others.\n\nBut the right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care and start mandating to the providers across America, telling a patient and a doctor what kind of treatment they can have.\n\nThat\u2019s the wrong way to go. The private market and individual responsibility always work best.\n\n22:08:36: OBAMA: Let me just point out first of all this board that we\u2019re talking about can\u2019t make decisions about what treatments are given. That\u2019s explicitly prohibited in the law. But let\u2019s go back to what Governor Romney indicated, that under his plan, he would be able to cover people with preexisting conditions.\n\nWell, actually Governor, that isn\u2019t what your plan does. What your plan does is to duplicate what\u2019s already the law, which says if you are out of health insurance for three months, then you can end up getting continuous coverage and an insurance company can\u2019t deny you if you\u2019ve \u2013 if it\u2019s been under 90 days.\n\nBut that\u2019s already the law and that doesn\u2019t help the millions of people out there with preexisting conditions. There\u2019s a reason why Governor Romney set up the plan that he did in Massachusetts. It wasn\u2019t a government takeover of health care. It was the largest expansion of private insurance. But what it does say is that \u201cinsurers, you\u2019ve got to take everybody.\u201d\n\nNow, that also means that you\u2019ve got more customers. But when \u2013 when Governor Romney says that he\u2019ll replace it with something, but can\u2019t detail how it will be in fact replaced and the reason he set up the system he did in Massachusetts was because there isn\u2019t a better way of dealing with the preexisting conditions problem.\n\nIt just reminds me of, you know, he says that he\u2019s going to close deductions and loopholes for his tax plan. That\u2019s how it\u2019s going to be paid for, but we don\u2019t know the details. He says that he\u2019s going to replace Dodd-Frank, Wall Street reform, but we don\u2019t know exactly which ones. He won\u2019t tell us. He now says he\u2019s going to replace Obamacare and ensure that all the good things that are in it are going to be in there and you don\u2019t have to worry.\n\nAnd at some point, I think the American people have to ask themselves, is the reason that Governor Romney is keeping all these plans to replace secret because they\u2019re too good? Is it \u2013 is it because that somehow middle-class families are going to benefit too much from them?\n\nNo. The reason is, is because, when we reform Wall Street, when we tackle the problem of pre-existing conditions, then, you know, these are tough problems and we\u2019ve got to make choices. And the choices we\u2019ve made have been ones that ultimately are benefiting middle-class families all across the country.\n\n22:11:05: LEHRER: We\u2019re going to move to\u2026\n\n22:11:06: ROMNEY: No. I \u2013 I have to respond to that.\n\n22:11:08: LEHRER: No, but\u2026\n\n22:11:10: ROMNEY: Which is \u2013 which is my experience as a governor is if I come in and \u2013 and lay down a piece of legislation and say, \u201cIt\u2019s my way or the highway,\u201d I don\u2019t get a lot done. What I do is the same way that Tip O\u2019Neill and Ronald Reagan worked together some years ago. When Ronald Reagan ran for office, he laid out the principles that he was going to foster. He said he was going to lower tax rates. He said he was going to broaden the base. You\u2019ve said the same thing, you\u2019re going to simplify the tax code, broaden the base.\n\nThose are my principles. I want to bring down the tax burden on middle-income families. And I\u2019m going to work together with Congress to say, OK, what \u2013 what are the various ways we could bring down deductions, for instance? One way, for instance, would be to have a single number. Make up a number, $25,000, $50,000. Anybody can have deductions up to that amount. And then that number disappears for high-income people. That\u2019s one way one could do it. One could follow Bowles-Simpson as a model and take deduction by deduction and make differences that way. There are alternatives to accomplish the objective I have, which is to bring down rates, broaden the base, simplify the code, and create incentives for growth. And with regards to health care, you had remarkable details with regards to my pre-existing condition plan. You obviously studied up on \u2013 on my plan. In fact, I do have a plan that deals with people with pre-existing conditions. That\u2019s part of my health care plan. And what we did in Massachusetts is a model for the nation state by state. And I said that at that time.\n\nThe federal government taking over health care for the entire nation and whisking aside the 10th Amendment, which gives states the rights for these kinds of things, is not the course for America to have a stronger, more vibrant economy.\n\n22:12:45: LEHRER: That is a terrific segue to our next segment, and is the role of government. And \u2013 and let\u2019s see. Role of government. And it is \u2013 you are first on this, Mr. President. And the question is this. Do you believe, both of you \u2013 but you had the first two minutes on this, Mr. President \u2013 do you believe there\u2019s a fundamental difference between the two of you as to how you view the mission of the federal government?\n\n22:13:14: OBAMA: Well, I definitely think there are differences.\n\n22:13:15: LEHRER: And do you \u2013 yeah.\n\n22:13:16: OBAMA: The first role of the federal government is to keep the American people safe. That\u2019s its most basic function. And as commander-in-chief, that is something that I\u2019ve worked on and thought about every single day that I\u2019ve been in the Oval Office.\n\nBut I also believe that government has the capacity, the federal government has the capacity to help open up opportunity and create ladders of opportunity and to create frameworks where the American people can succeed.\n\nLook, the genius of America is the free enterprise system and freedom and the fact that people can go out there and start a business, work on an idea, make their own decisions.\n\nBut as Abraham Lincoln understood, there are also some things we do better together. So, in the middle of the Civil War, Abraham Lincoln said, let\u2019s help to finance the Transcontinental Railroad, let\u2019s start the National Academy of Sciences, let\u2019s start land grant colleges, because we want to give these gateways of opportunity for all Americans, because if all Americans are getting opportunity, we\u2019re all going to be better off. That doesn\u2019t restrict people\u2019s freedom. That enhances it.\n\nAnd so what I\u2019ve tried to do as president is to apply those same principles.\n\nAnd when it comes to education what I\u2019ve said is we\u2019ve got to reform schools that are not working. We use something called Race to the Top. Wasn\u2019t a top-down approach, Governor. What we\u2019ve said is to states, we\u2019ll give you more money if you initiate reforms. And as a consequence, you had 46 states around the country who have made a real difference.\n\nBut what I\u2019ve also said is let\u2019s hire another 100,000 math and science teachers to make sure we maintain our technological lead and our people are skilled and able to succeed. And hard-pressed states right now can\u2019t all do that. In fact we\u2019ve seen layoffs of hundreds of thousands of teachers over the last several years, and Governor Romney doesn\u2019t think we need more teachers. I do, because I think that that is the kind of investment where the federal government can help.\n\nIt can\u2019t do it all, but it can make a difference. And as a consequence we\u2019ll have a better trained workforce and that will create jobs because companies want to locate in places where we\u2019ve got a skilled workforce.\n\n22:15:40: LEHRER: Two minutes, Governor, on the role of government. Your view?\n\n22:15:43: ROMNEY: Well, first, I love great schools. Massachusetts, our schools are ranked number one of all 50 states. And the key to great schools, great teachers.\n\nSo I reject the idea that I don\u2019t believe in great teachers or more teachers. Every school district, every state should make that decision on their own.\n\nThe role of government: Look behind us. The Constitution and the Declaration of Independence. The role of government is to promote and protect the principles of those documents.\n\nFirst, life and liberty. We have a responsibility to protect the lives and liberties of our people, and that means a military second to none. I do not believe in cutting our military. I believe in maintaining the strength of America\u2019s military.\n\nSecond, in that line that says we are endowed by our creator with our rights, I believe we must maintain our commitment to religious tolerance and freedom in this country. That statement also says that we are endowed by our creator with the right to pursue happiness as we choose. I interpret that as, one, making sure that those people who are less fortunate and can\u2019t care for themselves are cared by \u2013 by one another.\n\nWe\u2019re a nation that believes that we\u2019re all children of the same god and we care for those that have difficulties, those that are elderly and have problems and challenges, those that are disabled. We care for them. And we \u2013 we look for discovery and innovation, all these things desired out of the American heart to provide the pursuit of happiness for our citizens.\n\nBut we also believe in maintaining for individuals the right to pursue their dreams and not to have the government substitute itself for the rights of free individuals. And what we\u2019re seeing right now is, in my view, a \u2013 a trickle-down government approach, which has government thinking it can do a better job than free people pursuing their dreams. And it\u2019s not working.\n\nAnd the proof of that is 23 million people out of work. The proof of that is 1 out of 6 people in poverty. The proof of that is we\u2019ve gone from 32 million on food stamps to 47 million on food stamps. The proof of that is that 50 percent of college graduates this year can\u2019t find work.\n\n22:17:48: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:17:49: ROMNEY: We know that the path we\u2019re taking is not working. It\u2019s time for a new path.\n\n22:17:50: LEHRER: All right. Let\u2019s go through some specifics in terms of what \u2013 how each of you views the role of government. How do \u2013 education. Does the federal government have a responsibility to improve the quality of public education in America?\n\n22:18:03: ROMNEY: Well, the primary responsibility for education is \u2013 is, of course, at the state and local level. But the federal government also can play a very important role. And I \u2013 and I agree with Secretary Arne Duncan, he\u2019s \u2013 some ideas he\u2019s put forward on Race to the Top, not all of them, but some of them I agree with and \u2013 and congratulate him for pursuing that. The federal government can get local and \u2013 and state schools to do a better job.\n\nMy own view, by the way, is I\u2019ve added to that. I happen to believe, I want the kids that are getting federal dollars from IDEA or Title I \u2013 these are disabled kids or \u2013 or \u2013 or poor kids or \u2013 or lower-income kids, rather, I want them to be able to go to the school of their choice.\n\nSo all federal funds, instead of going to the \u2013 to the state or to the school district, I\u2019d have go, if you will, follow the child and let the parent and the child decide where to send their \u2013 their \u2013 their student.\n\n22:18:50: LEHRER: How do you see the federal government\u2019s responsibility to, as I say, to improve the quality of public education in this country?\n\n22:18:57: OBAMA: Well, as I\u2019ve indicated, I think that it has a significant role to play. Through our Race to the Top program, we\u2019ve worked with Republican and Democratic governors to initiate major reforms, and they\u2019re having an impact right now.\n\n22:19:20: LEHRER: Do you think you have a difference with your views and \u2013 and those of Governor Romney on \u2013 about education and the federal government?\n\n22:19:25: OBAMA: You know, this is where budgets matter, because budgets reflect choices. So when Governor Romney indicates that he wants to cut taxes and potentially benefit folks like me and him, and to pay for it we\u2019re having to initiate significant cuts in federal support for education, that makes a difference.\n\nYou know, his \u2013 his running mate, Congressman Ryan, put forward a budget that reflects many of the principles that Governor Romney\u2019s talked about. And it wasn\u2019t very detailed. This seems to be a trend. But \u2013 but what it did do is to \u2013 if you extrapolated how much money we\u2019re talking about, you\u2019d look at cutting the education budget by up to 20 percent.\n\nWhen it comes to community colleges, we are seeing great work done out there all over the country because we have the opportunity to train people for jobs that exist right now. And one of the things I suspect Governor Romney and I probably agree on is getting businesses to work with community colleges so that they\u2019re setting up their training programs\u2026\n\n22:20:20: LEHRER: Do you \u2013 do you agree, Governor?\n\n22:20:21: OBAMA: Let me just finish the point.\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:20:23: OBAMA: The \u2013 where they\u2019re partnering so that they\u2019re designing training programs. And people who are going through them know that there\u2019s a job waiting for them if they complete it. That makes a big difference, but that requires some federal support.\n\nLet me just say one final example. When it comes to making college affordable, whether it\u2019s two-year or four-year, one of the things that I did as president was we were sending $60 billion to banks and lenders as middlemen for the student loan program, even though the loans were guaranteed. So there was no risk for the banks or the lenders, but they were taking billions out of the system.\n\nAnd we said, \u201cWhy not cut out the middleman?\u201d And as a consequence, what we\u2019ve been able to do is to provide millions more students assistance, lower or keep low interest rates on student loans. And this is an example of where our priorities make a difference.\n\nGovernor Romney, I genuinely believe cares about education, but when he tells a student that, you know, \u201cyou should borrow money from your parents to go to college,\u201d you know, that indicates the degree to which, you know, there may not be as much of a focus on the fact that folks like myself, folks like Michelle, kids probably who attend University of Denver, just don\u2019t have that option.\n\nAnd for us to be able to make sure that they\u2019ve got that opportunity and they can walk through that door, that is vitally important not just to those kids. It\u2019s how we\u2019re going to grow this economy over the long term.\n\n22:21:59: LEHRER: We\u2019re running out of time, gentlemen.\n\n(CROSSTALK) LEHRER: Governor?\n\n22:22:05: ROMNEY: Mr. President, Mr. President, you\u2019re entitled as the president to your own airplane and to your own house, but not to your own facts. All right, I\u2019m not going to cut education funding. I don\u2019t have any plan to cut education funding and \u2013 and grants that go to people going to college. I\u2019m planning on (inaudible) to grow. So I\u2019m not planning on making changes there.\n\nBut you make a very good point, which is that the place you put your money just makes a pretty clear indication of where your heart is. You put $90 billion into \u2013 into green jobs. And I \u2013 look, I\u2019m all in favor of green energy. $90 billion, that would have \u2013 that would have hired 2 million teachers. $90 billion.\n\nAnd these businesses, many of them have gone out of business, I think about half of them, of the ones have been invested in have gone out of business. A number of them happened to be owned by people who were contributors to your campaigns.\n\nLook, the right course for America\u2019s government, we were talking about the role of government, is not to become the economic player, picking winners and losers, telling people what kind of health treatment they can receive, taking over the health care system that has existed in this country for a long, long time and has produced the best health records in the world.\n\nThe right answer for government is say, How do we make the private sector become more efficient and more effective? How do we get schools to be more competitive? Let\u2019s grade them. I propose we grade our schools so parents know which schools are succeeding and failing, so they can take their child to a \u2013 to a school that he\u2019s being more successful.\n\nI don\u2019t want to cut our commitment to education. I wanted to make it more effective and efficient. And by the way, I\u2019ve had that experience. I don\u2019t just talk about it. I\u2019ve been there. Massachusetts schools are ranked number one in the nation. This is not because I didn\u2019t have commitment to education. It\u2019s because I care about education for all of our kids.\n\n22:23:49: LEHRER: All right, gentlemen\u2026\n\n(CROSSTALK)\n\n22:23:51: LEHRER: Excuse me (inaudible). Excuse me, sir. We\u2019ve got \u2013 we\u2019ve got \u2013 barely have three minutes left. I\u2019m not going to grade the two of you and say your answers have been too long or I\u2019ve done a poor job.\n\nOBAMA: You\u2019ve done a great job.\n\nLEHRER: Oh, well, no. But the fact is government \u2013 the role of government and governing, we\u2019ve lost a pod in other words. So we only have three \u2013 three minutes left in the \u2013 in the debate before we go to your closing statements. And so I want to ask finally here, and remember, we\u2019ve got three minutes total time here \u2013 and the question is this. Many of the legislative functions of the federal government right now are in a state of paralysis as a result of partisan gridlock. If elected, in your case, if re-elected, in your case, what would you do about that?\n\nGovernor?\n\n22:24:41: ROMNEY: Jim, I had the great experience \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like it at the time \u2013 of being elected in a state where my legislature was 87 percent Democrat. And that meant I figured out from day one I had to get along and I had to work across the aisle to get anything done. We drove our schools to be number one in the nation. We cut taxes 19 times.\n\n22:24:50: LEHRER: But what would you do as president?\n\n22:24:50: ROMNEY: We \u2013 as president, I will sit on day one \u2013 actually, the day after I get elected \u2013 I\u2019ll sit down with leaders \u2013 the Democratic leaders, as well as Republican leaders, and continue \u2013 as we did in my state \u2013 we met every Monday for a couple hours, talked about the issues and the challenges in the \u2013 in the \u2013 in our state in that case. We have to work on a collaborative basis, not because we\u2019re going to compromise our principle, but because there\u2019s common ground.\n\nAnd the challenges America faces right now \u2013 look, the reason I\u2019m in this race is there are people that are really hurting today in this country. And we face \u2013 this deficit could crush the future generations. What\u2019s happening in the Middle East, there are developments around the world that are of real concern.\n\n22:25:53: LEHRER: All right.\n\n22:25:53: ROMNEY: And Republicans and Democrats both love America. But we need to have leadership \u2013 leadership in Washington that will actually bring people together and get the job done and could not care less if \u2013 if it\u2019s a Republican or a Democrat. I\u2019ve done it before. I\u2019ll do it again.\n\n22:25:56: LEHRER: Mr. President?\n\n22:25:57: OBAMA: Well, first of all, I think Governor Romney\u2019s going to have a busy first day, because he\u2019s also going to repeal Obamacare, which will not be very popular among Democrats as you\u2019re sitting down with them.\n\n(LAUGHTER)\n\nBut, look, my philosophy has been, I will take ideas from anybody, Democrat or Republican, as long as they\u2019re advancing the cause of making middle-class families stronger and giving ladders of opportunity to the middle class. That\u2019s how we cut taxes for middle- class families and small businesses. That\u2019s how we cut a trillion dollars of spending that wasn\u2019t advancing that cause. That\u2019s how we signed three trade deals into law that are helping us to double our exports and sell more American products around the world. That\u2019s how we repealed \u201cdon\u2019t ask/don\u2019t tell.\u201d That\u2019s how we ended the war in Iraq, as I promised, and that\u2019s how we\u2019re going to wind down the war in Afghanistan. That\u2019s how we went after Al Qaida and bin Laden.\n\nSo we\u2019ve \u2013 we\u2019ve seen progress even under Republican control of the House of Representatives. But, ultimately, part of being principled, part of being a leader is, A, being able to describe exactly what it is that you intend to do, not just saying, \u201cI\u2019ll sit down,\u201d but you have to have a plan.\n\nNumber two, what\u2019s important is occasionally you\u2019ve got to say no, to \u2013 to \u2013 to folks both in your own party and in the other party. And, you know, yes, have we had some fights between me and the Republicans when \u2013 when they fought back against us reining in the excesses of Wall Street? Absolutely, because that was a fight that needed to be had.\n\nWhen \u2013 when we were fighting about whether or not we were going to make sure that Americans had more security with their health insurance and they said no, yes, that was a fight that we needed to have.\n\nLEHRER: All right\n\nOBAMA: And so part of leadership and governing is both saying what it is that you are for, but also being willing to say no to some things. And I\u2019ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party.\n\n22:27:53: LEHRER: That brings us to closing statements. It was a coin toss. Governor Romney, you won the toss and you elected to go last, so you have a closing two minutes, Mr. President.\n\n22:28:05: OBAMA: Well, Jim, I want to thank you, and I want to thank Governor Romney, because I think was a terrific debate, and I very much appreciate it. And I want to thank the University of Denver.\n\nYou know, four years ago, we were going through a major crisis. And yet my faith and confidence in the American future is undiminished. And the reason is because of its people, because of the woman I met in North Carolina who decided at 55 to go back to school because she wanted to inspire her daughter and now has a job from that new training that she\u2019s gotten; because a company in Minnesota who was willing to give up salaries and perks for their executives to make sure that they didn\u2019t lay off workers during a recession.\n\nThe auto workers that you meet in Toledo or Detroit take such pride in building the best cars in the world, not just because of a paycheck, but because it gives them that sense of pride, that they\u2019re helping to build America. And so the question now is how do we build on those strengths. And everything that I\u2019ve tried to do, and everything that I\u2019m now proposing for the next four years in terms of improving our education system or developing American energy or making sure that we\u2019re closing loopholes for companies that are shipping jobs overseas and focusing on small businesses and companies that are creating jobs here in the United States, or closing our deficit in a responsible, balanced way that allows us to invest in our future.\n\nAll those things are designed to make sure that the American people, their genius, their grit, their determination, is \u2013 is channeled and \u2013 and they have an opportunity to succeed. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair shot. And everybody\u2019s getting a fair share \u2013 everybody\u2019s doing a fair share, and everybody\u2019s playing by the same rules.\n\nYou know, four years ago, I said that I\u2019m not a perfect man and I wouldn\u2019t be a perfect president. And that\u2019s probably a promise that Governor Romney thinks I\u2019ve kept. But I also promised that I\u2019d fight every single day on behalf of the American people, the middle class, and all those who were striving to get into the middle class. I\u2019ve kept that promise and if you\u2019ll vote for me, then I promise I\u2019ll fight just as hard in a second term.\n\n22:30:17: LEHRER: Governor Romney, your two-minute closing.\n\n22:30:18: ROMNEY: Thank you, Jim, and Mr. President. And thank you for tuning in this evening.\n\nThis is a \u2013 this is an important election and I\u2019m concerned about America. I\u2019m concerned about the direction America has been taking over the last four years.\n\nI \u2013 I know this is bigger than an election about the two of us as individuals. It\u2019s bigger than our respective parties. It\u2019s an election about the course of America. What kind of America do you want to have for yourself and for your children.\n\nAnd there really are two very different paths that we began speaking about this evening, and over the course of this month we\u2019re going to have two more presidential debates and a vice presidential debate. We\u2019re talk about those two paths.\n\nBut they lead in very different directions. And it\u2019s not just looking to our words that you have to take in evidence of where they go. You can look at the record.\n\nThere\u2019s no question in my mind that if the president were to be re-elected you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze with incomes going down and prices going up.\n\nI\u2019ll get incomes up again.\n\nYou\u2019ll see chronic unemployment. We\u2019ve had 43 straight months with unemployment above 8 percent.\n\nIf I\u2019m president I will create \u2013 help create 12 million new jobs in this country with rising incomes.\n\nIf the president\u2019s re-elected, Obamacare will be fully installed. In my view that\u2019s going to mean a whole different way of life for people who counted on the insurance plan they had in the past. Many will lose it. You\u2019re going to see health premiums go up by some $2,500 per family.\n\nIf I\u2019m elected we won\u2019t have Obama. We\u2019ll put in place the kind of principles that I put in place in my own state and allow each state to craft their own programs to get people insured and we\u2019ll focus on getting the cost of health care down.\n\nIf the president were to be re-elected you\u2019re going to see a $716 billion cut to Medicare. You\u2019ll have 4 million people who will lose Medicare Advantage. You\u2019ll have hospital and providers that\u2019ll no longer accept Medicare patients.\n\nI\u2019ll restore that $716 billion to Medicare.\n\nAnd finally, military. The president\u2019s re-elected you\u2019ll see dramatic cuts to our military. The secretary of defense has said these would be even devastating.\n\nI will not cut our commitment to our military.
