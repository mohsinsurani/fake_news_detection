Power has never motivated me. What I love is opportunity, and this is a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to do something special, to drive change, to make our schools better.\u201d\n\nMr. Duncan said he intended to reward school districts, charter schools and nonprofit organizations that had demonstrated success at raising student achievement \u0097 \u201cislands of excellence,\u201d he called them. Programs that tie teacher pay to classroom performance will most likely receive money, as will other approaches intended to raise teacher quality, including training efforts that pair novice instructors with veteran mentors, and after-school and weekend tutoring programs.\n\nThe stimulus money will help states avert some, but most likely not all, of the education cutbacks for the 2009-10 school year resulting from state budget shortfalls that currently total some $132 billion. California, for instance, is facing a $41 billion budget shortfall, much of it in school spending, but will receive some $11 billion in education money from the stimulus, estimates the National Education Association, the nation\u2019s largest teachers union.\n\nImage Upon meeting department employees last month, Arne Duncan, the new education secretary, asked them to call him by his first name. \u0093My name is Arne,\u0094 he said. \u0093It\u0092s not Mr. Secretary.\u0094 Credit... Veronika Lukasova for The New York Times\n\nThe positions of deputy secretary, under secretary and chief of staff and dozens of other senior posts at the Education Department remain unfilled, so Mr. Duncan is relying on help from career officers and consultants. He has appointed teams to develop procedures for distributing the stimulus billions quickly, and many aides, he said, have been working evenings and weekends to begin organizing the effort.\n\n\u201cI want all of us to work hard enough and smart enough to take full advantage of this, because it\u2019ll never happen again,\u201d Mr. Duncan said last month in his first speech to hundreds of civil servants at department headquarters, as the outlines of the huge stimulus package were taking shape in Congress.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/16/us/17educ_600.JPG?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/16/us/17educ_600.JPG?year=2009&h=331&w=600&s=8d82ac9b5dfdb55771da23c9d5b08133d355e920ee37d0d79cc0537fb39fb5f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/16/us/17educ_600.JPG?year=2009&h=331&w=600&s=8d82ac9b5dfdb55771da23c9d5b08133d355e920ee37d0d79cc0537fb39fb5f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Dillon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/education/17educ.html", "title": "For Education Secretary, Stimulus Means Dollars and Risk", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Arne Duncan must decide how to disburse $100 billion in emergency aid for schools and colleges.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/education/17educ.html", "type": "article", "title": "For Education Chief, Stimulus Means Power, Money and Risk (Published 2009)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/16/us/17educ_600.JPG?year=2009&h=331&w=600&s=8d82ac9b5dfdb55771da23c9d5b08133d355e920ee37d0d79cc0537fb39fb5f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Arne Duncan, newly appointed secretary of education, at the Office of Postsecondary Education in Washington in January."}, "description": "Arne Duncan must decide how to disburse $100 billion in emergency aid for schools and colleges."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/education/17educ.html", "title": "For Education Chief, Stimulus Means Power, Money and Risk (Published 2009)", "description": "Arne Duncan must decide how to disburse $100 billion in emergency aid for schools and colleges.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/16/us/17educ_600.JPG?year=2009&h=331&w=600&s=8d82ac9b5dfdb55771da23c9d5b08133d355e920ee37d0d79cc0537fb39fb5f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Arne Duncan, newly appointed secretary of education, at the Office of Postsecondary Education in Washington in January."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/fd3be1ad-7010-538e-b49f-b8b92b2022e1"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2009-02-17T01:04:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2009-02-17T05:27:31.000Z", "section": "Education", "tag": "Education Department (US)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 1194837873256, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/fd3be1ad-7010-538e-b49f-b8b92b2022e1", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/92b4bf9ee75a4f2490235c4f18118c29", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2009/02/16/us/17educ_600.JPG?year=2009&h=331&w=600&s=8d82ac9b5dfdb55771da23c9d5b08133d355e920ee37d0d79cc0537fb39fb5f3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Sam Dillon", "news_keywords": ",,Arne Duncan,US Department of Education", "pdate": 20090216, "CG": "education", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/education/17educ.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/fd3be1ad-7010-538e-b49f-b8b92b2022e1", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/education/17educ.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/17/education/17educ.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1234828800.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
