Yet there is no political will to do anything about the situation. Far from being ready to spend more on job creation, both parties agree that it\u2019s time to slash spending \u2014 destroying jobs in the process \u2014 with the only difference being one of degree.\n\nNor is the Federal Reserve riding to the rescue. On Tuesday, Ben Bernanke, the Fed chairman, acknowledged the grimness of the economic picture but indicated that he will do nothing about it.\n\nAnd debt relief for homeowners \u2014 which could have done a lot to promote overall economic recovery \u2014 has simply dropped off the agenda. The existing program for mortgage relief has been a bust, spending only a tiny fraction of the funds allocated, but there seems to be no interest in revamping and restarting the effort.\n\nThe situation is similar in Europe, but arguably even worse. In particular, the European Central Bank\u2019s hard-money, anti-debt-relief rhetoric makes Mr. Bernanke sound like William Jennings Bryan.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "title": "Rule by Rentiers - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | Rule by Rentiers (Published 2011)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?"}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "title": "Opinion | Rule by Rentiers (Published 2011)", "description": "Who benefits from economic stagnation?", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png?year=2011&h=900&w=1600&s=d9d72e75ba28f22953497a79adb4e5064d81d345c3f0f6265e47ea49573bdc7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/8e6fdc62-3b85-5ca8-9def-1013af67476e"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2011-06-10T00:53:28.000Z", "modified_time": "2011-06-10T02:02:28.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Banking and Financial Institutions", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 1248069767691, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/8e6fdc62-3b85-5ca8-9def-1013af67476e", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/10b21616c757489db4dc74ec850a9cc0", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Paul Krugman", "news_keywords": "Debt,US,Economy,Europe,US Economy,Banking and Finance", "pdate": 20110609, "CG": "opinion", "CN": "paul-krugman", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/8e6fdc62-3b85-5ca8-9def-1013af67476e", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/10/opinion/10krugman.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1307660400.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
