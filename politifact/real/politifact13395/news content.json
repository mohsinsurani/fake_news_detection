Choose your plan ArrowRight One of the nine things the Clinton campaign says \u201cevery voter in America needs to know about Donald Trump\u201d is that he would get rid of gun-free zones in schools on his first day in office. Most of the nine items are Trump\u2019s widely-known ideas (Muslim ban, torture, ISIS, etc.), but his proposal to allow guns in schools is less familiar to the public.\n\nThat\u2019s largely because Trump himself hasn\u2019t talked about it much publicly. His campaign, as usual, didn\u2019t respond to our request for more information, and doesn\u2019t seem to have answered other media outlets\u2019 requests, either.\n\nPerhaps Trump is saving the details until his May 20 speech at the National Rifle Association leadership event. (The NRA wants to repeal gun-free zones.) In the meantime, we took a look at the few instances he\u2019s described his plan to see what he intends to do about school gun-free zones.\n\nThe Facts\n\nCongress enacted the Gun-Free School Zones Act in 1990, under President George H. W. Bush, as a part of a larger crime bill, in response to school shootings in the 1980s. It was struck down by the Supreme Court because of violations under the Commerce Clause but was reenacted under President Bill Clinton with a list of exceptions supported by the NRA.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe law makes it illegal under federal law for people to carry or discharge a firearm in a school zone, but states can decide whether to allow concealed carry at K-12 schools or colleges. Most states prohibit concealed carry. There is a dispute between gun-rights and gun-control advocates as to whether the law enacted to prevent shootings on school grounds actually motivates people to target schools, since the victims would be unarmed. (We plan to explore this in a future fact-check.)\n\nAfter the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School, states began introducing legislation to arm teachers and staff at K-12 schools. In 2013 alone, at least 33 states introduced more than 80 bills to authorize school districts to allow certain teachers and staff to carry concealed firearms, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Since 2013, more states have considered laws allowing guns on college campuses.\n\nThat year, seven bills were signed into law allowing limited concealed carry with a permit at K-12 schools (mostly applicable to private schools). Some states have specific exemptions for guns in school zones with a concealed-carry permit, such as guns carried by security or law enforcement or unloaded firearms locked in a vehicle on school property.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump has argued against gun-free zones at military bases since last October, but he has been less vocal about repealing gun-free zones at schools.\n\nThe one time he talked about it publicly was at a January 2016 rally in Vermont: \u201cI will get rid of gun-free zones on schools \u2014 you have to \u2014 and on military bases. My first day, it gets signed, okay? My first day. There\u2019s no more gun-free zones.\u201d His campaign did not respond to requests by the media to clarify his proposal.\n\nOur colleague Jenna Johnson reported at the time that the proposal \u201craises a number of questions, such as: Would this apply to all public schools, from elementary to college? How would schools deal with the likely logistical and safety concerns created by having guns on the grounds?\u201d\n\nTrump was asked similar questions a few weeks later during an interview with the Outdoor Channel. This seems to be one of the only times he was ever asked directly about his proposal: How would you mandate that legislation? By executive order? Since public schools are legislated by the states, how could you make such an order stick? Would this legislation apply just to public schools, or private as well?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump\u2019s answer was still devoid of specifics:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to get rid of the gun-free zones on the military bases. I\u2019m also going to do it in schools. You say you have a school, and it\u2019s gun-free. The criminals are out there saying, \u2018This is incredible. This is perfect. There\u2019s no guns in there. I\u2019m the only one that\u2019s going to have guns.\u2019 You can\u2019t do it. I\u2019m going to work with the states, and if I have to, I\u2019m going to try and perhaps override the states if I have to, if I\u2019m allowed to do that. . . . But we can\u2019t have gun-free zones where, I see schools advertise, \u2018We are a gun-free zone.\u2019 And then you have these crazy people out there saying, \u2018Boy, this is the most incredible thing,\u2019 and that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\nThe Pinocchio Test\n\nTrump hasn\u2019t offered many details of his proposal, but it is clear that he wants to force states to allow guns in schools. Would he propose that Congress repeal the federal ban? Would it become illegal for states to pass laws to prohibit concealed carry at schools? The specifics aren\u2019t clear yet.\n\nTrump said he would \u201cwork with the states\u201d but that he would \u201coverride the states if I have to.\u201d Based on what he has said publicly so far, Trump indeed would force schools to allow guns. And he wants to make it happen on his first day as president.\n\nThe Geppetto Checkmark\n\nSend us facts to check by filling out this form\n\nCheck out our 2016 candidates fact-check page\n\nSign up for The Fact Checker weekly newsletter\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/AFP_A920J.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/AFP_A920J.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Ye Hee Lee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/18/clinton-campaigns-claim-that-trump-would-force-schools-to-allow-guns-in-classrooms/", "title": "Clinton campaign\u2019s claim that Trump would \u2018force schools to allow guns in classrooms\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "We look into what exactly Donald Trump has said about getting rid of gun-free zones in schools.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/18/clinton-campaigns-claim-that-trump-would-force-schools-to-allow-guns-in-classrooms/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2016/05/05/Editorial-Opinion/Images/AFP_A920J.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Analysis | Clinton campaign\u2019s claim that Trump would \u2018force schools to allow guns in classrooms\u2019", "description": "We look into what exactly Donald Trump has said about getting rid of gun-free zones in schools."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analysis | Clinton campaign\u2019s claim that Trump would \u2018force schools to allow guns in classrooms\u2019", "description": "We look into what exactly Donald Trump has said about getting rid of gun-free zones in schools."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-12-07T04:57:52.217Z", "article": {"published_time": "2016-05-18T07:00:24.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-12-07T04:57:52.217Z", "section": "Fact Checker", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 70, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/fact-checker/wp/2016/05/18/clinton-campaigns-claim-that-trump-would-force-schools-to-allow-guns-in-classrooms/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1463526000.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
