{"url": "http://www.nbcnews.com/politics/first-read/impeachment-talk-becomes-cynical-game-n168436", "text": "Impeachment talk becomes a cynical game\n\nOn Friday, a top White House aide said it was possible Republicans could impeach President Obama if he decided to take executive action on immigration. Days later, on Tuesday, House Speaker John Boehner fired back at this impeachment chatter: \u201cListen, it\u2019s all a scam started by Democrats at the White House.\u201d But let\u2019s be honest here: Both sides -- Democrats and Republicans -- believe the impeachment talk is good for motivating their base. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee says it\u2019s raked in more than $3 million in online donations since Thursday with solicitations like this one from House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (\u201cBoehner is planning a vote to sue the president. The House of Representatives has never sued a sitting President in all of U.S. history. And if they do it, impeachment may very well be the next step\u201d). Democrats also hope the impeachment talk can force a replay of 1998, when the impeachment proceedings against Bill Clinton backfired against the GOP that midterm season. As for Boehner and House Republicans, they\u2019re being disingenuous, too. The GOP base loves the impeachment talk (see Sarah Palin, Allen West, Drudge, and the rhetoric from some sitting House members). Indeed, Boehner\u2019s lawsuit seems intended to tap into that conservative impeachment enthusiasm -- but without going all the way to impeachment. It\u2019s impeachment-lite. The House will vote tonight on that lawsuit against the president, per NBC\u2019s Frank Thorp.\n\nAnd it\u2019s beneath the White House and the speaker\n\nSo both sides are playing this cynical game, turning the midterms into a base election that will be decided by who best motivates their base rather than by trying to fix the country\u2019s problems. (Republicans: \u201cThis President is breaking the law!\u201d Democrats: \u201cThey want to impeach the president!\u201d) And what\u2019s particularly jarring is that this isn\u2019t taking place on the campaign trail -- but rather from their official capacities at the White House and on Capitol Hill. It\u2019s beneath the White House, and it\u2019s beneath the speaker. And each side can rationalize their actions all they want, but all its doing is reinforcing the decision by MILLIONS of Americans who have chosen not to participate in the political process this year that they made the right decision. The leaders in both parties aren\u2019t taking their frustrations seriously. Instead, leaders in Washington are falling back on base turnout gimmicks.\n\nA Tale of Two Bills\n\nDespite that cynical game of impeachment talk, here is a GOOD story to tell about Washington from earlier in the week: Democrats and Republicans came together to strike a deal on reforming American\u2019s embattled VA hospital system. And what happened was an ACTUAL compromise -- where both sides gave up something to get something. Democrats got increased funding for VA hospitals; Republicans got additional flexibility for veterans to get private care. So that\u2019s on track to become law before Congress departs on its August recess. And a big reason why is that Democrats and Republicans couldn\u2019t afford to look like they were alienating a key constituency -- veterans. And that\u2019s maybe the biggest difference between VA reform (which looks like it will become law) and the emergency relief at the border (which doesn\u2019t). In the case of the border, there just isn\u2019t a major constituency that puts fear into BOTH parties.\n\nHouse GOP \u201ccautiously optimistic\u201d about ability to get 218 votes for border bill\n\nAs for the House GOP\u2019s $659 million border bill, NBC\u2019s Frank Thorp reports that House GOP aides are \u201ccautiously optimistic that the border supplemental can pass with Republican votes, and expect a handful of moderate Democrats to support the measure as well. Leadership is still in the process of whipping the bill, going from member to member during votes trying to quell any concerns they may have. But it was clear that leadership was trying to nip conservative's concerns in the bud Tuesday when Boehner released a statement unequivocally stating that if the Senate tried to add the Gang of Eight comprehensive immigration reform bill to the supplemental, it would hit a \u2018brick wall\u2019 in the House.\u201d Then again, it\u2019s truly remarkable that the House GOP leadership has to fight tooth and nail for a bill that has ZERO chance of becoming reality. To expend political capital internally to make a point, welcome to Washington, circa 2014.\n\nLatest on the Highway Trust Fund standoff\n\nMeanwhile, here\u2019s the latest on the Highway Trust Fund legislation: \u201cThe Senate Tuesday approved a short-term patch to keep funds flowing to highway projects through Dec. 19, but Speaker John A. Boehner has already promised to strip the Senate provisions and send the House-passed bill right back,\u201d Roll Call reports. \u201cAfter the Senate\u2019s version of the bill passed 79 to 18 \u2014 Finance Committee ranking member Orrin Hatch, R-Utah called it a \u2018free vote\u2026because the House is going to send this right back, they are going to strip everything out \u2014 after they\u2019ve left\u2019 for the August recess.\u201d So just when it looked like Congress would AVOID a highway trust fund \u201ccliff\u201d of sorts, the threat is back. And this is Senate vs. House stuff -- not necessarily, GOP vs Dem business.\n\nEconomy grew by 4% in 2nd quarter\n\nMore good economic news: \u201cAfter a dismal winter, the U.S. economy sprang back to life in the April-June quarter, growing at a fast 4 percent annual rate on the strength of higher consumer and business spending,\u201d the AP says. \u201cThe Commerce Department says the second-quarter rebound followed a sharp 2.1 percent annualized drop in economic activity in the January-March quarter. That figure was revised up from a previous estimate of a 2.9 percent decline.\u201d\n\nTom Steyer\u2019s TV campaign begins -- against Joni Ernst in Iowa\n\nThe millions of dollars in TV ads that liberal environmentalist Tom Steyer plans to spend in the midterms is beginning -- with the release of NextGen Climate\u2019s multi-million-dollar campaign in Iowa against GOP Senate nominee Joni Ernst. This new TV ad charges that Ernst is tied to Republican special interests. NextGen Climate says this is the first of a series in ads hitting Ernst, and it\u2019s a $2.6 million buy over five weeks in Des Moines, Cedar Rapids, and the Quad Cities markets. A little background on Steyer\u2019s involvement this midterm cycle: A Super PAC funded by Democratic environmentalist billionaire Tom Steyer has announced it will spend as much as $100 million this election season attacking Republicans in seven key states who it says are climate-science \u2018deniers,\u2019 elevating the issue of climate change in these contests. Steyer\u2019s group, NextGen Climate, says it will target Govs. Rick Scott of Florida, Paul LePage of Maine and Tom Corbett of Pennsylvania, as well as GOP Senate candidates Cory Gardner in Colorado, Joni Ernst in Iowa, Terri Lynn Land in Michigan and Scott Brown in New Hampshire.\n\nPoll: Kasich still leading in Ohio\n\nA new Quinnipiac poll finds Ohio Gov. John Kasich (R) leading Democratic challenger Ed Fitzgerald by 12 points among registered voters in Ohio\u2019s gubernatorial race, 48%-36%. Of all the 2010 GOP victors, it\u2019s mildly surprising that Kasich now among safer of these incumbents sitting in a swing state. He\u2019s still not out of the woods, but he\u2019s stronger today than any strategist in either party would have thought two years ago.\n\nDueling coal ads in West Virginia\n\nDays after Natalie Tennant (D) released a new TV ad in West Virginia\u2019s Senate race hitting her party\u2019s own president on coal, Republican opponent Shelley Moore Capito is out with her own TV ad on coal -- and trying to one up Tennant. Capito responded immediately, and doesn\u2019t seem to be taking any chances here\n\nThe bombshell in the Bob McDonnell trial\n\nIf you followed former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell\u2019s rise and fall -- like we have over the past five years -- this was a stunning story. And talk about a twist: \u201cLawyers for former Virginia first lady Maureen McDonnell say her marriage had broken down by the time a former CEO began to lavish gifts on her -- and he became her \u2018favorite playmate.\u2019 The bombshell was revealed Tuesday during opening statements in a corruption trial against Maureen and her husband, former Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell,\u201d NBC Washington\u2019s Julie Carey reported. More: \u201cThe couple arrived separately at federal court over the past two days, a sharp contrast to the united front they showed when they were indicted 10 days after he left office in January. Before the trial, they often held hands in the courthouse. Maureen's defense attorney, Bill Burck, said during opening statements Tuesday that not only was the couple's marriage a wreck, but that Maureen developed feelings for Williams as he took her on a designer clothes shopping trip and showered her with attention. \u2018You'd even hear she had a crush on on him. Unfortunately, unlike the other man in her life, Jonnie Williams paid attention to her,\u2019 Burck said.\u201d Here\u2019s what\u2019s particularly stunning: The defense is trying to PROVE a romantic relationship; usually, it\u2019s the other way around.\n\nClick here to sign up for First Read emails.
