Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, speaks in a ceremony in Iran's nuclear enrichment facility in Natanz in 300 kms 186 (miles) south of capital Tehran, Iran, Monday April, 9, 2007. President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said at a ceremony at the enrichment facility at Natanz, Monday, that Iran was now capable of enriching nuclear fuel \"on an industrial scale.\" Asked if Iran has begun injecting uranium gas into 3,000 centrifuges for enrichment, top nuclear negotiator Ali Larijani replied, \"Yes.\" He did not elaborate, but it was the first confirmation that Iran had installed the larger set of centrifuges after months of saying it intends to do so.

A building collapsed and they said that 3,000 people had been killed but never published their names,\" Ahmadinejad told Iranians in the holy city of Qom.\n\nUnder this pretext, the U.S. \"attacked Afghanistan and Iraq and since then a million people have been killed only in Iraq,\" Ahmadinejad said in the speech broadcast live on state-run television.\n\nOn the last anniversary of the attacks, the names of 2,750 victims killed in New York were read aloud at a memorial ceremony.\n\nIn Washington, the State Department rejected the comments out of hand, calling them \"another example of misinformed misguided rhetoric\" from the Iranian leader.\n\n\"I am not sure what one says about a statement like that,\" spokesman Sean McCormack told reporters. \"It leaves one speechless. It is misguided, misinformed rhetoric. I can't tell you whether or not it is something he truly believes or if this is just a warped attempt to try to shape public opinion in Iran or elsewhere.\"\n\nLast year, Ahmadinejad raised questions over the attacks, saying \"what caused it, what were the conditions that led to it, who truly was involved\" needed to be examined.\n\nAhmadinejad has said the attacks were a result of \"mismanaging and inhumane managing of the world by the U.S.\" and should not be turned into another Holocaust \"used for slaughtering people.\"\n\nAlthough Iran has condemned the U.S. invasions of Afghanistan and Iraq, the campaigns toppled the Taliban and Saddam Hussein, two regional threats to Iran.\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/corner-bot_right.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/font-md_off.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/icons/icon-arrow-up.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/loading.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/images/Site/abc_default_image_mc.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://ad.doubleclick.net/ad/N2581.ABC/B2640977.3;sz=1x1;MediaCode=W15GL;ord=2008.04.20.20.25.34", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/images/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/ap_vice_police_080416_mc.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/icons/icon-podcast_sm.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/logo-abcnews_23_08.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/icons/icon-rss_sm.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/apg_ahmadinejad_071203_mn.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/corner-top_left.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/corner-top_right.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/icons/icon-arrow-down.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/icons/icon-mobile_sm.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/spacer.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/icons/icon-email_sm.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://ads.pointroll.com/PortalServe/?pid=599823Q73720080408191956&pos=i&r=2008.04.20.20.25.34", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://rsi.abcnews.go.com/I04470/a3/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/0/noscript.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://adsatt.abcnews.starwave.com/ad/sponsors/AARP/Apr_2008/aarp-322x70-0002.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/font-lg_off.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/corner-bot_left.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://adsatt.abcnews.starwave.com/ad/sponsors/ABCNews_House/Apr_2008/abcn-322x70-0062.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/assets/images/font-sm_off.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20080421032535im_/http://a.abcnews.com/images/International/apg_ahmadinejad_071203_mn.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News", "The Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "", "title": "11 Pretext For Afghanistan and Iraq Invasions", "meta_data": {"Date": "2008-04-16", "Last-Modified": "2008-04-16 08:24:52", "robots": "index, follow", "author": "ABC News", "Copyright": "Copyright (c) 2008 ABC News Internet Ventures", "description": "Iran's President: 9/11 Pretext For Afghanistan and Iraq Invasions", "keywords": "world news, abc world news, world news online, world news, abcnews, abc news, abcnews online, abc news online,  international news, foreign news,  online news,"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
