And we already know what his campaign will be about: faith in miracles.\n\nSome of these miracles will involve things that you\u2019re liable to read in the Bible. But if he wins the Republican nomination, his campaign will probably center on a more secular theme: the alleged economic miracle in Texas, which, it\u2019s often asserted, sailed through the Great Recession almost unscathed thanks to conservative economic policies. And Mr. Perry will claim that he can restore prosperity to America by applying the same policies at a national level.\n\nSo what you need to know is that the Texas miracle is a myth, and more broadly that Texan experience offers no useful lessons on how to restore national full employment.\n\nIt\u2019s true that Texas entered recession a bit later than the rest of America, mainly because the state\u2019s still energy-heavy economy was buoyed by high oil prices through the first half of 2008. Also, Texas was spared the worst of the housing crisis, partly because it turns out to have surprisingly strict regulation of mortgage lending.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2010/09/16/opinion/Krugman_New/Krugman_New-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-thumbLarge.png"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Krugman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/the-texas-unmiracle.html", "title": "The Texas Unmiracle - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Rick Perry will likely campaign on claims of an economic miracle in Texas, but the miracle is a myth.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/the-texas-unmiracle.html", "type": "article", "title": "Opinion | The Texas Unmiracle (Published 2011)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "description": "Rick Perry will likely campaign on claims of an economic miracle in Texas, but the miracle is a myth."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/the-texas-unmiracle.html", "title": "Opinion | The Texas Unmiracle (Published 2011)", "description": "Rick Perry will likely campaign on claims of an economic miracle in Texas, but the miracle is a myth.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.png?year=2011&h=900&w=1600&s=d9d72e75ba28f22953497a79adb4e5064d81d345c3f0f6265e47ea49573bdc7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/be1e6c0d-8ee6-5339-9bb9-b83e0a0fd5cc"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2011-08-15T02:29:39.000Z", "modified_time": "2011-08-24T22:53:14.000Z", "section": "Opinion", "tag": "Recession and Depression", "opinion": "true", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000000999166, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/be1e6c0d-8ee6-5339-9bb9-b83e0a0fd5cc", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/d811dc223277403da0a7a5f42b9f0b32", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/04/02/opinion/paul-krugman/paul-krugman-facebookJumbo.png?year=2011&h=550&w=1050&s=85aea4ae9a4a01612b0077f6ce77e9faee119301c3f2f52abc5e343c5fc4e376&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Paul Krugman", "news_keywords": "2012 Presidential Election,Economy,Rick Perry,Texas,Population,Unemployment,Recession and Depression", "pdate": 20110814, "CG": "opinion", "CN": "paul-krugman", "PT": "article", "PST": "Op-Ed", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/the-texas-unmiracle.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/be1e6c0d-8ee6-5339-9bb9-b83e0a0fd5cc", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/the-texas-unmiracle.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2011/08/15/opinion/the-texas-unmiracle.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1313362800.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
