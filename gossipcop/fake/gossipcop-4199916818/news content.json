She expanded her family \u2014 her dog family, that is. Her two Italian greyhounds, Norman and Bambi, had surprise babies!\n\n\u201cMy babies had babies!\u201d she gushed. \u201cCan\u2019t you handle how cute little Harlie and Rosie are?!\u201d\n\nJenner also hit a few milestones in her professional life, starting with the creation of The Kylie Shop (\u201cCreating my own merch was a dream come true for me!\u201d) and her booming cosmetics company. But of all her Kylie Cosmetics creations, she\u2019s most proud of her special-edition lip kit with Smile Train, a non-profit organization that provides support and corrective surgery for children in developing countries with the birth condition.\n\n\u201cI donated 100 percent of the net proceeds from my Smile Lip Kit to Smile Train, which provides cleft surgery for children in the developing world,\u201d she said. \u201cPresenting them with the check was big moment for me!\u201d\n\nOf course, several of the reality star\u2019s favorite moments were style- and beauty-related, starting with going blonde for New York Fashion Week, a process which \u201ctook a couple of days\u201d but was \u201cso worth it.\u201d There was also the 2017 Met Ball, which she \u201cstill can\u2019t believe\u201d she attended with Donatella Versace. (In case you were curious, her custom sheer Atelier Versace dress with floral embellishment and beaded fringe was another \u201cdream come true.\u201d)\n\nFROM PEN: Rose Byrne Reveals the \u2018Rolls-Royce of Spanx\u2019 She Wore to the Met Gala\n\nAnd while every day is basically a photo shoot in the Life of Kylie, her two favorites were her 2017 calendar shoot with Terry Richardson (something she\u2019d been wanting to do \u201cforever\u201d) and her Barbie-themed Flaunt magazine shoot.\n\nLast but not least, one of King Kylie\u2019s favorite memories (and ours, too!) were the two times she impersonated a vintage Christina Aguilera \u2014 and nailed it.\n\n\u201cChristina Aguilera loved my \u2018Dirrty\u2019 Halloween costume so much, she asked me to do it again for her birthday in December!\u201d she said. \u201cHow could I say no to Xtina?\u201d", "images":
