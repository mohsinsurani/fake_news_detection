However, HollywoodLife has learned EXCLUSIVELY that there\u2019s a reason he\u2019s pushing so hard to keep up with the demanding lifestyle. \u201cJohnny\u2019s 55th birthday is this Saturday [June 9] and, like most of us, he doesn\u2019t like getting older,\u201d a source close to the actor tells us EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cHe is accustomed to being adored and has been named Sexiest Man Alive twice, so he likes doing the rockstar thing and living the life he\u2019s always led because he doesn\u2019t feel 55 or want to be 55.\u201d\n\nOur insider says this desire to live the life of an ultimate rockstar may have contributed to the skinny, gaunt look Johnny recently debuted, which has fans concerned about his health. \u201cHe wants to be forever young, so he is doing things that make him feel young,\u201d our source adds. \u201cSo what we might be seeing is the start of a little bit of a mid-life crisis for him.\u201d As we previously reported EXCLUSIVELY, Johnny is totally unbothered by all the talk surrounding his appearance, as it\u2019s the exact look he\u2019s going for as the frontman of his band.\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped those close to him from worrying about the effect this rock \u2018n roll lifestyle will have on his health and well-being. \u201cHe\u2019s partying hard,\u201d another source previously told us. \u201cWhen Johnny\u2019s single, he doesn\u2019t have anyone to reign him in, and he can get pretty wild when let to his own devices.\u201d", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/johnny-depp-old-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_13020901c.jpg?w=440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/shutterstock_editorial_13020901i.jpg?w=440", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/johnny-depp-1.jpg?w=289", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/johnny-depp-old-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TSDGIGI_VW013.jpg?w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/johnny-depp-old-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Katherine Speller", "Roya Backlund", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/05/johnny-depp-aging-appearance-mid-life-crisis/", "title": "Johnny Depp Concerned About Aging: He\u2019s Having A Mid-Life Crisis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Johnny Depp wants to stay forever young and is concerned about aging as she approaches his 55th birthday, HollywoodLife has learned.", "news_keywords": "Johnny Depp", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/05/johnny-depp-aging-appearance-mid-life-crisis/?ia_markup=1"}, "author": "Alyssa Norwin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Johnny Depp Concerned About Aging: He\u2019s Having A Mid-Life Crisis", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/05/johnny-depp-aging-appearance-mid-life-crisis/", "description": "Ahead of his 55th birthday, Johnny Depp more determined than ever to maintain his youth.
