Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith\u2019s 20-plus years of marriage have outlasted many Hollywood relationships. The couple seem as though they have figured out the magic formula to keeping the spark alive \u2014 even if they had to address rumors throughout their decades together.\n\nThe actor met the Red Table Talk cohost when she auditioned to play his girlfriend on The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air. Pinkett Smith did not get the role \u2014 Nia Long ended up playing the part \u2014 but the two later struck up a romantic relationship.\n\nSmith and Pinkett Smith tied the knot in December 1997. They went on to welcome son Jaden in July 1998 and daughter Willow in October 2000.\n\nPrior to his marriage to the actress, the Bad Boys for Life star wed Sheree Zampino in May 1992. The pair\u2019s son, Trey, arrived in November 1992. Smith and the Hollywood Exes alum divorced in 1995.\n\n\u201cDivorce was the worst thing in my adult life,\u201d Smith admitted during a June 2020 episode of Red Table Talk. \u201cDivorce was the ultimate failure for me. I\u2019ve been hurt a lot in my adult life, but I don\u2019t think anything touches the failure of getting divorced from my 2-year-old son\u2019s mother.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar nominee\u2019s split from Zampino seemingly informed his approach to marriage with Pinkett Smith, as they have repeatedly made clear divorce has never been an option for them.\n\nMeanwhile, the Maryland native addressed how important self-love is in a relationship too. \u201cWithout personal power/self love [sic], there is no foundation to build love for someone else because it\u2019s the power needed to dissolve the ego which is our greatest obstacle to truly loving anyone,\u201d she wrote on Instagram in February 2019. \u201cWithout self love [sic], all one has is their ego which gives a false sense of personal power through its brutal and unkind nature. The ego will never fail to strangle the love out of one\u2019s heart if we allow it to take center stage in our relationships.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cTransferring our trust to our hearts from our egos is a painful process in learning HOW to love. BUT \u2026 through it all \u2026 when we finally get to the place where we can give and receive love in its most pure state \u2026 ego free \u2026 it is only ever \u2026 beauty.\u201d\n\nIn March 2022, Smith came under fire after he slapped Chris Rock across the face at the 94th annual Academy Awards after the comedian cracked a joke about Pinkett Smith\u2019s hair loss. (She has spoken extensively about battling alopecia.) While he faced repercussions for his actions \u2014 the King Richard star was subsequently banned from all Academy of Motion Pictures, Arts and Sciences events for 10 years \u2014 his wife has stood by his side, breaking her silence in a June 2022 episode of Red Table Talk.\n\n\u201cUntil [Will and Chris reconcile], Will and I are continuing to do what we have done for the last 28 years, and that\u2019s keep figuring out this thing called life together,\u201d she said.\n\nScroll through to see what Smith and Pinkett Smith have said about their marriage through the years.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Why-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-Thinks-Its-Hard-to-Have-a-Good-Sex-Life.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/will-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-landing.jpg?w=1600&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Why-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-Thinks-Its-Hard-to-Have-a-Good-Sex-Life.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz-Stanton", "Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/everything-will-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-have-said-about-marriage/", "title": "Everything Will Smith, Jada Pinkett Smith Have Said About Marriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "gallery", "post-tags": "Better2Gether,celebrity news,News", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have said many things throughout their 20-plus year marriage \u2014 check out their best quotes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Will Smith: Jada Had \u2018Nothing to Do With\u2019 My Decision to Slap Chris Rock", "description": "Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have said many things throughout their 20-plus year marriage \u2014 check out their best quotes", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/everything-will-smith-jada-pinkett-smith-have-said-about-marriage/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2022-07-29T15:13:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Why-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-Thinks-Its-Hard-to-Have-a-Good-Sex-Life.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Why-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-Thinks-Its-Hard-to-Have-a-Good-Sex-Life.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2022-07-29T15:12:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-07-29T15:13:08+00:00"}, "author": "Leanne Aciz-Stanton", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Will Smith: Jada Had \u2018Nothing to Do With\u2019 My Decision to Slap Chris Rock", "description": "Will Smith and Jada Pinkett Smith have said many things throughout their 20-plus year marriage \u2014 check out their best quotes", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Why-Jada-Pinkett-Smith-Thinks-Its-Hard-to-Have-a-Good-Sex-Life.jpg?crop=0px%2C16px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1659107573.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
