The grand staircase Swimming pool Gymnasium Third-class dining Turkish bath Plans for the Titanic II\n\nTitanic II is set to launch in less than two years \u2014 not in movie theaters, but on the open sea.\n\nA replica of the world\u2019s most famous \u201cunsinkable\u201d ship \u2014 which struck an iceberg and sank on its maiden voyage on April 15, 1912, killing 1,503 people \u2014 is under construction, with a maiden voyage planned for 2018.\n\nAustralian tycoon and politician Clive Palmer \u2014 not J. Bruce Ismay \u2014 is at the helm of the ambitious project to faithfully recreate the luxury ship, which will be about 13 feet wider to meet current regulations.\n\nMore importantly, it will carry enough lifeboats for every passenger and its hull will be welded, not riveted, just in case it comes across a rogue iceberg, the Belfast Telegraph reports.\n\n\u201cThe new Titanic will of course have modern evacuation procedures, satellite controls, digital navigation and radar systems and all those things you\u2019d expect on a 21st-century ship,\u201d James McDonald, global marketing director of Palmer\u2019s company, Blue Star Line, told the paper.\n\nThe new nine-deck ship will be 885 feet long, about two more than her doomed predecessor, 174 feet high and have a maximum speed of 24 knots. She will accommodate 2,400 passengers \u2014 177 more than the RMS Titanic.\n\nIt also will feature the same categories of passengers \u2014 from the first-class movers and shakers to the hoi polloi in third class, where poor Leonardo DiCaprio was berthed in the classic movie.\n\nUnlike the Belfast-built original, the Titanic II is under construction by the CSC Jinling Shipyard in Jiangsu, China.\n\nIts maiden voyage will not be from Southampton to New York, but rather from Jiangsu, China, to Dubai in the United Arab Emirates, the paper reported.\n\nSome of the dead passengers\u2019 relatives have criticized the plans for a new Titanic, but Blue Star has reportedly been flooded with requests for tickets \u2014 with some offering up to about $900,000 for a spot on the first trip.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanic_ii_grand_staircase.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanic_ii_gymnasium.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanic_ii_third_class_dining.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanic_ii_turkish_bath.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/gone-wrong1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/EP.-6-wp-thumb_NEW-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanic_ii_new_york_harbour.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/jaff11.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanicindex.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/mcdtita_fe016.jpg?quality=100&strip=all&w=300", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/Mia-Thornton7-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/chloe-grace-moretz-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/jaff05.jpg?quality=100&strip=all&w=300", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/monopoly.png?w=260", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ron-DeSantis-Ana-Navarro.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanic_ii_exterior_a.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanic_ii_swimming_pool.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=878"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/02/titanicindex.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Warzer Jaff", "Social Links For Yaron Steinbuch", "Contact The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2016/02/10/titanic-ii-to-set-sail-in-2018-for-people-who-arent-superstitious-at-all/", "title": "Titanic II to set sail in 2018 for people who aren\u2019t superstitious at all", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
