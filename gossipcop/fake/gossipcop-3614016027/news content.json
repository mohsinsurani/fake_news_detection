What happened to your promise to fight for them?\u201d Jenner tweeted.\n\nJenner quoted a June 2016 Trump tweet where he thanked the LGBT community and said he will \u201cfight for you while Hillary brings in more people that will threaten your freedoms and beliefs.\u201d\n\nThere are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us.

He said he made the decision after consulting with \u201cgenerals and military experts.\u201d\n\nLast year, the Obama administration lifted the previous ban, allowing transgender troops to serve openly.\n\n\u201cAfter consultation with my Generals and military experts, please be advised that the United States Government will not accept or allow Transgender individuals to serve in any capacity in the U.S. Military,\" Trump tweeted.\n\n\"Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory and cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail. Thank you,\" he added.\n\nJenner, who voted for President Trump, has previously said that though she backs the GOP, she will \u201ccome after\u201d anyone who does not support LGBT rights.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10314615&c3=&c4=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/343915-caitlyn-jenner-to-trump-what-happened-to-your-promise-to-fight&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-51dZx4IkAE4Zk.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpjenner_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_small_article/public/trumpjenner_0.png?itok=Lrdf4QOz", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-big.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpjenner_0.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/343915-caitlyn-jenner-to-trump-what-happened-to-your-promise-to-fight", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Trump: What happened to your promise to fight for LGBT Americans?", "meta_data": {"Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Aida Chavez", "keywords": ",,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "app_id": 566538590082898, "pages": 7533944086}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Trump: What happened to your promise to fight for LGBT Americans?", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/343915-caitlyn-jenner-to-trump-what-happened-to-your-promise-to-fight", "updated_time": "2017-07-26T14:20:28-04:00", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/trumpjenner_0.png"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Trump: What happened to your promise to fight for LGBT Americans?", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170729082536im_/http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/343915-caitlyn-jenner-to-trump-what-happened-to-your-promise-to-fight", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-26T13:20:19-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-07-26T14:20:28-04:00"}, "dcterms.title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Trump: What happened to your promise to fight for LGBT Americans?", "dcterms.creator": "Aida Chavez", "dcterms.date": "2017-07-26T13:20-04:00", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/343915-caitlyn-jenner-to-trump-what-happened-to-your-promise-to-fight", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501089619.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
