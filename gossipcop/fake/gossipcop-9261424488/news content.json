Jennifer Aniston Spotted in NYC for First Time Since Justin Theroux Split\n\nAniston and Theroux announced their split after two years of marriage in February. A week later, a source told ET that the actress was enjoying the single life for the time being. \"She won't fall in love anytime soon,\" the source revealed. \"All her friends are around her. That is the best supportive group.\"\n\nTheroux, meanwhile, cleared his head after the breakup by hitting the gym and traveling the world. He was spotted enjoying the company of friends, including Emma Stone and Sienna Miller, in Cannes, France, in May. He even sparked romance rumors with Spider-Man: Homecoming star Laura Harrier, though a source told ET at the time that he wasn't jumping into another romance.\n\n\u201cJustin is not in a relationship,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s super social and loves meeting new people and collaborating on ideas with friends.
