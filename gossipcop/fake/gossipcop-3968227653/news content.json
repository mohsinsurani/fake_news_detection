{"url": "people.com/tv/khloe-kardashian-probably-wont-leave-tristan-thompson/", "text": "As they prepare to welcome a child together in the wake of ongoing cheating allegations, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson\u2018s future together is unclear.\n\n\u201cThis is supposed to be the most joyous time in her life and it\u2019s been ruined and that\u2019s probably what hurts most of all,\u201d a family source tells PEOPLE about Kardashian, 33, who is due with her first child \u2014 a daughter \u2014 with Thompson, 27, any day now.\n\nOn Tuesday, photos and videos surfaced of the NBA player allegedly getting close to an unidentified woman at an N.Y.C. lounge over the weekend. TMZ also posted footage recorded in October 2017 allegedly depicting Thompson kissing one woman while a different woman groped him at the Darna hookah lounge outside of Washington D.C.\n\nDespite the allegations of infidelity \u2014 a source previously told PEOPLE that Thompson is \u201ca serial cheater\u201d \u2014 the insider says the mother-to-be is likely to stay with Thompson.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a hopeless romantic and she\u2019ll try to make this work. She tried forever to make it work with Lamar [Odom]. She\u2019s having a child with Tristan, and she\u2019s going to try to rebuild this,\u201d the source says.\n\nAdds the source: \u201cKhlo\u00e9 could probably convince herself to get over the fact that he maybe, kind of, sort of, hooked up with some groupie while out on the road. But being so indiscreet about it and letting it get splashed all over the place and having it humiliate her? That\u2019s actually even worse.\u201d\n\nPrior to meeting Thompson, Kardashian was in a nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Odom. They wed on Sept. 27, 2009 \u2014 one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) \u2014 but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player\u2019s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.\n\nJAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com\n\nKhloe Kardashian and Lamar Odom\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 spent so much time with Lamar just excusing away the obvious, turning a blind eye to what was so clearly happening, that it would be impossible for her not to feel like a fool if she made the same sort of mistakes again and just ignored that N.Y.C footage [of Thompson[. That\u2019s not the way a man deeply in love with the mother of his child behaves. It\u2019s just not. And Khlo\u00e9 can\u2019t lie to herself and tell herself otherwise,\u201d the source says.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Did Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s Boyfriend Get Too Close to Another Woman Right Before She Gives Birth?\n\n\u201cThe thing about Khlo\u00e9, though, is she\u2019s a big believer in knowing someone\u2019s back story and understanding how it motivates them. With Lamar, her heart broke for everything he\u2019d been through in the past, losing his mom and his grandma and his baby boy, and she used that as a justification for why he struggled so much with addiction and cheating. She\u2019s got a big heart \u2014 too big sometimes,\u201d the source shares.\n\nThompson and Kardashian began dating in September 2016, when his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig was still pregnant with Thompson\u2019s first child, 16-month-old son Prince Oliver. Neither has addressed whether he met Kardashian while still in a relationship with Craig.\n\nWatch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty; Jordan Craig/Instagram\n\nTristan Thompson and Jordan Craig\n\n\u201cWith Tristan, she believed his back story that he was never even that committed to her or in love with Jordan, and that he\u2019d never meant to be with Jordan long-term,\u201d the insider explains.\u201dKhlo\u00e9 let herself believe that he\u2019s a really good guy with a good heart. She might still believe that, honestly.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

A source previously told PEOPLE she planned on giving birth there, and her famous family would fly in, including mother Kris Jenner, who is already in Ohio with Kardashian.\n\nWhile her future with Thompson remains unknown, the Good American jeans founder is focusing her attention on her unborn daughter.\n\n\u201cThe only thing Khloe can do now is focus on her baby,\u201d the source says.\u201dWhat\u2019s happened over the last 24 hours changes a lot of things, but it doesn\u2019t change everything: It doesn\u2019t change that Khlo\u00e9 has dreamed of becoming a mom, already loves her baby so much, and that soon her dream is going to come true.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe can\u2019t wait to meet her little girl, can\u2019t wait to hold her,\u201d says the insider, adding, \u201cand so for right now, the focus is just on getting to that day as safely and healthily as possible.\u201d", "images":
