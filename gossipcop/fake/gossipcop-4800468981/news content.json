Photo: Getty Images\n\nIt\u2019s been quite the month in Katy Perry news: She gave a boy his first kiss on American Idol and has been embroiled in a legal battle with a group of nuns over property in L.A. But amid all of that, Perry is still giving the people what they really want \u2014 reasons to believe she dislikes Taylor Swift.\n\nWhen a contestant on American Idol apologized to Perry for saying that he loved Swift and looked up to her as a musician, Perry said, \u201cI love her, as a songwriter, as well.\u201d Then she made a face most accurately described as \u201c\u00af\\_(\u30c4)_/\u00af\u201d and looked away.\n\nThe two singers have been publicly feuding since Swift called them \u201cenemies\u201d in a 2014 Rolling Stone interview. They\u2019ve been fueling the feud fire ever since, most recently when Perry may have seduced Karlie Kloss away from Swift\u2019s girl gang. But hey, she loves Swift as a songwriter still!", "images": ["http://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6f3/18a/62924a6879e010d3d7ba15a283051cd9c7-19-taylor-swift-katy-perry.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6f3/18a/62924a6879e010d3d7ba15a283051cd9c7-19-taylor-swift-katy-perry.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/93d/dd4/6993359860ee6cc420bb272619119c2cdf-elon-musk-settlement.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "http://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "http://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd4/409/28254d99ceca593534b46a52a9e49b452b-RISSI-AND-MIKO-SET-1152022.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6f3/18a/62924a6879e010d3d7ba15a283051cd9c7-19-taylor-swift-katy-perry.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/katy-perry-may-have-shaded-taylor-swift-on-american-idol.html", "title": "Katy Perry May Have Shaded Taylor Swift on American Idol", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "katy perry, taylor swift, culture, celebrity, american idol, feuds, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Did Katy Perry Shade Taylor Swift on American Idol?", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/03/katy-perry-may-have-shaded-taylor-swift-on-american-idol.html", "description": "This feud will never end.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6f3/18a/62924a6879e010d3d7ba15a283051cd9c7-19-taylor-swift-katy-perry.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Did Katy Perry Shade Taylor Swift on American Idol?", "description": "This feud will never end.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/6f3/18a/62924a6879e010d3d7ba15a283051cd9c7-19-taylor-swift-katy-perry.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-19T10:45:43.604-04:00", "tag": "katy perry, taylor swift, culture, celebrity, american idol, feuds", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "The two singers have been publicly feuding since Swift called them \u201cenemies\u201d in a 2014 \u2018Rolling Stone\u2019 interview.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "katy perry, taylor swift, culture, celebrity, american idol, feuds", "author": "Sarah Spellings", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521470743.604, "source": "http://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
