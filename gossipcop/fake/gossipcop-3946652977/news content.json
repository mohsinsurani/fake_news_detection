In addition, the Patriots now have the chance to tie the Pittsburgh Steelers for most Super Bowl wins, with six, in franchise history.\n\nMeanwhile, the Philadelphia Eagles became NFC Champions over the Minnesota Vikings 38-7, clinching their first Super Bowl appearance since February 2005, when they first took on the Patriots during XXXIX.\n\nThe rematch had plenty of celebrity supporters both in the stadium stands and in Hollywood.\n\nGisele B\u00fcndchen proudly congratulated her husband on social media with a photo of her and Brady, writing, \u201cWhat a game!!! Congratulations my love! So happy for you and your teammates! #gopats.\u201d\n\nOlivia Culpo ran onto the field at Gillette Stadium and into the arms of her boyfriend, Patriots wide receiver Danny Amendola. \u201cBABY GOING TO THE #SUPERBOWL,\u201d she wrote with several heart emojis.\n\nNearby at Lincoln Financial Field, Bradley Cooper was in his hometown of Philly to cheer on his team. (Fun fact: Cooper also played an Eagles fan in Silver Linings Playbook, for which he received an Oscar nomination.)\n\nAlso in the crowd were Bill Cosby, NBA legend Charles Barkley and Los Angeles Angels star Mike Trout.\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fbillcosby%2Fposts%2F10155643325664930&width=500\n\nOn social media, Pink, who will be performing the national anthem at this year\u2019s Super Bowl, celebrated her hometown\u2019s victory over the Vikings. \u201cUmmm. I\u2019m singing the national anthem and the EAGLES ARE PLAYING?! IS THIS FOR REAL?!THATS WHASSUP!!\u201d the singer tweeted.\n\nFellow Philly native Kobe Bryant also wrote on Twitter, \u201cGetting there wasn\u2019t the goal @Eagles let\u2019s finish the job.\u201d\n\nMaze Runner: The Death Cure actor Will Poulter showed his team pride with an Eagles hat in a photo shared on Twitter.\n\nUnited States women\u2019s national soccer team member Julie Ertz learned about her husband, Eagles tight end Zach Ertz\u2019s big win right after a match. \u201cOh my God! They\u2019re going! They\u2019re going!\u201d Julie told her team mates on the field.\n\nHowever, Josh Duhamel documented his favorite NFL team\u2019s loss on Instagram. \u201cWow, just got verbally abused by Philly fan. I need a shower. Congrats to the @philadelphiaeagles; except for that one dude missing a tooth. You went too far bro,\u201d the actor shared on Instagram.\n\nThe Patriots-Eagles Super Bowl will take place at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis on Feb. 4. Justin Timberlake will perform the halftime show.", "images":
