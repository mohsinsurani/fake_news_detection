Their relationship had flourished in private since they first met in July of that year, but when the eyes of the world turned to the prince and his potential bride-to-be, the couple was forced to work hard for their peace and quiet.\n\nOCTOBER 2016\n\nLike his brother, Harry enjoyed outfoxing the media, and while he was disappointed the story had broken, he knew he was lucky to have enjoyed several months getting to know Meghan without press scrutiny. When the story broke, Harry happened to be with Meghan in Toronto. He was apparently taken by surprise when his aides called to tell him the story was going to be front-page news and knew that very soon he and Meghan would be under siege. A story was leaked that Harry had canceled a flight to Toronto to try and make it look like he was in the U.K., but photographers and reporters descended on Meghan\u2019s home regardless.\n\nWhen Meghan suggested they go to stay with her friends Ben and Jessica Mulroney, Harry agreed. The Mulroneys were two of the few friends who knew about the romance, and they were more than happy to let the couple take shelter from the paparazzi at their Toronto house. Jessica, a stylist, is one of Meghan\u2019s best friends, while Ben is a TV host who presents CTV\u2019s entertainment news program etalk. Harry had become friendly with them both and was a big hit with the couple\u2019s three young children, 7-year-old twins Brian and John, and their 4-year-old daughter, Isobel.\n\n\u201cWhen Harry came to visit the family he brought a bag filled with gifts. He won the kids over in an instant. He was brilliant with them and I think what swung it for Meghan was how good Harry was with them,\u201d says a source. \u201cI actually think that might have been the moment Meghan really fell for Harry. He got to know the Mulroneys quite well, and they liked Harry from the beginning.\u201d\n\nSpread over 3 floors and with impressive 14-foot-high ceilings, the Mulroneys\u2019 open-plan home was a sanctuary for Meghan and Harry. No one knew where they were, and behind closed doors the foursome got to know each other. Harry was fascinated when Ben, the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, recounted lively stories of how Princess Diana once stayed with his family during an offcial tour to Canada and, finding herself bored with talking politics after dinner, had ventured up to the nursery to play with Ben and his three siblings.\n\n\u201cHarry found them immediately kind and welcoming people, and he loved hearing stories about his mother,\u201d a friend of Ben\u2019s told me. \u201cJessica is one of the nicest, sweetest people you will ever meet, and Ben is really easy to get along with.\u201d\n\nIt was just as well Meghan and Harry had somewhere to hide because over the following days the story snowballed. It was quickly discovered that the pair followed each other on Instagram, and as the media were eager to share, in one of the photos she had posted Meghan was wearing a blue-and-white beaded bracelet identical to one Harry wore.\n\nThe actress\u2019s L.A.-based agency at the time fueled the rumors of a romance when they were contacted for comment and said: \u201cShould this be confirmed by the Palace, all of us at Kruger Cowne are delighted for them and wish them well.\u201d In fact, there was so much fervid hype about the romance that bookmakers suspended bets on a royal wedding, having previously been offering odds of 12 to 1 that Harry would announce his engagement in 2016 and 5 to 1 that he would marry in 2017.\n\nLeft, Markle photographed leaving yoga in Toronto in April of last year; Right, Meghan and Harry photographed together for the first time at the September 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto.

But the trip proved to be stressful. The Sun newspaper had that week published a front-page story that some of Meghan\u2019s racy scenes from Suits were being trailed on a porn Web site. One of the scenes included her character Rachel Zane having sex with a colleague against a filing cabinet.\n\nMeghan was horrified, telling friends she was convinced that the British press was \u201cout to get her.\u201d It was the final straw for Harry who, according to a source, \u201ccompletely flipped\u201d when he read the story. He decided to issue a direct statement to the press. It was to be a warning shot to Fleet Street and all the social-media trolls whose hateful comments Harry had unwisely read on Twitter and the Internet.", "images":
