'She would accept a glass but it stayed full all night and no-one saw her take a sip.\n\n'But what we did see was her touching her belly quite a bit - at one point, Keith even leaned over and touched her stomach lovingly. They were definitely acting like a expectant couple.'\n\nIt's no secret that Nicole and Keith love being parents, with the 50-year-old revealing that she's never given up her baby dream despite her age.\n\n'I still have the faintest hope that something may happen to me this year,' she recently revealed to Mail On Sunday.\n\n'Keith and I would love to have more babies. My grandmother gave birth to my mother at 49. I would be beyond happy and just welcome it with open arms.'\n\nIf her miracle baby dream comes true, sources say the busy actress is determined to stick with her filming schedule.\n\n'It's early days yet, but Nicole wants to be prepared,' an insider says.\n\nFor the full story see this weeks issue of New Idea - out now!", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2693548590922384&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/111517/ni42_magshop_edm.jpg?height=158"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "keywords": [], "authors": ["New Idea"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/nicole-kidmans-miracle-baby", "title": "Nicole Kidman pregnant at 50", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "Nicole Kidman's amazing secret is out - a new baby's on the way, at the miracle age of 50!", "news_keywords": "Nicole Kidman, Nicole Kidman baby, Keith Urban, Nicole and Keith, celebrity babies, latest celeb news, celebrity news, celeb news, celebrity gossip", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/nicole-kidmans-miracle-baby", "title": "BREAKING: Nicole Kidman\u2019s miracle baby", "description": "Nicole Kidman's amazing secret is out - a new baby's on the way, at the miracle age of 50!", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewIdeamagazine", "title": "Nicole Kidman pregnant at 50", "description": "Nicole Kidman's amazing secret is out - a new baby's on the way, at the miracle age of 50!", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/nicole-kidmans-miracle-baby"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "sailthru.title": "Nicole Kidman\u2019s miracle baby", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-16 00:00:00", "sailthru.author": "New Idea", "sailthru.description": "Inside Keith and Nic's surprise pregnancy joy at 50.", "sailthru.tags": "Nicole Kidman,Nicole Kidman baby,Keith Urban,Nicole and Keith,celebrity babies,latest celeb news,celebrity news,celeb news,celebrity gossip", "sailthru.section": "Celebrity", "sailthru.doctype": "ArticlePage"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515960996.041, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
