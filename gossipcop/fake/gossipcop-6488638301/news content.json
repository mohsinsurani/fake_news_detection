Just send the man a text or a Snapchat every now and then!\n\nWhen asked to comment on his friend\u2019s description, Brad Pitt answered, \u201cWell, you know, George is extremely accessible. He's one of our best representatives. He's funny as shit. He's a joy to be around.\"\n\nbrad and angelina leave a los angeles hotel together\n\n\"I guess maybe I'm more of a miserable bastard,\" he quipped. \"I'm a bit of a loner you know? I'm more quiet by nature. And coming from, you know, hillbilly country, I'm probably more reserved.\"\n\nSo you're telling me that being married to Angelina Jolie and sequestered with your beautiful brood of children in a French chateau is not a winning formula for eternal happiness? Is there any hope for the rest of us??\n\n\"I've always believed happiness is overrated, you know?\" Pitt continued. \"It's those difficult times that inform the next wonderful time, and it's a series of trade-offs, of events, of wins and losses.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/26/Lady-Gaga-180x135.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/25/The-Hottest-Celebrity-Skin-Pics-of-the-Week-8-180x135.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/07/anglina-jolie-los-angeles-restaurant-04072014-04-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/ui/images/fb_login.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/07/anglina-jolie-los-angeles-restaurant-04072014-01-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/26/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-180x135.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/19/Brad-Pitt-5-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/19/Brad-Pitt-2-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/29/brad-pitt-british-gq-092914-lead-400x470.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/ui/images/cb_logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/28/Brad-Pitt-Family-Quotes19-100x75.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/25/The-Cutest-Celebrity-Kid-Pics-of-the-Week--180x135.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/07/anglina-jolie-los-angeles-restaurant-04072014-03-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/19/Brad-Pitt-3-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://www.celebuzz.com/ui/images/default_avatar.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/28/456275576_101-180x135.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/19/Brad-Pitt-4-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/07/anglina-jolie-los-angeles-restaurant-04072014-02-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://www.celebuzz.com/ui/images/collisionadmarkerwht.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/19/Brad-Pitt-1-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/07/brad-pitt-los-angeles-restaurant-04072014-02-94x94.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/ui/images/logo_footer.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851im_/http://cdn01.cdnwp.celebuzz.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/29/brad-pitt-british-gq-092914-lead-400x470.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140929152851/http://www.celebuzz.com/2014-09-29/brad-pitt-calls-himself-a-miserable-bastard-and-loner-in-british-gq/", "title": "Brad Pitt Calls Himself a 'Miserable Bastard' and 'Loner' in British 'GQ'", "meta_data": {"description": "On behalf of loners and miserable bastards everywhere, welcome to our esteemed club, Brad Pitt!
