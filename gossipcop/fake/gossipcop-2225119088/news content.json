The aspirant actress adores Kanye West\u2019s wife.\n\nA source shared: \u201cParis agreed to strategize with the savvy 61-year-old, but asked that her idol Kim [Kardashian] join them for a meeting at Kris\u2019s estate in Calabasas. Paris may soon be following in Kim\u2019s reality TV footsteps.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe upcoming months will reveal if Jenner was able to convince the teenager to become an honorary Kardashian.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kourtney-and-khloe-kardashian-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kris-jenner-rob-kardashian-300x158.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kris-jenner-rob-kardashian-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Robin-Roberts-Michael-Strahan-GMA-Fight-Aftermath-300x209.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bethenny-frankel-jason-hoppy-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Ree-Drummond-Pioneer-Woman-Racist-Joke-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kourtney-and-khloe-kardashian-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/ed48a891292b8aa7959e34a001e55e47?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie-Strong-Love-300x198.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/kim-richards-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Kanye-West-And-Kim-Kardashian-Marriage-Drama-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Mel-Walker-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Michael-Strahan-Father-Of-The-Year-Award-300x188.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Paris-Jackson-Kris-Jenner-Keeping-Up-With-The-Kardashians.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/javi-marroquin-300x168.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Paris-Jackson-Kris-Jenner-Keeping-Up-With-The-Kardashians.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mel Walker"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025/http://celebrityinsider.org/kris-jenner-wants-paris-jackson-to-join-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-amid-ratings-woes-24959/", "title": "Kris Jenner Wants Paris Jackson To Join \u2018Keeping Up With The Kardashians\u2019 Amid Ratings Woes", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Mel Walker", "news_keywords": "Keeping Up With The Kardashians, kim kardashian, kris jenner, paris jackson,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, kim kardashian, kris jenner, paris jackson,", "description": "Paris Jackson is 18 years old and seems to have a promising future ahead of her in the entertainment industry after a star-turn performance in the", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kris Jenner Wants Paris Jackson To Join \u2018Keeping Up With The Kardashians\u2019 Amid Ratings Woes", "description": "Paris Jackson is 18 years old and seems to have a promising future ahead of her in the entertainment industry after a star-turn performance in the", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025/http://celebrityinsider.org/kris-jenner-wants-paris-jackson-to-join-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-amid-ratings-woes-24959/", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170314162025im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Paris-Jackson-Kris-Jenner-Keeping-Up-With-The-Kardashians.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity News, Gossip -
