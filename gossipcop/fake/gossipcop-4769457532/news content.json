A seemingly very well-connected source at Page Six is passing on info that the couple is still in regular communication.\n\nApparently a \u201cjet-setting source\u201d told Page Six that Holmes and Foxx were FaceTiming on the plane as Holmes and Suri Cruise departed for Paris: \u201cShe said she loves him and asked if he wanted \u2018cookies from Paris.\u2019 He was in Miami.\u201d Suri\u2019s nanny was reportedly also on the plane.\n\nFoxx has, indeed, been in Miami; he was seen at mega-club E11EVEN on Sunday. The fact that we know this, and that we know Holmes is in Paris with Suri for fashion shows, is kind of monumental. This is a pairing that has managed to stay below the surface since they got together in 2013; though there is a timeline of their relationship, there are big gaps here where no one knows anything.\n\nAs Vanity Fair pointed out last year, Holmes and Foxx went to F.B.I.-level lengths to avoid tabloid attention. They reportedly hid out in a luxury resort to celebrate at least Holmes\u2019s 38th birthday, and Holmes \u201cput on a wig and hat\u201d to meet Foxx.\n\nNow, it seems that the high-security walls of this relationship keep tumbling down. People are overhearing FaceTime conversations and spotting Foxx and Holmes out during their nighttime adventures. Perhaps we had fair warning: last year, Us Weekly reported that Holmes was tired of \u201cplaying the hiding game.\u201d And what better way to combat breakup rumors than to stop hiding altogether?", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b364ea8420bf26882fee2b6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-have-not-broken-up.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3b7fabacd469252aac12a7/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jamie-foxx-kaite-holmes-break-up-rumors.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3a23ff3d9d835313b6f028/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/suri-cruise-paris-summer.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61bb68208185dc60dfd416d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3b7fabacd469252aac12a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jamie-foxx-kaite-holmes-break-up-rumors.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61f2a5fdbc6733c4e6a4c2e1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3b7fabacd469252aac12a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jamie-foxx-kaite-holmes-break-up-rumors.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Hilary Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/jamie-foxx-and-katie-holmes-find-best-way-to-battle-breakup-rumors", "title": "Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Find the Best Way to Battle Breakup Rumors", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Would a couple who split up be this open with their relationship after years of hiding?", "id": "5b3b7eb8acd469252aac12a5", "keywords": "katie holmes,jamie foxx,breakup", "news_keywords": "katie holmes,jamie foxx,breakup", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b3b7eb8acd469252aac12a5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Would a couple who split up be this open with their relationship after years of hiding?\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3b7fabacd469252aac12a7/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/jamie-foxx-kaite-holmes-break-up-rumors.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3b7fabacd469252aac12a7/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/jamie-foxx-kaite-holmes-break-up-rumors.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Would a couple who split up be this open with their relationship after years of hiding?", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3b7fabacd469252aac12a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jamie-foxx-kaite-holmes-break-up-rumors.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Find the Best Way to Battle Breakup Rumors", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/jamie-foxx-and-katie-holmes-find-best-way-to-battle-breakup-rumors"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-07-03T14:05:25.116Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-03T14:05:25.116Z", "author": "Hilary Weaver"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Would a couple who split up be this open with their relationship after years of hiding?", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3b7fabacd469252aac12a7/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jamie-foxx-kaite-holmes-break-up-rumors.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes Find the Best Way to Battle Breakup Rumors"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530626725.116, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
