In fact, it\u2019s SUPER NICE. Yes the Little Mix singer thought the Netflix series was \u201cmassively disturbing,\u201d but she meant it in a positive, empowering way. And besides, aren\u2019t the greatest works of art the ones that make us feel and think? \u201cThe way they got the message across was amazing, and although I found it massively disturbing, I feel like every person going to school should watch it.\u201d See \u2014 Perrie totally loved it!\n\nIt\u2019s a good thing too, since 13 Reasons Why is basically Selena\u2019s baby. The \u201cHands To Myself\u201d hitmaker took time away from her singing career to produce the series, which probably was a little frightening at least, but the results totally paid off. Fans love the show SO MUCH that they\u2019re already asking about season 2, or if there\u2019s even going to be one. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what is going to go beyond it, but we know there are so many stories that lie beneath each character,\u201d Selena explained to The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cThat\u2019s why it became a series in the first place. So we\u2019ll see.\u201d STOP TEASING US!\n\nAs much as we\u2019d love to watch the next chapter unravel on the silver screen, we\u2019ve got something else to buzz about! And that\u2019s Selena\u2019s upcoming album. The brunette beauty recently dropped \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me\u201d featuring DJ Kygo and we\u2019re already begging for more. One thing we know for sure, it\u2019s that Selena reportedly collaborated with Paulina Rubio, a Latin music icon, on at least one song. It sounds like this is going to be her best work yet!\n\nHollywoodLifers, did you also find Selena\u2019s show disturbing?
