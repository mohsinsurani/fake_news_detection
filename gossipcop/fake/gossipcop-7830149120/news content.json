In the bottom right hand corner of the video, two short, thin, straight white lines can be seen on a table behind the reality star. It didn't take long for many of her millions of followers to screenshot the scene and upload it to social media, pointing out that the two white lines look suspiciously like cocaine.\n\n\u201cI do not play with rumours like this,\u201d she wrote in response. \u201cThat\u2019s sugar from our candy mess from dylan\u2019s candy shop.\u201d\n\nI do not play with rumors like this so I'm gonna shut it down real quick. That's sugar from our candy mess from dylan's candy shop https://t.co/oICdPQVi8d \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 11, 2017\n\nImage via Snapchat\n\nFor the record, Kim is indeed in NYC this week, and according to photos posted on TMZ she did take her daughter North to Dylan\u2019s Candy Shop in Manhattan this Sunday.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time a Kardashian has been involved in a social media related cocaine scandal. Kim\u2019s sister Kendall Jenner, no stranger to scandals herself (see: the recent T-shirt fiasco, her Pepsi commercial), posted a photo to her Snapchat in July of last year of a tiny plastic bag with the caption: \"this is the cutest little ziploc baggie I have ever seen.\" Many identified the \u201ccute\u201d baggie as the same kind of bag popularly used to store cocaine. Kendall deleted the snap soon afterwards.", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/idst7x8coyeu6b9san7s/kim-kardashian-wants-another-baby?fimg-ssr-default", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6685975&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 135 76\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/idst7x8coyeu6b9san7s/kim-kardashian-wants-another-baby"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/idst7x8coyeu6b9san7s/kim-kardashian-wants-another-baby", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Pimentel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/07/kim-kardashian-denies-cocaine-rumor-snapchat", "title": "Kim Kardashian Wants You to Know That Wasn\u2019t Cocaine You Saw on Her Snapchat", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ICK39wBGvCQQMHpEUykVHWF8Ox_0MME-_qxe6ixFUik", "theme-color": "#000000", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Kim Kardashian said she \u201cdoes not play with rumors like this.\u201d", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Kim Kardashian Wants You to Know That Wasn\u2019t Cocaine You Saw on Her Snapchat", "description": "Kim Kardashian said she \u201cdoes not play with rumors like this.\u201d", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/07/kim-kardashian-denies-cocaine-rumor-snapchat", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/idst7x8coyeu6b9san7s/kim-kardashian-wants-another-baby", "site_name": "Complex"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310521533114641, "pages": 117696581735620}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim Kardashian Wants You to Know That Wasn\u2019t Cocaine You Saw on Her Snapchat", "description": "Kim Kardashian said she \u201cdoes not play with rumors like this.\u201d", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/07/kim-kardashian-denies-cocaine-rumor-snapchat", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,h_300,q_auto,w_600/fl_lossy,pg_1/idst7x8coyeu6b9san7s/kim-kardashian-wants-another-baby", "site": {"id": 13049362}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
