The schedule involves each child except for Maddox, who is being allowed to make his own choices because he is older. The \u2018Fury\u2019 actor is set to spend time with his kids June 8 to June 17 for four hours per day while he stays in London, where Angelina currently rents a house.\n\nDuring this time, Brad is required to designate one or two of the children to spend time with at a time, and must spend time with each child at least twice. Brad then gets custody again for 10 hours per day from June 27 through July 1, before getting all his children for four consecutive days between July 8 and July 14.\n\nBrad Pitt attends the 7th Annual Sean Penn & Friends HAITI RISING Gala benefiting J/P Haitian Relief Organization on January 6, 2018 in Hollywood, California.

Court papers state: \u201cIf the minor children remain closed down to their father and depending on the circumstances surrounding this condition, it may result in a reduction of the time they spend with [Jolie] and may result in the Court ordering primary physical custody to [Pitt].\u201d\n\nExecutive producer Angelina Jolie arrives on the red carpet with her children, Vivienne Jolie-Pitt, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt, Knox Leon Jolie-Pitt, and Zahara Jolie-Pitt, for the film \"The Breadwinner\" at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF), in Toronto, Canada, September 10, 2017.
