We may know that they\u2019re one of Hollywood\u2019s most fashionable duos, but we have no idea what they\u2019re really like together behind-the-scenes.\n\nLuckily, we can find out a lot about a couple based off of how they interact in public. Experts have shared just what their body language reveals, including why West always stands behind Kardashian in photos (page 5), and proof that they go through bad days just like any other couple (page 7).\n\n1. Stealing a kiss\n\nOne thing is for sure: Kardashian and West are genuinely in love. According to body language expert Blanca Cobb, West took everyone off guard with his kiss (John Legend and Chrissy Teigen didn\u2019t even have time to react!), but in the sweetest way. \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to wait!,\u201d Cobb explained.\n\n\u201cYou can tell [Kardashian is] enjoying it from the look on her face \u2014 she\u2019s holding back a smile as she puckers up,\u201d she added. \u201cShe could have stood up, but Kanye finds her instead, showing he was really feeling love for her in that moment.\u201d\n\nNext: It\u2019s crazy how connected they appear in this photo.\n\n2. Can\u2019t keep her hands to herself\n\nKardashian just couldn\u2019t keep her hands to herself while courtside at a Los Angeles Lakers game. With not one, but two hands around West\u2019s arm, Cobb explains that it\u2019s a way of \u201cmaintaining [their] connection.\u201d She added, \u201c[It\u2019s] a silent way of saying, \u2018I like you, I want to be with you, you mean something to me.\u2019 You use two hands when you feel extra affectionate toward a person.\u201d\n\nWest is showing his love for Kardashian, too, but in a different way. According to Cobb, his right shoulder is leaning into Kardashian to show he likes the feeling of her touch. Plus, both of their big smiles are completely genuine, which is revealed by their raised cheeks and looks of love on their faces.\n\nNext: We can\u2019t get over this look on their faces.\n\n3. They\u2019re all smiles\n\nWest is notorious for keeping a straight face in public, but sometimes, he just can\u2019t help but be all smiles around Kardashian. With West\u2019s hand resting on Kardashian\u2019s backside, we can definitely classify this as a glimpse into an intimate moment between the couple.\n\nAccording to Cobb, Kardashian seems comfortable with West getting a little touchy-feely in public. Cosmopolitan adds that it \u201crequires a high level of trust and comfort on Kim\u2019s part.\u201d\n\nNext: This is how West really makes Kardashian feel.\n\n4. Giving her confidence\n\nKardashian is looking seriously confident in this photo, and it could very well have something to do with her company. WIth the powerful look of her hand in her pocket and her self-assured gaze at the paparazzi, you can tell she\u2019s feeling good.\n\nCobb explained, \u201cWhen you\u2019re proud of who you\u2019re with, you can draw confidence from both your partner and from within.\u201d\n\nNext: This is why West is always standing behind Kardashian.\n\n5. She\u2019s the center of attention\n\nIf you\u2019ve noticed that West almost always stands behind Kardashian in photos \u2014 he\u2019s doing it on purpose. According to body language expert Darren Stanton, \u201cKanye has chosen to significantly shield his body behind Kim\u2019s.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cHe makes himself appear smaller and more subservient as he is being careful not to steal any of the attention. Kanye is using Kim as a proactive barrier, allowing him to sink into his surroundings and take the emphasis off himself.\u201d\n\nWest does often make sure to have his hand resting on Kardashian, even when he\u2019s letting her have the limelight. The move allows him to assert himself in the relationship, which, according to Cobb, \u201cis part of who they are as a couple.\u201d\n\nNext: They aren\u2019t always happy with each other.\n\n6. Feelings of coldness\n\nAlthough West and Kardashian seem completely obsessed with each other most of the time, they\u2019ve had moments where they come across as cold or disconnected. Take this photo above, for example. Even though they\u2019re close, it gives body-language expert Patti Wood an \u201cunusual\u201d feeling.\n\nShe explained to Elite Daily, \u201cIt\u2019s all the cues together in a sentence that says, \u2018I don\u2019t really want to be seen connected to her. I\u2019m forward to her. I\u2019m closed. I\u2019m not touching her. [My] fingers are curled upward rather than touching. It\u2019s very awkward. It\u2019s very unusual.\u201d\n\nKardashian is looking particularly disconnected in this photo, according to Wood. \u201cShe\u2019s got [the] front of her body up and just barely touching him,\u201d Wood described. \u201cBut she\u2019s not giving him weight \u2026 and what [that] shows is a lack of connection on her part.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIf you look at her left arm that\u2019s toward the camera, it could so easily be touching his body or surrounding his body, [and the placement shows] a subconscious choice not to do that.\u201d\n\n\n\nNext: This proves they\u2019re just like any other couple.\n\n7. They have bad days just like any other couple\n\nWood is a bit skeptical about how the couple is posing in this photo. Upon first glance, you might think they look just as close as they normally do. However, when she looked at it closer, she saw more of a pose than she did chemistry.\n\n\u201cYou see his head lean, but if you look at the expression on his face, the facial expression is a sadness combined with that dead-eyed stare forward,\u201d Wood explained. \u201cUsually, you draw comfort leaning in and resting on your mate\u2019s head. I typically see serenity and happiness. I don\u2019t see that here.\u201d\n\nKardashian is giving off similar vibes, according to Wood. \u201cHer hand is very stiffly placed around his shoulder with a strange wrist bend. It\u2019s not relaxed \u2026 and the fingers are not curled around him.\u201d\n\nKardashian and West might not seem totally happy in every photo, but in reality, it just proves they\u2019re like any other couple. Sure, they might have their bad days, but overall, we can see that Kardashian and West are a team.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/2016-MTV-Video-Music-Awards-Arrivals-e1522426627969.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kim-kanye-7.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/John-Legend-Celebrates-His-Birthday-And-The-10th-Anniversary-Of-His-Debut-Album-Get-Lifted-At-CATCH-NYC-624x500.jpg?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Kim-Kardashian-and-Kanye-West.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/John-Legend-Celebrates-His-Birthday-And-The-10th-Anniversary-Of-His-Debut-Album-Get-Lifted-At-CATCH-NYC.jpg?w=624&h=500", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Denver-Nuggets-v-Los-Angeles-Lakers-Game-Seven-e1522426552401.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Charles-James-Beyond-Fashion-Costume-Institute-Gala-Candids.jpg?w=640&h=427", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Harpers-Bazaar-Celebrates-ICONS-By-Carine-Roitfeld-Presented-By-Infor-Laura-Mercier-And-Stella-Artois-Inside-e1522426744180.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/John-Legend-Celebrates-His-Birthday-And-The-10th-Anniversary-Of-His-Debut-Album-Get-Lifted-At-CATCH-NYC-624x500.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Leary"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-surprising-secrets-their-body-language-reveals-about-their-relationship.html/", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West: Surprising Secrets Their Body Language Reveals About Their Relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's body language reveals a lot more than you would think about their marriage.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West: Surprising Secrets Their Body Language Reveals About Their Relationship", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's body language reveals a lot more than you would think about their marriage.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-surprising-secrets-their-body-language-reveals-about-their-relationship.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/John-Legend-Celebrates-His-Birthday-And-The-10th-Anniversary-Of-His-Debut-Album-Get-Lifted-At-CATCH-NYC-624x500.jpg?w=1200"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "published_time": "2018-06-23T17:27:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-23T17:27:05+00:00"}, "author": "Chelsea Leary", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cheatsheet", "site": "@cheatsheet", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Chelsea Leary", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "6 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529774820.0, "source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
