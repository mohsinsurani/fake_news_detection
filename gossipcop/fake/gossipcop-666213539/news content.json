Salaries of Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and More\n\nRaking it in! The Voice judges Blake Shelton, Kelly Clarkson, John Legend and Nick Jonas are earning a hefty salary for season 20, which premiered on March 1. However, newcomer Ariana Grande, who is slotted to appear next season, will reportedly be the highest-paid coach.\n\nThe NBC show has become extremely popular since it first premiered in 2011 and has featured some seriously A-list artists as coaches and advisors.\n\nAfter appearing as a part-time advisor during season 13, Kelly was brought on as a full-time coach for season 14, which premiered in 2014. Of course, this came as a surprise to some, considering the \u201cHeartbeat Song\u201d singer got her start on American Idol, which was rebooted in 2018 with judges Luke Bryan, Lionel Richie and Katy Perry.\n\n\u201cThink of how I felt,\u201d Kelly said with a laugh about her surprising decision during an interview with Entertainment Tonight in 2017. \u201c[But] I\u2019ve been in talks with The Voice about doing stuff for years \u2026 It\u2019s going to be good, and I\u2019m excited, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nThat being said, the \u201cSince U Been Gone\u201d singer acknowledged her previous experience on Idol is a positive for her as a coach. \u201cI think there is a difference being one of the contestants previously on a show like this \u2026 I think that does carry weight,\u201d she added.\n\nBlake is the only coach on season 20 who has appeared on The Voice since season 1. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I have sat in this chair now for the twentieth season \u2026 even Kelly is still a rookie compared to me,\u201d the \u201cGod\u2019s Country\u201d singer joked during a promotional YouTube video for the NBC show.\n\n\u201cCountry music has been my life since I was 14/15 years old and now what\u2019s exciting for me is to find new young talent,\u201d Blake added. \u201cThis is our tenth year anniversary and it\u2019s unbelievable that the talent level just keeps getting better, 20 seasons now of being a coach on this show and I still love my job.\u201d\n\nPast coaches, including Adam Levine, Gwen Stefani, Miley Cyrus, Christina Aguilera and Alicia Keys, also raked in major money for their short-lived appearances on the reality singing competition.\n\nThese talented artists may have the best jobs \u2026 ever.
