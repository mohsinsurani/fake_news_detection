Now there\u2019s a way to lure those rich people to the valley. He has committed to raising $500,000-plus for the president\u2019s re-election. \u201cI'm disillusioned by the people who are disillusioned by Obama,\u201d Clooney recently told ABC News.\n\nROME \u2013 The Hollywood Reporter updated this report with confirmation from George Clooney that the actor is not selling his Lake Como property.\n\nPreviously:\n\nIt looks like actor and Italy regular George Clooney may be severing his ties with the Bel Paese, at least according to a report from Italian news program TG 24.\n\nThe report said that Clooney is looking to sell Villa Oleandra, the mansion he bought on the shores of Lake Como 10 years ago, in order to distance himself from the attention of the corps of paparazzi who follow his every move while there.\n\nIf the reports prove to be true, it would be part of a dramatic withdrawal from Italy for the 51-year-old Clooney, who has established deep roots in the country.\n\nTwo years after buying Villa Oleandra, Clooney was made an honorary citizen of Laglio, the town where his villa is located.\n\nSTORY: THR Presents the Clooney Award: TV Stars Who Can Make the Leap\n\nHe also made his 2010 film The American in Italy after promising residents of the earthquake-stricken Abruzzo region he would make a film there in order to help boost the local economy, and he was an almost annual visitor to the Venice Film Festival.
