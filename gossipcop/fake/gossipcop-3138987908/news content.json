Fans couldn\u2019t help but comment on the 72-year-old\u2019s wrinkle-free face during a recent appearance on the weekly morning show Lorraine, with many accusing Elvis\u2019 ex of getting more plastic surgery.\n\n\u201cPriscilla Presley what happened to aging gracefully,\u201d one person wrote on Twitter, while another said, \u201cWhat has Priscilla Presley done to her face\u2026looks like she has a scary mask on.\u201d A third person added, \u201cPriscilla Presley looking like something from a horror movie on ITV Lorraine.\u201d\n\nThe mother-of-two has spoken out about botched cosmetic procedures in the past. Her spokesperson previously claimed that she unknowingly had industrial low-grade silicone \u2014 similar to what mechanics use to grease car parts \u2014 injected into her face. \u201cPriscilla Presley was one of many documented victims of Dr. [Daniel] Serrano,\u201d the actress\u2019 rep previously shared. \u201cAn investigation which uncovered his misconduct ultimately lead to his imprisonment. Ms. Presley dealt with this matter years ago and everything is now well.\u201d\n\nSerrano, who wasn\u2019t even licensed to practice medicine in the U.S., was deported to Argentina after serving 18 months in federal prison. Some of his injections caused lumps, paralysis, and holes in his clients\u2019 faces.\n\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time Priscilla has been subjected to nasty comments online. Following her last appearance on Lorraine in 2016, a viewer likened her to \u201cFrankenstein\u2019s monster.\u201d Another wrote, \u201cFlicking through channels on TV and thought I saw a Lizard being interviewed on Lorraine. Turns out it was Priscilla Presley after surgery!\u201d Scroll down to see her transformation over the years.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/priscilla-presley-march-1980.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/priscilla-presley-lorraine.png?fit=400%2C264&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C264"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/priscilla-presley-march-1980.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/priscilla-presley-plastic-surgery-103194/", "title": "Priscilla Presley Plastic Surgery: Elvis\u2019 Ex Admits to Botched Filler", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Did Priscilla Presley manage to invent a time machine?!
