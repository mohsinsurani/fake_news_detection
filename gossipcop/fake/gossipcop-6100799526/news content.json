Once the show went to air in February, the pair\u2019s relationship started to become competitive.\n\nA source told LIFE & STYLE that things turned from that point onwards.\n\n'The success of Big Little Lies has gone to both of their heads and there\u2019s now a power struggle between the two stars,' the source revealed.\n\n'Behind closed doors, their egos are clashing and they bicker over the smallest thing.'\n\nThe public were given a glimpse into the ongoing feud at the Emmy Awards in September when Big Little Lies won the Outstanding Limited Series category.\n\nOn stage, Reese grabbed the statue and refused to let it go \u2013 even when Nicole tried to have a turn holding it.\n\nTensions were further fuelled after Nicole beat out Reese for the Emmy award in the category of Best Actress In A Limited Series.\n\n'There seemed to be some tension between Nicole and Reese at the Emmys afterparty,\u2019 says the Insider.\n\n'There were some icy stares back and forth, kind of checking who was getting most of the attention, which was clearly Nicole.'\n\nFor now the stars are continuing to play nice for the cameras when fulfilling their publicity duties. But the insider says this is all just for show.\n\n'The bottom line is that Nicole and Reese really don\u2019t like each other.'", "images": ["https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/20165/nicole-vs-reese.jpg", "https://www.newidea.com.au/media/111517/ni42_magshop_edm.jpg?height=158", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2693548590922384&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/20165/nicole-vs-reese.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Smails"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/nicole-kidman-and-reese-witherspoon-in-bitter-feud", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in bitter feud", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "It was a complete lovefest when Reece Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman first started working together as co-stars on hit series, Big Little Lies.", "news_keywords": "Nicole Kidman, Reese Witherspoon, Nicole and Reese, big little lies", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/nicole-kidman-and-reese-witherspoon-in-bitter-feud", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in bitter feud", "description": "It was a complete lovefest when Reece Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman first started working together as co-stars on hit series, Big Little Lies.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/20165/nicole-vs-reese.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 1000}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewIdeamagazine", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Reese Witherspoon in bitter feud", "description": "It was a complete lovefest when Reece Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman first started working together as co-stars on hit series, Big Little Lies.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/20165/nicole-vs-reese.jpg", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/nicole-kidman-and-reese-witherspoon-in-bitter-feud"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "sailthru.title": "Nicole and Reese: They can't stand each other", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-7 00:00:00", "sailthru.author": "Patricia Smails", "sailthru.description": "The former friends are embroiled in a bitter feud.", "sailthru.tags": "Nicole Kidman,Reese Witherspoon,Nicole and Reese,big little lies", "sailthru.section": "Celebrity", "sailthru.doctype": "ArticlePage", "sailthru.image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/20165/nicole-vs-reese.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512609956.017, "source": "https://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
