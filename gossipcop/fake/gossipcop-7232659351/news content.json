But the couple is calling a truce, for the sake of their 6 children. The ex couple released a joint statement late last night which will seemingly end the back-and-forth drama in their Hollywood divorce. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe parties and their counsel have signed agreements to preserve the privacy rights of their children and family by keeping all court documents confidential and engaging a private judge to make any necessary legal decisions and to facilitate the expeditious resolution of any remaining issues,\u00e2\u0080\u009d the statement said. \u00e2\u0080\u009cThe parents are committed to act as a united front to effectuate recovery and reunification.\u00e2\u0080\u009d Basically this means the couple is going work together, but it also means we won\u00e2\u0080\u0099t be in the loop going forward, which isn\u00e2\u0080\u0099t necessarily a bad thing for the couple. This new statement comes after a judge initially denied Brad\u00e2\u0080\u0099s request for privacy in his custody battle. Last month the actor asked for the custody documents to be sealed, but they were not. Angelina\u00e2\u0080\u0099s lawyers felt Brad only wanted to protect himself and not the childrens\u00e2\u0080\u0099 well-being.\n\nThe New York Post News Corp Australia Network\n\nONE year after parting ways with Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie has revealed she\u2019s still dealing with the negative effects.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been difficult. I don\u2019t enjoy being single,\u201d the mother of six told the UK\u2019s Sunday Telegraph . \u201cThere\u2019s nothing nice about it. It\u2019s just hard.\u201d\n\nJolie and Pitt were together a total of 12 years and married for just two years before calling it quits in September 2016.\n\n\u201cSometimes maybe it appears I\u2019m pulling it all together,\u201d the 42-year-old actress said. \u201cBut really I am just trying to get through my days.\u201d\n\nWhile Jolie continues to sort out the details of her life, she\u2019s also been facing some health concerns.\n\nIn 2013, the Maleficent actress underwent a double mastectomy, she also had her ovaries removed in 2015. And earlier this year, she revealed she\u2019s dealing with hypertension and developed Bell\u2019s Palsy.\n\n\u201cEmotionally it\u2019s been a very difficult year,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I have some other heath issues. So my health is something I have to monitor.\u201d\n\nTaking it a step further, she describes how her body is doing.\n\n\u201cI feel sometimes that my body has taken a hit, but I try to laugh as much as possible,\u201d she said. \u201cWe tend to get so stressed that our children feel our stress when they need to feel our joy. Even if you are going through chemo, you need to find the ability to love and laugh. It may sound like a postcard, but it\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nNow that Jolie doesn\u2019t have any acting or directing projects on the table and her kids are getting older, she will refocus her time.\n\n\u201cI think now I need to rediscover a little bit of the old me,\u201d she says. \u201cI think we lose our way a bit. I have had a lot happen in my life, from certain people passing to health issues to raising the children. And it\u2019s been a very good time to absorb and develop and grow.\u201d\n\nIt comes after the former couple\u2019s biographer, Ian Halperin, told The Mail on Sunday that they are \u201cback together\u201d after intense spiritual counselling.\n\nBrad Pitt opens up about bitter divorce with Angelina Jolie 1:57 Brad Pitt speaks out about the alcohol abuse that led to his divorce with Angelina Jolie.
