We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why they\u2019re putting off the big commitment.\n\nSo many celebrity couples these days are getting engaged after dating for mere weeks. Yet Blake Shelton, 42, and Gwen Stefani, 48, are coming up on three years together this fall without getting betrothed. They\u2019re wildly in love, yet the country singer still hasn\u2019t put a ring on the beautiful blonde\u2019s finger. It turns out that their incredible success is standing in the way of an engagement and marriage. \u201cWith Gwen\u2019s Vegas residency and Blake\u2019s constant touring and duties with The Voice there really isn\u2019t anytime to get married. And instead of getting engaged and waiting forever to get married they want to be in a spot where they can do both quick and the way they want to do it,\u201d a source close to the couple tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cTheir careers just need a bit of a break before that happens and they aren\u2019t interested in slowing down right now. So they just have to settle down to settle down,\u201d our insider adds. Gwen just kicked off her Just A Girl Las Vegas residency at the Zappos Theater at Planet Hollywood on June 29 and shows no sign of slowing down. Meanwhile Blake is busy with his Country Music Freaks tour through August. Then he segues into shooting the upcoming season of NBC\u2019s The Voice.\n\nThe Blakester still took time out of his busy schedule to be there for Gwen\u2019s opening night in Vegas. He sweetly sat with her three sons as he looked on in adoration of his talented lady. The \u201cHollaback Girl\u201d singer even showed off backstage video on her Instagram of youngest son Apollo, 4, seated comfortably on Blake\u2019s lap in her dressing room when she finished her show. They\u2019re already like one big family without being married. In these days of quickie engagements like Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson after only three weeks of dating, it\u2019s refreshing to see a couple who has taken so much time bonding and growing so close yet not feeling the rush into marriage.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F10%2Fblake-shelton-gwen-stefani-putting-off-engagement-reason-careers%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3236345", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/screen-shot-2018-07-10-at-8-44-27-pm.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/rob-kardashian-struggling-to-accept-tristan-thompson-after-cheating-why-hes-so-protective-of-khloe-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/gwen_blake-happy-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/kendall-jenner-helping-hailey-baldwin-cope-with-wendy-williams-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/younger-recap.jpg?w=200&resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/irina-shayk-seashells-nipples-topless-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15476338&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://0.gravatar.com/avatar/629a3bdca6d1b82dbc92a7226593390f?s=64&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tiffany-trump-hamptons.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/gwen_blake-happy-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Bobcat-Goldthwait_Steve-Dietl2FtruTV-e1531251649343.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/gwen_blake-happy-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831/https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/10/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-putting-off-engagement-reason-careers/", "title": "Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani: Why They\u2019re Putting Off An Engagement Despite Being In Love", "meta_data": {"description": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani have been putting engagement plans on hold and we have the shocking reason why.", "news_keywords": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton & Gwen Stefani: Why They\u2019re Putting Off An Engagement Despite Being In Love", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180711053831/https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/10/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-putting-off-engagement-reason-careers/", "description": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani are more in love than ever but still haven\u2019t become engaged.
