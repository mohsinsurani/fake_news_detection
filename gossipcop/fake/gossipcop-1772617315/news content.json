That's the claim being made by the National Enquirer. They say that the \"wild child\" daughter of Michael Jackson has gone completely off the rails and that her family is concerned that she might be doing drugs to cope with the stress of her new modelling and acting career.\n\nBut Gossip Cop has looked into the rumors that Paris is currently doing drugs now, and it looks like they are false.\n\n\"The family worries the stress of Paris's booming modeling and acting career has catapulted her into substance abuse,\" one 'source' said to the National Enquirer, as reported by Gossip Cop.\n\nThe Enquirer also claims that The Jacksons are concerned about health of the matriarch and patriarch of the family, Katherine and Joe. \"The Jackson parents, both in their 80s, are fading fast,\" the source claims.\n\nParis had a very difficult adolescence after her father died. In an interview with Rolling Stone, she revealed that she was sexually assaulted at age 14. She also admitted she had cut herself, attempted suicide \"multiple times,\" and had been using drugs as well. Tattoos now cover the scars and track marks from the drug abuse.\n\nBut as for whether she is using drugs now, Gossip Cop interviewed her press rep who told them that the claims made by the National Enquirer were unfounded.\n\nSince her stint in rehab, Paris seems to be doing a lot better. She's currently signed to IMG models and has started acting as well, with a recent guest role on Fox's Star.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/14800743-abae-4146-ae2e-3b7a37ab5d23.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4440466/is-paris-jackson-doing-drugs-amid-scary-family-crisis/", "title": "Is Paris Jackson Doing Drugs Amid Scary Family Crisis?
