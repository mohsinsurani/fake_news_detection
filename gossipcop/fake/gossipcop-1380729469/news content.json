Back in the late 1960s, early 1970s. That was back during the time where, you know, drugs were going to expand our minds and everybody was experimenting and everything. We were really getting high, we didn't know it. And cocaine at that time was considered harmless. You know. I remember magazine articles in People Magazine of doctors saying it is not addicting. It is just\u2014alcohol is worse. So I think we all fell into that. But that's not the way it was.\" When asked if he believed he had ever been addicted to the drugs, he responded, \"It was a gradual thing. But it got to the point where I couldn't have any fun unless I had it. Which is a bad place to be.\" Later in the interview he said, \"But I saw myself being dead in about five years if I didn't stop.\"[52]\n\nPolitical views [ edit ]\n\nIn a 2018 interview with The New York Post, Quaid stated he was a registered independent and has voted for both Democratic and Republican candidates, saying that he did not consider himself an adherent to any particular ideology; though he did opine that Ronald Reagan was his favorite U.S. president of his lifetime.[53] In April 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic, Quaid stated that President Donald Trump was handling the pandemic well, calling him \"involved\".[54] He subsequently recorded an interview with infectious disease expert Anthony Fauci as part of an advertising campaign by the Department of Health and Human Services to \"defeat despair\" surrounding COVID-19.[55] Quaid later denied the ad was political in nature.[56]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nHome video [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 1997 Sesame Street: Kids' Guide to Life video series Uncle Tommy Video: \"Telling the Truth\"\n\nViewpoint with Dennis Quaid [ edit ]\n\nViewpoint with Dennis Quaid is a series of short films focused on public-interest topics that is hosted by Dennis Quaid.
