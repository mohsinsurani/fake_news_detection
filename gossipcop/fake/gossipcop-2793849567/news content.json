Shortly after their breakup, Holmes has been linked to actor Jamie Foxx when they were spotted dancing together in the Hamptons.\n\nRecently, a Radar! (opens in new tab) report surfaced that the couple had been planning a secret wedding and decided to split because Holmes, 39, had a \"sudden change of heart\" and \"couldn't get over her trust issues.\" However, Holmes' rep completely shut down the rumors. \"The Radar story is 100 percent untrue,\u201d she told People (opens in new tab).\n\nThe pair has technically never even confirmed their relationship in the first place. (Foxx left an ESPN interview (opens in new tab) when he was asked directly about Holmes and their Valentine's Day date.) They did, however, sit next to each other at Clive Davis' Pre-Grammy Awards Gala (opens in new tab) in January and were very loving and affectionate. They were also spotted on many date nights (opens in new tab), but made sure to be coy about it (opens in new tab).\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nIn December, Holmes also attended Foxx's 50th birthday party (opens in new tab) along with Leo DiCaprio, Snoop Dogg, Tobey MacGuire, and more celebs. Foxx's daughters were also there, but Suri Cruise was nowhere in sight (opens in new tab). (Perhaps a little too old of a scene for a 12-year-old.)\n\nThere's no rulebook that says any celebrity has to confirm or deny their relationship to the world, which makes it pretty nice that Holmes and Cruise can live their lives without answering to anybody.\n\n", "images": ["http://www.marieclaire.com/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/marieclaireus/missing-image.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KAsnvLga9RBXqBsQ2mjFHa-1200-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/7gaLHNLbC8RZseoTduRMzV-415-80.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/KAsnvLga9RBXqBsQ2mjFHa-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Epstein", "Andrea Park", "Jenny Hollander", "Julia Marzovilla", "Mehera Bonner", "The Editors", "Katherine J Igoe", "Bianca Rodriguez", "Neha Prakash", "Window.Slicecomponents"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a21999270/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-break-up/", "title": "Are Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Dating?
