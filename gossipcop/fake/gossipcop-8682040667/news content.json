Wife Kim Kardashian was quick to jump to his defense, tweeting to her fans it was unfair to label her husband 'mentally ill' because he has always been 'expressive.'\n\nIn 2016, Kanye spent time in a psychiatric facility due to a mental breakdown.\n\nNow, Life & Style has explosively claimed today that the rapper's problems are more serious than ever, with insiders claiming they've led to the disintegration of his four year marriage.\n\n'Kim is in talks with lawyers about getting a divorce,' a friend close to Kim told Life & Style. 'Kanye's acting more unpredictable than ever. Things have gotten so bad that Kim and Kanye sleep in separate rooms.'", "images": ["https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "https://www.newidea.com.au/media/111517/ni42_magshop_edm.jpg?height=158", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2693548590922384&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/0bc89bf7f17d33e09d14130166a65c45/5B8489ED/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/29714616_2102061949866296_390033350313639936_n.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Georgia Mars", "Georgia Mars Is A Digital Content Editor At New Idea Magazine.
