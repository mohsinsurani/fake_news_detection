The reality TV stars were allegedly all denied an invite to the star-studded event \u2014 Leonardo DiCaprio, Sylvester Stalone, Kerry Washington and Alicia Vikander were among those who did make the cut, in case you were wondering \u2014 after a source tells the outlet Kris Jenner rubbed some people the wrong way with her sloppy behavior at a previous party. \u201cKris Jenner went years ago and got drunk and no one liked that,\u201d the insider explained to the magazine. HollywoodLife.com has reached out for further comment.\n\nYikes! How bad could her behavior have been to get her entire family banned from the event? While it\u2019s no secret that Kris is a fan of her vodka drinks \u2014 it\u2019s been a running storyline on Keeping Up With The Kardashians for several seasons now \u2014 it\u2019s well-known that the majority of her daughters aren\u2019t big on drinking, which makes this whole thing seem rather unfair, don\u2019t you think?\n\nIn fact, in it was Khloe Kardashian who recently opened up about her family\u2019s sober ways, admitting that while she and Kris may love their cocktails, the same doesn\u2019t necessarily hold true for the rest of the family. \u201cKimberly does not drink alcohol whatsoever,\u201d Khloe told Elle magazine. \u201cPregnant or not, she\u2019s just never been into it. Kendall and Kylie are not into it. Even when Kendall goes to Europe where the drinking age is 18, she\u2019s never\u2014Kendall\u2019s really focused and determined.\n\n\u201cKourtney used to drink a lot more in college and probably before she had kids. She\u2019s literally been pregnant for, like, six years or breastfeeding, so I think that has obviously changed her life now,\u201d she continued. \u201cMy mom has a drink every night with dinner. That\u2019s her thing, and that\u2019s what she loves to do. I don\u2019t like the taste of alcohol like that, so if I drink, I drink for intent. Like, I don\u2019t care to just have a glass of wine. No, I want to get f**king buzzed or drunk. That\u2019s the point!\u201d\n\n\n\n\n\nStill, that\u2019s not to say that the Kardashians haven\u2019t had their sloppy moments in years past. In fact, it was in a recent episode of KUWTK that we saw a totally wasted Khole go off on Kris during her spectacular Great Gatsby-themed 60th birthday party. In the episode, Kris was just about to give a speech thanking all of her friends and family for celebrating with her when KoKo ripped the mic out of her hand and said, \u201cno one cares about her f**king speech.\u201d Yikes! Maybe there was a good reason to ban the Kardashians after all.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about the Kardashians reportedly getting banned from the Oscar pre-party?
