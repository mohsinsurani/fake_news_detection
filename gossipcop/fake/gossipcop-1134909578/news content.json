The two met to make the final decision on Valentine\u2019s Day.\n\nAs for her future, \u201cshe isn\u2019t a fan of dating, and she never was. She always found dating awkward and unpleasant,\u201d an Aniston source explains. \u201cShe hates all the media attention that she knows she will get now. But she is a big believer in falling in love and spending her life with a partner that loves sharing hers.\u201d\n\nIn the new issue, sources close to the pair detail how Aniston and Theroux\u2019s clashing lifestyles drove them apart \u2014 and how powerful chemistry first drew them together. They wanted to start a family early in their relationship, but it didn\u2019t work out. And longtime L.A. dweller Aniston\u2019s attempts to adapt to Theroux\u2019s New York City-based lifestyle \u201cmade her miserable,\u201d says the source close to her, while Theroux was never comfortable in her luxurious but insular L.A. world. \u201cThey couldn\u2019t find common ground that made them both happy. It became exhausting and frustrating.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jennifer Aniston \u2018Has Seemed Fine\u2019 Since Split from Justin Theroux, Will \u2018Continue to Be Friends\u2019\n\nDespite all the time they spent apart, they tried to save their marriage.\n\n\u201cFor many months they tried to make it work. They even had therapy,\u201d says the source.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty\n\nAnd while \u201cit seems Justin gave up many months ago,\u201d says the source, Aniston only \u201cvery recently started telling friends that they were over.\u201d\n\nThe Image Direct\n\nAniston \u201cseems okay\u201d in the wake of the split, says the source. \u201cShe has an amazing life that she loves and is very grateful for. Jen would be the first one to say that she is a lucky girl.\u201d", "images":
