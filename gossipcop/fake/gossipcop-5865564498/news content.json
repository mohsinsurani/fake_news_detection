Despite some hoping they\u2019d work it out, the two filed for divorce in April 2017. Supposedly, Ben wasn\u2019t ready to let go, as Us Weekly reports that since they filed the papers, \u201che\u2019s begged her to come back several times, but she has no interest.\u201d Though Ben has moved on to date Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, he was reportedly, at one point, telling friends he wanted his ex back.\n\nDespite two years of trying to fix things \u2013 Jennifer \u201cput her heart and soul into fixing the relationship and so desperately wanted to turn things around for the children\u2019s sake, as well as theirs,\u201d a fiend told Us \u2013 it was all in vain. Supposedly, there was a hopeful moment in 2017. After Jennifer reportedly helped Ben during his stint in rehab for alcohol abuse, a source claims he said, \u201cHe didn\u2019t want to live without her. Things looked positive\u2026they both wanted it to work. Though some observers thought \u201cit was like they were together again,\u201d it just wasn\u2019t meant to be, and the couple went ahead with the divorce filing.\n\nDespite this report, people shouldn\u2019t get too excited for a happy reunion. \u201cThere is no truth here,\u201d a source close to the exes EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com about this report. Though the source denied Ben\u2019s \u201cbegging,\u201d the insiders said that Ben and Jennifer \u201chave much love and admiration for each other.\u201d\n\nEven Us Weekly\u2019s report claims that Ben\u2019s cries were falling on deaf ears. \u201cShe forgave him for such much and still he couldn\u2019t change,\u201d a source tells Us. \u201cShe feels it\u2019s important to keep the peace and be a family unit,\u201d but when it comes to romance, \u201cshe\u2019s not going there at all.\u201d She and Ben will still spend time together, but it will be only for the benefit of their children. \u201cShe just wants her kids to heave a healthy, happy and engaged father \u2013 and she\u2019ll do whatever it takes to make that happen.\u201d\n\n[\n\nWhile Ben has moved on to Lindsey, what about Jen? She\u2019s reportedly been on a few dates \u2013 one with an \u201cAffleck look-alike.\u201d Jennifer is \u201cready to go with her feelings and give love another try. It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that Ben broke her heart and left her in a terrible place emotionally, [but] it\u2019s been almost three years since they called it quits. It\u2019s time for her to move on.\u201d", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-call-off-divorce-rex-ftr.jpg?w=311", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-divorce-2.jpg?w=292", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/moneyspells.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ben-affleck-reportedly-begging-jennifer-garner-for-second-shot-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-happy-leaving-marriage-counseling-ffn.jpg?w=365", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ben-affleck-reportedly-begging-jennifer-garner-for-second-shot-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/ben-affleck-reportedly-begging-jennifer-garner-for-second-shot-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Katherine Speller", "Meghan Rose", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/14/are-ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-getting-back-together-split-breakup/", "title": "Ben Affleck Reportedly Begging Jennifer Garner For Second Shot At Love: Will She Go Back To Him?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ben Affleck has reportedly been 'begging' Jennifer Garner to take him back, but we've got the EXCLUSIVE on if they'll reunite.", "news_keywords": "Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "author": "Jason Brow", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ben Affleck Reportedly Begging Jennifer Garner For Second Shot At Love: Will She Go Back To Him?", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/14/are-ben-affleck-jennifer-garner-getting-back-together-split-breakup/", "description": "Is there a chance that Ben Affleck and Jennifer Garner will get back together?
