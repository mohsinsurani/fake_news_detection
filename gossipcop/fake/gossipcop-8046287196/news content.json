In her cover story for the magazine\u2019s December 9 issue, she opened up for the first time about her amicable split from The Weeknd and reigniting her on-off relationship with Justin Bieber.\n\n\u201cSomething that I\u2019m really proud of is that there\u2019s such a true friendship [between us],\u201d the \u201cBad Liar\u201d singer, 25, said of her October breakup with The Weeknd, 27, whom she dated for 10 months. \u201cI truly have never experienced anything like that in my life. We ended it as best friends, and it was genuinely about encouraging and caring [for each other], and that was pretty remarkable for me.\u201d\n\nAs for Bieber, 23, entering her life once again, Gomez said, \u201cI\u2019m 25. I\u2019m not 18, or 19, or 20. I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn\u2019t right. But that doesn\u2019t mean caring for someone ever goes away.\u201d\n\nThat goes for \u201cpeople in general,\u201d she added. \u201cI mean, I grew up with Demi [Lovato]. Nick and Joe [Jonas] and Miley [Cyrus] \u2014 we\u2019ve gone through seasons in our lives. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as serious as people make things out to be half the time. It\u2019s just my life. I grew up with all of these people, and it\u2019s so cool to see where everybody is. It comes back to the idea of me remaining full. I think a true representation of love is beyond just yourself. \u2026 The littlest things are impactful.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly exclusively revealed earlier this month that the Disney alum and the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d crooner are back together three years after they broke up. \u201cSelena and The Weeknd just fizzled and ended amicably \u2014 it wasn\u2019t dramatic and it wasn\u2019t about Justin. But Selena always had feelings for Justin,\u201d a source told Us at the time. A second insider countered that The Weeknd (real name Abel Tesfaye) \u201ctrusted Selena, but he really didn\u2019t trust Justin.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-talks-the-weeknd-split-justin-bieber-reunion/", "title": "Selena Gomez Talks The Weeknd Split, Justin Bieber Reunion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Selena Gomez opened up about her amicable split from The Weeknd and reigniting her on-off relationship with Justin Bieber \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez Breaks Silence on The Weeknd Split, Justin Bieber Reunion", "description": "Selena Gomez opened up about her amicable split from The Weeknd and reigniting her on-off relationship with Justin Bieber \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-talks-the-weeknd-split-justin-bieber-reunion/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:13:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-30T19:05:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:13:43+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Selena Gomez Breaks Silence on The Weeknd Split, Justin Bieber Reunion", "description": "Selena Gomez opened up about her amicable split from The Weeknd and reigniting her on-off relationship with Justin Bieber \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/selena-gomez-the-weeknd-justin-bieber.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512068748.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
