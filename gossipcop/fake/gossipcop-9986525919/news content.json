We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on why her boyfriend Blake Griffin will be MIA.\n\nFor Blake Griffin, 28, his sports career comes first. It seems like the superstar athlete will be bringing in the New Year playing basketball, instead of kissing his model girlfriend Kendall Jenner, 22, at midnight. \u201cBlake has been injured for a bit but he is practicing again and looking to get back to playing very soon and ahead of schedule and he is looking for New Year\u2019s Eve to be the day he returns. With that schedule, he may have to meet up with Kendall later than expected or not spend the holiday with her unless she goes to the game. But his intentions are more to get back to the team then to hang out with Kendall. He is eager to get back to his job,\u201d a source close to Blake tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nThis news should come as quite the treat for Blake\u2019s teammates and fans, who feared he\u2019d succumb to the \u201cKardashian Curse\u201d or \u201cJenner Jinx.\u201d After seeing what happened to fellow basketball players Lamar Odom, 38, and Kris Humphries, 32, many feared that dating Kendall would negatively impact Blake\u2019s performance. Although Blake slammed those accusations, it\u2019s clear that he\u2019s taking no chances and is making basketball his number one priority.\n\nEven though the couple will not be together for New Year\u2019s Eve, Kendall will be able to spend time with Kylie Jenner, 20, who will also be without her beau, Travis Scott, 25. Travis will be preforming at LIV Nightclub in Miami, FL on Dec. 31. At least the sisters will have each other!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Blake Griffin choosing basketball over Kendall Jenner?
