However, the Jenners' creative director, Elizabeth Killmond-Roman, clarified that the two had numerous Skype and FaceTime calls with Sloan to discuss the content of the novel.[39] The novel was mostly panned by critics, and sold only 13,000 copies in its first four months on sale.[40] The book was also given a sequel, Time of the Twins, which was also co-authored by the Jenner sisters.\n\n2015\u20132018: Rise of Kylie Cosmetics\n\nKendall (left) and Kylie Jenner, 2016\n\nThe Jenner sisters were booed while introducing brother-in-law Kanye West's performance at the Billboard Music Awards in May 2015.[41] In May 2015, an episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premiered in which Jenner admitted to getting a lip augmentation.[42] Her enhanced lips from lip fillers created speculation and gained her publicity. Prior to the episode's debut, Jenner stated that she merely used lip liner and over lined her lips.[43] As a result, the practice of suctioning one's lips into a small glass in order to induce greater blood flow to swell the lips was called the \"Kylie Jenner Challenge\" (though there was no indication that Jenner herself employed this method).[44] Jenner responded to this by stating, \"I'm not here to try & encourage people/young girls to look like me or to think this is the way they should look.\"[45] In August 2015, Jenner announced that she would be launching her first lipstick line as a part of her self-titled lip kit under the name Kylie Lip Kit.[46] In November 2015, the Jenner sisters appeared in singer Justine Skye's \"I'm Yours\" music video.[47]\n\nIn February 2016, Jenner's cosmetic company was renamed to Kylie Cosmetics and the number of kits produced rose from an initial 15,000 to 500,000.[48] Jenner released a three-minute-long promotional video for a series of lip glosses in March 2016, directed by Colin Tilley and starring fellow models Karin Jinsui, Mara Teigen, and Jasmine Sanders.[49][50][51][52][53] The song in the video was revealed to be \"Three Strikes\" by Terror Jr, a band created on the same day as the release of the video; however, the lead singer, who was later revealed to be singer Lisa Vatale,[54] was heavily speculated to be Jenner herself.[55][56][57][58] However, Jenner subsequently denied any involvement with the band.[59][60] In May 2016, she made her musical debut rapping on producer Burberry Perry's song \"Beautiful Day\", with Lil Yachty, Jordyn Woods, and Justine Skye.[61] The next month, Jenner starred in another PartyNextDoor's music video for his song \"Come and See Me\".[62] In April 2017, she made a surprise appearance at the Rio Americano High School prom in Sacramento alongside junior Albert Ochoa after hearing that his date had turned him down.[63][64][65]\n\nIn June 2017, Jenner was placed at number 59 on the Forbes Celebrity 100, which calculates the 100 highest-paid celebrities of the previous 12 months, after earning approximately US$41,000,000, making her the youngest person on the list at 19 years old.[7]\n\nJenner starred in a reality show revolving around her life, Life of Kylie,[66] which premiered in August 2017.

It was reported that Global Brands Group (GBG) previously listed the Kendall + Kylie brand on its website. As a result, the Jenners stated that their company is owned by a separate entity known as 3072541 Canada Inc. even though they say that their brand \"has worked with CAA-GBG in the past, in a sales and business development capacity only\" and that they \"do not currently have any relationship at all with GBG\".[85] In August 2020, Kylie Cosmetics launched Summer Sailor collection which marked the launch of Jenner's first-ever false lashes.[86] In the same month, she made a cameo in Cardi B and Megan Thee Stallion's \"WAP\" music video, alongside singers Normani and Rosal\u00eda; a petition asking that Jenner's cameo be edited out of the video reached over 65,000 signatures.[87]\n\nJenner topped the Forbes list of highest paid celebrities for 2020.[88]\n\nIn August 2021, Jenner teased Kylie Swim, a new swimwear line that includes sizes for all women.[89] On September 17, it was officially launched on Kylie Jenner's website.[90] On September 21, she announced a new skincare and hair product line for babies, called Kylie Baby.[91]\n\nIn January 2022, Jenner became the first woman to gain 300 million followers on the social network service Instagram, surpassing the previous recordholder, singer Ariana Grande.[92]\n\nPersonal life\n\nRelationships\n\nIn August 2014, Tyga was seen getting close with Jenner at her 17th birthday party.

The magazine claimed she had a net worth of $900 million and that she was on the verge of becoming the youngest \"self-made\" billionaire.[125] This would beat Mark Zuckerberg, who became a billionaire at age 23.[126] However, the publication's use of the term \"self-made\" sparked widespread criticism and jokes online.[127] Critics argued that Jenner was already born into fame and fortune.[128] Some discussions took a more serious tone, with journalists writing pieces on wealth distribution, inequality and inheritance, as well as upward mobility in society.[129][130][131] However, celebrities such as Jenner's half-sister Kim Kardashian and socialite Paris Hilton have come out and defended Jenner, legitimizing assertions that she is indeed self-made, while Hilton who was born into the Hilton family also described herself as self-made.[132][133]\n\nIn May 2020, Forbes released a statement accusing Jenner of forging tax documents so she would appear as a billionaire.[14] The publication also accused her of fabricating revenue figures for Kylie Cosmetics.[14] The same day, Jenner responded in a series of tweets, writing: \"What am I even waking up to? I thought this was a reputable site... All I see are a number of inaccurate statements and unproven assumptions lol. I've never asked for any title or tried to lie my way there EVER. Period\". Jenner's attorney also demanded that Forbes retract the statements, calling the magazine's accusations \"unequivocally false\". Forbes reacted, stating that they spent months uncovering the facts and concluded that their \"extensively-reported investigation was triggered by newly-filed documents that revealed glaring discrepancies between information privately supplied to journalists and information publicly supplied to shareholders\".[134] However, Jenner became the youngest person on Forbes's list of 100 Richest Self-Made Women in October 2020. She is the only person on the list in her 20s, and is worth $700 million.[135]\n\nCultural appropriation\n\nJenner has been accused of appropriating African-American culture and style.[136] In 2016, Jenner was criticized for posting a photograph of herself wearing cornrows on Instagram.[137] In June 2017, urban streetwear brand PluggedNYC accused Jenner of stealing their designs for her collection of camouflage swimwear.[138]\n\nUnderpaying factory workers\n\nRemake, a non-profit labeled Global Brands Group as the manufacturer for the Kendall + Kylie clothing line.[139] The organization claimed that money was being withheld from workers in the factories despite having finishing their work.
