And it is a terrifying thing to do. We don\u2019t see the career opportunities women lose because of sexual harassment or the intense stress it causes a woman dealing with it when she comes to work each day. I am thinking of those women this morning and hoping they are okay. The days to come will not be easy.\u201d\n\nNBC News announced Wednesday morning that Lauer, who had anchored the Today Show for more than two decades, had been fired following accusations of sexual misconduct. \u201cWhile it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over twenty years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident,\u201d NBC News Chairman Andrew Lack said in a statement.\n\nKelly, who was at Fox when sexual harassment allegations against now deceased chairman Roger Ailes emerged, said she is confident NBC will weather the storm.\n\n\u201cThe good [news organizations] stay standing and forge forward, fulfilling their core mission: Journalism,\u201d she said.\n\nWrite to Alana Abramson at Alana.Abramson@time.com.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/matt-lauer-megyn-kelly.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jesse-Bryant-skiing-at-JHMR-e1612191790559.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/matt-lauer-megyn-kelly.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alana Abramson"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5040781/megyn-kelly-matt-lauer-fired/", "title": "Megyn Kelly Reacts to NBC Firing Today Show's Matt Lauer", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Megyn Kelly opened her\u00a0Today show\u00a0by addressing the termination of her colleague Matt Lauer, who was accused of sexual misconduct", "og": {"title": "Megyn Kelly Reacts to Matt Lauer's Termination From NBC", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5040781/megyn-kelly-matt-lauer-fired/", "description": "\"This one does hit close to home\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/matt-lauer-megyn-kelly.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5040781/megyn-kelly-matt-lauer-fired/", "description": "Megyn Kelly opened her\u00a0Today show\u00a0by addressing the termination of her colleague Matt Lauer, who was accused of sexual misconduct", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/matt-lauer-megyn-kelly.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5040781/megyn-kelly-matt-lauer-fired/", "title": "Megyn Kelly Reacts to Matt Lauer's Termination From NBC", "description": "\"This one does hit close to home\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/matt-lauer-megyn-kelly.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
