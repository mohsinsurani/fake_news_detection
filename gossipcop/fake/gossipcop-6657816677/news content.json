Time\n\nFrom Alex Rodriguez's appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, it's apparent he is confident of two things regarding his relationship with Jennifer Lopez: the day they met is \"the luckiest day of (his) life\" and if you have her love, you better pick up the phone.\n\n\"If she calls me and I don't pick up, forget it,\" the former pro-baller revealed to DeGeneres on Monday's show.\n\n\"You're in trouble?\" the host asked.\n\n\"I've been in board meetings and (said), 'Time out, board, \" he said. \"You got to answer her call.\"\n\nMore: JLo gives a shout-out to A-Rod, covers Prince at pre-Super Bowl show\n\nMore: Jennifer Lopez reveals her own Me Too story: 'I was terrified'\n\nBut it seems A-Rod doesn't always return the favor as he left DeGeneres hanging, when she tried to call him from Lopez's phone to chat, backstage at her Vegas show.\n\nThe comedian pressed her luck again to see if the Shades of Blue star would answer her beau's FaceTime. (Meanwhile we have not been so intrigued by Lopez's phone activity since Leonardo DiCaprio called her \"boo-boo\" in a text conversation during \"Carpool Karaoke\" in 2016.)\n\nLopez did answer the phone and assured DeGeneres \"I always pick up when he calls,\" seemingly taking a shot at her man. How often does she answer calls from DeGeneres? \"Occasionally\" JLo cracked, getting a huge laugh from the audience.\n\nMore: Jennifer Lopez, Alex Rodriguez open up about hard times, including the years after 'Gigli'\n\nMore: Seth Rogen says Stormy Daniels told him about alleged Trump affair a decade ago", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6515de01d38e332fde2db21fb7aeb26c2be0c922/c=386-68-1804-869/local/-/media/2018/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636588568118532710-Rozman-20180403-15130-0208r.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5766961483001_5766958733001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6515de01d38e332fde2db21fb7aeb26c2be0c922/c=386-68-1804-869/local/-/media/2018/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636588568118532710-Rozman-20180403-15130-0208r.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Jensen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/04/09/alex-rodriguez-facetimes-jennifer-lopez-ellen-degeneres/498248002/", "title": "Alex Rodriguez says if you want Jennifer Lopez's love, you have to answer her calls", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/04/09/alex-rodriguez-facetimes-jennifer-lopez-ellen-degeneres/498248002/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Alex Rodriguez says if you want Jennifer Lopez's love, you have to answer her calls", "description": "If you have Jennifer Lopez's love, you better pick up the phone.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6515de01d38e332fde2db21fb7aeb26c2be0c922/c=386-68-1804-869/local/-/media/2018/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/636588568118532710-Rozman-20180403-15130-0208r.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "If you have Jennifer Lopez's love, you better pick up the phone.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523228400.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
