Yes, really.\n\nIn the mean time, Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott just had their GQ cover, but they\u2019re not limiting their PDA to magazines. They\u2019re also cozying up on social media.\n\nAfter rumors of the two breaking up after a massive fight, this may be an effort to silence those stories.\n\nPhoto via GQ\n\nKylie Jenner used her social media savvy to build her brand \u2014 and an (almost) billion-dollar makeup empire.\n\nBut Travis Scott is no stranger to social media. He even still uses Snapchat!\n\nAnd it was on Snapchat that the rapper shared a cuddly PDA photo of him with Kylie.\n\nThe black-and-white photo is simply captioned \"first ferdi.\"\n\nWhile Ferdi can be short for Ferdinand, in this context, it is simply slang for \"a very cute-ass boy.\" We\u2019re not joking.\n\nRecently, Kylie and Travis were reportedly in a heated argument.\n\nIt was said to have started while the two were having dinner, with the young couple leaving dinner in a huff after only 45 minutes.\n\nAccording to eyewitnesses, the situation seemed to have deteriorated further once they returned to the hotel room, because Travis apparently left the hotel room in a hurry.\n\nIn fact, it was even speculated that Kylie had kicked Travis out for the night, but that was purely speculation.\n\nA lot of people have felt that the couple who conceived just weeks after they began dating and whom many believe are only together because of Stormi are just not a great match.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nSo, are they trying (and failing) to make it work just to remain together for Stormi\u2019s sake?\n\nAs part of her interview for their recent GQ cover, Kylie wrote that it is \"normal\" for them to get \"in a little fight\" from time to time\n\n\"When we fight, it\u2019s usually just because we\u2019ve been away from each other for too long and we didn\u2019t see each other for, like, two weeks,\" Kylie explains.\n\nThat sounds pretty toxic. Isn\u2019t absence supposed to make the heart grow fonder?\n\n\u201cAnd we have Stormi now,\" Kylie says. \"And I can\u2019t travel with her. She\u2019s too young. So it\u2019s harder to see each other.\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nSo, usually, Kylie stays at home with Stormi while Travis goes on tour to rap, and apparently to do his best DoodleBob impression.\n\nIf this very normal dynamic between the two of them is really causing them to fight, then it probably speaks to deeper, underlying issues, right?\n\nWe don\u2019t know what these arguments are about on the surface.\n\nBut couples who argue a lot \u2014 and we cannot stress enough that, no matter what you saw or heard on teen dramas, that is not healthy \u2014 tend to have unspoken reasons for disagreements.\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just Kylie missing Travis or vice-versa.\n\nOr maybe it\u2019s Kylie resenting that her life has been totally transformed while Travis goes on tour whenever he wants to.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nKylie continues to avoid showing her baby\u2019s face in order to punish fans who made up rumors about her having a different baby daddy.\n\nBeing a celebrity and a parent can lead to a lot of difficult choices, including how much exposure \u2014 if any \u2014 a baby should receive.\n\nBut Kylie and Travis may feel, as many fans believe, that they are obligated to stay together for Stormi\u2019s sake.\n\nBeing a parent comes with a host of obligations, but staying in a toxic relationship is not one of them.\n\nSure, this sweet, cuddly photo that they shared might mean that they\u2019ve made nice \u2026 but, realistically, how long is that going to last?", "images":
