The chronically on-again, off-again couple are taking time apart (opens in new tab), but are reportedly still thinking about each other very much.\n\nThis week, Gomez has been teasing the release of her new single, \"Back to You,\" which will appear on the 13 Reasons Why Season 2 (opens in new tab) soundtrack.

He will always be her first real love, and she thinks about him all the time....Selena thinks he is one of the most talented guys she has ever known, and she listens to his music almost every day.

Then, in April, Bieber posted a slew of workout pics that some thought were intended (opens in new tab) for Gomez.\n\nIf the caption is a lyric from the track and the lyric is about Bieber, it certainly wouldn't be the first time the singers had shared their story through song (opens in new tab).", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lgx8sQA9jGg3pN7UfomBgA-1200-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/6aMvhnYW8WCwovfowgiJjF-415-80.jpg", "http://www.marieclaire.com/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/marieclaireus/missing-image.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lgx8sQA9jGg3pN7UfomBgA-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kayleigh Roberts", "Weekend Editor", "Iris Goldsztajn", "Mehera Bonner", "The Editors", "Andrea Park", "Katherine J Igoe", "Bianca Rodriguez", "Neha Prakash", "Rachel Epstein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a20194892/selena-gomez-secret-message-justin-bieber-back-to-you/", "title": "Selena Gomez May Have Sent a Secret Message to Justin Bieber in Her Latest Instagram", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2018-05-06T07:32:05+00:00", "description": "Selena Gomez's latest Instagram caption might be a secret message for Justin Bieber and a hint that her new song will be about him.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/l0uowirhzd1627591128.svg", "og": {"site_name": "Marie Claire Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lgx8sQA9jGg3pN7UfomBgA-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez May Have Sent a Secret Message to Justin Bieber in Her Latest Instagram", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a20194892/selena-gomez-secret-message-justin-bieber-back-to-you/", "description": "The saga continues."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire", "published_time": "2018-05-06T07:32:05Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-06T07:32:05.583Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "44xdshDo5pyXokKDVhsxxb", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-05-06T07:32:05Z", "parsely-title": "Selena Gomez May Have Sent a Secret Message to Justin Bieber in Her Latest Instagram", "parsely-link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a20194892/selena-gomez-secret-message-justin-bieber-back-to-you/", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lgx8sQA9jGg3pN7UfomBgA.jpg", "parsely-section": "Celebrity", "parsely-tags": "Category: Celebrity,Category: News,celebrity,standard-article,serversidehawk", "parsely-author": "Kayleigh Roberts", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@marieclaireus", "title": "Selena Gomez May Have Sent a Secret Message to Justin Bieber in Her Latest Instagram", "description": "The saga continues.", "creator": "@marieclaireus", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/Lgx8sQA9jGg3pN7UfomBgA-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 15469402}, "google-site-verification": "G8uYPAX70T_vfdmDhxnUNSykxtjRTkSvHhloGBWT6R8", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a20194892/selena-gomez-secret-message-justin-bieber-back-to-you/"}, "botify-site-verification": "gEo2ltw4ZxjJkBcaADHlIGePpMrucY2w", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525591925.0, "source": "http://www.marieclaire.com", "summary": ""}
