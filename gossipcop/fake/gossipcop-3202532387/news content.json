Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, are \u201cvery much in love,\u201d a source exclusively tells Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cThey have quite a low-key relationship, which Taylor likes,\u201d the insider reveals. \u201cIt\u2019s very normal, and no one really knows about it right now. They just work out, watch movies together and invite friends over. Taylor loves to cook and bake for him. They are still taking it slow.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear exactly when the \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d singer, 27, and the British actor, 26, began dating, but their relationship first made headlines in May. Prior to Alwyn, she dated Tom Hiddleston from June to September 2016 and Calvin Harris from March 2015 to June 2016.\n\nThe ultra private couple may finally be ready to make their public debut, though. \u201cExpect to see them step out together really soon,\u201d a source exclusively told Us in September. \u201cIt\u2019s often been Taylor\u2019s M.O. to be seen with a new guy first, have her new single drop and then announce her new album. But this time, she\u2019s kept the guy private. And that\u2019s pretty interesting. She really likes Joe.\u201d\n\nThe Billy Lynn\u2019s Long Halftime Walk actor is \u201csupportive of her career choices,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cShe\u2019s very happy.\u201d\n\nAnd Swift appears to be smitten too. She released her new single \u201cGorgeous\u201d on Friday, October 20, and the song is packed with lyrics about love. \u201cOcean blue eyes, looking in mine / I feel like I might sink and drown and die,\u201d she sings. \u201cYou\u2019re so gorgeous.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-love.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-love.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-love.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-joe-alwyn-are-very-much-in-love/", "title": "Taylor Swift and Boyfriend Joe Alwyn Are 'Very Much in Love'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Exclusive", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, are 'very much in love,' a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details on the couple's relationship!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn Are 'Very Much in Love': Details!", "description": "Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, are 'very much in love,' a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details on the couple's relationship!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-and-boyfriend-joe-alwyn-are-very-much-in-love/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:23:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-love.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-love.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-10-20T22:47:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:23:45+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn Are 'Very Much in Love': Details!", "description": "Taylor Swift and her boyfriend, Joe Alwyn, are 'very much in love,' a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details on the couple's relationship!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-love.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508539661.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
