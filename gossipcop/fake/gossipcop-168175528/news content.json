(Selena\u2019s no alcoholic)\n\nSpeaking to Gossip Cop, Mandy Teefey wants to clear things up. First, she talks about Selena\u2019s battle with Lupus.\n\n\"When you are young, you feel invincible and she had to learn that she was not able to be your typical 20 year old.\"\n\nThat is so sad. But, of course, Mandy is so glad that Selena received a life-saving kidney transplant.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\n\"Beyond blessed that we had Francia in our life,\" she said.\n\nFrancia Raisa made a truly powerful, selfless choice. And a dangerous one. Having a kidney removed is no joke.\n\nMandy says that, during the surgery, she was a \"wreck inside not only for my daughter, but for Francia and her family.\"\n\nOf course. That had to be a weird feeling. And, understandably, Mandy was very, very emotional throughout the ordeal.\n\n\"I am pretty sure I am banned from that hospital [now].\"\n\nThat\u2019s a lot of nice stuff about Francia, but \u2026 how does Mandy describe Selena?\n\n\"Brave and fearless.\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nAbsolutely. To share her struggle with Lupus with the world, to share the news of her kidney transplant surgery, is a big deal.\n\nBut living her life every day, to the fullest, the way that Selana does is truly an act of courage.\n\n\"I was so proud of her bravery.\"\n\nRemember, folks \u2014 that kidney transplant wasn\u2019t a cure. Lupus has treatments, but no cure. And Selena\u2019s case of Lupus seems to be especially severe.\n\nSo, now that she\u2019s being directly interviewed, how does Mandy feel about Selena\u2019s latest reunion with the Biebs?\n\n\"Not happy.\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nThat much, we knew, but it sure would have been interesting if Mandy were pretending that it\u2019s totally fine.\n\n\"Selena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe, and healthy.\"\n\nThose are some very reasonable caveats.\n\nPhoto via Coach/Instagram\n\nBut the relationship that she describes having with Selena isn\u2019t exactly the feud that we\u2019ve been hearing about.\n\n\"Every mother and daughter has disagreements.\"\n\nAnd Mandy denies that her relationship with her daughter began to crumble in 2014 when she stopped being Selena\u2019s manager.\n\nWe\u2019d heard reports that Selena\u2019s reunion with Bieber was just one source of conflict.\n\n\"We never expected to manage her her whole life. We lost family time because the only time we saw her, we talked business.\"\n\nWe were going to say that sounds like no fun, but Mandy beat us to it.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\n\"It was no longer fun for any of us, like it was when she was younger and we had to be with her because she was a minor.\"\n\nMandy sounds determined to quash the feud rumors, saying of Selena:\n\n\"She is 25 years old and knows what is at stake with her health. I do not control her the way it has been portrayed.\"\n\nWell, surely no one really believed that Mandy was somehow giving her adult millionaire celebrity daughter a curfew.\n\n\"Selena is an adult and can make her own choices.\"\n\nThat\u2019s very true. We don\u2019t have to agree with Selena\u2019s choices in order to like her, folks.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/selena-gomez-at-her-childhood-home.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/mandy-teefey-and-selena-gomez-671x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/francia-raisa-selena-gomez-together.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/justin-bieber-shirtless-tattoos.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20500'%3E%3Crect%20width='500'%20height='500'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/selena-gomez-for-coach-760x1024.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20682%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='682'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20457%20655'%3E%3Crect%20width='457'%20height='655'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20760%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='760'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20581%20695'%3E%3Crect%20width='581'%20height='695'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20702'%3E%3Crect%20width='600'%20height='702'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/selena-gomez-mandy-teefey-split.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20671%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='671'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/selena-gomez-mandy-teefey-split-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/selena-gomez-and-francia-raisa-kidney-donation.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/leah-remini-poses-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/kendall-and-blake-320x240.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20568%20699'%3E%3Crect%20width='568'%20height='699'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-blonde-in-a-floral-print-682x1024.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/selena-gomez-mandy-teefey-split.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/01/mandy-teefey-speaks-out-mother-of-selena-gomez-wants-to-quash-fe/", "title": "Mandy Teefey Speaks Out; Selena Gomez, Mom Look to Quash Beef Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mandy Teefey Speaks Out; Selena Gomez, Mom Look to Quash Beef Rumors", "description": "Selena Gomez is back with Justin Bieber.
