Lawrence denied them, and explained that they only met once a few years ago.\n\nEven though the speculation was false, she admitted that she didn't mind being paired with Pitt.\n\n\"No,\" she said. \"I've met him once in like, 2013, so it was very random, but I also wasn't like, in a hurry to debunk it.\"\n\nSpeculation of Lawrence and Pitt dating surfaced in December 2017, with reports stating that Pitt \"had his eye on Jennifer for years\" and they were \"enjoying lots of late nights together.\"\n\nLawrence has been single since she split with Darren Aronofsky, who directed \"Mother!,\" in 2017 and Pitt has been single since he split with Angelina Jolie in 2016.\n\nLawrence also isn't the first actor to be linked to Pitt. In November 2017, Kate Hudson appeared on \"Watch What Happens Live\" and addressed the reports that she was dating Pitt. Like Lawrence, she didn't seem to mind the report and called it \"kind of awesome.\"\n\n\"I kind of liked it,\" Hudson said. \"I was like, 'OK, fine. We're having twins!'\"\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5dbb2c4d311d60081c3d2d12?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a9971468d602660008b4584?width=1200&format=jpeg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a9971058a438d5a008b458a?width=700", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "http://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a9971468d602660008b4584?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Singh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lawrence-brad-pitt-dating-reports-watch-what-happens-live-video-2018-3", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence finally addressed the reports that she's dating Brad Pitt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence finally addressed the reports that she's dating Brad Pitt", "datePublished": "2018-03-02T15:54:02Z", "dateModified": "2018-03-02T16:05:42Z", "news_keywords": "Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt, watch what happens live, Bravo, TV, Olivia Singh", "description": "While appearing on Bravo's \"Watch What Happens Live\" to promote \"Red Sparrow,\" the actress admitted that she \"wasn't in a hurry to debunk it.\"", "author": "Olivia Singh", "article": {"publisher": "insider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Culture", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Lawrence finally addressed the reports that she's dating Brad Pitt", "description": "While appearing on Bravo's \"Watch What Happens Live\" to promote \"Red Sparrow,\" the actress admitted that she \"wasn't in a hurry to debunk it.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lawrence-brad-pitt-dating-reports-watch-what-happens-live-video-2018-3", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5a9971468d602660008b4584?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Jennifer Lawrence finally addressed the reports that she's dating Brad Pitt", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-02", "sailthru.tags": "Jennifer Lawrence, Brad Pitt, watch what happens live, Bravo, TV, Olivia Singh", "sailthru.description": "While appearing on Bravo's \"Watch What Happens Live\" to promote \"Red Sparrow,\" the actress admitted that she \"wasn't in a hurry to debunk it.\"", "sailthru.author": "Olivia Singh", "sailthru.verticals": "culture", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5a9971058a438d5a008b458a?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5a9971058a438d5a008b458a?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "Insider": "Snapchat", "Jennifer Lawrence finally addressed the reports that she's dating Brad Pitt": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"bii-imgalt": "jennifer lawrence brad pitt watch what happens live dating reports"}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 1413475698959824}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.insider.com/jennifer-lawrence-brad-pitt-dating-reports-watch-what-happens-live-video-2018-3?fbia"}, "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"newsletter-email-input": "control"}, "viking-id": "5a9966588d60262b008b4577", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2021-08", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519948800.0, "source": "http://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
