Kim Kardashian, 37, is reportedly at her wits end when it comes to dealing with husband Kanye West, 40. She\u2019s struggled since Kanye\u2019s terrifying November 2016 breakdown, and she reportedly can\u2019t see a light at the end of the tunnel, according to an insider who spoke to Star Magazine. \u201cBetween his raging ego and mood swings, Kanye has been a total train wreck,\u201d the insider alleged to the Star. \u201cKim is stressed enough raising two kids and getting ready for the baby without Kanye dragging her down. She\u2019s tried to hang in there, but she just can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\nPoor Kim! We can\u2019t imagine how hard it must be to have a family member \u2014 especially your husband \u2014 go through such a huge health scare. Of course she\u2019s stressed! If they\u2019re truly divorcing, things are about to get crazy. She allegedly doesn\u2019t want to make any moves until after their third baby, which they\u2019re having via surrogate, is born. As the source says, she\u2019s totally fine raising the little one as a single mother. She\u2019s Kim effing Kardashian!\n\n\u201c[Their divorce] will be all-out war,\u201d the insider told Star. Kim has reportedly asked Kanye to sign a \u201cmid-nuptial agreement\u201d to protect her assets. Factoring in their revenue, from Kanye\u2019s music, the KUWTK empire, and Kim\u2019s various deals, including KKW beauty, it could be a $1 billion divorce!\n\nDon\u2019t think she\u2019s happy about this, though. \u201cThis decision is agony for her,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe still loves Kanye, but their marriage may be over!\u201d This is so sad, considering what we just learned from a source. Kim and Kanye were happily including daughter North West in the conversation about her new little sister, the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. If they\u2019re truly having problems, then at least they\u2019re putting on a united front for their little ones.\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Kim\u2019s rep for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kim and Kanye are really divorcing? Let us know!", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kim_kanye-ftr.jpg", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-rex-gallery-02.jpg?w=293", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/moneyspells.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-rex-gallery-01.jpg?w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kim_kanye-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-rex-gallery-03.jpg?w=440"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kim_kanye-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Wilson", "Katherine Speller", "Meghan Rose", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/20/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-getting-divorced-report/", "title": "Kim Kardashian & Kanye West Divorcing After Surrogate Baby Born?
