Kylie is happy with their living situation,\u201d a source close to Jenner, 20, tells PEOPLE. \u201cTravis is a great dad. When he wants to work, Kylie is supportive.\u201d\n\nThe source adds that the Kylie Lip Kit creator \u201chas everything she needs right now and seems very happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor being so young, she is very chilled out about her relationship with Travis,\u201d adds the source. \u201cShe isn\u2019t making any huge plans for the future.\u201d\n\nDays after the birth of their daughter, an insider said that the couple is \u201cnot in rush\u201d to get married and are \u201cjust enjoying their little family.\u201d\n\nThe pair has been dating since April 2017, after Jenner split from heron-again, off-again boyfriend of nearly three years, Tyga \u2014 and another source recently told PEOPLE that her relationship with Scott, 25, is very different, saying: \u201cHe\u2019s very protective of Kylie, and his family embraced her, too.\u201d\n\nAlthough Jenner was initially looking to family and close friends to help out with caring for Stormi, she has since \u201chired some help.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe knows she can\u2019t rely on [mom Kris Jenner] every day and hired some help for the baby,\u201d said a second source. \u201cKris is helping out as much as she can, but she also runs a business and has her own life.\u201d\n\nWATCH: New Parents Kylie Jenner & Travis Scott Are \u2018Not Officially Living Together\u2019\n\nAmong those close to and supporting the new mom is Jordyn Woods, Jenner\u2019s best friend.\n\n\u201cKylie and Jordyn are super close. They have the best friendship,\u201d says the source. \u201cJordyn is very excited about the baby. She helps out as well and stays with Kylie.\u201d\n\nAfter months of secrecy, Jenner revealed that she had given birth earlier this month. Stormi weighed in at 8 lbs., 9 oz., and arrived at 4:43 p.m. local time.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions,\u201d Jenner wrote to fans as she revealed her baby news on Instagram. \u201cI understand you\u2019re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world.\u201d\n\nContinued Jenner, \u201cI knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how. There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\u201d\n\n\u201cPregnancy has been the most beautiful, empowering, and life changing experience I\u2019ve had in my entire life and I\u2019m actually going to miss it,\u201d she said. \u201cI appreciate my friends and especially my family for helping me make this special moment as private as we could. My beautiful and healthy baby girl arrived February 1st and I just couldn\u2019t wait to share this blessing. I\u2019ve never felt love and happiness like this I could burst! Thank you for understanding.\u201d", "images":
