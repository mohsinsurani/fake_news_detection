Yet, the close-knit clan has stubbornly refused to confirm this. Like most open secrets, it\u2019s become almost frustrating. More frustrating than those two friends in your circle that everyone knows are secretly dating but refuse to admit it. More frustrating than knowing someone is throwing you a surprise birthday party but not knowing the exact details. More frustrating even than when someone you know keeps saying they\u2019re staying out of politics, but occasionally makes vague Facebook status that makes you think they\u2019re a secret Trump supporter. Yes, more frustrating than even that.\n\nIn the process, though, the Kardashian-Jenners have turned the presumably inevitable announcement and their surrounding anticipation into events on their own. It\u2019s not even a question of \u201cif\u201d that\u2019s interesting anymore, but rather \u201chow\u201d and \u201cwhen\u2026. no seriously when? We\u2019re all waiting. There\u2019s a lot going on in the world right now. We have better things to think about.\u201d\n\nWell, at least one confirmation may be coming our way sometime sort of soon, if the latest preview of Keeping Up With The Kardashians is any indication. The trailer begins with Kris Jenner (in that blonde wig) and her three eldest daughters sitting around a table and presumably all cosplaying as powerful female crime lords, as Kris proposes, \u201cLet\u2019s raise a glass to Kris f\u2014\u2014 Jenner.\u201d Then they run through matters of Rob\u2019s whole situation with Blac Chyna, Kendall\u2019s anxiety issues, and a tarantula before we get to someone murmuring the phrase, \u201cDid you guys hear what\u2019s on TMZ?\u201d Then Kourtney says, \u201cI\u2019m so sick of people like not saying anything.\u201d (Yeah, us too.) Eventually, though, we wind up at a party where there\u2019s tears of joy and everyone is hugging Khloe. It definitely seems like a pregnancy announcement situation.\n\nSo, perhaps that\u2019s how the Khlo\u00e9 konfirmation goes down, almost as we all should have expected it, during a super-hyped episode of the family\u2019s show.\n\nThat leaves the matter of Kylie, who, save for some iPhone-shot footage, is as conspicuously absent from the preview as the part of her body below her neck is from her Snapchats. Some fans have theories about how her pregnancy could be revealed. Kim is currently teasing the family\u2019s Christmas card shoot on Instagram in a sort of 25 day long digital advent calendar: Khlo\u00e9 made her first full appearance today, but Kylie has been missing. Might she and her baby bump appear on day 25? Or could she too be waiting to reveal her news on the show?\n\nHere\u2019s another curious matter to consider when mulling the timing: the trailer in question is for the second half of this season, which will begin on January 7th next year. So we may make it through the rest of 2017 without confirmation of either. What\u2019s another few weeks at this point? Then again, what\u2019s the point of calling the show Keeping Up With The Kardashians if we\u2019re all way ahead of it anyway?\n\nEither way, the\u2019ve managed to keep attention on this mystery for far longer than they should have. As they say in the trailer, \u201cLet\u2019s raise a glass to Kris f\u2014\u2014 Jenner!\u201d\n\nRelated: Kris Jenner Finally Opens Up About Her Daughters Pregnancies: \u201cIt\u2019s Like a Faucet That We Turned On and Won\u2019t Turn Off", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/30/1f0c6da9-47bd-4693-a50d-a9a62daa8aad-309288039_971043807619371_5785063958279885749_n.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.3787&fp-y=0.2505", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/12/13/5a31a096499a6c4ea286ad36_khloe-kardashian-pregnancy-reveal.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/8/29/9f122c0b-8ad0-4d04-b2cf-3379547870db-tswifty.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.532&fp-y=0.228", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/12/13/5a31a096499a6c4ea286ad36_khloe-kardashian-pregnancy-reveal.jpg?w=414&h=219&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/12/13/5a31a096499a6c4ea286ad36_khloe-kardashian-pregnancy-reveal.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/keeping-up-with-kardashians-teaser-khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-pregnancy", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner May Not Confirm Their Pregnancies Until 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@munzenrieder"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/keeping-up-with-kardashians-teaser-khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-pregnancy", "type": "article", "title": "We May Have to Wait Until 2018 for Kardashian Pregnancy Confirmations", "description": "Keeping up?
