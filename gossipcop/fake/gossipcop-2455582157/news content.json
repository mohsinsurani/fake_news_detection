There is no official word from the camp of the singer born as Madonna Louise Ciccone about a possible move, though the 54-year-old pop icon has always maintained close ties with Italy, the home of her ancestors.\n\nMadonna\u2019s personal donation of $500,000 to help the victims of the devastating 2009 earthquake in Abruzzo was at first larger than the aid from the U.S. government. She has also opined periodically on Italian affairs, and has been a vocal critic of media tycoon and former Italian Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi.\n\nVIDEO: Madonna Turns 54: Her Top 5 Hits\n\nMadonna\u2019s directorial effort, W.E., which told the story of the love story between British King Edward VIII and American divorcee Wallis Simpson, premiered at the Venice Film Festival last year.\n\nBut she has also been attacked repeatedly by the Vatican, which called the video for her 1989 hit \u201cLike a Prayer\u201d \u201cblasphemous\u201d for its visions of burning crosses, statues that cried blood and a scene where Madonna herself seduced a black actor playing Jesus Christ. In 2004, she was also criticized for promoting the Kabbalah religious belief, which the Vatican considers to be a threat to Roman Catholicism.\n\nMost recently, church officials blasted her for the decision to sing while hanging from a crucifix during a 2006 concert in Rome. After that show, Cardinal Ersilio Tonino, speaking for Pope Benedict XVI, said, \u201cThis time the limits have really been pushed too far. She should be excommunicated.\u201d\n\nShe last attracted headlines in Italy in June, when during another concert in Rome, Madonna flashed her buttocks, revealing her black undergarments and fishnet stockings, to the delight of concertgoers.\n\nRome has been a popular destination for the entertainment world\u2019s elite since the Dolce Vita days of the 1950s and 1960s.
