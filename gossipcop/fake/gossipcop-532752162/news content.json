The model has responded to speculation that she\u2019s pregnant in the funniest \u2014 and most relatable \u2014 way possible.\n\nJenner retweeted an article questioning whether not she was expecting on Saturday, December 30, and hilariously wrote, \u201ci just like bagels ok!!!\u201d\n\ni just like bagels ok!!! https://t.co/4IxM9ECLOs \u2014 Kendall (@KendallJenner) December 31, 2017\n\nAs previously reported, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star posted a bathroom selfie on Friday, December 29, wearing a black-and-white polka dot dress. The 22-year-old model captioned the selfie \u201cloner life\u201d with an alien emoji. The photo shows Jenner, who routinely flaunts her bare midriff in crop tops and shows off her lean figure, showcasing what some thought was a bump. The photo sent fans into a frenzy as they wondered whether or not she was the fourth woman in her famous family to be expecting. Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are pregnant, while Kim Kardashian is expecting her third child via a surrogate any day now.\n\nWhile Kylie is remaining mum about her pregnancy, multiple sources have confirmed to Us Weekly that she is pregnant with her first child with Travis Scott in early 2018.\n\nJenner\u2019s response prompted her followers to defend the reality star. One wrote, \u201cWhat gives people the right to judge her body shape/size? I\u2019m sure if she wasn\u2019t a Jenner/Kardashian then this would be called body shaming? Not ok people.\u201d Another asked, \u201cWhy must she be \u2018pregnant\u2019. It\u2019s the season of good food, good wine and good company\u2026 honestly.\u201d\n\nOne fan simply commented, \u201cYou don\u2019t even look \u2018preggers\u2019 smh.
