We dropping soon! About to be crazy! A post shared by Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) on Apr 10, 2017 at 8:13pm PDT\n\nIt is not known if the coats are real of fake fur but Khole appeared to make no attempt to correct users criticising them for their controversial fashion choice.\n\nChloe Lattanzi was particularly upset.\n\nOlivia Newton-John\u2019s daughter reposted a pic of Kourtney in a white coat with a drink in hand.\n\nRELATED: Kardashian \u2018knew OJ was guilty\u2019\n\nKhloe previously declared she would never wear fur despite dropping her support for animal rights group, People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals.\n\nKhloe had been an ambassador for PETA and featured on billboards for the organisation.\n\nHowever she cut ties to the group in 2012, when she discovered they were linked to a woman who attacked Kim with a flour bomb.\n\nBlac Chyna Banned From Using 'Kardashian' Name Professionally 1:02 Blac Chyna has reportedly been banned from using the \"Kardashian\" name professionally. Ref: SPL1473126 030417 Video by: SNTV / Splash News\n\nKhloe released a statement at the time.\n\n\u201cHi dolls. I\u2019m sure you all heard what happened to Kim last week (thank you SO much for the love and support you all showed her), and I just received word that the woman responsible has very close ties to PETA, despite PETA publicly stating otherwise,\u201d the statement read.\n\n\u201cNot only has PETA lied to the public, but they have proved that they support this kind of behaviour.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been a vocal supporter of PETA for a long time but I have also been very vocal about anti-bullying, so this was a huge disappointment for me.\n\n\u201cAs you all know, I don\u2019t condone violence and bullying and what happened last Thursday was just that.\n\n\u201cI am absolutely disgusted by their behaviour. Everyone is entitled to their own beliefs and opinions \u2014 I personally don\u2019t wear fur but that doesn\u2019t mean I am going to force my views on anyone else, ESPECIALLY by violating them.\n\n\u201cI am a very proud sister right now, because Kim handled last week\u2019s incident like a champ. She got cleaned up and was back out there in a matter of minutes. Go Kimmie!\n\n\u201cWe all need to practice what we preach. I will still continue to NOT wear fur, but I will no longer support PETA. Bullying and harassment is NEVER a solution, and I won\u2019t be a part of any organisation that thinks otherwise.\u201d", "images":
