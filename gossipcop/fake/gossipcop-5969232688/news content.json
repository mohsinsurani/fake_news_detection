More info\n\nSpeaking with the Express.co.uk, Tracey Cox, a body language and relationships expert and TV presenter, suggested the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are both the \u201cstar\u201d in the relationship. Ms Cox said: \u201cThere is something about them that is very similar. \u201cSame approach to the world, they both like to have a bit of fun, they very quickly settled in to the appropriate level of affection. \u201cTheir body language shows nobody is at the bottom of the relationship and that is because it is an unusual situation with her being a Hollywood celebrity and him being the star.\n\n\u201cUsually there is only one star in the relationship.\u201d When asked how this compares to the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge\u2019s \u201cmannerisms\u201d, Ms Cox said: \u201cKate very much knows William is the star.\u201d She added: \u201cHer body language shows she is quite subservient to him. \u201cWhereas with Harry and Meghan their body language is completely different.\n\nMeghan and Harry's body language shows they are very different from William and Kate\n\n\u201cI can't see any power struggle, and she has got a level of saying.\u201d Ms Cox explained her claims and suggested the reason why the two Royal couples have got such different relationships is because the pressure is on Prince William, who is third in line to be king. Ms Cox said: \u201cThis is why Meghan and Harry can have public display of affection in public while William and Kate tend not to. \"They can be a bit more modern and affectionate.\"\n\nMeghan and Harry can have public display of affection in public while William and Kate tend not to", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/996038.jpg",
