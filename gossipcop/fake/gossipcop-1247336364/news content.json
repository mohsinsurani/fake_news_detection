As we reported earlier, new claims have surfaced alleging that Jennifer and Josh Duhamel, 45, are dating! Although this news calls for celebration, not everyone is ready to say congratulations. Jen\u2019s ex is not too thrilled about her new fling! \u201cThere were rumors going around about Jen and Josh last year. They did a movie (Love, Simon) together and there was a lot of talk at the time about them hooking-up. Everyone who saw them on set together said they had really obvious chemistry. Jen had filed officially filed for divorce from Ben and Josh was already separated from Fergie, so they were well within their rights. That didn\u2019t stop Ben from getting really jealous though,\u201d a source close to Ben tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cHe was asking around about it. It\u2019s fine for Ben to move on and be with whoever he wants, but he\u2019s not ready to see Jennifer do the same. Ben\u2019s not at all mentally prepared for Jennifer to be with another guy, especially not someone like Josh Duhamel \u2014 he\u2019s threatened,\u201d the source continued. We can totally understand Ben\u2019s jealousy. Jen and Ben were married for over 10 years and have three children together: Violet Affleck, 12, Samuel Garner Affleck, 5, and Seraphina Rose Elizabeth Affleck, 9. But, it\u2019s certainly time for Jen to move on. After all, Ben recently started dating SNL producer Lindsay Shookus, 37.\n\nJennifer and Ben officially filed for divorce in April 2017. They originally announced their split two years prior. Their divorce seemed amicable and friendly! Despite their split, \u201cBennifer\u201d have managed to effectively co-parent their children. They even spent the 2017 Holidays together! So sweet!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Ben Affleck has the right to be jealous of Jennifer Garner\u2019s new relationship?
