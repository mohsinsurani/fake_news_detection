The exes shared a \"friendly\" breakfast at JOi Cafe in Westlake Village, Los Angeles, according to E!. There, the pair spent the morning get-together \"just talking,\" Us Weekly reports. Justin reportedly paid for both of their meals.\n\nTMZ\n\nThey were also photographed going to church together that morning. According to other churchgoers, Bieber and Gomez sat next to each other in the congregation. Later in the evening, his car was spotted in her driveway. According to Elle.com, this apparently marks the first time the former couple has been photographed out together since 2015.\n\nBACKGRID\n\nBieber and Gomez, who were on-and-off until they officially broke up in 2014, were also seen hanging out together last week, when the Purpose singer was photographed visiting her house in Studio City. The hangout, however, took place amongst other friends and Selena's then-boyfriend, The Weeknd, wasn't present, but he was apparently cool with her hanging out with Justin again.\n\nYesterday, however, fans noticed that The Weeknd (n\u00e9e Abel Tesfaye) began to unfollow some of Gomez's friends and family members on Instagram after news broke of her Sunday hangout with Bieber.\n\nThen today, it was reported that Tesfaye and Gomez had called it quits on thier relationship after ten months together. Sources with knowledge of their split cited the distance between the couple as the main reason for the breakup; not Bieber's involvement. (Tesfaye is currently on tour.)", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2478974-012-1665067784.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "http://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-backgrid-index-1509395792.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.321xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2479931-003-1665162992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0192xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-tmz-new-1509399792.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-on-september-26-news-photo-1665065585.jpg?crop=0.941xw:1.00xh;0.0304xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665155826.jpg?crop=0.984xw:1.00xh;0.00962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/58cc63b8d55930653af0b5ce/thumb_1489789889.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665151779.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-arriving-for-lunch-at-the-abbey-of-san-news-photo-1665070515.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0551xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-backgrid-index-1509395792.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-and-gisele-b-c3-bcndchen-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1664907170.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-del-castillo-teresa-mendoza-lrds3-tlmd-2-1664910940.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0566xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-backgrid-embed-1509398878.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-justin-bieber-selena-gomez-backgrid-index-1509395792.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a13122007/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-breakfast-photo/", "title": "New Photos of Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's Breakfast Reunion Have Surfaced", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber's Breakfast Photos -
