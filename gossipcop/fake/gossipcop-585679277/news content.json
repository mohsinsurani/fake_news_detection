But many are wondering if they will ever walk down the aisle and how they will do it \u2014 so much so that a country singer has already offered to officiate their ceremony.\n\nSo what exactly are their marriage plans? Here are seven things to know, including the one country singer who wants to officiate the couple\u2019s wedding.\n\n1. Shelton might have dissed ex Miranda Lambert on Twitter\n\nAlthough Shelton and Stefani have been dating three years now, he might still have some resentful feelings for his ex-wife, Miranda Lambert.

It\u2019s karma!!\u201d on April 25.\n\nSo what could this be referring to? In Touch Weekly reports Lambert has moved on to dating Evan Felker who is still technically married to Staci Felker. Felker filed for divorce in February of 2018. He reportedly struck up his relationship with Lambert after the split.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re figuring it out. It\u2019s in the early stages; they\u2019re still getting to know each other,\u201d an insider said. There also might be a sore spot there because Miranda Lambert, Blake Shelton, and Gwen Stefani were in the same room recently for the American Country Music Awards.\n\nShelton and Stefani mostly stuck to themselves.

It\u2019s been on the cover of all the credible magazines!\u201d\n\nNext: A source said this is how they really feel about marriage.\n\n\n\n3. A source said they are happy with their relationship the way it is\n\nAlthough there have been reports that the couple could be getting married, there are sources saying it\u2019s not really a priority for them.\n\n\u201cThere is no reason for them to rush into a marriage, so they aren\u2019t,\u201d a source said according to ET. \u201cBoth of them are happy and content with where their relationship is right now.\u201d\n\nNext: Stefani reveals she thinks about marriage.\n\n\n\n4.

I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s it, she can\u2019t see!'\u201d\n\nNext: This is what Shelton said about Bryan\u2019s offer.\n\n\n\n7.
