The judge presiding over Cosby\u2019s trial released the names of the 12 jurors and six alternates in the case on Wednesday.\n\nCosby faced three counts of aggravated indecent assault. Prosecutors say Cosby drugged and sexually assaulted Andrea Constand, the former director of operations for Temple University\u2019s women\u2019s basketball team, at his home near Philadelphia in January 2004.\n\nAccording to the juror who spoke to ABC News, the vote was 10-2 to convict him on charges that he digitally penetrated Constand without her consent, and 10-2 that he gave her drugs that substantially impaired her ability to resist. The vote was 11-1 to acquit Cosby on a charge that he digitally penetrated Constand while she was unconscious or unaware, the juror said.\n\nThe juror who spoke to WPXI said that the 10-2 split happened at one point but that jurors changed their votes before a tally could be sent to the judge.\n\nIn most criminal cases, verdicts must be unanimous.\n\nCNN has tried to reach most of the jurors but has not gotten responses from them. On Thursday, the door of one juror\u2019s home had a note saying, \u201cNO interviews. Please do not ring bell.\u201d\n\nA note saying \"NO interviews\" was taped to the door of a juror's home. Lawrence Crook/CNN\n\nThe juror who spoke with ABC News said tensions ran high in the too-small jury room.\n\n\u201cThey were just literally walking in circles where they were standing because they were losing their minds. People would just start crying out of nowhere,\u201d the juror said. We wouldn\u2019t even be talking about [the case], and people would just start crying.\u201d\n\nAt one point, a male juror even punched a concrete wall, possibly breaking his pinky knuckle, the juror said.\n\nJurors\u2019 names released\n\nAfter requests from media outlets, including CNN, Judge Steven O\u2019Neill decided to release the names, while keeping the jury deliberations confidential, according to a court document released Wednesday.\n\nThe document states that a disclosure of anything said or done during deliberations \u201cwould have a chilling effect upon future jurors in this case and their ability to deliberate freely.\u201d\n\nProsecutors have said they will retry the case.\n\nThe court emphasized that jurors are not allowed to disclose the opinions and thoughts of their fellow jurors as well as any arguments or comments made, or votes cast, by fellow jurors during deliberations.\n\nThe names were released to the public after the court contacted the jurors and gave them instructions.\n\nThe jurors for the trial were selected in Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, and taken to Montgomery County, near Philadelphia, where they were sequestered for the 12 days of trial and deliberations.\n\nAccording to the post-trial instructions, the judge acknowledged the freedom of the press, stating \u201cthere is no law forbidding (reporters) to question discharged jurors,\u201d and adding that a juror can decline to be interviewed at any time.\n\nThe document said the court had \u201csignificant concerns\u201d over publishing the names during the trial when attempts to interview jurors\u2019 families and friends, who would likely have contacted the jurors, would have caused \u201cconsternation and distraction from their sworn duty.\u201d\n\nThe prosecution filed a memorandum opposing the release of the names, saying it \u201ccould have a chilling effect on future jurors and could impair both parties\u2019 right to a fair and impartial trial.\u201d The defense team later joined that request.\n\nAfter balancing the rights of all parties, the court decided to release the names, the document said.", "images":
