The 33-year-old is attractive, articulate, famous and an Olympic icon.\n\nPerhaps that\u2019s too intimidating a task for single guys to tackle right now.\n\nA post shared by L I N D S E Y \u2022 V O N N (@lindseyvonn) on May 28, 2017 at 8:46am PDT\n\nFresh from winning bronze in the ladies\u2019 downhill at the recently completed Winter Games in PyeongChang, Vonn was the toast of America. She won gold in the same event at the Vancouver Winter Olympics in 2010 and Bronze in the Super-G program.\n\nThat she was able to medal in what was her final Olympic campaign was a seriously impressive effort \u2014 but not impressive enough to win her a boyfriend.\n\nVonn\u2019s list of ex-partners includes golf star Tiger Woods and NFL assistant coach Kenan Smith (they broke up in November), while she was also married to fellow skier Thomas Vonn for four years.\n\nBut she\u2019s going through a dry spell.\n\nVonn was vocal about her desire to find a man in South Korea, hoping Twitter would get the job done.\n\nSo apparently it\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day....I forgot all about it because I\u2019m at the #Olympics and I\u2019m single. Anyone else out there single and want to be my valentine? \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2640\ufe0f #worthashot \u2014 lindsey vonn (@lindseyvonn) February 14, 2018\n\nIt didn\u2019t, and neither did appearing on the red carpet at this week\u2019s Oscars.\n\nVonn attended Hollywood\u2019s night of nights with her sister Karin but while some actors left with a little gold statue, she left without even a phone number.\n\nA despondent Vonn revealed not even the after-parties provided her with any luck.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t (meet anyone),\u201d Vonn told US show Access Live. \u201cThey were all either married or dating or not available.\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t really had any offers. I didn\u2019t have one guy talk to me that wasn\u2019t married or taken at the entire night, all the after parties, not one guy at the Oscars.\u201d\n\nAnd so started a segment where hosts Natalie Morales and Kit Hoover went through celebrities to find who would be the best fit for Vonn. They couldn\u2019t believe no man would want her so made it their mission to find Vonn a partner.\n\nVonn said Mad Men star Jon Hamm was \u201cdoable, in the mix\u201d and, unsurprisingly, gave two thumbs up to Brad Pitt.\n\n\u201cYeah, sure, you guys want to facilitate that? Why not, let\u2019s go. Brad\u2019s everyone\u2019s type,\u201d she said.\n\nRapper Drake wasn\u2019t really up her alley though. \u201cHe\u2019s good looking. I\u2019ve met him a few times, but he\u2019s dated a few people that I know. I\u2019m not sure. He can make a rap song about me and I\u2019m totally fine with that,\u201d Vonn said.\n\nIf Drake was a soft no, Vonn rejected New England Patriots NFL star Rob Gronkowski by shouting it from the rooftops.\n\n\u201cI love Gronk, but that is never going to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cI can say never! It\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d\n\nFunnyman Chris Pratt sounded like he was in with a shot, even though Vonn let out an ominous \u201coohh\u201d when his name came up. It sounded like a match with Pratt would make Vonn\u2019s sister Karin happier than her, because she believes the skier needs more \u201cfunny\u201d in her life.\n\n\u201cOohh. I like Pratt, I like Chris. He\u2019s very funny. Karin says I need more funny in my life,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cI have not (met Pratt). I went to his premiere of Jurassic World but he was married at the time.\u201d\n\nWe said at the start this had nothing to do with Married At First Sight, but if you watched Vonn\u2019s appearance on Access Live, you could be forgiven for thinking the talk show had turned into a reality dating program.\n\nThink cult favourite If You Are The One only the available partners aren\u2019t there to have their say. Instead, they appear on a screen and the hosts do the matchmaking for them.\n\nIf you don\u2019t know what that show is, then chances are you\u2019re not alone on the couch at 11pm eating those tubs of ice cream while watching late night SBS.\n\nOf all the contenders, Vonn was most enthusiastic about Black Panther star Michael B. Jordan. The pair share the same stylist, and Vonn is hoping to use him to set up a first date.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very cute,\u201d Vonn said. \u201cMy stylist \u2014 he\u2019s trying to facilitate (dinner). I\u2019m trying to get the ball rolling on this one, but it hasn\u2019t happened and he\u2019s already shooting his next movie.\u201d\n\nBeautiful and talented but bang out of luck \u2014 that\u2019s not really how many people would think the world works for someone like Vonn.\n\nIt prompted a revelation you\u2019d never expect to hear from someone with her profile. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can compete (with other women),\u201d she said.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry. There\u2019s no chance of Vonn giving up on love, locking herself at home and becoming a crazy cat lady. After all, she\u2019s got dogs.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got three dogs,\u201d she said. \u201cWho needs a guy when you\u2019ve got three dogs?\u201d", "images":
