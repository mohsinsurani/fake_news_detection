During a late-October visit to by The Rachael Ray Show, the Dark Angel alum joked she was looking forward to having \"someone to love me more.\"\n\n\"When [Cash] comes home, [Haven and Honor are] like, 'Daddy!' It's like a party,\" she explained. \"When I come home, they're like, 'Oh, hey Mom.' I'm like, 'I do everything for you! I cook, I do all the things!' \"\n\nEarlier that month, the star said on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that the family was \"super stoked\" and that having a son was \"gonna be a whole situation.\"\n\nJon Kopaloff/FilmMagic\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Honestly Chic!

video, \"What's so exciting about this winter diaper reveal is that this will be the diaper [print] that the little baby in my tummy will be wearing.\"\n\nAnd although the new baby's sex is a nice bonus, what Alba was most looking forward to about caring for an infant one more time has everything to do with those first moments of new motherhood.\n\n\"Cuddling!\" she told PEOPLE in August of her most-anticipated activity once her newborn arrived. \"Cuddling babies are the best.\"", "images":
