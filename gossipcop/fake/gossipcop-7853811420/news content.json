The purpose, it seemed, was to announce his new pick for labor secretary, Alexander Acosta (opens in new tab), one day after Andrew Puzder withdrew his nomination for the position.\n\nBut after a minute or so of talking about Acosta, Trump launched into a nearly hour-and-a-half long rant in which he harshly criticized at the media, told a series of blatantly incorrect \"facts\" about how popular he was, and went off on Hillary Clinton.\n\nCelebrities had a lot of feelings about this one:\n\nKendrick Sampson\n\nThe press conferences keep getting more bizarre.
