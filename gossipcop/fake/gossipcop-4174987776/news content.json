But don\u2019t expect them to make any grand public appearances soon. Instead, the pair are going to be laying low for a while so they can have as much privacy as possible. Which means you might not see any cute couple antics on Instagram stories for a while.\n\nAccording to the latest update on their relationship, Cyrus and Hemsworth are \u201cvery much still together and have just been trying to be more private about their relationship,\u201d a source told E! News, adding, \u201cThey have been spending a lot of their time being low-key in Nashville lately, and come home to Malibu often to spend time with family.\u201d\n\nAs it turns out, the reason Cyrus deleted all her Instagram posts\u2014including ones with Hemsworth\u2014is that she\u2019s shifting how she presents herself to the world in anticipation of her next album, the followup to 2015\u2019s Miley Cyrus & Her Dead Petz and 2017\u2019s Younger Now. \u201cMiley is working on new music and rebranding herself, hence why she deleted her Instagram photos,\u201d the source says, \u201cShe is starting the process of a new music project and wants a clean slate.\u201d\n\nThat clean slate may also include wedding plans, although as of now no date has been set. \u201cWedding planning has been a continuous conversation over the years but they have not locked in any set plans,\u201d the source says. \u201cTheir family would love for them to finally tie the knot, and are very excited about it, but no one is pushing them. Miley is very simplistic when it comes to her ideas and does not want things to be an ordeal. Both Miley and Liam want to have children and they both want to be married but aren\u2019t trying to rush the process.\u201d\n\nThe last time Cyrus opened up about marriage, though, she said it wasn\u2019t something she was necessarily interested in. \u201cI\u2019m just riding this out,\u201d she said last fall. \u201cI don\u2019t envision marriage. I\u2019m 24. I hope I get to live a little bit more. I have too much living to do.\u201d This time, however, she\u2019ll be doing much of that living behind closed doors.\n\nRelated: Miley Cyrus Says Playing Hannah Montana Did \u201cExtreme Damage in My Psyche\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/20/5b51fd3919a1593a76295694_Miley-Cyrus-and-Liam-Hemsworth-wedding-plans.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/5/47b5fa0f-fc48-4cb1-9604-6f5821fa832d-getty-1430611960.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5093&fp-y=0.3502", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/20/5b51fd3919a1593a76295694_Miley-Cyrus-and-Liam-Hemsworth-wedding-plans.jpg?w=414&h=276&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/8/29/9f122c0b-8ad0-4d04-b2cf-3379547870db-tswifty.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.532&fp-y=0.228"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/20/5b51fd3919a1593a76295694_Miley-Cyrus-and-Liam-Hemsworth-wedding-plans.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-more-private-breakup", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Are Going to Be More Private After Breakup Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marissagmuller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-more-private-breakup", "type": "article", "title": "Here's Why You'll See Less of Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Together", "description": "They're still going strong despite breakup rumors.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/20/5b51fd3919a1593a76295694_Miley-Cyrus-and-Liam-Hemsworth-wedding-plans.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "They're still going strong despite breakup rumors."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
