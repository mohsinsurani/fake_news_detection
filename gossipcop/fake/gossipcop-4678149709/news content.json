Each time Channing and Jenna head to mediation to discuss the terms of their divorce, \u201cthey can\u2019t seem to agree on anything,\u201d says a source. \u201cTheir meetings have been contentious.\u201d One big issue: their five-year-old daughter, Everly. \u201cThey can\u2019t agree on custody,\u201d a friend tells In Touch exclusively.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re both working hard to do what\u2019s in the best interest of their daughter, but it\u2019s just taking way longer than they both expected because they can\u2019t agree on the small details.\u201d Another sticking point: Channing\u2019s estimated $60 million fortune. Though Jenna, 37, has had a successful movie and TV career with shows like Supergirl, Channing, 38, has starred in several blockbusters, such as Magic Mike and 21 Jump Street, and was the family\u2019s main breadwinner. \u201cJenna has told friends that she gave Channing the best years of her life,\u201d says the source, \u201cand now she\u2019s trying to negotiate a very secure future for herself.\u201d\n\nThere is a lot at stake financially. During the course of their marriage, the pair acquired several assets, including a $6 million Beverly Hills home and pricey cars including a Tesla and a vintage Chevrolet truck. Finding common ground about dividing their stuff \u201cis not easy,\u201d says the friend. \u201cThey both want it to be over with.\u201d\n\nJenna never thought it would come to this. \u201cShe isn\u2019t pleased about how it\u2019s all played out so far,\u201d says the source. \u201cShe\u2019s bitter. There are days when she\u2019s blaming him for not working harder to save their marriage.\u201d And while she\u2019s told pals that she hopes they can stay friends, adds the source, deep down \u201cshe knows that\u2019s never going to happen.\u201d\n\nChanning shouldn\u2019t underestimate Jenna, says the source: \u201cShe\u2019s looking out for herself, and at the end of the day she knows that he\u2019s got to pay. She\u2019s not going to walk away quietly.\u201d\n\nFor more on this, pick up the latest issue of In Touch \u2014 and for more exclusive content sign up for our newsletter.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/channing-jenna-tatum.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/images-production.freetls.fastly.net/uploads/images/file/3520/channingfamilypic.JPG?w=1180", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/channing-jenna-tatum.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-divorce-update-165052/", "title": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan\u2019s Divorce Is Getting Ugly (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been on a wave of", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's Divorce Is Getting Ugly (EXCLUSIVE)", "description": "Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been on a wave of growth,\u201d Jenna said recently....", "url": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/channing-tatum-jenna-dewan-divorce-update-165052/", "site_name": "In Touch Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-08-23T16:03:17+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/channing-jenna-tatum.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/channing-jenna-tatum.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/InTouchWeekly", "published_time": "2018-08-22T18:25:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-23T16:03:17+00:00"}, "author": "In Touch Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's Divorce Is Getting Ugly (EXCLUSIVE)", "description": "Since separating from Channing Tatum in April, Jenna Dewan has put a cheery spin on the end of their nine-year marriage. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been on a wave of growth,\u201d Jenna said recently....", "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/channing-jenna-tatum.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@intouchweekly", "site": "@intouchweekly"}, "fb": {"admins": 593583017, "pages": 75932763901}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/android-chrome-192x192-1.jpeg?fit=192%2C192&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1534962300.0, "source": "http://www.intouchweekly.com", "summary": ""}
