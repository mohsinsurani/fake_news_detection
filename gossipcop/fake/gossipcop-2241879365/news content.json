Jen \u2026 we\u2019re concerned.)\n\nGiven that Jen chose Scott over any of the women in the Kardashian clan, it\u2019s not surprising that certain tabloids already have these two bedding down together.\n\nIt\u2019s also not surprising that some of these same publications are casting Kourtney in the role of the insane ex:\n\nPhoto via Getty\n\nAccording to the Australian version of OK! magazine (because why wouldn\u2019t news about three American celebs reach Sydney first?), Kourtney is pissed about the possibility of Jen and Scott hooking up.\n\nIn fact, Kourt has reportedly warned Lawrence to keep her mitts off her boozy baby daddy.\n\nThe subtly-titled piece \u201cKourtney Warns J. Law: Stay Away From Scott!\u201d doesn\u2019t offer anything in the way of quotes or evidence, and instead poses an argument along the lines of \"makes sense if ya think about it.\"\n\nThe article also doesn\u2019t mention the fact that Kourtney is dating Younes Bendjima.\n\nOr that Scott is with Sofia Richie.\n\nOr that Jen was clearly joking, and her ideal dinner party would really just consist of Meryl Streep playing three different roles.\n\nPhoto via E!\n\nLook, we believe Jen when she says she genuinely enjoys Keeping Up With the Kardashians (though it\u2019s worth noting that she\u2019s said she watches the show \"to fall asleep.\" Celebrities\u2013they\u2019re as bored with the Kardashians as the rest of us!).\n\nBut there\u2019s a difference between enjoying a reality show and wanting to enmesh yourself in that world.\n\nWe like watching Naked and Afraid, but the thought of a single genital mosquito is enough to keep us inside for the bulk of 2018.\n\nHey, if the mere mention of Scott Disick doesn\u2019t bring to mind a bloodsucker who will spread disease to your nether regions, then you\u2019re not sufficiently wary of the Lord.", "images":
