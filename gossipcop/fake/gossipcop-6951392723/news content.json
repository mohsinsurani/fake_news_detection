I just have always been that girl. I will give my heart and my soul to the person that I love. It's just how I operate. With that comes a lot, you know?\"\n\nExpand Close Selena Gomez and The Weeknd attend the \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons: Art Of The In-Between\" Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 1, 2017 in New York City.

I could've had a stroke.\"\n\n\"I wanted so badly to say, 'You guys have no idea. I'm in chemotherapy. You're a**holes.' I locked myself away until I was confident and comfortable again.\"\n\nVideo of the Day\n\n\"I'm so f***ing nice to everybody, and everyone is so vile to me. I've been working since I was 7. I've been a UNICEF ambassador since I was 17,\" she says. \"It's so disappointing that I've become a tabloid story. That hate motivated me.\"", "images": ["https://www.independent.ie/incoming/3d4f7/35377094.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/bella%20use.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/929a4/35672245.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/675629644.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/27463/35672224.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/675629150.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/fa4eb/35672772.ece/AUTOCROP/h530/2017-05%201833.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/a6005/35592773.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/bella6.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/1d154/42049942.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4943273-1665188758799618.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/da0ec/35766062.ece/AUTOCROP/w620/selena.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/653bf/35232861.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/AFP_IA1OB.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/bc444/35672310.ece/AUTOCROP/w620/675648072.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/bc444/35672310.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/675648072.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/b006f/42047175.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4961475-1665098604549499.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/e6be9/42049904.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4962913-1665184326168310_10.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/166d8/35232855.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/624764458.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/d6f4d/35673077.ece/AUTOCROP/w300h168/couples.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/dc959/42048993.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4962776-1665158564360521.jpg", "https://www.independent.ie/videos/33ba9/42040030.ece/AUTOCROP/w220h124/4959364-1664901666199638.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/bc444/35672310.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/675648072.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/selena-gomez-finally-opens-up-about-her-relationship-with-the-weeknd-35766069.html", "title": "Selena Gomez finally opens up about her relationship with The Weeknd", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, viewport-fit=cover", "google-signin-client_id": "726696172496-90eva72em9kilt5siidtbppm234tq0sh.apps.googleusercontent.com", "description": "Selena Gomez has finally opened up about her relationship with The Weeknd.", "fb": {"pages": 96796398469, "app_id": 714861305308164}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=335158729, app-argument=https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/selena-gomez-finally-opens-up-about-her-relationship-with-the-weeknd-35766069.html", "og": {"title": "Selena Gomez finally opens up about her relationship with The Weeknd", "site_name": "independent", "description": "Selena Gomez has finally opened up about her relationship with The Weeknd.", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/selena-gomez-finally-opens-up-about-her-relationship-with-the-weeknd-35766069.html", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/bc444/35672310.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/675648072.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/bc444/35672310.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/675648072.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1240, "height": 700}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Independent_ie", "url": "https://www.independent.ie/style/celebrity/celebrity-news/selena-gomez-finally-opens-up-about-her-relationship-with-the-weeknd-35766069.html", "title": "Selena Gomez finally opens up about her relationship with The Weeknd", "description": "Selena Gomez has finally opened up about her relationship with The Weeknd.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.independent.ie/incoming/bc444/35672310.ece/AUTOCROP/w1240h700/675648072.jpg", "alt": "Selena Gomez (L) and The Weeknd attend the \"Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Garcons: Art Of The In-Between\" Costume Institute Gala at Metropolitan Museum of Art on May 1, 2017 in New York City.
