In one shot, the mystery guy affectionately kisses Dunham on her head.\n\nMEGA\n\nHer rep did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed in January that Dunham and Antonoff, 33, had split after dating for five years.\n\nDunham revealed in the March issue of Vogue that she underwent a total hysterectomy last year. She discussed the procedure and the outpouring of \u201coverwhelming\u201d and \u201cheartening\u201d support that she\u2019s received from fans in an emotional Instagram post, aligning the experience to her breakup.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

After \u201cdesperately\u201d trying to manage a \u201cnew level of pain\u201d from August to November, Dunham said she finally checked herself into the hospital and refused to leave \u201cuntil they stop this pain or take my uterus.\u201d\n\nDunham said the situation wasn\u2019t easy on the former couple.\n\n\u201cMy beautiful partner, who has seen me through so much pain with compassion and care, has to be away for work, and I can feel us growing slowly apart, since life is so determined to display its full complexity right now,\u201d she wrote in Vogue. \u201cI am surly and distant. I offer nothing.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe reminds me again and again that I am still a woman and still alive,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut I also know that soon \u2014 for so many reasons that have nothing to do with my uterus \u2014 we\u2019ll slip away from each other and I will face everything I am losing in impossibly tiny step.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Lena Dunham and Jack Antonoff Split After More Than Five Years Together\n\nDunham and Antonoff met in 2012 after being set up on a blind date by Antonoff\u2019s sister Rachel and comedian Mike Birbiglia.\n\nDays after PEOPLE confirmed Dunham and Antonoff\u2019s split, she briefly addressed the breakup during a livestream on Instagram, saying she was still wearing a ring that Antonoff had given her.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always wear it because love is a really cool, powerful, eternal thing,\u201d she said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t have to be defined the way that we, in Western culture, define it as beginnings and ends.\u201d\n\nAntonoff has since been linked to Carlotta Kohl; the Bleachers frontman and model sat courtside at a Knicks game a couple weeks ago.", "images":
