If we do so, our success could be as short-lived as theirs when the political winds shift, as they regularly do. The issue is too important, and too many lives are at risk, for us to leave the American people guessing from one election to the next whether and how they will acquire health insurance. A bill of this impact requires a bipartisan approach.\n\nSenators Alexander and Murray have been negotiating in good faith to fix some of the problems with Obamacare. But I fear that the prospect of one last attempt at a strictly Republican bill has left the impression that their efforts cannot succeed. I hope they will resume their work should this last attempt at a partisan solution fail.\n\nI cannot in good conscience vote for the Graham-Cassidy proposal. I believe we could do better working together, Republicans and Democrats, and have not yet really tried. Nor could I support it without knowing how much it will cost, how it will effect insurance premiums, and how many people will be helped or hurt by it. Without a full CBO score, which won\u2019t be available by the end of the month, we won\u2019t have reliable answers to any of those questions.\n\nI take no pleasure in announcing my opposition. Far from it. The bill\u2019s authors are my dear friends, and I think the world of them. I know they are acting consistently with their beliefs and sense of what is best for the country. So am I.\n\nI hope that in the months ahead, we can join with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to arrive at a compromise solution that is acceptable to most of us, and serves the interests of Americans as best we can.", "images": ["https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/840ca01/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1160x629+0+0/resize/630x342!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd1%2Fd8%2F3dec710b498196d5457f24537b6e%2F170922-john-mccain.jpg", "https://static.politico.com/d1/d8/3dec710b498196d5457f24537b6e/170922-john-mccain.jpg", "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/cb8dec3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/786x629+187+0/resize/250x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F16%2Fd5%2F4d9898df4d898b1654fa684f0b9a%2Fmccain-health-js-1160.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.politico.com/d1/d8/3dec710b498196d5457f24537b6e/170922-john-mccain.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/full-statement-john-mccain-on-voting-no-on-graham-cassidy-243030", "title": "Full statement: John McCain to vote no on Graham-Cassidy health care bill", "meta_data": {"description": "\"I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition,\" he writes.", "brightspot.contentId": "0000015e-aada-db86-a55e-fbdadb670000", "brightspot.cached": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Full statement: John McCain to vote no on Graham-Cassidy health care bill", "description": "\"I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition,\" he writes.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/09/22/full-statement-john-mccain-on-voting-no-on-graham-cassidy-243030", "image": "https://static.politico.com/d1/d8/3dec710b498196d5457f24537b6e/170922-john-mccain.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "site_name": "POLITICO"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "twitter": {"title": "Full statement: John McCain to vote no on Graham-Cassidy health care bill", "description": "\"I take no pleasure in announcing my opposition,\" he writes.", "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/975e9d3/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x650%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2Fd1%2Fd8%2F3dec710b498196d5457f24537b6e%2F170922-john-mccain.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@politico", "creator": "@politico"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "host": "www.politico.com", "build": "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506034800.0, "source": "http://www.politico.com", "summary": ""}
