The series focuses on the lives of a group of six teenage friends living in the fictional town of Point Place, Wisconsin, from May 17, 1976, to December 31, 1979.[1]\n\nThe main teenage cast members were Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Danny Masterson, Laura Prepon, Wilmer Valderrama, and Lisa Robin Kelly. The main adult cast members were Debra Jo Rupp, Kurtwood Smith, Don Stark, Tommy Chong, and Tanya Roberts.\n\nIn 1999, the show was remade by the ITV network in the United Kingdom as Days Like These using almost verbatim scripts with minor changes to cultural references.[2]\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nYoung cast [ edit ]\n\nOlder cast [ edit ]\n\nDebra Jo Rupp as Kitty Forman: Red's wife and mother of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's informally adoptive mother, Kitty is a cheerful, doting mother, but can also be assertive when pushed. A nurse by profession, she drinks heavily and is a former smoker. Her major mood swings are usually attributed to menopause, although the lack of affection and attention from her daughter (Laurie) and her mother (Bea) is also partly to blame. She is also a nurturing mother figure to Eric's rather dysfunctional friends, especially Fez.\n\nKurtwood Smith as Red Forman: Kitty's husband, father of Eric and Laurie, and Hyde's adoptive father. A conservative Navy combat veteran, he served in World War II and the Korean War. He is frequently hard on Eric and casually insults him, often calling him \u201cdumbass\u201d. Despite his mean exterior, Red also displays a soft side. His hobbies include working with his power tools, drinking beer, watching television, reading the newspaper, hunting and fishing. The producers sought Chuck Norris for the role, but the actor declined due to commitments with Walker, Texas Ranger . Smith (the only cast member born in Wisconsin) modeled his performance after his relationship with his stepfather, who died shortly before the pilot was filmed.\n\n. Smith (the only cast member born in Wisconsin) modeled his performance after his relationship with his stepfather, who died shortly before the pilot was filmed. Lisa Robin Kelly (seasons 2\u20133; recurring season 1; special appearance season 5) and Christina Moore (recurring season 6) as Laurie Forman : Eric's manipulative and dishonest older sister. She flunked out of college during the first season and moves back home with her parents. Laurie enjoys tormenting Eric and manipulating her parents. She is promiscuous, often seen with various men, mainly Eric's friend Kelso, who cheats on his girlfriend Jackie. Eric, Hyde and Donna often insult her for her promiscuity. She also has a strained relationship with her mother who thinks of her as a freeloader. She leaves the series during the third season, but returns in a recurring role during the fifth and sixth seasons. In season five, she marries Fez to prevent him from getting deported. She leaves the series part way through season 6 and is never seen again. During the seventh season, she is mentioned as having moved to Canada, where, as Eric puts it drolly, \"bottomless dancing is legal\".\n\n: Eric's manipulative and dishonest older sister.

Tanya Roberts as Midge Pinciotti (seasons 1\u20133; special guest appearance seasons 6\u20137): Bob's wife, Donna's mother, and Kitty's best friend, Midge is a woman about whom Eric and his male friends fantasize when coming of age. Although often dim-witted, she later adopts some feminist ideals. She is written out of the series in 2001 after the third season after divorcing Bob and moving to California. She returns during the sixth and seventh seasons in a limited recurring role. She is temporarily replaced in Bob's heart by the aggressive, assertive Joanne (played by Mo Gaffney).\n\nDon Stark as Bob Pinciotti: Midge's husband and Donna's father. Bob often brags about his service in the National Guard, which invariably irritates Red, a veteran of foreign wars. Bob is known for walking around his house with his robe wide open and no underwear. He eats constantly, even in bed. Bob is almost always in a good mood. His best friend is Red, who usually considers him to be a nuisance. He usually takes the brunt of Red's abuse in a jolly manner. After Midge divorced Bob in the fourth season, he began dating Joanne (in seasons four and five) and Pam Burkhart (played by Brooke Shields replacing Eve Plumb from the first season), Jackie's mother (in seasons six and seven).\n\nTommy Chong as Leo (seasons 4 & 8; special guest seasons 2\u20133 & 7): A hippie, and the owner of a Foto Hut at which Hyde once worked, Leo is an Army veteran who served in World War II, where he was awarded a Purple Heart. Leo often puts play before work and maintains an easy-going attitude in most things, business included. He disappears from the series after season four, but is later referenced in season five's \"The Battle of Evermore\" when the gang goes on a mission to find him, but with no luck. He returns in season seven and remains on the series until the show's end. In Season 8, he gets a new job working for Hyde at Grooves.\n\nEpisodes [ edit ]\n\nSeason Episodes Originally aired First aired Last aired 1 25 August 23, 1998 ( ) July 26, 1999 ( 1999-07-26 ) 2 26 September 28, 1999 ( ) May 22, 2000 ( 2000-05-22 ) 3 25 October 3, 2000 ( ) May 22, 2001 ( 2001-05-22 ) 4 27 September 25, 2001 ( ) May 21, 2002 ( 2002-05-21 ) 5 25 September 17, 2002 ( ) May 14, 2003 ( 2003-05-14 ) 6 25 October 29, 2003 ( ) May 19, 2004 ( 2004-05-19 ) 7 25 September 8, 2004 ( ) May 18, 2005 ( 2005-05-18 ) 8 22 November 2, 2005 ( ) May 18, 2006 ( 2006-05-18 )\n\nTimeline [ edit ]\n\nThe show was set in May 1976 in the August 23, 1998, premiere. After 12 episodes, the series transitioned to 1977. The 23rd episode, \"Grandma's Dead\", was also set in 1976, because it was supposed to be the season finale of season 1. The show remained in 1977 for the next two seasons. Near the end of the third season, the series transitioned to 1978 until early in the sixth season. The remaining episodes took place in 1979, and the series finale abruptly ends during a New Year's Eve party as the characters reach \"one\" during a countdown to January 1, 1980.[5] After the credits roll, the license plate from Eric's Vista Cruiser is shown with the year \"80\", indicating that the 1980s have begun.\n\nEighth season and series finale [ edit ]\n\nThe character of Eric Forman was written out of the series at the end of the seventh season, as Topher Grace wanted to move on with his career.[6] Ashton Kutcher switched to a recurring guest role when he also chose to depart following the seventh season.[6] However, Kelso had not been written out yet, so to give better closure to the character, Kutcher appeared in the first four episodes of the eighth season (credited as a special guest star). Both Grace and Kutcher would eventually return for the series finale, although the former was uncredited. Tommy Chong (who began reappearing by late season 7 after a long absence) became a regular again to help fill Kelso's role as the dimwit of the group. Eric was supposed to be replaced by his new friend Charlie, played by Bret Harrison, as an \"innocent character\", who proved fairly popular with audiences, but the character was killed off after Harrison was offered a lead role in the series The Loop.[7] Another new character named Randy Pearson, played by Josh Meyers (brother of Late Night host Seth Meyers), was introduced to take the place of both Eric and, to a lesser extent, Charlie.[8] Another new character, Samantha, a stripper played by Jud Tylor, was added as Hyde's wife for nine episodes. The location of the show's introductory theme song was changed from the Vista Cruiser to the circle.\n\nThe eighth season was announced as the final season of the show on January 17, 2006,[9] and \"That '70s Finale\" was filmed a month later on February 17, 2006, first airing on May 18, 2006.[10]\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nTitle [ edit ]\n\nThe working titles for the show were:\n\nHowever, due to song-rights refusals (including The Who's Pete Townshend) and Fox Network's deeming Feelin' All Right less than memorable, co-creator Bonnie Turner suggested that the show should be titled That '70s Show, after hearing an audience member saying \"I loved that show about the '70s.\" It was at that point where it ultimately became the official title for the show.[11]\n\nElements of the show [ edit ]\n\nThe 1970s [ edit ]\n\nThe show addressed social issues of the 1970s such as sexual attitudes, generational conflict, the economic hardships of the 1970s recession, mistrust of the American government by blue-collar workers, and underage drinking/teenage drug use. The series also highlighted developments in fashion trends,[12] the entertainment industry, including the television remote (\"the clicker\"), reruns, VCR, and cable TV; the video games Pong and Space Invaders; the cassette tape and Disco; MAD magazine; and Eric's obsession with Star Wars.[13] The show has been compared to Happy Days, which was similarly set 20 years before the time in which it aired.[14]\n\nBeginning with season 5, each episode in the series is named after a song by a rock band that was famous in the 1970s: Led Zeppelin (season 5), The Who (Season 6), The Rolling Stones (season 7), and Queen (season 8, except for the finale, titled \"That '70s Finale\").[15]\n\nThe circle [ edit ]\n\nThe circle illustrated the teens' marijuana use, usually in Eric's basement. The picture is of the final scene of the series.\n\nIn the circle, a group of characters, usually the teenagers, sit in a circle (generally in Eric's basement, though occasionally elsewhere), as the camera pans, stopping at each character as they speak. It was usually apparent that the characters are under the influence of marijuana. Thick clouds of smoke, frequent coughing and an extreme wide-angle lens added to the \"drug-induced\" feel, although the audience never saw anyone actually smoking the plant. Also, no visible cannabis-related paraphernalia were seen, such as bongs or joint papers. Characters never spoke the word \"marijuana\" while in the circle (except in one episode \"Reefer Madness\"), often referring to it as \"stuff\" or a \"stash\". In the episode \"Bye-Bye Basement\", Theo (Leo's cousin) refers to \"weed\"; in \"The Relapse\", Kelso tells Fez that the concrete wall behind the gym is used mostly for \"smoking weed and beating up freshmen;\" in \"Ski Trip\" Kitty asks Eric why he is taking so much oregano to Jackie's ski lodge; in \"Eric's Burger Job\", Kelso blames his \"roach clip\" when the water bed pops on which he is sitting at a party; in two episodes (\"That Wrestling Show\" and \"Hyde Moves In\"), Eric and Hyde can be seen wearing shirts with the words \"Cannabis sativa\" written on a Campbell's soup can; and in \"The Pill\", Red, referring to Kelso, exclaims, \"That kid's on dope!\" A gimmick related to the circle and the marijuana smoking was Eric watching the kitchen wall moving erratically, although this technique was also used to show that Eric was drunk.\n\nAs the series progressed, the circle became one of the series' recurring features. The only four episodes where the whole gang is in the circle are \"Class Picture\", \"I'm A Boy\", \"Substitute\", and in the series finale. During the eighth and final season, the circle sans smoke replaced the Vista Cruiser as the setting of the opening credits.\n\nThe Vista Cruiser [ edit ]\n\nMany of the show's episodes featured Eric and the rest of the kids in or around Eric's \"Aztec Gold\" 1969 Oldsmobile Vista Cruiser, handed down to Eric by Red. For the first seven seasons of the show, the show's introduction showed the cast inside the Vista Cruiser. The particular station wagon was bought by Wilmer Valderrama at the show's conclusion from Carsey-Werner for \"no more than\" US$500.[16]\n\nIn August 2009, the show's Vista Cruiser was named third-greatest television car ever by MSN Autos.[17]\n\nRunning gags and catchphrases [ edit ]\n\nIn one of the show's major running gags, Red often threatens to punish Eric with many variations of the catchphrase, \"my foot in your ass\" or more generally \"kicking your ass.\"[18] For example, in \"Kitty and Eric's Night Out\", Red mistakenly thinks Eric offended Kitty, so Red says, \"I swear I'll kick his ass!\" In \"Eric's Hot Cousin\", Eric tries to get out of something by claiming he's sleepwalking and Red says, \"And I'm about to be sleep-kicking your ass\", and, in \"Prank Day\", when Red gets covered in oatmeal, Eric tries to explain that it was just a prank that had gone \"horribly, horribly wrong\" Red says, \"Well, I have a prank, too. One where my foot doesn't plow through your ass. Let's hope it doesn't go horribly, horribly wrong!\" Several of the running gags were shown in edited clips for the series finale.\n\nSome other notable running gags and catchphrases are:\n\nIn other media [ edit ]\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nThat '70s Show was released on DVD in Regions 1, 2 and 4 by 20th Century Fox Home Entertainment at an increment of two seasons per year between 2004 and 2008 and a complete series release on October 14, 2008. Mill Creek Entertainment released all eight seasons between 2011\u20132013 and released a complete series set on May 14, 2013. On March 6, 2012, Mill Creek released the first season on Blu-ray and season two on October 16, 2012. On November 3, 2015, Mill Creek Entertainment released That '70s Show The Complete Series on Blu-ray 1080p, featuring all 200 episodes from the series, presented digitally remastered in High Definition from the original film negatives for optimum sound and video quality and for superior home entertainment Blu-ray presentation with remastered 5.1 DTS-HD Master Audio surround sound and 1.78:1 widescreen aspect ratio.[28]\n\nSoundtracks [ edit ]\n\nSeveral prominent songs from the decade can be heard on the series, and two soundtracks were released in 1999. The first is a collection of funk, soul, and disco, called That '70s Album (Jammin'). The second is a collection of album-oriented rock songs, called That '70s Album (Rockin'). AllMusic gave both albums 3 out of 5 stars in their reviews.[29][30]\n\nRemake [ edit ]\n\nDays Like These [ edit ]\n\nRelated shows [ edit ]\n\nThat '80s Show [ edit ]\n\nThat '80s Show was a similar decade-based show which, despite having a similar name, show structure, and many of the same writers and production staff, was not a direct spin-off, with the characters and story lines never crossing paths. It was created because of That '70s Show's popularity at the time.\n\nThat '90s Show [ edit ]\n\nIn October 2021, Netflix announced a spin-off of the series, titled That '90s Show, with Kurtwood Smith and Debra Jo Rupp reprising their roles as Red and Kitty Forman, respectively. It will be produced by The Carsey-Werner Company, with Gregg Mettler serving as showrunner and Bonnie Turner, Terry Turner, their daughter Lindsay Turner, Marcy Carsey, Tom Werner, Smith and Rupp as executive producers.[31] In May 2022, Netflix announced that Topher Grace, Mila Kunis, Ashton Kutcher, Laura Prepon and Wilmer Valderrama\u2014who played Eric Forman, Jackie Burkhart, Michael Kelso, Donna Pinciotti, and Fez, respectively\u2014will appear as guests in the new series.[32]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nAmerican ratings [ edit ]\n\nOver the course of its run, the series was a consistent performer for Fox, becoming one of their flagship shows. Its eight seasons, consisting of 200 episodes, made it Fox's second-longest-running live-action sitcom ever behind Married... with Children, though That '70s Show did not have the same ratings success, despite surviving cancellation.\n\nAs of April 2020, the show went in syndication on FX, Freeform, Comedy Central, TeenNick, IFC, Nick at Nite and TV Land. It can currently be seen on Laff.\n\nSeason Episodes Timeslot Premiere Season finale Rank Viewers\n\n(in millions) 1 1998\u20131999 25 Sunday 8:30 August 23, 1998 July 26, 1999 49[ citation needed ] 11.7 2 1999\u20132000 26 Tuesday 8:30 September 28, 1999 May 22, 2000 86[33] 9.0 3 2000\u20132001 25 Tuesday 8:00 October 3, 2000 May 22, 2001 65[ citation needed ] 10.8 4 2001\u20132002 27 September 25, 2001 May 21, 2002 67[34] 9.1 5 2002\u20132003 25 Tuesday 8:00 (2002)\n\nWednesday 8:00 (2003) September 17, 2002 May 14, 2003 52[35] 10.4 6 2003\u20132004 25 Wednesday 8:00 October 29, 2003 May 19, 2004 49[36] 10.0 7 2004\u20132005 25 September 8, 2004 May 18, 2005 85[37] 7.0 8 2005\u20132006 22 Wednesday 8:00 (2005)\n\nThursday 8:00 (2006) November 2, 2005 May 18, 2006 103[38] 5.8\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nOver the course of its run, the series was nominated for a substantial number of awards, including 16 Primetime Emmy Awards. The only win for the series at this event came in 1999, when Melina Root was awarded the Emmy for Outstanding Costume Design for a Series for \"That Disco Episode\". Additionally, the show was nominated for a large number of Teen Choice Awards, with both Ashton Kutcher and Wilmer Valderrama winning on three occasions.\n\nReferences [ edit ]\n\nMedia related to That '70s Show at Wikimedia Commons", "images": ["http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/27/EC1835_C_cut.jpg/16px-EC1835_C_cut.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/That_%2770s_Show_logo.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5a/SMirC-laugh.svg/19px-SMirC-laugh.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/d/dd/70sFinaleCircle.png/200px-70sFinaleCircle.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/12px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/e2/That_%2770s_Show_logo.png/250px-That_%2770s_Show_logo.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/8c/Blank_television_set.svg/21px-Blank_television_set.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/21px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "http://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/b/b4/Ambox_important.svg/40px-Ambox_important.svg.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/That_%2770s_Show_logo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_%2770s_Show", "title": "That '70s Show", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/e/e2/That_%2770s_Show_logo.png", "width": 640, "height": 480}, "title": "That '70s Show - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
