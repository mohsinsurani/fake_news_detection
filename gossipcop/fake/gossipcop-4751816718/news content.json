After all, motherhood isn\u2019t a solo sport. It definitely requires a tribe \u2014 for inspiration\u2019s and sanity\u2019s sake. And Mom star Anna Faris says she\u2019s found that tribe in fellow mamas Kristen Bell and Reese Witherspoon.\n\nMore: Kristen Bell Gets Why Chris Pratt & Anna Faris Split\n\n\u201cI like how they combine humor with raising kids, but also how they tackle motherhood and work without being pretentious,\u201d Faris told Us Weekly. \u201cThe first few years, I was like, \u2018Oh, my God. Everyone else seems to know exactly what to do and I don\u2019t.\u2019\u201d\n\nFaris said she\u2019s grateful for Witherspoon and Bell\u2019s keep-it-real parenting style and their willingness to be candid about their mistakes. Faris admits she\u2019s still figuring things out. \u201cI question every single thing, like, \u2018Oh, I shouldn\u2019t have changed lanes,\u2019 or \u2018Why don\u2019t I have hand sanitizer?\u2019 and \u2018I should have applied more sunblock,\u2019\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much pressure for parents and it\u2019s tough to let yourself off the hook and be like, \u2018You know what? He\u2019s happy. It\u2019s OK.\u201d\n\nFaris and ex-husband (*sob*) Chris Pratt share son Jack, who\u2019s now 5. Fans were devastated by news of the divorce, but by all accounts, Faris and Pratt remain friends and are committed to co-parenting their son in peace. Faris told Extra recently that she and Pratt believe co-parenting is \u201chugely important.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are great and there\u2019s so much friendship and love, and we surround Jack with love, and funny, kind, happy people, and as a result, he is really happy,\u201d she said. Sounds like Faris \u2014 who\u2019s recently thrown herself into her podcast, Unqualified \u2014 is doing great and doesn\u2019t need all that help from Bell and Witherspoon at all. Still, we\u2019re glad she\u2019s got a support system in place for those mom days when it feels like there\u2019s not enough pizza \u2014 or merlot \u2014 in the world.\n\nMore: Anna Faris & New Beau Are Already Vacationing Together\n\nFaris rarely posts personal pics of her son on Instagram \u2014 in fact, the last time she did was September 2015 in this adorable on-the-way-to-the-airport shot.\n\n\n\nShe admits that things are easier now that Jack is 5. She told Us, \u201cI just get such a kick out of him now. He does weird things. The other day we were at a restaurant and he ate five balls of butter just by himself. My friends were a little bit horrified\u2026 but it was just one of those funny things where I was thinking, That\u2019s my kid! He\u2019s hysterical!\u201d\n\nWell, with a funny mom like Faris, it\u2019s no wonder Jack\u2019s already ramping up the humor.
