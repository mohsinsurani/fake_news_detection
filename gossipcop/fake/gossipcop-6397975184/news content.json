HIS Hair Clinic is not a tattoo parlour or tattoo studio, we are a professional hair clinic and the world\u2019s first Scalp MicroPigmentation company to specialise in this innovative hair loss treatment.\n\nAs with all great inventions other people try to copy what we do; unfortunately for them HIS Hair remains the global leader and most experienced company for this type of hair loss treatment.\n\nWhat is the difference between a tattoo and SMP?\n\nThe main difference between a tattoo and SMP is that SMP is more semi-permanent and uses a completely natural pigment. SMP uses specialist pigments created for the scalp, not general tattoo inks.\n\nTouch-ups maybe necessary after say 5 to 10 years because SMP is not as permanent as a tattoo.\n\nWe are often asked by potential clients from the Muslim community if it\u2019s OK for them to undergo SMP. Naturally they are concerned because they think SMP is a tattoo. The most important advice we give to every individual is that they MUST interpret their understanding of their religious beliefs. However, as far as we are concerned, SMP is NOT a tattoo and we are NOT tattoo artists. We are artistic hair loss specialists and we were the first clinic to set up a dedicated SMP clinic in the Middle East.\n\nA local Imam said: \u201cThere is nothing wrong for you to have SMP because it is considered as a treatment of ailment and especially as the treatment is temporary. Baldness is like any other ailment, you are allowed to use any treatment to cure it whether that is colouring or hair planting.\u201d", "images": ["https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ScalpMicropigmentation-Results-London-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ranbir.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/trust-pilot-5-star-reviews.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Male-SMP-Treatment.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/google-5-star-reviews.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HIS-Hair-Clinic-6.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Radio-5.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SMP-to-Cover-Hair-Transplant-Scars-Before-and-Afters-London-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Ian.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ITV.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SMP-before-and-afters-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HIS-Hair-Clinic-3-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scalp-Micropigmentation-before-and-afters-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Trust-Pilot-1.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Female-SMP-Treatment.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Google-Reviews-transparent.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/His-Hair.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Mens-Health.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Sky.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/BBC.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SMP-Before-and-Afters-Birmingham-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/CBS.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/ScalpMicropigmentation-Results-Birmingham-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/menu-before-after.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Benedict-After.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/HIS-Hair-Clinic-4-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/image-3.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Julietn.png", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Julien-Before.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/benedict-before03.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/SMP-Before-and-Afters-London-1.jpg", "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Scalp-MicroPigmentation-Before-and-Afters-London-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Julien-Before.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hishairclinic.co.uk/", "title": "London and Birmingham", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The UK hair loss experts at HisHair offer advice, diagnosis and treatment for men and women suffering from hair loss.
