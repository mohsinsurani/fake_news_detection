Maybe you should\u2019ve said no deal to that fugly hat, nahmean?\"\"\n\nAnd so forth.\n\nAnyway, it all sounds very far-fetched, but this isn\u2019t the first report we\u2019ve heard that Kate and Meg aren\u2019t exactly beasties:\n\n\"Kate feels like Meghan has barely made any effort with her and is more interested in impressing [Queen Elizabeth],\u201d a source recently told some tabloid called Closer Weekly.\n\n\"Kate feels left out. She spent years working on her image as \u2018the perfect royal,\u2019 and Meghan is stealing her thunder,\"\n\nYes, a real feud might be taking place among the duchesses.\n\nIf only we could convince them to star in a reality show about their classy beef.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-the-best-reactions-to-the-royal-w.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20743%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='743'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='540'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-scaled.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-720x540.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-683x1024.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20683%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='683'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/meghan-markle-and-kate-middleton-together-743x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/the-new-duchess-683x1024.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/06/shawn-mendes-hailey-baldwin-justin-bieber-split-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/julie-chen-waves-big-brother-flag-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201245%20825'%3E%3Crect%20width='1245'%20height='825'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/markle-and-middleton-scaled.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/06/kate-middleton-trash-talks-meghan-markle-daily-report/", "title": "Kate Middleton Trash-Talks Meghan Markle Daily (Report)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Middleton Trash-Talks Meghan Markle Daily (Report)", "description": "Ever since Meghan Markle married Prince Harry, there have been rumors about the former actress\u00a0struggling to fit in with the royals.
