The \"Red\" singer, 24, has distanced herself from former best friend Selena Gomez after the Disney star reconnected with her infamous ex-boyfriend, 20, sources confirm to Us Weekly.\n\nSwift is disgusted that the pair are back together, cutting off her bestie after tweeting just last July that Gomez was \"the closest thing I've ever had to a sister.\"\n\nThe \"Boyfriend\" singer sent his ex $10,000 in flowers and flew from Miami to McAllen, Texas to see her on March 7. Two days later, the \"Come And Get It\" crooner accompanied the Biebs to the SXSW music fest where he sang his hit \"As Long as You Love Me\" to her.\n\nBut Gomez rekindling of the Jelena flame isn't the only thing peeving Swift. She believes Gomez \"used\" a brief romance with the Grammy winner's pal Ed Sheeran last June to make her jailbird sweetie jealous.\n\n\"After Selena pulled that move, Taylor started distancing herself,\" a source tells Us.\n\nAnd Swift has plenty of besties to spend time with otherwise. Recently she's been spotted with Modern Family's Sarah Hyland, True Grit's Hailee Steinfeld, Victoria's Secret model Karlie Kloss, and even Gomez's enemy, New Zealander Lorde. But while their friendship may be struggling, a Swift pal insists that the country artist-turned-pop vocalist loves Gomez and will always be there for her.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1394582157_177658603_taylor-swift-selena-gomez-justin-bieber-zoom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1394582157_177658603_taylor-swift-selena-gomez-justin-bieber-300.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1394582157_177658603_taylor-swift-selena-gomez-justin-bieber-300.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/taylor-swift-cuts-off-selena-gomez-after-she-reunites-with-justin-bieber-2014123/", "title": "Taylor Swift Cuts Off Selena Gomez After Justin Bieber Reunion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Young Hollywood", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "After Selena Gomez reunited with ex-boyfriend Justin Bieber, Taylor Swift has distanced herself from her former bestie -- read the exclusive scoop!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "See Ya, Selena!
