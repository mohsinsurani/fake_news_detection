(It's the store Kate Middleton was photographed shopping at this April.) Pippa's column, Exercising During Pregnancy, talks about the adjustment with her sports routine during her first trimester. Pippa is a marathoner and generally super active.\n\n\"When I learned the happy news that I was pregnant, I realized I needed to adjust my normal 4-to-5-day-a-week routine and find a way of continuing my exercise safely throughout the three trimesters,\" she wrote in the column.\n\n\"I\u2019m fanatical about sports and have looked at loads of books and websites on exercise during pregnancy but have been disappointed by the limited technical information on what you can and can\u2019t do. I found that particularly so during the riskier first trimester. And this being my first pregnancy, I had so many questions I felt were all unanswered.\"\n\nPippa wrote that she kept the news private when she first learned of her pregnancy and that unlike her sister Kate, she hasn't suffered from severe morning sickness. \"I was lucky to pass the 12-week [mark] without suffering from morning sickness,\" she wrote. \"That meant I was able to carry on as normal and continue most of my sports with better knowledge and, more importantly, professionals to learn from.\"\n\n\"I\u2019ve noticed my body change and weight increase, but through effective exercise and sports I feel that it\u2019s being strengthened to support a healthy pregnancy, birth, and recovery,\" she added. Pippa will continue to write about her pregnancy experience for Waitrose Weekly, she ended her column.\n\nSo it's official: Princess Charlotte, Prince George, and Prince Louis are definitely getting at least one new cousin this year!", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-960667256-1528409794.jpg?crop=1xw:0.7457180500658761xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-arrive-at-zuma-on-october-06-news-photo-1665150988.jpg?crop=0.591xw:0.531xh;0.226xw,0.0403xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-attend-a-private-reception-as-news-photo-1664913566.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.146xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sarah-jessica-parker-and-kristin-davis-are-seen-on-the-set-news-photo-1664990757.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-on-september-04-news-photo-1665077679.jpg?crop=0.758xw:0.569xh;0.143xw,0.0276xh&resize=180:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1665070899.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0817xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/te-le-chargement-1665080515.png?crop=0.505xw:1.00xh;0.162xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664981510.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.735xh;0,0.0444xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-princess-of-wales-smiles-during-her-visit-to-the-news-photo-1665066747.jpg?crop=0.655xw:0.444xh;0.175xw,0.0369xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rihanna-bgus-2478374-004-1664978615.jpg?crop=0.566xw:0.377xh;0.186xw,0.0331xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2019-elle-songassociation-ep93-lewiscapaldi-jp-cm-kk-v3-ap-v2-1575927996.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078833.jpg?crop=0.388xw:0.259xh;0.304xw,0.0578xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-960667256-1528409794.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.374xh;0,0.0227xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leo-gigi-gettyimages-1662584674.jpg?crop=0.492xw:0.984xh;0.508xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-princess-of-wales-prince-william-prince-of-wales-news-photo-1665073240.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-960667256-1528409794.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.374xh;0,0.0227xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a21207423/pippa-middleton-pregnancy-announcement-column/", "title": "Pippa Middleton Announces Her Pregnancy in a Fitness Column", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Pippa Middleton Announces Pregnancy in Fitness Column -
