While she will be accompanied by close friends, it seems there is room for Brad.\n\n\u2018When Jen mentioned that she was planning to go skiing with friends in Aspen after New Year\u2019s, a light bulb went off in Brad\u2019s head,\u2019 claims Star\u2019s source. \u2018He said he could fly over in his private jet and meet up with her there.\n\n\u2018He pointed out that they could even hit the slopes together, since no one would recognise them in their ski masks, goggles and helmets. Jen thought it was genius.\n\nThe magazine claims that Jen has booked a $10,000 a night chalet featuring multiple fireplaces and hot tubs.\n\n\u2018The trip is going to be a blast,\u2019 claims the source, who adds, \u2018I imagine Brad and Jen will steal private moments to they can have some emotional heart-to-hearts.\u2019\n\nReps for both Brad and Jen have denied Star\u2019s story, and Jen has long said how happy she is with husband Justin.", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2693548590922384&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/111517/ni42_magshop_edm.jpg?height=158"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikki Black", "Nikki Is Obsessed With All Things Celebrity", "Dreams She Is A Long-Lost Kardashian.
