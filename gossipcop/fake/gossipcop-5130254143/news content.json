Julia Roberts made a very pricey purchase in an attempt to save her marriage to husband Danny Moder, an insider exclusively tells In Touch. According to the source, the A-list actress, 49, bought Danny, 48, his own private surf shack in Malibu, CA, so that he spends more time at home with their family.\n\nIn June 2016, Julia \u2014 whose main home is a $10 million Craftsman-style house atop a bluf in the seaside enclave\u2019s tony Point Dume neighborhood \u2014 previously bought the $6.84 million house directly across the street, so that nannies and visiting family members could have a place to stay. However, as In Touch has previously reported, it has become a refuge for the Pretty Woman star\u2019s cinematographer hubby \u2014 especially when the two were fighting.\n\nMORE: Julia Roberts\u2019 Children Are All Grown Up \u2014 See What They Look Like Now!\n\nWell, this past June, Julia, who married Danny in 2002, shelled out $3.9 million for a 1,600-square-foot ranch house just down the road that a friend says \u201cis basically a tear-down.\u201d While the pad may not be fancy, it comes with a deeded key to the gates leading to one of Malibu\u2019s best, most idyllic and private surf spots, known as Little Dume \u2014 the perfect gift for her surf enthusiast husband.\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s hoping that the purchase of the most expensive surf shack in Malibu will help her marriage by keeping Danny from going away on extended surf trips,\u201d the source tells In Touch. \u201cJulia is hoping that by giving Danny his own incredible surf spot, it will stave of any talk of divorce.\u201d\n\nMost recently, the pair \u2014 who share 12-year-old twins Phinnaeus and Hazel, and son Henry, 10 \u2014 have clashed over Julia\u2019s controlling ways, their differing approaches to parenthood, Danny\u2019s trips away, and his desire to be the man of the house despite being in Julia\u2019s shadow.\n\nMORE: The \u2018Halloweentown\u2019 Cast Is Reuniting to Honor Debbie Reynolds and Our Hearts Can\u2019t Take It\n\n\u201cWhen they first married, Julia was gone a lot for work, and it was like a honeymoon every time she and Danny were reunited,\u201d the source explains, adding that Julia \u2014 who is working steadily in LA on the HBO drama Today Will Be Different \u2014 is urging Danny to scale down his traveling. But \u201cDanny often wants to get away,\u201d says the insider. \u201cPlain and simple, they just aren\u2019t as happy as they once were, and she thinks the new house\u201d will help.\n\nThough Danny may appreciate Julia\u2019s expensive gesture, his wanderlust is likely to return \u2014 and very soon. \u201cAs beautiful as Little Dume is, riding the same waves can get monotonous, so the novelty will probably be short-lived and he\u2019ll still have an itch to go to exotic locations with his wave-riding buddies,\u201d the insider says. \u201cNo matter how desperately she tries, Danny won\u2019t be bought of \u2014 even with his own beach!\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-5-41-15-pm.png?resize=1052%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-5-41-15-pm.png?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/danny-moder-julia-roberts.jpg?fit=400%2C711&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C711"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-5-41-15-pm.png?resize=1052%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/julia-roberts-danny-moder-marriage-139676/", "title": "Julia Roberts and Danny Moder's Marriage \u2014 Her Desperate Attempt to Avoid Divorce (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Can she buy his love?
