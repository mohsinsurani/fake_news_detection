At the Hollywood Film Awards on Sunday, Nov. 5 in LA, Margot, 27, excitedly approached Angelina Jolie to introduce herself. But instead of a warm reply, Angie \u201ccurtly replied, \u2018I know who you are\u2019 and turned her back on Margot,\u201d an insider exclusively tells In Touch.\n\nAccording to the source, the Australian-born beauty \u201clooked shocked.\u201d Jealousy may be to blame. When Margot starred in 2015\u2019s The Big Short alongside Angelina\u2019s ex Brad Pitt, \u201crumors swirled about Brad crushing on Margot and that Angelina had tried to stop Brad from casting Margot in the film,\u201d says the insider.\n\n(Photo Credit: Splash)\n\nThe source says that the mom-of-six \u2014 who shares Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, Vivienne, 9, and Knox, 9, with Brad, 53 \u2014 can\u2019t shake her resentment toward the Suicide Squad actress. \u201cIt was clear from Angelina\u2019s reaction to Margot that she still holds a grudge,\u201d the source says.\n\nBack in November 2016, not long after Angelina, 42, filed for divorce from Brad, OK! Magazine reported that the Fight Club hunk was \u201cready to move on\u201d with Margot. \u201cHe thinks she\u2019s the hottest girl in Hollywood right now,\u201d a source said at the time. \u201cThis was a sore subject with [Angelina] who blocked them from working together a few times. Now that he\u2019s single again, you can expect Brad to go after Margot with a passion.\u201d\n\nWhile a romance between Brad and Margot never flourished, the eternal heartthrob has recently fell for 21-year-old British actress Ella Purnell \u2014 who, in an ironic twist, played a young Angelina in 2014\u2019s Maleficent. He\u2019s so enchanted, a source previously told In Touch, that he cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.\n\n\u201cBrad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,\u201d said the source. \u201cElla is incredibly flattered by all the attention she\u2019s getting from Brad. She\u2019s told friends he\u2019s always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.\u201d\n\nFor more exclusive celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-17-at-3-20-46-pm.png?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-17-at-3-20-46-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brad-pitt-weight-loss.jpg?fit=400%2C600&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C600"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/screen-shot-2017-11-17-at-3-20-46-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/angelina-jolie-snubbed-margot-robbie-147087/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Snubbed Margot Robbie Because of Brad Pitt Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Looks like Margot Robbie is going to need some aloe for this burn!
