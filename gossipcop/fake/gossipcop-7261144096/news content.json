Recent rumors suggest that Twilight alum and FKA Twigs are expecting their first child.\n\nGamenguide reported earlier that the Remember Me star is currently suffering from depression and that's why he has canceled his wedding with Twigs. Now the publication has reported about their pregnancy.\n\nAccording to Gamenguide, there are reports that Robert Pattinson and Tahliah Debrett Barnett are planning to have a baby so they could save their failing relationship. According to the reports, the couple is now very desperate to fix their relationship and that's why they have decided to have a baby\n\nIf these speculations about Kristen's ex-boyfriend were not enough, other sources previously claimed that the engaged couple might be headed for an end. Hollywood Life reported that Twigs and Pattinson were spotted fighting at Los Angeles Airport. The publication further noted that the couple seemed visibly upset with each other.\n\nAt the same time, iTechPost explained that the fall between the couple is because of Kristen Stewart. Patrick Wachsberger, a Lionsgate chairman, recently confirmed the possibility of a Twilight sequel, and recent rumors suggest that the actor is seriously considering to share the screen with his ex-girlfriend again.\n\nSo, there are chances that Pattinson's decision to feature in Twilight's reboot with Stewart has caused the rife between him and Twigs.\n\nMeanwhile, Twigs was not sporting her engagement ring during their recent trip and many are believing that they have officially parted their ways. InTouch also reported that the couple's friends think that things are not going too well between them as she is very dominating.\n\n\"[She] isn't the girl for him.
