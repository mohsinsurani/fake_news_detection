The singer and The Voice coach was named People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive for 2017.\n\nSo, what did he think when he first heard the news? \u201cThat y\u2019all must be running out of people,\u201d he told People. \u201cLike, Wow, we\u2019re down to somebody who is somewhat symmetrical.\"\n\nSurely his girlfriend of two years, Gwen Stefani, agrees with the title. \u201cI think he\u2019s hot. Do you?\u201d Stefani said, confirming that she was attracted to Shelton before their relationship even went public back in 2015. She definitely does! In fact, she was the one who convinced him to embrace the crown. \u201cShe goes, \u2018Listen to me, you\u2019re going to regret this for the rest of your life if you don\u2019t take this gift and just live in the moment,\" Shelton said.\n\nRELATED: Adam Levine Reveals When He Thinks Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Could Get Married\n\nHowever, the best part about the new title? Being able to rub it in his buddy Adam Levine's face. \"I can\u2019t wait to shove this up Adam\u2019s ass,\u201d Shelton added. \u201cAs proud as I am and honored that you guys asked me, that\u2019s really the only thing I care about.\u201d\n\nLevine took home the title back in 2013. \u201cI was just amazed and stunned and it almost seemed like they were kidding, but they weren\u2019t, so that\u2019s cool,\u201d Levine said of taking home the honor back in 2013.\n\nCongrats, Blake! Now you and Levine are both two of the world's sexiest men alive.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/https://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/11/111417-blake-shelton-lead.jpg?itok=xPsjIFzH", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111417-blake-shelton-lead.jpg?itok=1pD_gFmy", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111417-blake-shelton-lead.jpg?itok=1pD_gFmy", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442/http://www.instyle.com/news/blake-shelton-people-sexiest-man-alive-2017", "title": "Blake Shelton Is People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive for 2017", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Celebrity,News,Blake Shelton,Adam Levine,Gwen Stefani", "news_keywords": "blake shelton sexiest man alive, people's 2017 sexiest man alive, blake shelton gwen stefani", "description": "It's official: Blake Shelton is People's Sexiest Men Alive.", "og": {"title": "Blake Shelton Is People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive for 2017", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442/http://www.instyle.com/news/blake-shelton-people-sexiest-man-alive-2017", "description": "\"I\u00a0can\u2019t wait to shove this up Adam\u2019s a\u2014.\"", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111417-blake-shelton-lead.jpg?itok=1pD_gFmy"}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://www.instyle.com/news/blake-shelton-people-sexiest-man-alive-2017", "description": "It's official: Blake Shelton is People's Sexiest Men Alive.", "media": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111417-blake-shelton-lead.jpg?itok=1pD_gFmy"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://www.instyle.com/news/blake-shelton-people-sexiest-man-alive-2017", "title": "Blake Shelton Is People\u2019s Sexiest Man Alive for 2017", "description": "\"I\u00a0can\u2019t wait to shove this up Adam\u2019s a\u2014.\"", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171115053442im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111417-blake-shelton-lead.jpg?itok=1pD_gFmy"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
