Well the source alleged it\u2019s all because Lady Mary loves a good party and Victoria worries about that rubbing off on David, 42.\n\nThe insider said: \u201cDavid has spent time partying with Mary at events into the early hours of the morning.\u201d\n\nApparently David was introduced to Lady Mary through his good friend Dave Gardner, who is engaged to Hollywood actress Liv Tyler.\n\n\u201cVictoria is very worried that she is not the best influence on David,\u201d continued the insider.\n\n\u201cThey met at Glastonbury but Victoria is not fond of her.\u201d\n\nOh dear. Of course, this is all just wild rumours and until Posh, Becks or Mary actually respond, we\u2019ll take it with a pinch of salt!\n\nAnd hey, even if Lady Mary does like a party, so what?\n\nWe all have that friend who loves a good night out and is buckets of fun to be around!\n\nLady Mary, 30, is rather well-connected (perhaps obvious given the whole title\u2026)\n\nShe\u2019s the daughter of Scottish nobleman James Charteris, the 13th Earl of Wemyss and 9th Earl of March and has Jerry Hall as her godmother.\n\nThe model and socialite has been married to rocker Robbie Furze since 2012.\n\nRead more: Lorraine viewers shocked by how Rizzo from Grease looks now\n\nDavid and Victoria, meanwhile, have been married since 1999 and proud parents to four kids: Brooklyn, 18, Romeo, 15, Cruz, 12, and six-year-old Harper.\n\nGushing Becks said earlier this year it was love at first sight when he saw Victoria. Aww!\n\nHe added to Desert Island Discs: \u201cWhenever we\u2019ve come up against tough times, we know each other better than anybody knows us. We have an amazing life which we are very respectful of. We are also private people.\u201d\n\nAww, you guys!", "images": ["https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/09/26152835/Why-did-mary-leave-ghosts-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/07170229/Big-Brother-2023-launch-date-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/09/07132124/EastEnders-skinny-Sharon-update-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/07102443/Helen-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/07143619/Chas-opinion-Emmerdale-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2021/01/25101916/cropped-logo-512-32x32.png", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/06180438/Phillip-Schofield2-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/05165518/GhostsTheCaptainBenWillbond-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/07164938/Nadia-3-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/05/12122528/Thunderball-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/06164841/Samantha-Womack-2-742x388.jpeg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/07145822/Barbara-Windsor-widower-Scott-Mitchell-1-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/05/11162254/shutterstock_editorial_1337876c-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/07161447/alison-hammond-carol-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/06110134/Where-is-Ghosts-filmed-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/06172253/Coleen-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/07093314/Scott-Mitchell-Barbara-Windsor-742x388.jpg", "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2022/10/06174028/Paul-OGrady-742x388.webp"], "top_img": "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2021/01/25101916/cropped-logo-512-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Martin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/victoria-beckham-reportedly-furious-about-davids-female-friend/", "title": "Victoria Beckham reportedly furious about David\u2019s female friend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#d60b52", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Really, though?", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Victoria Beckham reportedly furious about David's female friend", "description": "Really, though?", "url": "https://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk/news/victoria-beckham-reportedly-furious-about-davids-female-friend/", "site_name": "Entertainment Daily"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/entertainmentdailyfix/", "published_time": "2017-10-17T17:08:45+00:00"}, "author": "Lara Martin", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@EntDailyUK", "site": "@EntDailyUK", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Lara Martin", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.entertainmentdaily.com/2021/01/25101916/cropped-logo-512-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508260125.0, "source": "http://www.entertainmentdaily.co.uk", "summary": ""}
