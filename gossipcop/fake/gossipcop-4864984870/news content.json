Suddenly, we\u2019re watching her and JAY-Z seethe at home as a staring contest rolls into the boil of an argument. As the scene unfurls moments after \u201cHe better call Becky with the good hair\u201d echoed throughout Cardiff\u2019s Principality Stadium, the subject of the fraught conversation is clear. Images of their growing family and the frame of a house engulfed in flames followed, with Beyonc\u00e9 kneeling before the inferno and Jay standing, stunned, as the bones of his home disintegrate.\n\nThey say nothing, but they don\u2019t have to. We know who lit the match. Those who were hoping for generous glimpses into Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z\u2019s evolution as husband, wife and parents since the last On The Run tour in 2014 should be careful what they wish for, because On The Run II delivers on that front without compromise to exquisite and devastating degrees.\n\nExplore See latest videos, charts and news Beyonc\u00e9 Jay-Z See latest videos, charts and news\n\n\u201cSorry\u201d is one of the many songs indicting JAY-Z\u2019s infidelity on Lemonade, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s 2016 visual album, which he would address in his own way on 2017\u2019s 4:44. Both records are rife with pain and the complications of commitment, as it\u2019s clear the couple was \u2014 is \u2014 intent on working through the brutality of his betrayal and its excruciating aftermath, both at home and in their respective recording studios. They made it through the blaze and rebuilt what was destroyed, but On The Run II doesn\u2019t discard the smoldering embers of indiscretion in favor of the shiny next chapter of a shared life and love renewed.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z are human and have their limits like everyone else, and they\u2019ve mounted a production that pushes them to theirs in order for us to understand how deeply earned and hard won this catharsis was \u2014 and how superhuman they were to channel this anguish into such profound work.\n\nThat extends beyond On The Run II\u2019s emotional anchor. Both are coming to their latest joint venture with an impressive set of wins collected since On The Run\u2019s first outing nearly four years ago \u2014 a feat itself, as it grossed over $100 million by the time it wrapped. 4:44 and its subsequent trek gave Jay his highest-grossing solo tour to date and his fourteenth No. 1 album, while Lemonade, her sixth No. 1 album, went on to make Hot 100 history when every one of its songs charted simultaneously.\n\nThe most recent of these accolades is Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s staggering (and historic) Coachella set, which redefined what a headliner can achieve and imbued Lemonade and the rest of her hit-laden discography with an even bolder bombast thanks to the might of an HBCU-inspired marching band and dance corps.\n\nA post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Jun 6, 2018 at 1:47pm PDT\n\nBeychella posed a challenge in and of itself \u2014 how was Beyonc\u00e9 going to top herself after that, and so soon after the fact? \u2014 but On The Run II succeeds in condensing the vibrant brass and percussive step team choreography of her Coachella performance into a formidable package streamlined for the road. The incredible On The Run II band boasts not one but two tubas, two bassists (with Lauren Robinson\u2019s \u201cDeja Vu\u201d feature standing out as a highlight), two guitars (Ariel O\u2019Neal\u2019s \u201cI Don\u2019t Care\u201d solo was a showstopper, too) and ample strings, among other talented singers and players.\n\nAn innovative stage setup kicked the production value up with the addition of Club Carter, a 700-person nightclub taking over the area between the catwalks, and a platform that moved Bey, Jay and their dancers deep into the heart of the arena at various points throughout the night. The show leaned on their shared affinity for film as well, as the visual interludes were crucial for picking up the story the Carters left off.\n\nThe selection of Lemonade and 4:44 tracks on the setlist was surprisingly modest, which made the vignettes \u2014 especially the ones throwing to the conflict that shaped their most recent creative output \u2014 all the more potent. Burning houses, tropical baptisms, voyeuristic visions of a harness-clad Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z in a cash-covered motel room, family footage of Blue, Sir and Rumi with their doting parents, the cartoon for \u201cThe Story of O.J.\u201d \u2014 no image was gratuitous, each one a metaphor that packed the same punch as Jay\u2019s bars or Bey\u2019s verses.\n\nA post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Jun 6, 2018 at 2:38pm PDT\n\nConsidering the mammoth visuals of the 4:44 tour and the technical and musical prowess of Beychella and the Formation tour before it, On The Run II was the sum of exceptional parts \u2014 and one that elevated Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z\u2019s happiest and most harrowing memories in their most challenging performance yet. They spent about a quarter of the show on their collection of duets, opening with the explosive \u201cMagna Carta Holy Grail\u201d and delighting in throwbacks \u201cUpgrade U\u201d and \u201cDeja Vu.\u201d Old favorites got new makeovers, with \u201cBaby Boy\u201d seguing into a reggae-inflected meditation and \u201cNaughty Girl\u201d invoking Bob Fosse\u2019s iconic Sweet Charity choreography to a bellydance-ready beat. Noticeably absent were lighthearted standards like \u201cSingle Ladies (Put A Ring On It),\u201d \u201cLove On Top\u201d and other chart-toppers of Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s, though the heavier cuts \u2014 like \u201cResentment\u201d off 2006\u2019s B\u2019Day, or 4\u2018s stadium shredder \u201cI Care\u201d \u2014 flowed with the thematic undercurrent of the evening.\n\nTheir commitment to social justice shone through at various points: JAY-Z hit the stage in a bulletproof vest to perform \u201c99 Problems\u201d as mug shots of numerous celebrities \u2014 Meek Mill, David Bowie, civil rights activist Angela Davis, Lisa \u201cLeft Eye\u201d Lopez and more \u2014 towered above him, and the clip of Nigerian author Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie speaking on feminism in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u201cFlawless\u201d found a new, fitting home in the final measure of \u201cRun the World (Girls).\u201d\n\nStill, the moments when they were singing solely for each other brought it all back to why On The Run II was happening in the first place: JAY-Z was at his happiest and most relaxed in Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s orbit, and the sheer joy emanating from them both when they came together for \u201cYoung Forever\u201d was intense, especially at the conclusion of this multi-sensory, two-hour journey.
