The Dangerous Woman singer and her fiance have had a whirlwind romance and got engaged after only dating for a few weeks. However, according to tweets from her former boyfriend Big Sean's Twitter account, the singer has been cheating on her boyfriend with him.\n\nAccording to a July 7 report by Gossip Cop, it seems that rapper Big Sean's Twitter account was hacked over the weekend. The hacker posted a series of explicit comments, which included profanity and the n-word, before tweeting that Ariana Grande had been cheating on Pete Davidson with her ex-boyfriend the \"whole time.\"\n\nThe tweet started a firestorm among fans via Twitter. The rumors that Ariana had been cheating on Pete began to circulate and the tweet garnered over 5,000 retweets and 8,000 likes in only about 15 minutes. Fans were talking about the surprising post so much that \"Big Sean\" even became a trending topic on the social media site.\n\nIf fans only saw the one tweet from the rapper's account it could look like a legitimate claim. However, those who bothered to go back and read all of Big Sean's tweets could see that his account had been hacked, which is something that has happened to multiple celebrities in the past.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5a1aab41ece6a274bcaecb11bc798ff5?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c4ca7c76-1956-4818-b67f-af1d1f0cfe0c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e494db4a-e9aa-4be6-a73c-2041f4691eb1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ariana-Grandes-Engagement-Ring-From-Pete-Davidson-Reportedly-Cost-Almost-100k-Claims-TMZ.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ariana-Grandes-Engagement-Ring-From-Pete-Davidson-Reportedly-Cost-Almost-100k-Claims-TMZ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4977160/ariana-grande-did-not-cheat-on-pete-davidson-with-ex-boyfriend-big-sean-debunked/", "title": "Ariana Grande Did Not Cheat On Pete Davidson With Ex-Boyfriend Big Sean [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ariana Grande Did Not Cheat On Pete Davidson With Ex-Boyfriend Big Sean [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4977160/ariana-grande-did-not-cheat-on-pete-davidson-with-ex-boyfriend-big-sean-debunked/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Ariana Grande Did Not Cheat On Pete Davidson With Ex-Boyfriend Big Sean [Debunked]", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Ariana-Grandes-Engagement-Ring-From-Pete-Davidson-Reportedly-Cost-Almost-100k-Claims-TMZ.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-07-08 22:12:28Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "Ariana Grande Did Not Cheat On Pete Davidson With Ex-Boyfriend Big Sean [Debunked]", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531087948.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
