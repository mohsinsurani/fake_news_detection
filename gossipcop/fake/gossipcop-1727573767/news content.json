It\u2019s been over a decade since Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston parted ways, yet their love story isn\u2019t over yet. Following Pitt\u2019s dramatic split with Angelina Jolie, inside sources claim that he and Aniston are giving their romance a second shot.

Which side are we on?\" https://t.co/ryxuGuOo0J \u2014 E! News (@enews) January 12, 2018\n\nAniston was shocked when Pitt reached out and was deeply moved by his comments. Although she is still married to actor Justin Theroux, Aniston hasn\u2019t forgotten about Pitt and relies on him for support.\n\nThe reunion rumors come amid reports that Aniston\u2019s marriage with Theroux is on the rocks. The couple\u2019s busy schedule has pulled them apart this past year and put a lot of strain on their romance.\n\nAlthough Pitt and Aniston have renewed their friendship, a source says that Pitt is not interested in getting romantically involved with his ex-wife and is happy with just being friends.\n\nPitt has had a lot of time to reflect over the past year. Between his split with Jolie and newfound sobriety, the actor is starting to realize how much he hurt Aniston.\n\nThe source even claims that Pitt believes he would still be with Aniston if it hadn\u2019t been for his drinking problem. While Aniston has moved on, Pitt is holding out hope that they will eventually find their way back to each other and exchange vows a second time.\n\nAmid all the reunion rumors, Huffington Post reports that Jolie may have majorly dissed Aniston at the recent Golden Globes ceremony.

An anonymous relative came forward and revealed that the Friends alum doesn\u2019t speak to her family and has ignored their phone calls for years.\n\nThis comes roughly a year after Aniston\u2019s mom passed away. Although the actress keeps her family at a distance, they couldn\u2019t be prouder of her accomplishments and wish her well in days to come.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nJennifer Aniston has not commented on the rumors surrounding her marriage.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Mama-June-1-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Jennifer-Aniston-Will-Always-Be-Brad-Pitts-Greatest-Love.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Brad-Pitt-Is-Staying-Sober-While-At-War-With-Angelina-Jolie-Over-Parenting-Styles-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Bill-Cosby-LA-Times-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Angelina-Jolie-Doesnt-Plan-To-Date-Again-Soon-Despite-Rumors-700x466.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cardi-b-offset-1-300x198.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_36_1498683898-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Jen-Aniston-Justin-Theroux-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Gwen-Stefani-Calls-Off-Her-Wedding-To-Blake-Shelton-The-Voices-Chloe-Kohanski-To-Blame-300x210.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Sophie-Brussaux-Drake-Baby-Boy-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Justin-Bieber-and-Selena-Gomez--300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tiny-Harris-Children-300x286.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Jennifer-Aniston-Will-Always-Be-Brad-Pitts-Greatest-Love.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Suzy Kerr"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180115005438/http://celebrityinsider.org/jennifer-aniston-will-always-be-brad-pitts-greatest-love-104413/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Will Always Be Brad Pitt\u2019s \u2018Greatest Love\u2019", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Suzy Kerr", "news_keywords": "angelina jolie, brad pitt, jennifer aniston,", "keywords": "celebrity news, angelina jolie, brad pitt, jennifer aniston,", "description": "Who says true love doesn\u2019t exist?
