{"url": "en.wiktionary.org/wiki/will", "text": "Thus Mill\u2019s case for the claim that happiness is the sole human end, put more carefully, is this: \u2018Whatever is desired otherwise than as a means to some end beyond itself, and ultimately to happiness, is desired as itself a part of happiness, and is not desired for itself until has become so\u2019 (1861a: 237). Nothing here assumed Hume\u2019s view that every action must ultimately flow from an underived desire. That is a quite separate issue, and Mill\u2019s view of it is closer to that of Kant or Reid than to that of Hume. He insists \u2018positively and emphatically\u2019 that the will is a different thing from desire; that a person of confirmed virtue, or any other person whose purposes are fixed, carries out his purposes without any thought of the pleasure he has in contemplating them, or expects to derive from their fulfilment. (1861a: 238) This distinction between purpose and desire is central to Mill\u2019s conception of the will. When we develop purposes we can will against mere likings or aversions: \u2018In the case of an habitual purpose, instead of willing the thing because we desire it, we often desire it only because we will it\u2019 (1861a: 238). Every action is caused by a motive, but not every motive is a liking or aversion: When the will is said to be determined by motives, a motive does not mean always, or solely, the anticipation of a pleasure or of a pain\u2026. A habit of willing is commonly called a purpose; and among the causes of our volitions, and of the actions which flow from them, must be reckoned not only likings and aversions, but also purposes. (1843: 842) The formation of purposes from desires is the evolution of will; it is also the development of character. Mill quotes Novalis: \u2018a character is a completely fashioned will\u2019 (1843: 843).", "images": ["http://en.wiktionary.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "http://en.wiktionary.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/80/Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg/44px-Wikipedia-logo-v2.svg.png", "http://en.wiktionary.org/static/apple-touch/wiktionary/en.png", "http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1"], "top_img": "http://en.wiktionary.org/static/apple-touch/wiktionary/en.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/will", "title": "Wiktionary", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.4", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=1000", "og": {"title": "will - Wiktionary", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://en.wiktionary.org", "summary": ""}
