Clooney and her husband George were our favorite couple from the evening, and she stunned in a shiny floral print strapless gown with a long flowing train and trousers.\n\nAmal Clooney at the 2018 Met Gala on May 7, wowing everyone. But she wasn't done yet. Getty Images\n\nBut as we learned from Vogue editor Anna Wintour on \"The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,\" Amal wasn't done stunning us for the evening.\n\n\"She wore this incredible dress on the red carpet that was designed by a young British designer called Richard Quinn but it was made of tin foil, so she was a little bit concerned it might rip during the evening,\" Wintour revealed.\n\nFortunately, the human rights lawyer had backup.\n\n\"She went into the gift shop and she changed into this extraordinary Tom Ford dress, which is designed to look like stained glass,\" Wintour continued.\n\nAnd it was a stunner as well: a full-length fitted mosaic maroon gown with matching red accessories, including Christian Louboutin heels. She sat at the table next to Rihanna, who took our breath away in her beaded gown.\n\nAmal Clooney (with husband George) in her second Met Gala dress, a red Tom Ford creation that evoked stained glass. Backgrid\n\n\"You sell this at the gift shop?\" Colbert wondered incredulously. \"I thought it was just astronaut ice cream and paperweights.\"\n\nApparently not. As Wintour noted, there's just one way you can get away with doing that.\n\n\"Only if you're Amal Clooney,\" she said.\n\nFollow Randee Dawn on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201805/tdy_style_jenna_met_gala_180508_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_19/1338171/amal-clooney-today-inline-180510.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Randee Dawn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/style/amal-clooney-changed-dresses-during-met-gala-museum-gift-shop-t128704", "title": "Amal Clooney changed dresses during the Met Gala in the museum gift shop", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/style/amal-clooney-changed-dresses-during-met-gala-museum-gift-shop-t128704", "title": "You'll never guess where Amal Clooney changed dresses at the Met Gala", "description": "It's not just \"astronaut ice cream and paperweights\" in there.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TODAYshow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_19/1338099/amal-clooney-today-1-180510.jpg", "title": "You'll never guess where Amal Clooney changed dresses at the Met Gala", "description": "It's not just \"astronaut ice cream and paperweights\" in there.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Our favorite couple at the 2018 Met Gala was George and Amal Clooney.
