So obviously, Lovatics freaked out when the \"Really Don't Care\" singer announced her engagement on Instagram. However, Dilmer isn't making it official! Instead, she just got \"engaged\" to an adorable young fan, Grant.\n\nThe five year old held up a sign in the audience reading \"Demi I have a ring for you,\" and then he kneeled down and popped the question after she invited him onstage. (She had to teach him how to propose, which was even more adorable.)\n\nLater, Demi posted a picture on Instagram announcing her \"engagement,\" calling it one of the cutest things ever.\n\nUm, we have to agree with her. This is probably one of the best fan proposals we've seen. And we love how she played along!\n\nWhat do you think about Demi's \"engagement\"? Is it the cutest thing ever? Let us know in the comments!\n\nLove J-14?
