But these days, he isn\u2019t letting his ex\u2019s antics get him down \u2014 and it may be due to the fact that he\u2019s dating again!\n\nAs Life & Style previously reported, Angelina was making it hard for Brad to see his six children \u2014 Maddox, 16, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9 \u2014 over the holidays. \u201cAngie is using the kids as pawns against him,\u201d an insider explains. \u201cBrad knows he can\u2019t count on scheduled days with the kids because Angie has changed the plans abruptly at the last minute multiple times.\u201d\n\nThough the old Brad may have responded in a fit of rage, he calmly thanked her for keeping him informed. \u201cThere are two choices for Brad,\u201d the insider notes. \u201cFight back and get angry every time she pulls a stunt, which would only impacts the kids, or handle it like a mature adult. If that means he won\u2019t see the kids as much or at the holidays, he has made peace with it.\u201d\n\nThis attitude adjustment could be a result of the 53-year-old\u2019s new social life. According to In Touch, Brad has become smitten with a 21-year-old British actress named Ella Purnell \u2014 who, interestingly enough, played a young Angelina in 2014\u2019s Maleficent. He even cast her in his upcoming Starz series, Sweetbitter.\n\n\u201cBrad had Ella in mind from the get-go. He went out of his way to cast her,\u201d a source explained. \u201cElla is incredibly flattered by all the attention she\u2019s getting from Brad. She\u2019s told friends he\u2019s always been her No. 1 celebrity crush.\u201d\n\nAustralian magazine New Idea is also reporting that Brad has become involved with Monaco princess, Charlotte Casiraghi, 31. \u201cNo one could believe it when we saw them together,\u201d an alleged onlooker told the outlet. \u201cThere have been rumors circulating for weeks that Brad has moved on with a new woman, but no one was ready to see him hand-in-hand with royalty from Monaco.\u201d\n\nFor more info on Brad\u2019s holiday plans, pick up the current issue of Life & Style, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/who-is-brad-pitt-dating-today.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/who-is-brad-pitt-dating-today.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-holidays.jpg?fit=400%2C400&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C400", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/who-is-brad-pitt-dating-today.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/who-is-brad-pitt-dating-today-146596/", "title": "Who Is Brad Pitt Dating Today?
