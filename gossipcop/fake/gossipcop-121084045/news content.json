He was believed to be alone when he died.\n\nLea Michele, Monteith\u2019s real-life girlfriend who was in Mexico when the news reached her, has pleaded for privacy, but fans from all over the world are tweeting at #LeaMichele, #PrayForLea, #StayStrongLea, #StayStrongLeaMichele, where millions are sending thoughts, prayers and posting pictures of the petite half-Jewish singer/actress with Monteith.\n\nBuzz Feed, which projects \u201cthe viral web in realtime,\u201d has put together a timeline of their relationship, which is also being massively retweeted, alongside memes (images reflecting a cultural trend or idea) such as:\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\n\u201cALL FANDOMS RT AND PLEASE SPREAD THE WORD. DO IT FOR CORY, LEA AND THE GLEEKS. #RipCoryMonteith #PrayForLea http://t.co/QppzEBHZUY\u201d \u2014 ???????????????????????????? \u2728 (@simplyhoran) July 15, 2013\n\nSome fans simply write to the star, saying nothing, just sending their Twitter thoughts.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans are tweeting around the clock in a Tower of Babel of languages from countries as far-flung as Indonesia, which has recently forged closer ties with Western countries.\n\nSampai saat ini berita tentang pernikahan Cory Monteith dan Lea Michele masih belum bisa dikonfirmasi atau dianggap benar \u2014 Glee Indonesia (@gleekindonesia) July 15, 2013\n\nIn England, what was supposed to be a weekend celebration of the musical TV series turned into an impromptu memorial of song and dance for Monteith after news of the co-star\u2019s death rocked a \u201cGlee\u201d fan convention.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe hundreds of \u201cgleeks,\u201d as they\u2019re known, joined a chorus of thousands worldwide who took to social media with similar expressions about Monteith\u2019s passing. The actor\u2019s struggles with addiction echoed those of other young stars whose premature deaths also left young fans grieving.\n\n\u201cThe whole day was simultaneously the best and worst experience of my life,\u201d said Chloe Harvey, an 18-year-old fan from Portsmouth, England. \u201cThe news was devastating. No one had any idea what to say or do. It just shows how much of a truly amazing guy Cory was that everyone was so shocked and emotional about the news. Everyone was crying and sharing their stories.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s not known what caused his death, Monteith\u2019s passing recalls the lives of Heath Ledger, Corey Haim and River Phoenix \u2014 actors who battled substance abuse and died in their 20s and 30s. Monteith talked bluntly about struggling with addiction since he was a teenager, calling it a serious problem and telling Parade magazine in 2011 he was \u201clucky to be alive.\u201d\n\nMonteith admitted himself to a treatment facility in April for substance addiction and asked for privacy as he took steps toward recovery, a representative said at the time. Michele told People magazine that she loved and supported him and was proud he was seeking help. It was not Monteith\u2019s first time in rehab. He also received treatment when he was 19.\n\n\u201cI think kids really need a place to go and feel like they belong,\u201d he said in the video posted the site for Project Limelight, a Vancouver charity offering theater and arts programs to at-risk youth. \u201cWhen I was a kid, I struggled a lot with who I was and where my life was going and what I was interested in. And I was fortunate to have the arts inspire me.\u201d\n\nMonteith similarly moved fans. At the weekend \u201cGlee\u201d convention, instead of planned revelry like singing competitions and autograph sessions with actors who\u2019ve played members of the rival Warblers glee club, organizers Starfury Conventions rescheduled the final day of the three-day event at Heathrow\u2019s Thistle Hotel so the 250 attendees could mourn him together.\n\n\u201cWe all woke up to hear the story, and no one really wanted to believe it was true,\u201d said Chloe-Louise Bond, a 22-year-old fan from Wakefield, England. \u201cWalking into the main room, you could just feel the tragedy in the air, absolute strangers became a family right in that moment. Everyone was crying and hugging and just trying to get over the shock.\u201d\n\nIt was a day filled with sadness and songs. The attendees chanted \u201cCory! Cory! Cory!\u201d In unison, they sang tunes like \u201cDon\u2019t Stop Believin\u2019,\u201d the Journey cover crooned by Monteith in the high school-set musical\u2019s first episode. Curt Mega, Telly Leung and other actors who\u2019ve played Warblers led a group discussion with fans about their memories of Monteith.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cGlee,\u201d with its catchy song-and-dance numbers and high-profile guest stars like Gwyneth Paltrow and Britney Spears, became an instant hit when it debuted in 2009 and made celebrities of Monteith and the rest of the relatively unknown cast. Over the past four seasons, he delivered renditions of such classics as U2\u2019s \u201cOne\u201d and R.E.M.\u2019s \u201cLosing My Religion.\u201d\n\nMonteith served as the show\u2019s resident hunk with a heart of gold. He played Finn Hudson, a football quarterback with two left feet who found more camaraderie in the choir room than on the football field. After his character graduated high school, Hudson sought out to find himself before settling on what he wanted to do with his life: become a teacher and mentor.\n\nOutside the Vancouver hotel where Monteith\u2019s body was discovered, a makeshift memorial popped up where fans left flowers and notes commemorating the actor.\n\nCopyright 2013 The Associated Press", "images":
