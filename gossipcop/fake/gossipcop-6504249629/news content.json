Buckle up for this one, Twihards. Rob and Kristen have reportedly both been approached to star in the same movie, which would be their first joint project since their Twilight days. At lot has happened since then \u2014 blossoming careers, other romances, and a very messy, very public breakup. It\u2019s pretty understandable that the actors are both reportedly thinking it over before ever working together again.\n\n\u201cKristen is more hesitant than Rob right now, but they\u2019ve agreed to discuss it,\u201d an insider told OK! Magazine. \u201cSeparately, they\u2019d each jump at it, but working together isn\u2019t an easy yes for them given the fan hysteria that surrounded their split years ago.\u201d If it helps, the unknown movie is described by the source as an \u201cedgy project\u201d that has absolutely nothing in common with the Twilight movies. Rob and Kristen would reportedly be playing roles \u201cfar from their Bella and Edward characters.\u201d\n\nAnd by that, the insider also means no romantic shenanigans between Rob and Kristen. Their characters aren\u2019t \u201clovers,\u201d according to the source, but they do allegedly have some \u201cclose encounters.\u201d To say we\u2019re excited about this hypothetical film would be an understatement. Can you imagine them together again onscreen. A dream come true!\n\nWe\u2019re not holding our breath for a romantic reunion, though. We\u2019re not dumb! Though Rob\u2019s now single after ending his engagement to FKA Twigs, Kristen\u2019s still with girlfriend Stella Maxwell. Oh, and there\u2019s that whole thing when Kristen cheated on him with her Snow White director and their relationship crashed and burned. Not happening!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you want Rob and Kristen to star in another movie together?
