Here\u2019s what went down between them at Serena Williams\u2019 wedding.\n\nCelebrity feuds have a way of bringing us all together (while tearing famous relationships apart). Whether you\u2019re Team Kimye or Team Whoever Kanye West Decided To Fight With That Day, we can all agree that we\u2019ll be here for whatever drama these stars find themselves in. And hoo boy, do we have some drama to discuss today! As we know, Kanye has beef with Jay-Z, 47, and by association, Beyonce, 36, (you thought I was gonna say Taylor Swift didn\u2019t you?! Be patient, she\u2019ll come up). As we also know, Kim Kardashian, 37, will always stand by her 40-year-old husband. So, just imagine what would happen if Kim and Beyonce ran into each other for the first time since their husbands started fighting. Just kidding, you don\u2019t need to imagine a single thing because it JUST HAPPENED FOR REAL. That\u2019s right, Kim and Bey ran into each other at Serena Williams\u2018 wedding and it was just as awkward as you expected it to be.\n\nBey and Kim were standing at the VIP bar together at Serena\u2019s wedding to Alexis Ohanian on Nov. 16, onlookers told E! News. They ordered glasses of champagne before celebrating their friend\u2019s big day. Kim wore a long, black dress that made her look exactly like an hourglass. Bey rocked a long-sleeved green gown for the formal occasion. Luckily, they appeared to put aside whatever issues they may have with one another to honor the tennis all-star\u2019s special day. Neither of their husbands were in attendance \u2014 and that\u2019s probably for the best.\n\nThe Jay-Z and Kanye fallout started an entire year ago when the \u201cFamous\u201d rapper stopped a show in Sacramento, CA to go on a rant about his supposed friends. A video of him rambling was posted to Twitter, where you could clearly hear him saying, \u201cBeyonc\u00e9, I was hurt \u2019cause I heard that you said you wouldn\u2019t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me and over \u2018Hotline Bling,'\u201d before adding, \u201cIn my opinion \u2013 now don\u2019t go trying to diss Beyonce \u2013 she is great. Taylor Swift is great.\u201d See, I told you Taylor would come up. Calling Beyonce \u201cgreat\u201d in the same way that he called Taylor Swift, his Public Enemy #1, \u201cgreat\u201d was clearly meant as a diss toward the Lemonade star.\n\nHe then went on to publicly tell Jay-Z to give him a call and talk to him, \u201clike a man.\u201d Jay-Z later responded to the fallout on TIDAL\u2019s Rap Radar podcast, where he spoke openly about how Kanye\u2019s actions hurt him. So basically, Kim and Kanye are no longer tight with Jay-Z and Beyonce. And suddenly that Taylor lyric, \u201cBut I\u2019m not the only friend you\u2019ve lost lately. If only you weren\u2019t so shady,\u201d from her notorious new Kanye diss track \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things, has started to make a bit more sense, huh?\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think about Kim and Beyonce\u2019s run in?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F11%2F17%2Fbeyonce-kim-kardashian-meet-up-serena-williams-wedding-jay-z-kanye-feud%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2875903&comment_count=12", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/260c1efde9e5f671381a52a12c2e3dc9?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-and-kim-kardashian-awkward-run-in-serena-williams-wedding-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/usher-case-dismissed-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/ryan-seacrest-denies-msconduct-accusations-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-and-kim-kardashian-awkward-run-in-serena-williams-wedding-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/venus-williams-twerking-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/beyonce-and-kim-kardashian-awkward-run-in-serena-williams-wedding-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118104558/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/17/beyonce-kim-kardashian-meet-up-serena-williams-wedding-jay-z-kanye-feud/", "title": "Beyonce & Kim Kardashian Had An \u2018Icy\u2019 Exchange At Serena Williams\u2019 Wedding", "meta_data": {"description": "Beyonce and Kim Kardashian met up at Serena Williams' wedding.
