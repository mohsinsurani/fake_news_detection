TMZ reports that King Myers dropped a track called \u201cPropaganda\u201d and put \u2018Ye\u2019s name on it as producer. He even used Kanye\u2019s Twitter avatar as his cover art, leading people to believe that the famous rapper had some involvement.\n\nHowever, Kanye\u2019s team is speaking out about the fraudulent project, saying that West has nothing to do with it, and he\u2019s already put his lawyers on the job to get his name and art removed from the track.\n\nThe news of a fake Trump diss by Kanye comes just after reports that \u2018Ye deleted all of his pro-Trump tweets from Twitter. Maybe he and President Trump aren\u2019t such long-time friends after all.\n\nDid Kanye West Make A Diss Track About Donald Trump? was originally published on globalgrind.com", "images":
