The best way to get back at an ex-boyfriend is to look amazing. FKA Twigs, 30, latest Apple commercial (promoting the HomePod) has her ex-lover Robert Pattison, 31, reminiscing about the good old days. \u201cHe loves her very much still and seeing this commercial reminds him of how amazing she is. He sees her talent, he sees her smile, and watching it makes him happy since it such a time warp for him. It takes him back to when they were in a better place. It shows the best of everything about her. Now, will that lead him back to her? Never say never,\u201d a source close to the Twilight star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. So sweet, right?\n\nFor those of you who haven\u2019t seen the commercial, Robert isn\u2019t exaggerating. FKA looks absolutely stunning in the ad directed by Spike Jones. In the four-minute clip, the gorgeous singer shows off her enticing dance moves to the tune of \u201cTill It\u2019s Over\u201d by Anderson .Paak. The HomePod transforms her room into a dance floor, and we can\u2019t get enough. No wonder Robert is so smitten. FKA\u2019s commercial also marks her return to the spotlight. Since their breakup in 2017, FKA has kept a pretty low profile, and hasn\u2019t put out any music. So, this is definitely the Friday pick-me-up we didn\u2019t know we needed. Plus, just like Robert, we can\u2019t help but take a trip down memory lane.\n\nRobert and FKA were together for a little two years before deciding to call it quits. We certainly thought they were in it for the long hall as they had plans to get married. Unfortunately, their busy schedules caused them to breakup. Interestingly, right after their split, a source told The Sun, \u201cwith so much history between them, though, there are strong feelings there.\u201d And, it\u2019s clear those strong feelings are still alive today. Don\u2019t be surprised if they reunite in the near future! We\u2019d be here for it.", "images": ["https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jen-aniston-loved-wet-brush-now-kid-friendly-disney.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fka-twigs-robert-pattinson.jpg?w=440", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/robert-pattinson-misses-fka-twigs-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/fka-twigs-robert-pattinson-2.jpg?w=315", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/howtosupportiran.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/robert-pattinson-misses-fka-twigs-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/robert-pattinson-fka-twigs-cannes.jpg?w=293"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/robert-pattinson-misses-fka-twigs-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Robyn Merrett", "Taylor Jeffries", "Roya Backlund", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/10/robert-pattinson-misses-fka-twigs-still-loves-her/", "title": "Robert Pattinson Misses FKA Twigs After Seeing Her New Apple Commercial: He Still Loves Her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Robert Pattinson misses FKA twigs.
