We exclusively learned the actor has zero interest in dating!\n\nWhile we\u2019re sure many women are pining after Chris Pratt, 38, after he and his wife Anna Faris, 40, announced their split last week, the truth is, Chris has no plans whatsoever to date in the near future. Instead, the Passengers star is determined to stay focused on his booming career as well as being the best dad he can be to his and Anna\u2019s son Jack Pratt, 4. \u201cNo one at all should even try to connect Chris with anyone because he is not looking to get into a relationship in any way shape or form,\u201d a source close to Chris told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cHe is definitely mourning losing Anna and has to work that out before he even thinks about getting into another relationship. He is going to drown himself into his work and being a great father only.\u201d We can totally respect that! After all, the favorite Hollywood couple tied the knot eight years ago, and their split came as a major shock to fans. Anna especially is reportedly taking the separation particularly hard. \u201cAnna can\u2019t believe she\u2019s going to have to start dating again in her 40s,\u201d another insider told us EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cJust thinking about it makes her break down in tears. She can\u2019t even wrap her head around it.\u201d Click here to see pics of Anna and Chris\u2019 relationship timeline.\n\nThe couple announced their separation on Aug. 6, with a social media statement that just about broke our hearts. \u201cWe are sad to announce we are legally separating. We tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed,\u201d the post read. \u201cOur son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward. We still love each other and will always cherish our time together. Anna Faris and Chris Pratt.\u201d\n\nClearly Anna and Chris are making Jack a priority throughout this whole ordeal though. In fact, Chris has already made a public appearance with their adorable son since news of his split surfaced. The actor stepped out to take Jack to church on Aug. 13, and Chris carried the preschooler, which was almost too much cuteness to handle! The two were all smiles too as Jack rocked cowboy boots and a sunhat.\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 are you surprised Chris supposedly doesn\u2019t want to date right now?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/la-la-anthony-exclusive-interview-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/chris-pratt-and-jack-fatherhood-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/chris-pratt-and-jack-fatherhood-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/tara-wallace-has-hot-new-body-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F08%2F16%2Fchris-pratt-dating-anna-faris-divorce-work-fatherhood-son-jack%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2743239&comment_count=2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/natalee-holloway-and-dad-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/chris-pratt-and-jack-fatherhood-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170819034205/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/16/chris-pratt-dating-anna-faris-divorce-work-fatherhood-son-jack/", "title": "Chris Pratt Swearing Off Dating After Anna Faris: Wants To Drown Himself In Work & Fatherhood", "meta_data": {"description": "Chris Pratt may be one of Hollywood's hottest stars -- who's also newly single -- but that doesn't mean he'll be flaunting his new bachelor status anytime soon.
