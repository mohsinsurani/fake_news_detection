{"url": "www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/09/aniston200509", "text": "Although the bungalow was dark and depressing when she first saw it, a quickie makeover has transformed it into a cozy sanctuary that\u2019s far more representative of Aniston\u2019s personal taste than the showplace she and Pitt shared, where the d\u00e9cor seemed all hard edges and unforgiving materials. \u201cBrad and I used to joke that every piece of furniture was either a museum piece or just uncomfortable,\u201d Aniston says. \u201cHe definitely had his sense of style, and I definitely have my sense of style, and sometimes they clashed. I wasn\u2019t so much into modern.\u201d\n\nI mention Nicole Kidman\u2019s quip after splitting up with Tom Cruise, when she was asked what she looked forward to in her new life without the diminutive husband who had abruptly ended their marriage. \u201cWearing high heels again,\u201d Kidman retorted.\n\nSo I ask Aniston\u2014who filed for divorce on March 25 and expects it to become final this fall\u2014what she\u2019s enjoying about being on her own. \u201cI can have a comfortable couch,\u201d she says with a wry smile.\n\nIn the tabloids and celebrity gossip magazines, the soap-opera version of her life continues to hurtle along like a runaway express train, rushing Aniston through major life stages with ludicrous speed: Jen Is Devastated! Jen Is Furious! Jen Gets Revenge! Jen Has a New Man! Jen Is Over Brad! Most of the stories are wrong. (No, Oprah didn\u2019t try to get Brad and Jen back together; no, Jen is not romantically involved with Vince Vaughn, her co-star in The Break-Up, a comedy about a separating couple who continue to live together, which they shot in Chicago over the summer.)\n\nOther reports are just idiotically simpleminded, breathlessly advancing a plot that bears little resemblance to the long, complex, painful experience of getting over a divorce. While the tabloids insist on dividing Aniston\u2019s emotions into neat, distinct chapters, the reality is that pain and denial and anger and resignation all blur together, sometimes at the same moment\u2014and the lengthy process of mourning is nowhere near over.\n\n\u201cThere are many stages of grief,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s sad, something coming to an end. It cracks you open, in a way\u2014cracks you open to feeling. When you try to avoid the pain, it creates greater pain. I\u2019m a human being, having a human experience in front of the world. I wish it weren\u2019t in front of the world. I try really hard to rise above it.\u201d\n\nAniston is struggling to find a deeper meaning in the debacle. \u201cI have to think there\u2019s some reason I have called this into my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI have to believe that\u2014otherwise it\u2019s just cruel.\u201d\n\nHer friends are filled with admiration for the way she\u2019s handled the whole mess. \u201cThis woman is basically having a root canal without anesthesia, but she\u2019s really trying not to numb the pain or shove it under the rug,\u201d says Hahn. \u201cShe\u2019s grown so much, and she continues to grow on a daily basis, because every time you think, \u2018Well, I\u2019ve dealt with this,\u2019 there\u2019s another hurdle to get over. It\u2019s a bit Job-like at the moment.\u201d\n\nPhotographed by Mario Testino for the September 2005 issue.\n\nAniston\u2019s response has been to retreat into her cocoon, \u201cin an effort to take care of myself and my heart,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m nesting. I love being home. I have friends that come over. My girlfriends I\u2019ve had for 20 years. When things happen, the tribe gathers around and lifts you up. I\u2019ve had lonely moments, sure, but I\u2019m also enjoying being alone. There\u2019s no question it takes getting used to; I\u2019m a partnership person, and if something happens your instinct is to share it\u2014but you\u2019re no longer part of a couple. I definitely miss that. It\u2019s sort of like Bambi\u2014like you\u2019re trying to learn how to walk. You\u2019re a little awkward; you stumble a little bit. The things you would do with your partner, you don\u2019t do. It\u2019s uncharted territory, but I think it\u2019s good for me to be a solo person right now. You\u2019re forced to re-discover yourself and take it to another level. If you can find a way to see the glass half full, these are the moments when you learn the most. I\u2019ve had to re-introduce myself to myself in a way that\u2019s different.\u201d\n\nShe doesn\u2019t downplay the difficulties. \u201cAm I lonely? Yes. Am I upset? Yes. Am I confused? Yes. Do I have my days when I\u2019ve thrown a little pity party for myself? Absolutely. But I\u2019m also doing really well,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve got an unbelievable support team, and I\u2019m a tough cookie.\u2026 I believe in therapy; I think it\u2019s an incredible tool in educating the self on the self. I feel very strong. I\u2019m really proud of how I\u2019ve conducted myself.\u201d\n\nA crucial part of Aniston\u2019s strategy has been to ignore the putrid stew of rumor, speculation, and outright falsehood in the tabloid media. \u201cIt\u2019s been very important for me not to read anything, not to see anything,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s been my saving grace. That stuff is just toxic for me right now. I probably avoided a lot of suffering by not engaging in it, not reading, not watching.\u201d\n\nShe gestures toward Norman, who has roused himself for a moment to check on his mistress\u2019s whereabouts. \u201cIt\u2019s like those dog cones,\u201d she says, encircling her neck as if putting on one of the plastic cones prescribed by vets to prevent dogs from scratching their ears. \u201cI have my imaginary dog cone on, so I don\u2019t see anything. It just allows for a much more peaceful life.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, as Pitt publicly flaunted the instant family he had created with Jolie, the tableaux of their newfound togetherness were humiliating. \u201cI would be a robot if I said I didn\u2019t feel moments of anger, of hurt, of embarrassment,\u201d Aniston acknowledges.\n\nBut she tries to keep the lurid details to herself. \u201cShe is grieving, but she\u2019s taken the high road,\u201d says Bendewald. \u201cShe\u2019s mourning the death of a marriage, and she\u2019s done it very privately. She can have her moments of rage, but she doesn\u2019t want to out him, and that keeps her heart clear. She\u2019s not bad-mouthing him. She doesn\u2019t want to make him the villain and her the victim.\u201d\n\nIndeed, Aniston vehemently rejects the interpretation that she was left for another woman. \u201cI don\u2019t feel like a victim,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve worked with this therapist for a long time, and her major focus is that you get one day of being a victim\u2014and that\u2019s it. Then we take responsibility for our own input. To live in a victim place is pointing a finger at someone else, as if you have no control. Relationships are two people; everyone is accountable. A lot goes into a relationship coming together, and a lot goes into a relationship falling apart. She\u2019d say, \u2018Even if it\u2019s 98 percent the other person\u2019s fault, it\u2019s 2 percent yours, and that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to focus on.\u2019 You can only clean up your side of the street.\u201d\n\nThese days, one index of recovery is the fact that Aniston\u2019s sardonic humor is resurfacing. When I tell her that my 13-year-old son is a big fan of hers, she doesn\u2019t miss a beat. \u201cIs he single?\u201d she asks, deadpan.\n\nShe\u2019ll toss off a crack about Pitt\u2019s startling transformation into a punky bleached blond. \u201cBilly Idol called\u2014he wants his look back,\u201d she murmurs with a sly smile.\n\nBy now she can even talk about those gut-wrenching photos of Jolie and Pitt in Kenya with mordant resignation rather than tears. \u201cI can\u2019t say it was one of the highlights of my year,\u201d she says. \u201cWho would deal with that and say, \u2018Isn\u2019t that sweet! That looks like fun!\u2019? But shit happens. You joke and say, \u2018What doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe sighs. \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve earned a superpower shield,\u201d she says. Then, afraid of sounding grandiose, she adds, \u201cI\u2019m not comparing my suffering to other people\u2019s suffering. Everybody has their own.\u201d\n\nAniston\u2019s friends were particularly horrified by W magazine\u2019s 60-page photo spread featuring Pitt and Jolie as an early-1960s-style married couple with a brood of miniature blond Brads. \u201cYou want to shake the shit out of him and say, \u2018Your timing sucks!\u2019\u201d says one. \u201cHe\u2019s made some choices that have been tremendously insensitive.\u201d\n\nThe W feature, which was entitled \u201cDomestic Bliss,\u201d couldn\u2019t be blamed on the paparazzi; not only did Pitt conceptualize it, but he retained the international rights, so he actually profited from it. Aniston\u2019s eyes widen in surprise when I mention that last fact, and she grimaces. \u201cI didn\u2019t know that,\u201d she says. But she refuses to indulge herself in an angry reaction. \u201cIs it odd timing? Yeah. But it\u2019s not my life,\u201d she says. \u201cHe makes his choices. He can do\u2014whatever. We\u2019re divorced, and you can see why.\u201d\n\nShe shakes her head in exasperation. \u201cI can also imagine Brad having absolutely no clue why people would be appalled by it,\u201d she adds. \u201cBrad is not mean-spirited; he would never intentionally try to rub something in my face. In hindsight, I can see him going, \u2018Oh\u2014I can see that that was inconsiderate.\u2019 But I know Brad. Brad would say, \u2018That\u2019s art!\u2019\u201d\n\nShe rolls her eyes, pretending to screw something into her forehead. \u201cThere\u2019s a sensitivity chip that\u2019s missing,\u201d she says.\n\nAniston\u2019s friends are amazed at her willingness to give Pitt the benefit of the doubt, but they basically agree with her assessment. \u201cI don\u2019t think he was trying to hurt Jen,\u201d says Courteney Cox, Aniston\u2019s dear friend and former co-star on Friends. \u201cI don\u2019t think that Brad is malicious, or a liar. The W thing was his idea, but I don\u2019t think he thought that one through, about what it would look like to anyone else.\u201d\n\nAlthough Aniston remains determined not to lash out, she sometimes questions her own restraint. \u201cWhy am I protecting him?\u201d she exclaimed to one friend, only to continue with what she sees as the dignified course of action.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4338fbf768838dc570f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ss05-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c42c8fbf768838dc56b7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss02-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62100dc174854b6731411914/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6270778fc79ffab65a2f7d6d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61e0aaf2b8d453b000d50805/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61e9a4b7b7a91122f5b3d8b9/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c434169027501c6efb7f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss06-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/618c0614fdf674f0522a9fb7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57d2e2a05475d07256a8b2ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/celebrity-divorces-lawyers.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62b3340bfa5c67611b2c46ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4ec6a8fbf768838dc619b/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/ss10-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62bb516609ddf1b35f5ea552/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c43c169027501c6efbd7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss09-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/627ea8ca0a29d0182d5876f6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c438169027501c6efbab/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss07-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4388fbf768838dc573b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss08-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c42c169027501c6efb27/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss01-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/623a28a1e700ab34afc82b7f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4308fbf768838dc56e3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss04-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633d9bec72fe11ef3849c3ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/55c4c4338fbf768838dc570f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ss05-jennifer-aniston-vf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Leslie Bennetts"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2005/09/aniston200509", "title": "The Unsinkable Jennifer Aniston", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The whole world watched as her \u201cperfect\u201d marriage fell apart.
