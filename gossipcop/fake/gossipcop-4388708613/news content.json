Kim has always known Ryan to be professional, respectful and a total gentlemen and so she was shocked when she found out what was being said about him. It hurts Kim to hear these things and she can\u2019t believe any of it. She has reached out to Ryan to offer her love and support during his challenging time.\u201d\n\nKim isn\u2019t the only one standing by Ryan during this trying time. Kelly Ripa and Jimmy Kimmel have both expressed support for Ryan since the claims came out and his girlfriend, Shayna Taylor, took to social media to post a sweet message of love for the Live With Kelly & Ryan host. Ryan has publicly denied the claims more than once and wants to put the while issue behind him.\n\nDespite the denial and support, after the claims, there was a lot of controversy on whether or not Ryan should be allowed to be a part of the red carpet interviews at the 2018 Oscars on Mar. 4. It turns out the talented television personality is going to be a part of the festivities after all but not without a ton of pressure to look cool and collected as he deals with his tough issues behind the scenes.", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kim-kardashian-heartbroken-over-ryan-seacresdt-allegations-rex-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/moneyspells.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kim-kardashian-heartbroken-over-ryan-seacresdt-allegations-rex-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kim-kardashian-heartbroken-over-ryan-seacresdt-allegations-rex-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia", "Katherine Speller", "Meghan Rose", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/04/kim-kardashian-ryan-seacrest-scandal-upset-sexual-harassment/", "title": "Kim Kardashian \u2018Heartbroken\u2019 Over Ryan Seacrest Scandal: She \u2018Can\u2019t Believe Any Of It\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Kim Kardashian is \"heartbroken\" over Ryan Seacrest scandal and doesn't believe any of it.", "news_keywords": "Kim Kardashian, Ryan Seacrest", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "author": "Erin Silvia", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian \u2018Heartbroken\u2019 Over Ryan Seacrest Scandal: She \u2018Can\u2019t Believe Any Of It\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/04/kim-kardashian-ryan-seacrest-scandal-upset-sexual-harassment/", "description": "Kim Kardashian is feeling upset over the alleged sexual misconduct allegations against her friend Ryan Seacrest and is willing to support him all the way.
