As his costar, Gaga insisted that there would be no pre-recorded vocals or lip-synching in the film. Some of it was even filmed in front of live audiences at packed summer festivals like Coachella and Stagecoach. In his debut as a film director, Cooper spent three years learning to sing and developing his vision for the movie, according to a conversation he had with Robert DeNiro at the Tribeca Film Festival.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA Star Is Born will also be a first for Lady Gaga. The pop star and newly minted TV actress is taking on her first movie role after winning a Golden Globe for her role on American Horror Story: Hotel. She follows in the footsteps of Janet Gaynor, who starred in the 1937 original film, as well as Judy Garland and Barbra Streisand, who starred in later remakes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDave Chappelle also makes an appearance as an old friend of Cooper\u2019s country music star, wearing a hat you will have to watch the trailer to believe. A Star Is Born will be in theaters October 5.", "images": ["https://compote.slate.com/images/fe502585-6ab8-45ad-b0fb-fb1fe9f7f52c.png?width=1560&rect=402x268&offset=215x0", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-fw53_-Tq3MNK1.gif", "https://compote.slate.com/images/fe502585-6ab8-45ad-b0fb-fb1fe9f7f52c.png?crop=402%2C268%2Cx0%2Cy0"], "top_img": "https://compote.slate.com/images/fe502585-6ab8-45ad-b0fb-fb1fe9f7f52c.png?width=1560&rect=402x268&offset=215x0", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carmen Russo"], "canonical_link": "https://slate.com/culture/2018/06/bradley-cooper-learns-to-sing-for-new-film.html", "title": "Bradley Cooper learns to sing for new film.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Bradley Cooper Sings for Real in the First Trailer for A Star Is Born", "url": "https://slate.com/culture/2018/06/bradley-cooper-learns-to-sing-for-new-film.html", "description": "When Gaga says you sing live, you sing live.", "image": {"identifier": "https://compote.slate.com/images/fe502585-6ab8-45ad-b0fb-fb1fe9f7f52c.png?width=1560&rect=402x268&offset=215x0", "width": 1560}, "site_name": "Slate Magazine", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Bradley Cooper Sings for Real in the First Trailer for A Star Is Born", "url": "https://slate.com/culture/2018/06/bradley-cooper-learns-to-sing-for-new-film.html", "description": "When Gaga says you sing live, you sing live.", "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/fe502585-6ab8-45ad-b0fb-fb1fe9f7f52c.png?width=1560&rect=402x268&offset=215x0", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@slate"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-06T19:00:56+00:00", "tag": "movies, trailers, a-star-is-born", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "When Gaga says you sing live, you sing live.", "news_keywords": "movies, trailers, a-star-is-born", "author": "Carmen Russo", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "theme-color": "#000000", "dfp-cache-buster": "20673f0c66f9b7dc445dfc2001f1b9549a2c9299"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/nSbzyEJ8X9E?rel=0&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1528311656.0, "source": "http://slate.com", "summary": ""}
