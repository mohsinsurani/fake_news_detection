What are you planning on doing now?\u2019 And you say, \u2018Uh, I\u2019m just going to take a second and like do something other than that,'\u201d she told HuffPost Live. \u201c[But suddenly the headline reads] Kristen Stewart Quits Hollywood!\u201d\u201d\n\nSee Photos: \u2018Twilight Saga: Breaking Dawn \u2013 Part 2\u2032 Premiere: Kristen Stewart, Robert Pattinson Raise the Heat\n\nStewart was interviewed alongside her \u201cStill Alice\u201d co-star Julianne Moore, so much of the conversation touched upon their critically acclaimed film that focuses on Moore\u2019s struggle with Alzheimer\u2019s disease, which is slowly corrupting her mind and threatens to tear apart her family.\n\nThe conversation also hit on other topics, including Stewart\u2019s broodiness as a 12-year-old and how the world flocks to tabloid gossip stories that she\u2019s featured in.\n\n\u201cThere is like, you know, a whole other form of entertainment that is just voraciously consumed,\u201d she said.

But after an alleged romantic indiscretion with her \u201cSnow White and the Huntsman\u201d director Rupert Sanders was caught on camera and Stewart and Pattinson broke up, the actress suddenly found herself at the heart of a media frenzy.\n\nSince then, she has starred in projects with smaller fan bases, including \u201cStill Alice\u201d and Guantanamo Bay drama, \u201cCamp X-Ray.\u201d\n\nAlso
