Just about everyone else I know hated it.)\n\nAnyway, Eastwood has given an extensive interview about the speech to the newspaper of the tiny California town he used to be the mayor of, Carmel.\n\nAmong other things, Eastwood told the Carmel Pine Cone:\n\n\"President Obama is the greatest hoax ever perpetrated on the American people.\"\n\nThem's fighting words.\n\n(Not to be annoying, but if you're going to say something like that, it seems as though you ought to back it up a bit. Eastwood didn't, at least not in the Carmel Pine Cone).\n\nSome other nuggets:\n\nEastwood didn't tell anyone in the Romney campaign what he planned to say before the speech, because he didn't know\n\nEastwood got to the convention center about 15-20 minutes before he went on\n\nEastwood didn't think of the \"empty chair\" routine until a few minutes before show time\n\nEastwood said he had three points he wanted to make:\n\nThat not everybody in Hollywood is on the left,\n\nthat Obama has broken a lot of the promises he made when he took office, and\n\nthat the people should feel free to get rid of any politician who\u2019s not doing a good job.\n\nRead more at the Carmel Pine Cone >", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Henry Blodget"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/clint-eastwood-president-obama-hoax-2012-9", "title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "datePublished": "2012-09-07T16:06:00Z", "dateModified": "2012-09-07T18:52:40Z", "news_keywords": "Democratic National Convention, Clint Eastwood, Henry Blodget", "author": "Henry Blodget", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Politics", "og": {"title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/clint-eastwood-president-obama-hoax-2012-9", "image": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "CLINT EASTWOOD: 'President Obama Is The Greatest Hoax Ever Perpetrated On The American People'", "sailthru.date": "2012-09-07", "sailthru.tags": "Democratic National Convention, Clint Eastwood, Henry Blodget", "sailthru.author": "Henry Blodget", "sailthru.verticals": "politics, clusterstock, sai, thewire", "sailthru.image.full": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/og-image-logo-social.png", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@PoliticsInsider"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/clint-eastwood-president-obama-hoax-2012-9?fbia"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"newsletter-email-input": "control"}, "ii-split-test": {"bii-media-show-lock": "variant", "ii-finance-email-lock": "variant", "ii-retail-show-lock": "control"}, "viking-id": "504a18d2ecad04ab17000005", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2021-08", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1346972400.0, "source": "http://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
