The cost for the trips ran into the hundreds of thousands of dollars.\n\nThe scandal infuriated Trump, who viewed the controversy as a needless distraction from his agenda. Over the course of the week, Trump fumed to aides about Price\u2019s flights, which he deemed \u201cstupid,\u201d according to multiple sources. Instead of moving past the storm, Price\u2019s offer to reimburse the government for only a fraction of the flights\u2019 costs enraged Trump further.\n\nSpeaking less than an hour before the resignation was announced, Trump bemoaned the optics of the matter, which he said obscured what otherwise had been a cost-saving tenure.\n\n\u201cI was disappointed because I didn\u2019t like it, cosmetically or otherwise. I was disappointed,\u201d Trump said.\n\nPrice and his aides have insisted that the trips he took by private charter jet had been approved through the usual legal and ethics offices at HHS. But the appearance of a millionaire Cabinet secretary flying routes easily navigated by far cheaper means proved an optics nightmare for an administration already accused of being out of touch with regular Americans.\n\nPrice is the latest casualty in an administration that\u2019s seen a high rate of dramatic departures over its first eight months. Since taking office, Trump has dismissed or seen quit his national security adviser, press secretary, communications director, chief strategist, acting attorney general and FBI director. The tumult has come as Trump struggles to fulfill key aspects of his agenda on Capitol Hill, and as his team confronts its most dire challenge yet on a storm-demolished Puerto Rico.\n\nTrump was incensed that Price\u2019s actions undermined his vow to \u201cdrain the swamp,\u201d though Price is not the only Cabinet official to have used private air charters to travel around the country. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt and Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke have both flown on private planes during their tenures in the administration.\n\nThe White House said this week it was examining whether to adopt stricter oversight of Cabinet secretaries\u2019 travel plans.\n\nThe first sign of Trump\u2019s ire emerged on Wednesday, when he said only \u201cwe\u2019ll see\u201d after being asked if he was planning to fire Price. Neither Trump nor his top aides could say in the following days whether Price retained the President\u2019s confidence.\n\nDeparting the White House on Friday, Trump called Price a \u201cvery fine man\u201d who had nonetheless made a grave mistake.\n\n\u201cThis is an administration that saves hundreds of millions of dollars on renegotiating things,\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo I don\u2019t like to see somebody that perhaps there\u2019s the perception that it wasn\u2019t right.\u201d\n\nThe resignation was announced as Trump flew aboard Air Force One for another weekend at his golf club in New Jersey. Stepping off his own plane, Trump offered a thumbs-up sign when reporters asked if he\u2019d accepted Price\u2019s resignation.\n\nPrice himself offered a rosy picture of his future on Thursday evening, telling CNN that he \u201cabsolutely\u201d planned to stay on as health secretary \u2013 a claim that was ultimately not meant to be.\n\nNot close\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 01:34 - Source: CNN Tom Price vows reimbursement for flights\n\nTrump, who never grew as close to Price as he has to some of his aides, also viewed the health secretary as an ineffective promoter of Republican plans to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, an effort that has failed multiple times over the course of Trump\u2019s eight months in office.\n\nDuring a rally with Boy Scouts in July, Trump quipped that if Price couldn\u2019t wrangle the votes, he\u2019d dismiss him.\n\n\u201cHe better get them. Oh, he better,\u201d Trump said. \u201cOtherwise I\u2019ll say, \u2018Tom, you\u2019re fired.\u2019 \u201c\n\nPrice didn\u2019t get the votes, but it was his use of private aircraft that ultimately led to his demise in the Trump administration.\n\nPolitico first reported Price\u2019s use of charter jets for official business last week and found that the secretary has traveled on charter flights at least 24 times since May, citing people familiar with his travel plans and a review of HHS documents.\n\nCharter plane operators estimated 24 flights would have cost $400,000, Politico reported. Commercial trips would have cost thousands of dollars less. The Health and Human Services inspector general is reviewing whether the means of travel was appropriate.\n\nLater, it was revealed that Price also took US military aircraft on two trips abroad, bringing the total cost of his non-commercial travel to more than $1 million. The military flights were approved by the White House.\n\nBreaking precedent\n\nVideo Ad Feedback 04:39 - Source: CNN Price experiencing turbulence for private flights\n\nPrice\u2019s travel breaks with the precedent set by former President Barack Obama\u2019s HHS secretaries Sylvia Mathews Burwell and Kathleen Sebelius, who flew commercially when flying within the US.\n\nPrice said in a statement on Thursday that would write a personal check to the US Treasury to cover the cost of his travel on private charter planes.\n\n\u201cThe taxpayers won\u2019t pay a dime for my seat on those planes,\u201d he proclaimed, though it was later revealed he would only pay for his seat and not the total cost of chartering a plane.\n\nAn HHS spokesperson said the check would come to $51,887.31, a small percentage of the total cost of the private flights.\n\nPrice, both in his role as Trump\u2019s health boss and as a Republican congressman from Georgia, was a frequent critic of government spending. He told CNN in April that he wanted to cut redundancy and waste in his agency.\n\n\u201cFor us to say, \u2018OK, let\u2019s just throw more money at that system, let\u2019s see if more money helps that out,\u2019 is the wrong way,\u201d Price told CNN\u2019s Sanjay Gupta.\n\nWhile at HHS, Price played an integral part helping craft many iterations of alternatives to Obamacare \u2013 all of which ultimately failed to pass. Price was also part of the executive opioid commission announced by Trump in March.\n\nPrior to his role in the administration, Price was a Georgia representative for over 10 years, and was an orthopedic surgeon for 20 years. He was the third doctor to hold the HHS secretary position.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170117115346-chuck-schumer-tom-price-raju-ath-intv-00001317.jpg?q=x_228,y_54,h_869,w_1544,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929135751-01-tom-price-0929.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170925150243-sarah-sanders-09-25-2017.jpg?q=x_6,y_52,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170419223152-1-on-1-with-tom-price.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1078,w_1915,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160520153744-white-house-file.jpg?q=x_3,y_126,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170928161928-tom-price-09-28-2017.jpg?q=x_3,y_156,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170116165250-02-tom-price-file.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929135751-01-tom-price-0929.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929103051-kevin-liptak-profile-image.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/161129144301-tom-price.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170808174919-tom-price.jpg?q=x_127,y_58,h_920,w_1635,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/161128093233-tom-price-january-12-2015.jpg?q=x_392,y_0,h_2223,w_3951,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170706100345-miranda-green.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929121150-tom-price.jpg?q=x_5,y_143,h_2526,w_4490,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929165353-03-price-trump-file.jpg?q=x_76,y_102,h_1616,w_2872,c_crop/w_250"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929135751-01-tom-price-0929.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kevin Liptak Miranda Green", "Kevin Liptak", "Miranda Green"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/29/politics/tom-price-resigns/index.html", "title": "Price out as HHS secretary after private plane scandal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Price out as HHS secretary after private plane scandal | CNN Politics", "description": "Tom Price, the embattled health and human services secretary, resigned Friday in the midst of a scandal over his use of private planes, a storm that enraged President Donald Trump and undercut his promise to bring accountability to Washington.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929135751-01-tom-price-0929.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/29/politics/tom-price-resigns/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Price out as HHS secretary after private plane scandal | CNN Politics", "description": "Tom Price, the embattled health and human services secretary, resigned Friday in the midst of a scandal over his use of private planes, a storm that enraged President Donald Trump and undercut his promise to bring accountability to Washington.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170929135751-01-tom-price-0929.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cnnpolitics"}, "description": "Tom Price, the embattled health and human services secretary, resigned Friday in the midst of a scandal over his use of private planes, a storm that enraged President Donald Trump and undercut his promise to bring accountability to Washington.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "politics", "theme": "politics", "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-29T20:40:03Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-29T22:34:25Z", "tag": "air transportation, aircraft, aviation and aerospace industry, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, civil aviation, donald trump, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, political figures -
