Despite being on the receiving end of an onslaught of allegations, he remains focused on doing whatever is best for the children.\u201d\n\nTMZ reports the actor, whose wife Angelina Jolie filed for divorce Monday, is under investigation following an incident on a private jet.\n\nTMZ says the case was referred over to the FBI on Thursday due to the fact that the alleged incident happened in the air while the family was on a plane from France last Wednesday.\n\n\u201cThe FBI is continuing to gather facts and will evaluate whether an investigation at the federal level will be pursued,\u201d FBI spokeswoman Laura Eimiller said in a statement emailed to USA TODAY.\n\nIn divorce documents, Jolie listed the couple's date of separation as the following day, Sept. 15.\n\nPeople.com reports that Pitt is accused of getting verbally abusive with one of couple's kids, as well as getting physical while the family was on their private plane. People and TMZ both note that Jolie and at least some of the couple's other children were present at the time. Pitt and Jolie have six children: Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department is so far not investigating. \"LAPD is not handling any report or allegations into child abuse against Brad Pitt,\" spokeswoman Officer Jenny Houser told USA TODAY in a statement on Thursday.\n\nAttempts to reach Jolie's representative were not successful.\n\nContributing: Maria Puente, Andrea Mandell", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3e938abe7ed0ca5309dedb7bc1501d51c48662d6/c=334-0-3202-2868/local/-/media/2016/09/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/636099657938457418-AFP-AFP-GB9GB-85377206.JPG", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/202873f19581ccd8804cc0a3a29e41bfdd4064ce/c=0-135-2348-1898/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/03//1396569253000-77097AW036-Changeling-Ne.jpg?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/88cc7aa0b38d7a0df7b592af9e4c28e6f9b598d1/c=0-135-2348-1463/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/03//1396569253000-77097AW036-Changeling-Ne.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ce813a6018216e7f7a78a1b878e46d0787fced46/c=0-0-2722-2722/local/-/media/2016/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636101649373229133-GTY-460533116-69488566.JPG", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/aa4866bdb4bd0271d607c664b5ec0929c9280022/c=532-0-3012-2480/local/-/media/2016/09/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636101456146113545-AFP-AFP-GE3WX.jpg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove2/29906170001/2016/09/29906170001_5137637843001_5137370613001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/9065941e142eb769bb76794c742e08d1e14ee558/r=300/http/www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/82a52f2a8a3886dd4af4d13aa59e9b066e007cfe/c=809-0-4043-3234/local/-/media/2016/09/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636100670626827101-XXX-AP-248864748776.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/88cc7aa0b38d7a0df7b592af9e4c28e6f9b598d1/c=0-135-2348-1463/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/03//1396569253000-77097AW036-Changeling-Ne.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kim Hjelmgaard", "Lorena Blas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/09/22/reports-brad-pitt-accused-child-abuse-under-investigation/90825098/", "title": "Brad Pitt, accused of child abuse, is under investigation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2016/09/22/reports-brad-pitt-accused-child-abuse-under-investigation/90825098/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt, accused of child abuse, is under investigation", "description": "Authorities are looking into the report.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/88cc7aa0b38d7a0df7b592af9e4c28e6f9b598d1/c=0-135-2348-1463/local/-/media/USATODAY/USATODAY/2014/04/03//1396569253000-77097AW036-Changeling-Ne.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Authorities are looking into the report.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1474498800.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
