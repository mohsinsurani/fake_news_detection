Since his diagnosis, he said, he has informed every sexual partner of his condition. He called it \u201cimpossible\u201d that he had transferred the virus to others.\n\nHe said the diagnosis came after he suffered a series of cluster headaches and night sweats.\n\n\u201cAfter a battery of tests \u2026 they walked in the room and said, \u2018Boom, here\u2019s what\u2019s going on,\u2019\u201d Sheen said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a hard three letters to absorb,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a turning point in one\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nHe said he revealed the diagnosis to people he thought he trusted, but some of them demanded money to keep the information to themselves. He paid those people \u201cin the millions,\u201d he said. Later in the show, Lauer said that Sheen told him it was more than $10 million.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking about shakedowns,\u201d Sheen said. \u201cI\u2019ve paid those people.\u201d\n\nOne of those people, he said, was a prostitute who entered his bathroom, took a cellphone picture of his medication and threatened to sell the image.\n\nAsked if he would continue to pay the people he\u2019d been paying, he said: \u201cNot after today, I\u2019m not.\u201d\n\n\u2018Charlie does not have AIDS\u2019\n\nSheen was joined on the show by his doctor, Robert Huizenga, an assistant professor of clinical medicine at UCLA ,and was asked directly if he had AIDS.\n\n\u201cCharlie does not have AIDS,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cAIDS is a condition where the HIV virus markedly suppresses the immune system and you are susceptible to rare, difficult cancers and infections. Charlie has none of those. He is healthy; he does not have AIDS.\u201d\n\nHIV, or human immunodeficiency virus, attacks the immune system by destroying white blood cells, which are vital to fighting infection. Once enough of these cells have been destroyed and the person has another \u201copportunistic\u201d infection like pneumonia or tuberculosis, the diagnosis moves to the final stage of the infection, called AIDS.\n\nThis won\u2019t be the AIDS-free generation\n\nThere are two main ways HIV is spread in the United States \u2013 by sex and by sharing needles, syringes or any of the equipment used to prepare and inject drugs. Anal sex carries the highest risk, followed by vaginal sex and having multiple partners.\n\nIn the \u201cToday\u201d interview, Sheen denied any possibility that he got the disease via drug use. \u201cNo needles,\u201d Sheen said. He also said he was no longer on drugs, but did continue to drink and seek the company of prostitutes.\n\nHIV discoverer: \u2018To develop a cure is almost impossible\u2019\n\nIn the past, Sheen has admitted to frequent visits to prostitutes at various times in his life. In July 1995, he testified in the tax evasion trial of \u201cHollywood madam\u201d Heidi Fleiss that he had spent $53,000 in one 15-month period on \u201csexual services.\u201d\n\nTwo cases of \u2018unprotected sex\u2019\n\nSheen told Lauer that he had unprotected sex \u201cunder the care of my doctor\u201d with two women since his diagnosis, but that it was \u201cimpossible\u201d that he had transferred the virus to them. While Huizenga did not agree that it\u2019s \u201cimpossible,\u201d he did say it was highly unlikely.\n\n\u201cHe was immediately put on treatment, strong antiviral drugs, which has suppressed the virus, to the point that he is absolutely healthy from that vantage,\u201d Huizenga said. \u201cIndividuals who are optimally treated with undetectable viral loads, (the risk is) incredibly low to transmit the virus. We can\u2019t say it\u2019s zero, but it\u2019s an incredibly low number.\u201d\n\nSocial media hails Sheen after announcement\n\nStaying on daily medication is important to keep the HIV virus from developing resistance and spreading, experts said.\n\n\u201cResistance occurs when the virus replicates in the presence of the drugs,\u201d said Dr. Stephen Boswell, president and CEO of Boston\u2019s Fenway Health, a healthcare organization that works with lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender people. \u201cMissed dosages lead to lower concentrations in the bloodstream and in the body, so the virus can become resistant and spread. So staying on your medications and not missing dosages is absolutely critical.\u201d\n\nHIV patients should start treatment immediately, U.N. says in new push\n\nSheen said that he was taking an antiviral \u201ccocktail\u201d of HIV drugs \u2013 four pills per day \u2013 and that he had not missed a day of medication, even while struggling with depression and substance abuse. Huizenga backed up his comment, saying that Sheen was undergoing lab tests every three to four months that showed the virus was at low levels.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s no longer a death sentence,\u201d Boswell said of HIV. \u201cIt\u2019s a very different time now. Most people just diagnosed with HIV will live an almost normal life span if they get an early diagnosis, appropriate care and stay on their medications.\u201d\n\nTeenager controls HIV infection without drugs for more than 12 years\n\nUp and downs\n\nSheen is one of Hollywood\u2019s best-known actors, starring in hit films such as \u201cWall Street\u201d and on the CBS sitcom \u201cTwo and a Half Men.\u201d\n\nSheen was fired from \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d in 2011 after a public meltdown that had the actor lashing out at the show\u2019s creator.\n\n\u2018Who\u2019s the Boss?\u2019 star Danny Pintauro reveals he\u2019s HIV-positive\n\nAmong the more notorious points of his career, Sheen entered drug rehab twice and lived at one time with three women.\n\nHe\u2019s also been married multiple times and has children with ex-wives Brooke Mueller and Denise Richards. His ex-wives and an older child are aware of his illness, he said in the NBC interview.\n\nA spokesman for Mueller told People magazine that she and her sons with Sheen, 6-year-old twins, do not have HIV.\n\nHis salary on \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d was one of the highest on TV at the time, at $1.25 million per episode in 2010.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/130118215738-charlie-sheen-getty.jpg?q=x_0,y_299,h_1687,w_2999,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150909142218-04-hiv-prep-heroes.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1125,w_1999,c_fill/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140110095114-charlie-sheen-0110.jpg?q=x_342,y_284,h_1245,w_2214,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/141127180602-new-hiv-infections-by-region.jpg?q=h_360,w_640,x_0,y_0,c_crop/h_576,w_1024,c_lpad,b_rgb:061015/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/120111063108-piers-sheen.jpg?q=x_4,y_0,h_710,w_1263,c_crop/h_144,w_256"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/130118215738-charlie-sheen-getty.jpg?q=x_0,y_299,h_1687,w_2999,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Hanna Doug Criss Sandee Lamotte", "Jason Hanna", "Doug Criss", "Sandee Lamotte"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/health/charlie-sheen-health/index.html", "title": "Charlie Sheen says he is HIV-positive", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Charlie Sheen says he is HIV-positive | CNN", "description": "In an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's \"Today\" show, Charlie Sheen revealed that he's HIV-positive.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/130118215738-charlie-sheen-getty.jpg?q=x_0,y_299,h_1687,w_2999,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2015/11/17/health/charlie-sheen-health/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Charlie Sheen says he is HIV-positive | CNN", "description": "In an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's \"Today\" show, Charlie Sheen revealed that he's HIV-positive.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/130118215738-charlie-sheen-getty.jpg?q=x_0,y_299,h_1687,w_2999,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNN"}, "description": "In an interview with Matt Lauer on NBC's \"Today\" show, Charlie Sheen revealed that he's HIV-positive.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "health", "theme": "health", "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-17T12:15:26Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-01T17:05:57Z", "tag": "aids and hiv, celebrities, charlie sheen, diseases and disorders, health and medical, immune system disorders, infectious diseases, business and industry sectors, life forms, microscopic life, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs, viruses", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "aids and hiv, celebrities, charlie sheen, diseases and disorders, health and medical, immune system disorders, infectious diseases, business and industry sectors, life forms, microscopic life, pharmaceuticals and biotechnology, pharmaceuticals and prescription drugs, viruses", "author": "Jason Hanna,Doug Criss,Sandee LaMotte", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1447718400.0, "source": "http://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
