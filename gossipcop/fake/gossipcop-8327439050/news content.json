Even before the presumably lucrative Netflix deal, the pair were worth $30 million, according to 2018 estimates from Money.com. They merged their finances when they decided against a prenuptial agreement before their wedding.\n\nMeghan and Harry are expected to still receive funds from the Duchy of Cornwall, a private fund managed by Prince Charles, which amounts to \u00a32.3 million ($3 million) a year. Harry is also expected to receive a sizeable yearly cut of Princess Diana's estate.\n\nBefore marrying Prince Harry, Markle was earning close to half a million dollars a year starring in the USA Network drama \"Suits,\" plus a five-figure income from endorsement deals and sponsorships. Money.com reported in 2018 that her total net worth was estimated to be $5 million.\n\nHere's where all their pre-royal money came from.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/5e177e87b2e66a648e2a3e63?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5e17a41df442310841655b42?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e178033b2e66a66516b3264?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e178254b2e66a687723d9d6?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/5e177b13f442315f052aab49?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5e177a4424fe125a18712e2c?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://i.insider.com/587e7963dd0895651c8b4beb?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5f29a5d50ef1884bf07e9506?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/5f500251e6ff30001d4e6be0?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5adf80d219ee8649008b486f?width=700", "https://i.insider.com/5ae73e5619ee861e008b466d?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "http://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5e1780bab2e66a66a45b2110?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5f29a5d50ef1884bf07e9506?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tanza Loudenback", "Taylor Borden", "Darcy Schild"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/prince-harry-net-worth-2018-4", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are already worth at least $30 million \u2014 and none of that money belongs to the crown", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle are already worth at least $30 million \u2014 and none of that money belongs to the crown", "datePublished": "2020-09-03T12:22:00Z", "dateModified": "2020-09-03T12:22:34Z", "news_keywords": "Royal Family, Prince Harry, Meghan Markle, Net Worth, Arts & Culture, Features, BI Select, Tanza Loudenback, Taylor Borden, Darcy Schild", "description": "Meghan and Harry are worth about $30 million without the Queen's support.
