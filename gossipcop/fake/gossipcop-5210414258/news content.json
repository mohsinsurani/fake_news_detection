This is why every right-thinking person hates St Valentine\u2019s Day. Scheduling a day for romance is as joyful as a deflated heart-shaped balloon.\n\nWe\u2019re in Stanley\u2019s on St Andrew\u2019s Street in Dublin, downstairs in the wine bar. It\u2019s an unplanned outing after an impromptu cry of \u201cLet\u2019s go out, but not to our usual place\u201d. I\u2019ve eaten here before, and enjoyed it except for some oversalted fish. This is a second chance. They don\u2019t come easily.\n\nBut two things happened after the previous review. First, a man who was at the next table wrote to me to say how much he loved Stanley\u2019s. He had no vested interest, but was talking as a well-dined eater about town. Later, I found out that chef and co-owner Stephen McArdle had something more important on his hands than my dinner that night. His son had been born hours before.\n\nIf that doesn\u2019t earn a second chance, nothing will. So we\u2019re tucked in at a small table under the sloping ceiling. The walls are painted a soft green. There\u2019s a candle in a wax-crusted wine bottle on the table and high-class jazz standards on the sound system.\n\nREAD MORE\n\nFor the moment, it feels like we\u2019re not in Dublin. We could be in a city anywhere and lucky enough to find a place we\u2019ll remember fondly when we get home.\n\nThe menu is chalked up on the wall and Liam has already ordered some cod croquettes, balls of soft fluffy fish in crispy lagging jackets sitting in a small puddle of silken house mayonnaise.\n\nThe star of Stanley's is Morgan Vanderkamer. She's the sommelier here. But don't let that put you off. Bad sommeliers are pretentious up-sellers, there to push diners towards the wallet-busting bruisers on the wine list. Vanderkamer has taken the nonsense out of the role and will open your mind to new ideas about what to drink with your food. If you thought sherry was for fogeys and posers, she will change your mind. So we have ice-cold glasses of manzanilla to cut through the fluffy cod croquettes. We are in excellent hands.\n\nThe main event is the Irish charcuterie sharing plate. We\u2019re going with an oloroso, the ruby-coloured sherry that gets its colour and kick from time and ageing. There are two on the menu, Vanderkamer says. One is good; the other is \u201camazing\u201d, and priced accordingly, she warns. With a \u20ac16 plate of food between us, we push the sherry cask out and live it large on the oloroso at \u20ac13 a glass. It is a good decision.\n\nThere\u2019s a small farmyard on that \u20ac16 charcuterie plate: generous slices of duck ham, smoked cured slices of moist pink meat. The duck ham is the soulmate of the apricot puree dotted on one side of the plate. The sharp pickled gherkins sing with the \u201cbacon and cabbage\u201d, a slice of ham hock terrine wrapped in crinkly soft leaves of bright-green savoy cabbage. There are two small delicate slabs of mi-cuit fois gras, delicate to the point of dissolving on contact with the tongue. The pear and vanilla sauce, in a small ramekin, takes the sweetness of the liver to another even more decadent place.\n\nJust in case there isn\u2019t enough on the plate (there is), we\u2019ve ordered a plate of the bean and chorizo stew. The beans are in fact chick peas \u2013 but that\u2019s even better in my book \u2013 and the chorizo has been minced to a small rubble that sits on top of the soupy mix. It\u2019s the kind of stew where the juices have transformed from separate elements of meat, tomato, oil and wine into one glistening sheen. We get a blended Priorat, a Spanish red as heartwarming as the stew, to sip with it.\n\nDessert would be an option only for people less greedy in their savoury ordering. There\u2019s a final glass of Rasteau, a fortified Grenache that\u2019s served deliciously chilly. It\u2019s a thought-provoking alternative to a syrupy dessert wine, and next time we\u2019ll leave space for some cheese to go with it.\n\nRomantic is a bleached-out word, but that\u2019s what Stanley\u2019s wine bar is: a properly love-it romantic joint, a new favourite to add to your list.\n\nDinner for two, with sherries and wine, came to \u20ac84.75.", "images": ["https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/Ls-pCFF0O7fhrbMAHTAza5RGIwc=/600x338/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/NPJMN3AYLNETTP2G4OAHNBE4ZM.png", "https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/BJJKNJJHDJDGDDODHEER7FDH44.png", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/JBIpgjik8r6e_CLS0ZwZv2PAAGI=/84x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/irishtimes/bba5081b-b2c6-4005-bbf6-2e1ad82d5096.png", "https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/T2XGUGDSUZCOZAYIQEKG2TWML4.png", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/irishtimes/1647534191733.svg", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/GNIsK2SfKv4UN5YJ6oHS8TlkHP0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/OTXPNPQPMSLEEBG7XPYUWRBLNM.jpg", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/1qnkNi_Qp7cHz1CyvIfEAccAG-s=/1600x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/OTXPNPQPMSLEEBG7XPYUWRBLNM.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8946263&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/GNIsK2SfKv4UN5YJ6oHS8TlkHP0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/OTXPNPQPMSLEEBG7XPYUWRBLNM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catherine Cleary", "Sat Feb"], "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/restaurant-reviews/restaurant-review-stanley-s-gets-a-second-look-and-comes-up-smelling-of-roses-1.2522563", "title": "Restaurant review: Stanley\u2019s gets a second look and comes up smelling of roses", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "This cosy spot on St Andrew\u2019s Street nails the wine-with-tasty-food night out perfectly", "twitter": {"description": "This cosy spot on St Andrew\u2019s Street nails the wine-with-tasty-food night out perfectly", "title": "Restaurant review: Stanley\u2019s gets a second look and comes up smelling of roses", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/GNIsK2SfKv4UN5YJ6oHS8TlkHP0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/OTXPNPQPMSLEEBG7XPYUWRBLNM.jpg", "site": "@IrishTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "This cosy spot on St Andrew\u2019s Street nails the wine-with-tasty-food night out perfectly", "title": "Restaurant review: Stanley\u2019s gets a second look and comes up smelling of roses", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/GNIsK2SfKv4UN5YJ6oHS8TlkHP0=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/OTXPNPQPMSLEEBG7XPYUWRBLNM.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/life-and-style/food-and-drink/restaurant-reviews/restaurant-review-stanley-s-gets-a-second-look-and-comes-up-smelling-of-roses-1.2522563"}, "keywords": "morgan-vanderkamer,stephen-mcardle", "robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.irishtimes.com", "summary": ""}
