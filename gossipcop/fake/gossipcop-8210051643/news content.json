Before she was romantically linked to NBA boyfriend Thompson in September 2016, Kardashian dealt with allegations of extramarital affairs during her nearly eight-year relationship with ex-husband Lamar Odom.\n\nA source close to Odom, 38, told PEOPLE recently that \u201cLamar feels terrible for Khlo\u00e9. He wasn\u2019t sure if he should reach out and see how she\u2019s doing. He feels for her.\u201d\n\nKardashian and Odom wed on Sept. 27, 2009 \u2014 one month to the day after they met (and nine days after getting engaged) \u2014 but the marriage fell apart after the former basketball player\u2019s cheating scandal and drug relapse, which led Kardashian to file for divorce in 2013.\n\nWatch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nCheating rumors against Odom first circulated in January 2012, when a tabloid report claimed Odom cheated on Kardashian with a woman he met at a Washington, D.C., strip club. And in July 2013, the pair were confronted rumors claiming Odom had been unfaithful to Kardashian after playing a game for the Dallas Mavericks.\n\nJAKE HOLLY/startraksphoto.com\n\n\u201cLove is blind \u2026 Lamar was so great at making me feel like I was the only one and I\u2019m this princess. I never speculated cheating \u2026 so I didn\u2019t know about cheating \u2026 until before the DUI [in 2013],\u201d Kardashian told Howard Stern in January 2016.\n\n\u201cHe was so good. So nothing was on his cell phones, [but] he had an assistant. They were all on his assistant\u2019s phone, so he was really crafty,\u201d she recalled as Stern asked the former Kocktails with Khlo\u00e9 host: \u201cDoesn\u2019t that feel awful when the assistant knows, and everyone knows?\u201d To which Kardashian agreed, \u201cOh, it\u2019s disgusting.\u201d\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian & Lamar Odom: A Timeline of Their Relationship\n\n\u201cBut all these rumors kept coming out in the weeklies, and as much as I know they\u2019re bull\u2014-, where there\u2019s smoke there\u2019s fire. Something has to be right here,\u201d Kardashian revealed. \u201cIt is humiliating on any level, but I found out he was cheating on me the majority of our marriage, I just didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nIn October 2015, Odom was rushed to the hospital after being found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. Near death, he spent four days in a coma, and Kardashian rushed to his side and called off their divorce proceedings temporarily.\n\nImeh Akpanudosen/Getty; JB Lacroix/WireImage\n\nMonths before, in July 2015, both stars had signed divorce papers, but the judgment had not yet been entered in court by the time Odom was hospitalized; thus, they were technically still legally married. As a result, Kardashian was making all of Odom\u2019s medical decisions.\n\nUpon his recovery, Odom completed a 30-day drug rehab program.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 refiled for divorce once Odom recovered from the Nevada incident, and their split was finalized in December 2016.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s BFF Khadijah Haqq Takes Aim at Tristan Thompson During Cheating Scandal\n\nIn July 2017, Odom penned an emotional first-person essay for The Players\u2019 Tribune in which he touched on how his drug addiction and infidelity tore apart his marriage.\n\n\u201cAnybody who\u2019s lived a complicated, drug-infused life like I\u2019ve lived knows the cycle \u2014 with women, cheating on my wife, s\u2014 like that,\u201d he wrote.\n\nJerritt Clark/Getty Images\n\nOne of his \u201cdarkest\u201d moments, he admitted, was when Kardashian caught him doing drugs with another woman. \u201cI was in a motel room, getting high with this chick, and my wife (at the time) walked in. That probably was like rock bottom. First of all I was in a motel. A motel,\u201d he remembered.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a millionaire. I\u2019d made it out of Jamaica, Queens, and won two NBA titles. And I\u2019m in a motel, with some random person, doing coke. But I just wanted to get high with this girl, and I had no other place to go. I couldn\u2019t take her home. You know, I was being a scumbag,\u201d he wrote.\n\nOdom still thinks highly of Kardashian. Asked in January by BET\u2019s Mancave about Khlo\u00e9 being pregnant, Odom said he\u2019s \u201chappy for her,\u201d adding, \u201cShe took care of me, she\u2019ll be a good mother. For real. She\u2019s a great woman.\u201d\n\nNow, a source told PEOPLE that when Kardashian got together with Thompson, her sisters were \u201creally happy to see Khloe so excited about someone again because she hadn\u2019t felt that way about a guy since Lamar. Eventually Tristan won over her family too \u2026 he really seemed dedicated to her, so this must be a shock to everyone.\u201d", "images":
