There have been rumors going around that Prince Charles isn\u2019t Prince Harry\u2019s real dad, so many fans are wondering if Harry and James Hewitt are actually father and son since they look alike. Scroll down to find out!\n\nIs Prince Harry Charles\u2019 son?\n\nPrincess Diana\u2019s ex-lover recently confirmed that Charles is Prince Harry\u2019s biological father. In a previous interview with Australia\u2019s Sunday Night, James was asked, \u201cAre you Harry\u2019s father?\u201d from the show\u2019s host. \u201cNo, I\u2019m not,\u201d the 60-year-old candidly admitted. He was then asked why he thought the truth of Harry\u2019s paternity has been in constant doubt over the years. \u201cIt sells papers. It\u2019s worse for [Harry], probably, poor chap,\u201d James shared.\n\nJames in 2004.\n\nJames and Diana previously met in 1986, two years after Harry was born (Diana welcomed Harry with Charles in September 1984). The two were introduced around the same time Charles was rumored to be having an affair with his now-wife, Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. However, James\u2019 claims prove that Charles is actually Harry\u2019s father (Phew!).\n\nJames reflected on his and Diana\u2019s whirlwind and private romance. \u201cIt\u2019s a gradual period and then, you know, suddenly you can\u2019t get enough of each other or see each other as much as you want,\u201d he said, adding they had some great, low-key times together. \u201cI\u2019d cook and she\u2019d wash up. Just dinner and relaxing and laughing.\u201d\n\nTheir affair was soon exposed by the press, which led to their eventual split. Diana and Charles \u2014 who are also parents to a 35-year-old son, Prince William \u2014 later divorced in 1996 after 15 years of marriage. Diana died in a car crash in August 1997.\n\nWhile Harry has expressed in the past that he\u2019s close with his dad, the red-headed royal also had a strong bond with his late mother and recently revealed how he\u2019s keeping her legacy alive through his charity work. \u201cI want to do something that makes my mother proud,\u201d he said. \u201cLucky for me I\u2019ve got the prince bit so I\u2019m able to make a difference.\u201d\n\nJoin our Facebook group for the latest updates on Kate Middleton, Prince William, and all things royal!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-james-hewitts-son.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-james-hewitts-son.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TITANIC_300x490_7_11r.gif?fit=300%2C490&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/james-hewitt.jpg?fit=400%2C659&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C659"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/prince-harry-james-hewitts-son.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/prince-harry-dad-rumors-127594/", "title": "Who's Prince Harry's Real Father?
