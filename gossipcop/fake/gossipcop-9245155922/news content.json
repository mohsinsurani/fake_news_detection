Simpson has been paroled.\n\nPhoto via Getty\n\nYes, it looks like the football great and likely double-murderer might be a free man as early as October 1.\n\nThe 70-year-old Simpson, of course, is one of the most notorious public figures in America.\n\nAs a result, it stands to reason that the question of what he\u2019ll do after his release is looming large today.\n\nWill he write another ill-advised memoir, or did he learn his lesson the first time?\n\nWill he attempt to re-enter public life, or simply lay low?\n\nAnd, of course, will the Juice make an appearance on Maury to settle the most famous paternity mystery since Jon Snow?\n\nPhoto via E!\n\nAs you may have heard, a rumor that O.J. is Khloe Kardashian\u2019s father has been circulating on the Internet for years and years.\n\nProponents cite several pieces of \u201cevidence,\u201d including the fact that Kris Jenner and Simpson ran in the same social circles.\n\n(The physical dissimilarities between Khloe and her sisters is perhaps the biggest driver of this long-running theory.)\n\nOne thing that is fact, father than fiction, is that at the time of his arrest for double murder, Simpson was tight with the family.\n\nO.J. was so close with the Kardashians that they were prominently featured in the FX miniseries about the Simpson trial.\n\nSo some considered it strange that the 33-year-old Khloe didn\u2019t comment on the news of Simpson\u2019s impending release.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nAnd the Internet being the Internet, a handful of folks flocked to Khloe\u2019s Instagram page to try and coax a comment out of her.\n\nKhloe posted the above pic to her Instagram page yesterday, and not surprisingly, many of the comments had little to do with the photo.\n\nO.J. was the news of the day, and the reactions to Khloe\u2019s photo reflected that \u2026 sometimes amusingly, other times inappropriately.\n\n\u201cDad\u2019s on his way home from that vacation your mom told you about when you were a kid,\u201d joked one fan.\n\n\u201cThe face you make when you find out Daddy\u2019s home #oj,\u201d commented another.\n\n\u201cYour dad is out of prison girl, u must be thrilled,\u201d wrote a third.\n\nEventually, Khloe broke Internet Rule Number One and fed the trolls, but she did so without debasing herself by engaging in one-on-one arguments.\n\n\u201cPeople are a\u2013oles but I don\u2019t care lol. I focus on the good,\u201d Khloe wrote. \u201cThey are all f-cked lol such a\u2013holes.\u201d\n\n\u201cHehe oh well\u2026 I\u2019m happy and they hatin\u2019.\u201d\n\nJokes are one thing, but mean-spirited comments made directly to Khloe without an iota of wit are uncalled for.\n\nAnd, as many fans pointed out, in some cases, they\u2019re disrespectful to the late Robert Kardashian Sr. (with O.J., above).\n\nThe elder Robert Kardashian died in 2003 at the age of 59; Kris Jenner and Kardashian married in 1978 but later divorced.\n\nFortunately, Khloe\u2019s been in the spotlight for the better part of two decades, so she knows exactly how to handle this sort of thing by now.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20980%20552'%3E%3Crect%20width='980'%20height='552'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/04/oj-simpson.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/sean-spicer-looking-down-320x240.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/a-few-words-from-khloe-kardashian.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/oj-and-khlo.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/oj-and-khlo-720x540.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20566%20495'%3E%3Crect%20width='566'%20height='495'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/khloe-kardashian-selfie-for-the-gram-1024x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='540'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20681'%3E%3Crect%20width='1024'%20height='681'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/oj-simpson-parole-hearing-image-1024x681.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/jamel-dunn-photo-320x240.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='1024'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/07/oj-and-khlo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/07/khloe-kardashian-responds-to-rumors-oj-simpson-is-her-father/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Responds to O.J.
