This comes on the (Yeezy plastic stiletto) heels of the news that her sister Kourtney recently filed documents for a cosmetics company called Kourt, so it looks like Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty isn't the only new beauty brand giving Kylie Cosmetics a run for its money.\n\nLike her sisters, Khlo\u00e9 has always been outspoken about her love for the beauty game, especially when it comes to makeup. Recently, someone tried to makeup-shame the mogul by demanding she \"post a real pic [with] no makeup and normal angels,\" to which she responded, \"I don't take those lol.\"\n\nThough this is the first indication that Khlo\u00e9 may be launching a line of her own, it's hardly the first time she's taken her passion for the perfect contour and turned it into a business venture: She was a part of the Kardashian Beauty licensing deal with Kim and Kourtney way back in the day and collaborated with Kylie Cosmetics on a limited-edition lip kit collection called The Koko Collection. (Foreshadowing, anyone?)\n\nKhlo\u00e9's own go-to makeup routine is fairly simple, so it will be interesting to see if the aesthetic of her line maintains the same sort of ease of products that she values in her own routine. Her \"ride-or-die\" products include a concealer for spot treatment, a contour and highlight kit, some mascara, and a nude lip pencil that she doubles as a lipstick. It's unclear what exactly she plans to sell in her own makeup line, but according to TMZ, her application covers a \"broad range of makeup merch,\" so here's hoping she gives us all an easy way to replicate this Kardashian-approved routine at home.\n\nRead more about Khlo\u00e9:", "images": ["http://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6318eff12351b74a815cd74e/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/63330b4ab92ee9720de0b0a6/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633ee19e9bcb3c4fb1bb3b62/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a676e87e7f13a1627fd6a65/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/khloe%20kardashian%20makeup%20line%20koko.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a66516f296f5478826632d4/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/khloe-kardashian-makeup-copyright-name.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/632c9bcfc82769820c08f48e/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a676e87e7f13a1627fd6a65/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/khloe%20kardashian%20makeup%20line%20koko.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Zoe Weiner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/khloe-kardashian-trademarks-name-makeup-collection", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Trademarks \"Koko\" Name for Makeup Collection", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian joins Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics and Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty with the reported trademarking of her own beauty line.", "id": "5a664ba4296f5478826632d2", "keywords": "khloe kardashian,kourtney,koko kollection,kim kardashian,kylie,snd", "news_keywords": "khloe kardashian,kourtney,koko kollection,kim kardashian,kylie,snd", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a664ba4296f5478826632d2", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian joins Kylie Jenner's Kylie Cosmetics and Kim Kardashian's KKW Beauty with the reported trademarking of her own beauty line.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5a66516f296f5478826632d4/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/khloe-kardashian-makeup-copyright-name.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5a66516f296f5478826632d4/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/khloe-kardashian-makeup-copyright-name.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Even the Kardashians gotta keep up with the Kardashians.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a676e87e7f13a1627fd6a65/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/khloe%20kardashian%20makeup%20line%20koko.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Is Reportedly Launching Her OWN Makeup Line", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/khloe-kardashian-trademarks-name-makeup-collection"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-23T13:05:24.830Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-23T13:05:24.830Z", "author": "Zoe Weiner"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Even the Kardashians gotta keep up with the Kardashians.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5a676e87e7f13a1627fd6a65/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/khloe%20kardashian%20makeup%20line%20koko.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Is Reportedly Launching Her OWN Makeup Line"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516712724.83, "source": "http://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
