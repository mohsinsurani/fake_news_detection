We will expect our governments to make sure that the laws of equal pay for equal work are upheld. We will demand that our workplaces are diverse and equitable so that they can best reflect the world in which we actually live. A world that allows all of us behind and in front of the camera to thrive shoulder to shoulder with our male colleagues.\u201d\n\nMoment historique de ce 71e @Festival_Cannes la \u201cMont\u00e9e des Femmes\u201d. 82 Femmes du cin\u00e9ma r\u00e9unies sur les marches #Cannes2018 #F\u00e9minisme pic.twitter.com/aTO6sjekp2 \u2013 Citizen Cannes TV (@CITIZENCANNES) May 12, 2018\n\n\u201cWe acknowledge all of the women and men who are standing for change. The stairs of our industry MUST be accessible to all. Let\u2019s climb.\u201d\n\nVarda is one of only two women in Cannes Film Festival\u2019s history to receive the Palme d\u2019Or \u2014 the highest prize awarded \u2014 along with New Zealand filmmaker Jane Champion.\n\nThe group stood on the steps of the Palais des Festival silently to protest how hard it still is to climb the ladder as a woman in Hollywood. The protests, part of the rising 5050\u00d72020 movement was planned ahead of the premiere of \u201cGirls of the Sun,\u201d a film in competition by director Eva Husson, one of only three female filmmakers in the running.\n\nAlso Read: Women in Cannes: A Short History of Small Victories and Decades of Male Dominance (Photos)\n\nThat is an improvement over Cannes\u2019 historical record. Only 82 films in official selection in the history of the Cannes Film Festival have been directed by women. The number of women participating in the protest was selected to match this figure.\n\nOthers involved in the vigil are Salma Hayek, Marion Cotillard, director Patty Jenkins and Haifaa al-Mansour, and agents including CAA\u2019s Hylda Queally and activist-journalist Melissa Silverstein.\n\nDuVernay and Stewart are on the jury. Fonda is at the festival for the screening of a documentary about her life.\n\nSilverstein told TheWrap that the protest originated with the French group Le Deuxieme Regard and the 5050\u00d72020 collective, working directly with the festival.\n\n\u201cThey get all the credit,\u201d said Silverstein. \u201cI am honored to work with them to amplify the message about the need for more women in the competition at the festival. This feels like a very big moment.\u201d\n\nOn the 5050\u00d72020 website, the organization released a statement echoing many of those given by women involved in the #MeToo and Time\u2019s Up movements in Hollywood, noting how the downfall of producer Harvey Weinstein has triggered a demand for change and calling for the French film industry to confront that demand.\n\nAlso Read: 'Girls of the Sun' Film Review: A Middle Eastern Feminist Hero Slays ISIS\n\n\u201cWhile French cinema wasn\u2019t shaken by the Weinstein shock wave, it is essential that we move to take concrete action reaching beyond the issue of sexual abuse alone,\u201d the site\u2019s statement reads.\n\n\u201cWe believe that the distribution of power needs to be questioned. We believe that equality restores the balance of power. We believe that diversity deeply changes representations. We believe that the opportunity to work in an egalitarian and inclusive environment must be seized because we are certain that the equal sharing of power will promote profound creative renewal.\u201d\n\nAs TheWrap reported recently, the statistics for women in Cannes are pretty dismal: Over the first 71 years, a paltry 4.3 percent of the competition films have been directed by women. (See chart below.) Only one, Jane Campion\u2019s \u201cThe Piano,\u201d has won the Palme d\u2019Or, though actresses Adele Exarchopoulos and Lea Seydoux were given honorary Palmes alongside \u201cBlue Is the Warmest Color\u201d director Abdellatif Kechiche\u2019s real one in 2013.\n\nAdmittedly, things are getting better. Of the 11 times that three or more women have placed films in competition, eight have come in the last 13 years. Three women made the cut in 2006, 2007, 2009, 2015, 2016, 2017 and 2018 \u2014 and four did so in 2011.\n\nAlso Read: Cannes' Female Troubles: Women Directors Have Always Been Scarce\n\nThis year along with Husson, the women in competition include Nadine Labaki with \u201cCapharnaum\u201d and Alice Rohrwacher with \u201cHappy as Lazzaro.\u201d", "images":
