Twigs since 2014, and recently told Howard Stern they were \u201ckind of\u201d engaged. But when asked by GQ if he was getting married, the actor \u2014 who revealed he calls his girlfriend Twigs \u2014 responded with a noncommittal \u201ceh.\u201d\n\nDaniel Jackson/GQ\n\nPattinson said that he went to therapy a few years ago \u2013 and his therapist commented that he was good at \u201ctalking without saying anything.\u201d He said he uses that skill in all his interviews. The Good Time actor explained that he chooses to stay private so people don\u2019t form ideas about his personality that may later change and label him as dishonest.\n\n\u201cI want to be misunderstood,\u201d he told the magazine after declining to talk about anything personal. \u201cPeople are always changing, and the more you put something down in print, people form opinions and they\u2019re constantly creating who they think you are. If you do something that contradicts that, or if you do something which goes out of that box, then you can look like a liar or something like that.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Chrissy Metz on \u2018This Is Us\u2019, Crying on Set, and Her Body Positivity\n\nThe actor also revealed the great lengths he\u2019d go to during the height of the Twilight whirlwind to a little privacy. He recalled how he would have different cars parked around Los Angeles with a full change of clothes. If he noticed he was being followed by paparazzi, he would pop into the garages, change, and leave in a different car.\n\nHe would also try to confuse photographers by having all of his friends order different rides out of restaurants when they were together and sending the cars to different places after trading outfits with one of his friends. Pattinson also recalled riding in trunks several times to hide from the photographers \u2013 and once drove around all night when one was tailing him to find out where his new house is.\n\n\u201cThere are ways to disappear, like, fairly easily,\u201d he said. \u201cIt just involves effort, and most people can\u2019t be bothered to put the effort in.\u201d\n\nGood Time hits theaters August 11.",
