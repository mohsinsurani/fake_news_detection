(Eric Risberg / Associated Press) \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u201d got a chilly reception on some airwaves earlier this year, but the seasonal favorite is heating up the charts, thanks to loyal fans who are pushing back against, well, the backlash. The tune has grown controversial in recent years, due to a changing cultural climate and conversations cropping up in the wake of #MeToo, prompting some radio stations to remove the song from airplay. But the tide appears to be turning for \u201cBaby, It\u2019s Cold Outside.\u201d On Monday, San Francisco-area radio station KOIT-FM (96.5) announced that it had returned the song to its rotation after a vast majority of listeners in an online poll voted to have it reinstated. \u201cKOIT\u2019s listeners have spoken, and the overwhelming message is they do want to hear \u2018Baby, It\u2019s Cold Outside\u2019 on our station, as they have throughout the years,\u201d KOIT program director Brian Figula said in Monday\u2019s statement. The radio station was one of several that had excised the song from their playlists, is now among those that reversed their original decision after fan outrage. And it\u2019s not just on the radio where \u201cBaby\u201d is gaining ground. Billboard\u2019s Holiday Digital Song Sales chart for the week of Dec. 15 feature three different versions of the song, with Dean Martin\u2019s 1959 rendition at No. 2, Idina Menzel and Michael Bubl\u00e9\u2019s 2014 duet reentering the chart at No. 29, and Leon Redbone and Zooey Deschanel\u2019s 2003 duet from the \u201cElf\u201d soundtrack debuting at No. 41. As for radio stations, they remain dedicated to giving the audience what it wants. \u201cMore than seven out of every ten listeners who responded said although some lyrics of the song may reflect a different era and a different sensibility than today, still they love the tradition and history of the song, and want to hear it as part of their holiday season,\u201d Figula\u2019s statement added. \u201cAt KOIT, we always listen carefully when our listeners take time to comment.

Literally biting because it\u2019s Serkis via his immortal rendition of Gollum. The \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d actor reprised a version of the One Ring-obsessed character in a new video posted by We Wants It. Much like the Gollum of the film series, Serkis\u2019 May has her own fixation: the Brexit withdrawal agreement. \u201cOh, Precious, our agreement,\u201d says a blue-suit clad Serkis. \u201cThis is it. Our deal \u2026 We takes back control: Money, borders, laws, blue passportses.\u201d But another May personality quickly rebuts: \u201cNo. It hurts the people. Makes them poorer.\u201d The parody features the two sides of May arguing with herself and it\u2019s somehow both hilarious and terrifying. One personality only cares about how much she wants the \u201cjuicy and sweet\u201d deal, while the other recognizes that there are plenty of people opposed to the idea. \u201cThey hates the deal, all of them hates it. They wants a people\u2019s vote,\u201d Gollum/May says to herself. The People\u2019s Vote refers to the efforts of those in the U.K. calling for a public vote on whether Britain will leave or remain in the EU based on the terms of the final exit agreement. On Monday, the real May delayed the parliamentary vote for the Brexit plan because she feared it did not have enough support to pass. The vote had been scheduled for Tuesday. While May has defended the deal (that EU leaders have said is the only one on the table), it has been slammed by both Brexit-backers and \u201cremainers\u201d who oppose leaving the 28-nation bloc. As of now Britain is scheduled to leave the EU on March 29, 2019.

Recovery from that surgery has been relatively smooth, but the 28-year-old has contended with a spate of other medical issues that resulted in additional procedures. After the second transplant, she had surgery to mitigate her endometriosis and another to repair a hernia. The chronic illnesses have resulted in six surgeries in the past 16 months, she told Self magazine, where she opened up about her tumultuous medical journey. \u201cI\u2019m stable. I\u2019m thriving. I\u2019m super happy with life,\u201d the 28-year-old actress said. .@sarah_hyland was born with kidney dysplasia. She went into kidney failure, and needed a transplant. In 2012, her dad gave her one of his. What Hyland hasn\u2019t been ready to share until now is that in 2016, her body began to reject the donated kidney. https://t.co/iAw8rdXJ1z pic.twitter.com/rR0xqZPiGy \u2014 SELF (@SELFmagazine) December 10, 2018 Hyland was born with kidney dysplasia, which causes the organs to grow debilitating cysts. She had a kidney transplant in 2012, with her father giving one of his kidneys to his daughter. But in October 2016, her body began rejecting the transplant and \u2014 under the scrutiny of social media and the public eye \u2014 Hyland\u2019s weight dropped, her face swelled due to immunosuppressant drugs and fluid retention and her blood pressure spiked, damaging her vision, the mag said. The candid star said she began dialysis in February 2017 to filter her blood because her kidneys couldn\u2019t. However, the treatment fell short and the transplanted kidney had to come out. Doctors removed it that May, then in September of that year transplanted a kidney donated by her younger brother, Ian. \u201cI was very depressed,\u201d she told the magazine. \u201cWhen a family member gives you a second chance at life, and it fails, it almost feels like it\u2019s your fault. It\u2019s not. But it does.\u201d Hyland felt completely helpless, she said, and for a long time contemplated suicide. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to fail my little brother like I failed my dad,\u201d she said. \u201cI had gone through [my whole life] of always being a burden, of always having to be looked after, having to be cared for.\u201d The thoughts subsided after she reached out to a friend, and she encouraged others to do the same. \u201cIt\u2019s not shameful,\u201d she said. \u201cFor anybody that wants to reach out to somebody but doesn\u2019t really know how because they\u2019re too proud or they think that they\u2019ll be looked upon as weak, it\u2019s not a shameful thing to say. It\u2019s not a shameful thing to share.\u201d Hyland said on Instagram on Monday that she shared her story so others might \u201cfeel like they\u2019re not alone.\u201d \u201cHopefully those that are lucky enough not to experience this will learn about something new and take a moment to appreciate their health,\u201d she wrote.

While the humans are still hanging out in the background, wringing their hands and staring in mute disbelief, far more of the footage is given over to the wrath of the titans. Heck, Godzilla even takes on King Ghidorah head-to-head(-to-head-to-head) and it looks amazing. See what it looks like when the world burns, but this time the old gods are to blame. \u201cGodzilla: King of the Monsters\u201d is scheduled to stomp its way into theaters May 31.

Last year, when he also made the shortlist, Trump tweeted he had passed on the nominal title, though Time disagreed Separated families: Despite weathering the fallout of putting a crying Honduran child who had not been separated from her family on its magazine cover earlier this year, Time still selected migrant families at the U.S.-Mexico border as candidates for its Person of the Year, again highlighting the battle over immigration in the U.S. Vladimir Putin: The Russian president was named Person of the Year in 2007 and has continued to make headlines due to Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the 2016 presidential election, and his relationship with Trump. Which brings us to ... Robert Mueller: The special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, who has been investigating allegations of Russian meddling in the election and Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, has become a foil to the bombastic leader. Though the investigation has ensnared Trump\u2019s former personal attorney Michael Cohen, his former campaign Chairman Paul Manafort and several others, Trump has repeatedly decried it as a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d for evidence of collusion with Russia. Ryan Coogler: The \u201cBlack Panther\u201d director and screenwriter turned a lesser-known superhero into a cultural phenomenon with his groundbreaking film, which became a critical darling and broke a bevy of box-office records while boasting a predominantly black cast. Christine Blasey Ford: The university professor who accused U.S. Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh of sexually assaulting her when they were teenagers brought the nation to a standstill with her emotional testimony in front of the Senate Judiciary Committee in September, throwing Kavanaugh\u2019s shoo-in appointment into question for weeks. Jamal Khashoggi: The Saudi journalist was killed soon after he entered the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul, and his disappearance led to widespread criticism of the Arab nation, particularly Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is believed to have ordered Khashoggi\u2019s murder. March for Our Lives activists: The teenagers who survived the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School shooting in Parkland, Fla., assembled to take on gun control and march on Washington, D.C., to speak out against gun violence. Moon Jae-in: The South Korean president, who helped host the Olympic Games this year, mounted a historic summit with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, officially bringing about an end to the war between the two countries. Meghan Markle: The \u201cSuits\u201d actress who hails from California became the Duchess of Sussex when she married Britain\u2019s Prince Harry in May, offering a fairy-tale reprieve from pressing conflicts around the world. In October, the couple announced that they were expecting their first child, who would be seventh in line to the British throne.

With the always-on news cycle of 2018, the cold open is typically a feast-or-famine affair that benefits from standout, vaguely surreal moments \u2014 Kanye West in the White House, for example. With so much news this week surrounding the legal affairs of the president\u2019s inner circle, \u201cSNL\u201d imagined the FBI\u2019s special counsel as the boogeyman in Eric Trump\u2019s closet. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, it\u2019s just me,\u201d De Niro assured him, \u201cyour dad\u2019s friend from work.\u201d Alex Moffat as a clueless Eric and Mikey Day as Don Jr. has been a solid pairing on Weekend Update, and they were natural choices given the news cycle. Still, the segment lacked the sort of standout snap that makes the cold open the usual talking point for the episode, apart from its closing exchange. \u201cPeople say you\u2019re the worst thing that happened to my dad,\u201d Moffat\u2019s Eric Trump told De Niro. \u201cNo, getting elected president was the worst thing to happen to your dad,\u201d he countered.

Timberlake, whose tour accompanies his folksy fifth studio album, \u201cMan of the Woods,\u201d first canceled his Madison Square Garden show in New York in late October and had since postponed a slew of dates.

He\u2019s also been rescheduled to play the Honda Center in Anaheim on Feb. 22.

Misty, the stage name of Josh Tillman, is teaming up with Los Angeles-based concert promoter Goldenvoice and has scrolled through his contacts for a coterie of special guests, including Haim, Mac DeMarco, Lucius, Tim Heidecker, Rostam, Jonathan Wilson, Rivers Cuomo and Weyes Blood, among others. Set for Dec. 18 at the Theatre at Ace Hotel in L.A., the night promises to be an intimate affair: an all-acoustic session of songs from some of the area\u2019s most accomplished songwriters, with a Steinway & Sons-donated piano to add some class. The benefit is the latest to raise money for those affected by the devastating fires. Over the weekend, Katy Perry, Gwen Stefani and Robin Thicke raised a reported $1 million as part of the One Love Malibu Benefit Concert. Last week, garage rocker Ty Segall and friends took over Zebulon in Frogtown to make money for those in need. Proceeds from Tillman & Co.\u2019s event will go to the Southern California Disaster Relief Fund, created by the United Way of Greater Los Angeles in partnership with United Way of Ventura County. In a statement Thursday morning, organizers explained that \u201cthe fund is directed at low-income families whose lives and livelihoods are affected by the current wildfires in Southern California.\u201d Specifically, the fund focuses on longer-term support to help individuals and families in need to rebuild their lives. Bonus opportunity: Fans will be able to bid on front-row tickets to the concert through CharityBuzz. The high-bidder will also get a commemorative poster signed by participating artists and a room at the Ace Hotel. Tickets for the all-ages concert range from $59.50-$199.50 and go on sale Friday at 10 a.m. Pacific.

(Marcus Yam / Los Angeles Times, left; Evan Agostini / Invision/Associated Press, right)) Oscar winner Natalie Portman hears you, Jessica Simpson, and agrees that women should dress and behave however they like without judgment. That\u2019s a different tune than the one Portman appeared to sing in a USA Today profile published on Tuesday \u2014 one that prompted a lengthy statement from Simpson calling out Portman for shaming her, particularly amid the Time\u2019s Up era that Portman helped usher in. Portman plays a pop star in the upcoming film \u201cVox Lux,\u201d which explores the underbelly of the music industry, and in discussing the topic, she lauded Madonna but appeared to throw shade at Simpson and the industry that touted \u201cthe virgin/vixen paradigms\u201d around the millennium. \u201cI remember being a teenager, and there was Jessica Simpson on the cover of a magazine saying \u2018I\u2019m a virgin\u2019 while wearing a bikini, and I was confused. Like, I don\u2019t know what this is trying to tell me as a woman, as a girl,\u201d Portman, 37, told the publication. Simpson. 38, read those words Wednesday morning and, in a missive posted on Instagram and Twitter, said she was \u201cdisappointed,\u201d but did not indicate what magazine cover Portman was referring to. \u201cAs public figures, we both know our image is not totally in our control at all times, and that the industry we work in often tries to define us and box us in,\u201d the fashion designer wrote. \u201cHowever, I was taught to be myself and honor the different ways all women express themselves, which is why I believed then \u2014 and I believe now \u2014 that being sexy in a bikini and being proud of my body are not synonymous with having sex,\u201d Simpson added. Simpson, who made no secret of losing her virginity after she wed 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey in 2002, had said that she\u2019s always embraced being a role model to women by letting them know they can look and wear whatever they want and choose to have or not have sex whenever they want. \u201cThe power lies within us as individuals,\u201d Simpson wrote. Addressing Simpson directly (and publicly) in the comments section of the post, Portman thanked her and said she she completely agrees with her. \u201cI only meant to say I was confused \u2014 as a girl coming of age in the public eye around the same time \u2014 by the media\u2019s mixed messages about how girls and women were supposed to behave,\u201d Portman wrote. The actress said she didn\u2019t mean to shame Simpson and is sorry for any hurt her words might have caused. \u201cI have nothing but respect for your talent and your voice that you use to encourage and empower women all over the globe,\u201d Portman said.

(Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times) Stepping into what is often considered one of the most difficult \u2013 and at times thankless \u2014 gigs in Hollywood, Kevin Hart is set to host the 91st Academy Awards. The stand-up comedian and actor made the announcement himself Tuesday on Instagram, promising, \u201cI will be sure to make this years Oscars a special one.\u201d \u201cFor years I have been asked if I would ever Host the Oscars and my answer was always the same,\u201d Hart wrote. \u201cI said that it would be the opportunity of a lifetime for me as a comedian and that it will happen when it\u2019s suppose to.\u201d In tapping Hart, who has starred in box-office hits like \u201cJumanji: Welcome to the Jungle\u201d and \u201cCentral Intelligence\u201d and who boasts a massive social media following and large base of young fans, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences is hoping to stem a steady decline in ratings for the telecast. In each of the past two years, under host Jimmy Kimmel, the ratings dipped, with March\u2019s show reaching a record-low audience of 26.5 million viewers. Facing perennial criticism over what many have decried as the sometimes tedious length of the Oscars, the academy has vowed that this coming year\u2019s show, which is being produced by Donna Gigliotti and Glenn Weiss, will not run over three hours. To trim the proceedings down, some awards will be given out during commercial breaks rather than live on air. In an ultimately fizzled gambit to bring in a wider audience for the all-important telecast, the academy earlier this year announced the creation of a new award recognizing \u201coutstanding achievement in popular film.\u201d But after weeks of blowback, the academy\u2019s board of governors reversed itself and decided to shelve the idea, at least for the time being. Hart has previously served as emcee of the \u201cMTV Movie Awards\u201d along with his \u201cCentral Intelligence\u201d co-star Dwayne Johnson. The Oscars will air on ABC on Sunday, Feb. 24.

Wait, what? Yes, exactly what you just read. Online trolls can\u2019t bully him to death, he says. And he wonders why they\u2019re getting away with such abusive behavior. \u201cI\u2019ve been getting online bullied and in public by people for 9 months. I\u2019ve spoken about BPD and being suicidal publicly only in the hopes that it will help bring awareness and help kids like myself who don\u2019t want to be on this earth,\u201d the \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor said bluntly Monday on Instagram. \u201cI just want you guys to know. No matter how hard the internet or anyone tries to make me kill myself. I won\u2019t.\u201d The \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d actor, who has been diagnosed with borderline personality disorder, was presumably referring to his break from pop star Ariana Grande. The two met in March and became an item toward the end of May, got engaged just weeks into the relationship and then split up in October. She has got around 137 million Instagram followers, some of whom have apparently been talking to \u2014 or at \u2014 Davidson online. He has no verified Twitter or Facebook accounts. He said he has kept his mouth shut about the online bullying to this point and hasn\u2019t mentioned any names \u2014 nor does he drop any names in the post. \u201cI\u2019m trying to understand how when something happens to a guy the whole entire world just trashes him without any facts or frame of reference,\u201d Davidson wrote. \u201cEspecially in today\u2019s climate where everyone loves to be offended and upset it truly is mind boggling.\u201d Pete Davidson just posted a touching note about mental health to his Instagram pic.twitter.com/nAudS7NdmU \u2014 Alexis Benveniste (@apbenven) December 3, 2018 Davidson\u2019s missive comes on the heels of the new video for Grande\u2019s hit song \u201cthank u, next,\u201d whose title echoes a Twitter comment involving the actor. The singer put Davidson\u2019s statement and a comment of her own on her Instagram story around midnight, urging her many fans to change their behavior. \u201c[I] really don\u2019t endorse anything but forgiveness and positivity. i care deeply about pete and his health. i\u2019m asking you to please be gentler with others, even on the internet,\u201d Grande said, in part. Later in the statement, she got a bit more specific. \u201c[P]lease let whatever point you\u2019re trying to make go. I will always have irrevocable love for him and if you\u2019ve gotten any other impression from my recent work, you might have missed the point,\u201d she said. Here\u2019s Grande\u2019s statement in full: \u201ci know u already know this but i feel i need to remind my fans to please be gentler with others. i really don\u2019t endorse anything but forgiveness and positivity. i care deeply about pete and his health. i\u2019m asking you to please be gentler with others, even on the internet. i\u2019ve learned thru my own mistakes not to be reactive on socials so i do understand. but you truly don\u2019t know what anybody is experiencing ever. regardless of what they choose to display on social media or how they may appear in public. i can promise u that. so please let whatever point you\u2019re trying to make go. I will always have irrevocable love for him and if you\u2019ve gotten any other impression from my recent work, you might have missed the point.\u201d Borderline personality disorder is \u201cmarked by an ongoing pattern of varying moods, self-image and behavior,\u201d according to the National Institute of Mental Health website. Symptoms can often result in impulsive actions and relationship problems, with people experiencing intense episodes of anger, depression and anxiety that last for hours or days. People with BPD tend to experience things as all good or all bad, and according to the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration, the risk of self-harming behavior or suicide is an extreme risk.

(Wally Skalij / Los Angeles Times ) Liquid adrenaline manufacturer Red Bull has announced the lineup for the 2019 Red Bull Music Festival Los Angeles, which will focus nearly as much on sight as on sound. Most notably, the multi-event program will feature the first live performance of music from the blockbuster action-adventure game \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2.\u201d It will be the centerpiece of a festival that aims to explore how music intersects with gaming, film and photography. Attendees will experience live \u201cRed Dead Redemption 2\u201d performances by composer Woody Jackson, Indonesian duo Senyawa and others featured in the game in what\u2019s billed as a reimagining of the score \u201cas a unique auditory installation.\u201d The festival, happening at various locations across multiple February dates, will also present the first U.S. stops on Swedish pop powerhouse Robyn\u2019s upcoming North American tour. Hitting the States to promote her new album, \u201cHoney,\u201d Robyn will perform her first Los Angeles shows in eight years on Feb. 22 and 23 at the Hollywood Palladium. The festival\u2019s Feb. 7 opening event will aim a much-deserved spotlight on the performer San Cha. She\u2019ll be introducing a new original piece, according the notes, \u201cbased around the telenovela programs of her childhood,\u201d and will feature artists from a range of L.A.\u2019s creative disciplines.

The second trailer for the Marvel Studios film debuted Monday night, and it sends a clear message that Carol Danvers, a.k.a. Captain Marvel, is the hero everyone has been waiting for. At least according to Disney. While the first trailer hinted that Carol (played by Brie Larson) is trying to piece together what seems to be her forgotten past on Earth, this new promo provides more information about who she has become. Carol explains to Nick Fury (Samuel L. Jackson) that she is Kree, an alien race of \u201cnoble warrior heroes.\u201d But then the trailer immediately reveals that wasn\u2019t always the case. It turns out that after somehow stumbling upon an injured and memory-less Carol, the Kree turned her into one of them. This gave her enhanced strength, a prolonged lifespan and various other superpowers. And these powers appear to be no joke. The trailer shows Captain Marvel handle everything from hand-to-hand combat against what appears to be an elderly woman (but is likely an enemy in disguise) to flying around in space while taking out spaceships with energy blasts she shoots from her hands. Looks like there is definitely hope for the remaining Avengers to save the universe following the events of \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d after all. \u201cCaptain Marvel\u201d is scheduled to hit theaters March 8, 2019.

(Timothy A. Clary / AFP/Getty Images) Halsey, who performed at the 2018 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show that aired Sunday night on ABC, posted a lengthy note on social media at the same time regarding the show\u2019s perceived lack of trans inclusivity. \u201cI have adored the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show since I was young. Performing this year alongside other amazing artists, and hardworking models/friends was supposed to be the best night of my year. However, after I filmed the performance some comments were made regarding the show that I simply cannot ignore,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAs a member of the LGBTQ+ community, I have no tolerance for a lack of inclusivity. Especially not one motivated by stereotype,\u201d continued the 24-year-old singer, who is out as bisexual. She then directed followers to the GLSEN website and said she had made a big donation to the organization, which champions LGBTQ issues in K-12 education. The show featured 49 female models of various races and skin colors from at least 14 countries and six continents. However, a comment from a Victoria\u2019s Secret executive in a Nov. 8 Vogue article \u2014 which ran the same day the show was taped \u2014 upset some transgender people and their allies, and appears to have sparked Halsey\u2019s post. There was also discussion in the article about the absence of plus-size models on the VS catwalk. \u201cIt\u2019s like, why doesn\u2019t your show do this? Shouldn\u2019t you have transsexuals in the show? No. No, I don\u2019t think we should,\u201d Ed Razek, chief marketing officer for Victoria\u2019s Secret owner, L Brands, told the magazine. \u201cWell, why not? Because the show is a fantasy. It\u2019s a 42-minute entertainment special. That\u2019s what it is. It is the only one of its kind in the world, and any other fashion brand in the world would take it in a minute, including the competitors that are carping at us. And they carp at us because we\u2019re the leader.\u201d \ud83d\udc95\ud83e\udd8b\ud83d\udc95 @GLSEN - https://t.co/XdQMPro0KC pic.twitter.com/agOzSYREkX \u2014 h (@halsey) December 3, 2018 Victoria\u2019s Secret did not respond immediately to a request for comment. The quote was in the context of a larger discussion about criticism of the show on social media, which had ramped up ahead of the show. Halsey, for one, wasn\u2019t having it. \u201cIf you are a trans person reading this, and these comments have made you feel alienated or invalidated please know that you have allies. We stand in solidarity, and complete and total acceptance is the only \u2018fantasy\u2019 that I support,\u201d she said in her Sunday post. Also performing at the fashion show were Shawn Mendes, Rita Ora, the Chainsmokers, Bebe Rexha, Leela James, Kelsea Ballerini, and the Struts, most of whom posted generic social-media reminders to watch the show. None of them talked about trans exclusion. Rexha, however, had a bit more to say, and added a video of her performance Monday on Twitter so followers could see it \u2014 in some cases, again. \u201cIt has always been a big dream of mine to perform at @victoriassecret Fashion Show and it\u2019s finally happening tomorrow!!

(Greg Allen / Associated Press) The Kennedy Center Honors, which once again were not attended by President Trump, included tributes Sunday night to the late former President George H.W. Bush, who died Friday at age 94. \u201cI think it\u2019s appropriate to recognize the passing of a wonderful man who dedicated his life to service and who graciously attended this event many times during his administration, laughing, applauding, singing along and even shedding a tear from right up there in the presidential box,\u201d host Gloria Estefan said to kick off the evening at the John F. Kennedy Center in Washington. She recalled being invited to the White House and how Bush \u201cliterally spent 45 minutes patiently talking to my 8-year-old son\u201d about how government worked. Estefan was recognized last year; this year, the lifetime artistic-achievement honors went to jazz great Wayne Shorter, pop diva Cher, country star Reba McEntire and composer Philip Glass, with a unique award of distinction going to the team behind \u201cHamilton\u201d: Andrew Blankenbuehler, Thomas Kail, Alex Lacamoire and star Lin-Manuel Miranda. Their names, like the other nominees\u2019, were first announced this summer. \u201cIn recognizing \u2018Hamilton\u2019 and its co-creators,\u201d Kennedy Center President Deborah F. Rutter said in a statement at the time, \u201cthe Kennedy Center is making an unprecedented statement about an unprecedented work \u2014 a work that transcends cultural boundaries and tells America\u2019s story in a powerful and contemporary way.\u201d On Sunday, comic Whoopi Goldberg introduced Cher and friend Cyndi Lauper sang \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time.\u201d Kelly Clarkson paid tribute to McEntire with a version of \u201cFancy,\u201d the Bobbie Gentry song McEntire turned into a hit in 1990. Jason Moran, the Kennedy Center\u2019s artistic director for jazz, said Shorter\u2019s sound over a six-decade career \u201cholds a special place in the galaxy,\u201d adding that he could safely say that \u201csomewhere in the galaxy right now, a band is playing one of his pieces.\u201d And previous award winner Paul Simon did the honors for Glass, whom he praised for \u201cnever settling into one particular style, always developing and exploring.\u201d Trump and First Lady Melania Trump, who also missed last year\u2019s event after several honorees threatened a boycott, returned in the wee hours Sunday from the G-20 summit in Buenos Aires. Though Bush attended most years and continued to do so after his presidency, he \u2014 like other heads of state, including Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton \u2014 missed a year due to major events. Trump is the first president to decline an invitation twice. You can watch the Kennedy Center Honors when they are broadcast on CBS on Dec. 26. The Associated Press contributed to this report.

The Russia investigation received another callback at the end of the episode with McKinnon and Strong joined by Aidy Bryant, Leslie Jones, Melissa Villase\u00f1or, Heidi Gardner, and newest cast member Ego Nwodim for a performance of \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d dedicated to Robert Mueller in the hopes of an indictment for the president.

Cyrus, in collaboration with British DJ and producer Mark Ronson, released \u201cNothing Breaks Like a Heart\u201d on Thursday, the first single from Ronson\u2019s upcoming album, his first solo effort since 2015. It\u2019s the first new music from Cyrus in more than a year. Cyrus brings her huskiest growl to the tale of love gone wrong, singing, \u201cThis world can hurt you, it cuts you deep and leaves a scar / Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart.\u201d The accompanying video features Cyrus in a low-speed chase with a bevy of cop cars, smashing through walls as if she were a wrecking ball \u2013 or the Kool-Aid Man. In the world outside, cultural references play out in disconnected fashion, as football players kneel and children visit a gun range, all while Cyrus looks on. Also, she goes to a strip club, so watch the video at your own risk. However, the video does end with a stunning sequence of a car wreck that features Cyrus still inside the vehicle singing, as gold and glass float through the air around her, in what appears to be an obvious homage to Julie Taymor\u2019s gold dust bus crash in 2002\u2019s \u201cFrida.\u201d The video is worth watching for those stylish seconds alone.

By Christie D\u2019Zurilla Quentin Tarantino and Daniella Pick in 2016. (Jean-Philippe Ksiazek / AFP/Getty Images) Once upon a time in Hollywood, Quentin Tarantino married Daniella Pick, the Israeli singer-model he\u2019s been engaged to since last year. The two tied the knot in Los Angeles in an \u201cintimate\u201d ceremony, People reported exclusively Wednesday, ahead of a larger gathering that was planned for that night. Tarantino, 55, and Pick, 35, met in 2009 when he visited Israel to promote \u201cInglourious Basterds,\u201d but they had been dating steadily only for about a year when he popped the question in summer 2017. They\u2019d been on and off before that. It\u2019s a first marriage for the director, who explained his take on marriage to GQ in 2009. \u201cWhen I\u2019m doing a movie, I\u2019m not doing anything else. It\u2019s all about the movie,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t have a wife. I don\u2019t have a kid. Nothing can get in my way. \u2026 I\u2019m not saying that I\u2019ll never get married or have a kid before I\u2019m 60. But I\u2019ve made a choice, so far, to go on this road alone. Because this is my time. This is my time to make movies.\u201d Tarantino said at a conference in 2016 that he was going to retire after he had directed 10 movies. His \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Hollywood\u201d is in post-production now, while an untitled \u201cStar Trek\u201d project looms. That latter one would be his 10th full-length effort. Just Married!

She said she started the petition as a way to honor Hillenburg and also to drive awareness of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, a degenerative neurological condition also known as Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease. The petition had closed in on its 3,000-signature goal by early Wednesday afternoon. Stephen Hillenburg at the world premiere of \u201cThe SpongeBob Movie: Sponge Out of Water\u201d in 2015.

There have been two \u201cSpongeBob\u201d movies, with one more on tap for 2020. Hillenburg went public with his ALS diagnosis in March 2017.

(Rene Macura / Associated Press) Bobby Brown and the estate of Bobbi Kristina Brown are suing Showtime and other distributors of the unauthorized 2017 biopic \u201cWhitney: Can I Be Me,\u201d alleging the defendants used more than half an hour of old footage of both Browns, plus his other children, without permission. The suit, which seeks at least $2 million in damages, was filed Wednesday in U.S. District Court in the Southern District of New York, where defendants Showtime, the BBC and Passion Pictures all have offices. The named defendants \u2014 which also include Tracey Baker-Simmons, Wanda Shelley, B2 Entertainment and Simmons Shelley Entertainment, based in Atlanta \u2014 are accused of distributing footage including some shot for the 2005 reality show \u201cBeing Bobby Brown,\u201d thereby violating the Browns\u2019 privacy rights in pursuit of financial gain. Though Brown was contacted by the filmmakers, the suit says, to be interviewed for \u201cCan I Be Me,\u201d he declined. A mention in the film\u2019s credits suggests Brown\u2019s production company OK\u2019d the use of the \u201cBeing Bobby Brown\u201d footage, including footage of Bobbi Kristina Brown, but the complaint says no such permission was given. \u201cThe footage was actually recorded prior to the divorce in 2007 between Brown and Houston. Brown never signed or executed a release for the material that appears in the film,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cThe footage of Brown is approximately fifteen (15) years old.\u201d The Los Angeles Times\u2019 review of \u201cCan I Be Me\u201d noted that some voices were absent from the film, which was co-directed by Nick Broomfield and Rudi Dolezal. (Neither director is named as a defendant in the lawsuit.) \u201cBroomfield, for his part, was hampered by the fact that he was not able to interview key people in Houston\u2019s life, including ex-husband Bobby Brown, her closest friend Robyn Crawford, and Clive Davis, the Svengali who began her career,\u201d Times critic Kenneth Turan wrote. Showtime and the BBC declined to comment on Wednesday. And an email sent to Tracey Baker-Simmons was not immediately returned. Bobbi Kristina Brown died in July 2015 from undetermined causes.

(Patrick T. Fallon / Los Angeles Times) In the surest sign yet that we are living in the age of reboots, revivals and sequels, Margaret Atwood announced Wednesday that a sequel to \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d her prescient 1985 novel, is in the works. Titled \u201cThe Testaments,\u201d the new novel is set 15 years after the protagonist\u2019s final scene in \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and is narrated by three female characters. Atwood revealed the news in a tweet Wednesday morning and said the book is set to be published next year. \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d and its dystopian tale of life in Gilead, a patriarchal society overseen by fundamentalist zealots with a singular obsession with women\u2019s reproductive rights has seen renewed cultural significance in recent days. The book\u2019s continued relevance is thanks in part to the high-profile Hulu adaptation, along with plenty of other contributing factors. \u201cDear Readers: Everything you\u2019ve ever asked me about Gilead and its inner workings is the inspiration for this book. Well, almost everything!\u201d Atwood wrote in her tweet. \u201cThe other inspiration is the world we\u2019ve been living in.\u201d Yes indeed to those who asked: I\u2019m writing a sequel to The #HandmaidsTale. #TheTestaments is set 15 years after Offred\u2019s final scene and is narrated by three female characters. It will be published in Sept 2019. More details: https://t.co/e1umh5FwpX pic.twitter.com/pePp0zpuif \u2014 Margaret E.

This new book is no exception.\u201d Beyond the timeline and the narrators, little else has been revealed about the sequel. The book is not, however, in any way connected to Hulu\u2019s current adaptation. \u201cThe Testaments\u201d is scheduled for release on Sept. 10, 2019, by Nan A.

(Neilson Barnard / Getty Images) Former child star turned cautionary tale Amanda Bynes has resurfaced on the cover of Paper magazine looking happy, healthy and ready for a comeback. Bynes broke through on Nickelodeon\u2019s sketch comedy show \u201cAll That\u201d before scoring a series of her own at age 13 with \u201cThe Amanda Show.\u201d Her star continued to rise through the early 2000s with movie roles aplenty, including \u201cWhat a Girl Wants,\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s the Man\u201d and \u201cHairspray.\u201d But eventually, Bynes said in a new sit-down interview with Paper, self-image issues fueled her burgeoning drug habit and led to her abandoning acting altogether. The actress recounted a moment on the set of \u201cHall Pass,\u201d when, after seeing herself on a monitor, \u201cliterally tripping out and thinking my arm looked so fat because it was in the foreground or whatever and I remember rushing off set and thinking, \u2018Oh, my god, I look so bad.\u2019\u201d According to Bynes, it was a combination of image issues and Adderall abuse that resulted in her eventually leaving \u201cHall Pass.\u201d Shortly thereafter, she found herself in a similar situation while watching her performance in \u201cEasy A.\u201d Amanda Bynes on the cover of Paper magazine\u2019s \u201cBreak the Internet\u201d issue.

I can\u2019t turn back time, but if I could, I would,\u201d Bynes said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m so sorry to whoever I hurt and whoever I lied about because it truly eats away at me. It makes me feel so horrible and sick to my stomach and sad. \u201cEverything I worked my whole life to achieve, I kind of ruined it all through Twitter,\u201d she said. In the interview, Bynes also discusses her four years of sobriety and educational pursuit at Los Angeles\u2019 Fashion Institute of Design & Merchandising, as well as her potential return to acting.

More like one door closing and another one opening. So it is with Bruce Springsteen, who\u2019s bringing \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d to small screens the day after his autobiographical show closes following more than a year at New York City\u2019s Walter Kerr Theatre. \u201cThis is what I\u2019ve presented to you all these years as my long and noisy prayer, as my magic trick,\u201d Springsteen says to kick off the trailer released by Netflix on Tuesday, not quite three weeks ahead of the special\u2019s debut on the streaming service. Think of it as a two-hour reward for resisting the urge to spend hundreds or even thousands of dollars on a ticket to the gig, which opened in October 2017. Heavy on serious theatricality, the trailer offers a low-key taste of the nearly solo show \u2014 staged in a theater that seats fewer than a thousand \u2014 which on most nights has included Springsteen\u2019s wife, Patti Scialfa, on a couple of songs. It\u2019s a hybrid, but clearly not a Bruce concert. Far from it. Unlike his raucous arena shows, there are no massive singalongs by the crowd. It doesn\u2019t stretch to 3\u00bd or four hours, though it\u2019s apparently grown longer with time. \u201cIt\u2019s a coming-of-age story, and I want to show how this \u2014 one\u2019s coming of age \u2014 has to be earned,\u201d Springsteen told Esquire magazine this month. \u201cIt\u2019s not given to anyone. It takes a certain single-minded purpose. It takes self-awareness, a desire to go there. \u201cAnd a willingness to confront all the very fearsome and dangerous elements of your life \u2014 your past, your history \u2014 that you need to confront to become as much of a free agent as you can. This is what the show is about.\u201d \u201cSpringsteen on Broadway\u201d premieres Dec. 16 on Netflix.
