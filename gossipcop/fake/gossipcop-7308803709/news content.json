Over the long Thanksgiving weekend, he spent some seriously adorable father-son time with his and ex Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s eldest child, Mason, 7, taking him to NYC to visit the Intrepid Sea, Air & Space Museum before hopping a private jet bound for Miami, where they took a helicopter ride and hit the beach. Scott\u2019s also often been on daddy-daughter dates with Penelope, 5.\n\nBut he\u2019s rarely seen out with his youngest child, son Reign. \u201cThis sounds horrible to say, but Scott is closest to Mason and then Penelope,\u201d an insider exclusively tells In Touch, adding that though Scott, 34, has a bond with Reign, who turns three on Dec. 14, \u201cit\u2019s not the same as the one he had with Mason when he was that young.\u201d\n\nNow a source has some bombshell insight into why that might be. \u201cReign was conceived when Kourtney and Scott were going through a rough patch. At the time, Scott didn\u2019t question whether he was the father, but that soon changed,\u201d explains the source. \u201cIt didn\u2019t take long for Scott to start having doubts as to whether Reign is actually his child.\u201d\n\nScott\u2019s fears were stoked any time people commented on his kids\u2019 looks. \u201cWhat really got under Scott\u2019s skin is when family members said that Reign didn\u2019t look like him,\u201d says the insider. \u201cPenelope and Mason are dead ringers for Scott, but Reign looks more like Kourtney.\u201d\n\nAnd her volatile relationship with Scott is legendary. \u201cThere were countless times when they\u2019d split up and not see each other for weeks. And whenever they had a huge argument,\u201d says the source, Kourtney, 38, \u201cwent out of her way to seek revenge. She\u2019d often party with her pals and close guy friends.\u201d (They finally broke up for good in 2015, when Reign was about six months old. At the time, a Lord Disick insider told In Touch Scott hadn\u2019t spent time with Reign \u201cfor months.\u201d)\n\nScott \u2014 who is in a relationship with Sofia Richie, the 19-year-old sister of Kardashian family friend Nicole Richie \u2014 eventually questioned Kourtney about Reign\u2019s parentage. \u201cShe outright denied [that Reign could be someone else\u2019s],\u201d says the source. \u201cDuring the heated bust-up, Scott brought up doing a DNA test. Kourtney said no, which has only heightened his suspicions.\u201d\n\nAnother insider also says that Kourtney, who is currently dating 24-year-old model Younes Bendjima, isn\u2019t interested in debating with Scott: \u201cKourtney didn\u2019t want to hear it when Scott asked if he\u2019s really the father.\u201d\n\nFor more on this story, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-05-at-5-07-58-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-05-at-5-07-58-pm.png?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-05-at-5-07-58-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/scott-disick-reign-not-his-child-148339/", "title": "Scott Disick Worries That His Son Reign Is Not His Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Secret struggle.
