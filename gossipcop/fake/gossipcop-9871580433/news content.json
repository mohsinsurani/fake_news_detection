Photo: Getty Images\n\nSince Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux officially split last month, friends of Theroux have been telling the tabloids how happy Theroux is to be back to his \u201cedgy\u201d New York lifestyle. He\u2019s been spending time with the \u201cedgy\u201d art crowd, which includes photographer Petra Collins. And now, he\u2019s apparently hanging out with Aubrey Plaza. Is Plaza edgy? She must be.\n\nThe Daily Mail published several photos of Theroux and Plaza together this morning. The two were spotted walking around downtown on Sunday and going into Theroux\u2019s West Village apartment. Plaza, 33, was wearing a Barbour jacket with a \u201cMarch for Our Lives\u201d sticker on the back, and Theroux, 46, was wearing a black Supreme hoodie with the words \u201cillegal business controls America\u201d on the back. He also had a Supreme sticker on his bike. You can see all of that here.\n\nThe Daily Mail points out that Theroux and Plaza have known each other for some time; Theroux appeared on an episode of Plaza\u2019s show Parks and Recreation in 2012. But this is the first time they\u2019ve ever been photographed together. What message do you think Theroux is trying to send here?
