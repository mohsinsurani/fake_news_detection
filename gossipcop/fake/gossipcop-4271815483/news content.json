Time\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West are now the parents of a third baby, a girl, Kardashian announced on Twitter Tuesday.\n\n\"She's here!\" Kardashian declared in extra-large type on her Twitter account. \"We're so in love,\" she added.\n\nHer tweet included a statement saying the baby was born via a surrogate on Monday at 12:47 a.m. and weighed 7 pounds, 6 ounces. She did not say where the baby was born, nor what she has been named.\n\n\"Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,\" the statement said. \"We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care.\"\n\nShe said the couple's two other children, North, 4, and Saint, 2, are \"thrilled to welcome their baby sister.\"\n\nKardashian and West hired a surrogate because Kardashian's doctors strongly advised her not to go through a third pregnancy, as she discussed on her show, Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nShe suffered from placenta accreta, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes childbirth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.\n\nBut she wanted a third baby and her desire grew stronger in the wake of her traumatic experience as the victim of an armed robbery in Paris in October 2016.\n\n\"I've come to the conclusion that I can't carry another one,\" Kardashian told her mother, Kris Jenner, on the show. \"So now I want to explore surrogacy.\"\n\nKardashian's representative confirmed the birth but didn't offer any more details.", "images": ["http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/17667f8f3f8e527c661d1d7cf4b946be7179fbf9/c=0-73-4034-2352&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2018/01/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636517029616311563-AP-People-Kim-Kardashian-West-Baby.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5c672c742951384cb68ec82f94919384c86dde67/c=0-73-4034-2352/local/-/media/2018/01/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636517029616311563-AP-People-Kim-Kardashian-West-Baby.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5c672c742951384cb68ec82f94919384c86dde67/c=0-73-4034-2352/local/-/media/2018/01/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636517029616311563-AP-People-Kim-Kardashian-West-Baby.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Puente"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/01/16/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-new-baby-girl-here-born-via-surrogate/1036527001/", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's new baby girl is here, born via surrogate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2018/01/16/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-wests-new-baby-girl-here-born-via-surrogate/1036527001/life", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West's new baby girl is here, born via surrogate", "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West announce their third baby, a girl, has arrived via surrogate.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5c672c742951384cb68ec82f94919384c86dde67/c=0-73-4034-2352/local/-/media/2018/01/16/USATODAY/USATODAY/636517029616311563-AP-People-Kim-Kardashian-West-Baby.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West announce their third baby, a girl, has arrived via surrogate.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516060800.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
