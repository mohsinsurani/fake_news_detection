More info\n\nIt may not sound as if we\u2019re heading out on a wild South African adventure but this is how our safari begins. We\u2019re wrapped up all warm and cosy in a Land Cruiser while our guide, wearing nothing more than shorts and a T-shirt, turns and asks what we want to see. Lets go find some cats, we say. As the sun rises we bound off into Kruger National Park on a jeep convoy.\n\nThousands of animals roam this vast space, an area roughly the size of Scotland. While the park is home to 147 species, the main draw is the Big Five \u2013 that\u2019s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo. Picking our way through the bush it\u2019s difficult to spot anything. There are rustles and strange sounds in the long grass but I can\u2019t see any animals. The tracker perched on the bonnet with his rifle is much better at it. Despite (and very probably because of) being at risk of predators, he seems to notice the smallest of movements in the distance \u2013 he\u2019s an expert at finding exotic shapes, everything from hippos and lone giraffes to zebras.\n\nEvery now and again we stop to look at footprints and even fresh poop.\n\nThe main draw is the Big Five \u2013 that\u2019s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo\n\nIt looks like elephants passed through overnight. The rangers can read what direction they took and even how long ago. Soon enough, we gasp and nudge each other as he sights a leopard through the trees. It\u2019s hunting something that we can\u2019t make out. Impressed to find it stalking prey, we sit watching in silence. We see another safari vehicle and they report there are elephants near the river so we decide to leave our hungry feline to hunt alone.\n\nNATALIE CHALK Nathalie Chalk on safari\n\nThe ground is dry and cracked due to a two-year drought, which has left parts of the park looking scorched with dead trees and uprooted branches. It\u2019s hard to see how anything could thrive in this landscape. Yet as we approach the river, it\u2019s like we enter a different country. There are lush mahogany and marula fruit trees \u2013 a favourite snack of the park\u2019s vast herds of elephants. And this is where we find once such group.\n\nGETTY The main draw is the Big Five \u2013 that\u2019s lion, leopard, elephant, rhino and buffalo\n\nOn the banks are 30 elephants, including babies, close to their mothers, young bulls jumping on each other and adult males spraying water. It\u2019s like being backstage on a David Attenborough documentary \u2013 peeking into their secret lives off-camera. As our guide talks quietly about how an elephant\u2019s ear resembles the shape of Africa, they begin to stroll our way. The herd is making its way to the road and coming straight towards the vehicle. It\u2019s an uncomfortable mixture of excitement and terror. As we look at them, they stare back. Some of us get nervous. We hold our breath, grit our teeth and fall silent as they get closer. I am about to be nuzzled by the largest land animal on Earth.", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/133/590x/south-africa-safari-elephant-736598.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/133/750x445/736598.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/133/750x445/736598.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Natalie Chalk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/travel/activity/736598/south-africa-safari-travel-adventure-big-five-prince-harry", "title": "Going wild in South Africa", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "WE leave at 6.30am without breakfast, clutching only hot water bottles and blankets.", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 823607694325129, "pages": 129617873765147}, "og": {"title": "Going wild in South Africa", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/travel/activity/736598/south-africa-safari-travel-adventure-big-five-prince-harry", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/133/750x445/736598.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "ctp_video,safari,South africa,south africa safari,big five,lion,leopard,elephant,rhino,buffalo,adventure,south african adventure,lodge,prince harry,UploadExpress", "section": "Activity Holidays", "description": "WE leave at 6.30am without breakfast, clutching only hot water bottles and blankets."}, "news_keywords": "ctp_video,safari,South africa,south africa safari,big five,lion,leopard,elephant,rhino,buffalo,adventure,south african adventure,lodge,prince harry,UploadExpress", "article": {"tag": "UploadExpress", "published_time": "2016-11-26T00:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-11-25T17:46:47+00:00", "expiration_time": "2016-12-25", "section": "Activity Holidays", "image_count": 6, "video_count": 2, "word_count": 1196, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0, "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "Natalie Chalk", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/133/750x445/736598.jpg", "title": "Going wild in South Africa", "description": "WE leave at 6.30am without breakfast, clutching only hot water bottles and blankets."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Going wild in South Africa", "vf": {"image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/133/237x141/736598_1.jpg", "container_id": "express-prod-736598", "site_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0ed77b31aaaf"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all", "dataLayer": "{\"page\":{\"attributes\":{\"publicationName\":\"express\",\"ownerSite\":\"express\",\"ownerSiteDomain\":\"www.express.co.uk\",\"platformType\":\"responsive\",\"cmsPlatform\":\"Daily Express CMS\",\"pageType\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"133\"}},\"article\":{\"articleId\":\"736598\",\"articleTitle\":\"Going wild in South Africa\",\"articleAuthor\":\"Natalie Chalk\",\"firstPublishDate\":\"2016-11-26\",\"firstPublishTime\":\"00:01:00\",\"attributes\":{\"primaryTag\":\"South Africa\",\"allTags\":\"South Africa|safari|south africa|south africa safari|big five|lion|leopard|elephant|rhino|buffalo|adventure|south african adventure|lodge|prince harry|uploadexpress\",\"isAdvertorial\":false,\"isNative\":false,\"affiliateLinks\":false,\"activeLegalProceedings\":false,\"nudity\":false,\"isSensitive\":false}}}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1480118460.0, "source": "http://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
