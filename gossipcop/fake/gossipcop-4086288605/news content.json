She got flirty with Jennifer Aniston\u2019s ex Brad Pitt at a recent event, according to a shocking Jan. 25 report, and we\u2019ve got all the details right here. So has Jen heard? Here\u2019s what\u2019s going on!\n\n\u201cCourtney Cox, 52, behaved like a smitten fan girl around Brad Pitt, 53, [at the Rock4EB charity concert],\u201d an eyewitness at the Jan. 14 event in Malibu, CA, tells Life & Style magazine in their Feb. 6 issue. Yikes! \u201cShe kept telling him how great he looked and flirted with him like crazy,\u201d the source adds of Courteney, who hosted the big shindig. Well, Brad did look exceptionally good that evening, but still!\n\nHere\u2019s where it gets interesting: Brad might just have a little crush on the Cougar Town actress, too! \u201cSparks were flying big time,\u201d another source tells Australian magazine New Idea of their interaction at the event. \u201cThere\u2019s so much history and affection between those two,\u201d the insider explains. \u201cBrad and Courteney have come full circle.
