Whenever Jenner and West get together, the political talk has only made the troubled rapper more determined about his forthcoming run to win the presidential election in 2020.\n\n\"Caitlyn Jenner is just the latest reality TV star with political ambitions. But according to an insider, it's not Jenner herself who will be campaigning for office. Instead, a source told Radar, she's got her sights set on helping Kanye West make America great again,\" the outlet notes.\n\n\"Jenner shocked the world when she attended President Donald Trump's inauguration in Washington DC last week, with not a single family member by her side. West has spoken out in support of the President and even met with him in DC. Jenner now sees him as her ticket into the world of politics.\"\n\nNobody in the Kardashian household supported Caitlyn's move to attend Trump's inauguration, last week, The Hollywood Gossip alleges.\n\nThings have been very rocky between the Kardashians and Caitlyn, so much that the only person that the reality star still has a close relationship with is Kanye West.\n\nIt's further stressed that Kim isn't happy about Jenner's influence on her husband of two years. The 36-year-old doesn't like the supposed fact that Caitlyn is so determined into getting Kanye thinking he will become the next president of the United States.\n\nWhile Kim is aware that West has wanted to give his presidential campaign a try, Kanye has refrained himself from talking about it until Caitlyn Jenner started bringing it up again \u2014 to the point where the \"Stronger\" superstar is constantly talking about politics and his plans to win the election in 2020.\n\n\"Caitlyn and Kanye have bonded a lot over President Trump\u2026 Of course, Kim does not want Kanye to run for President! She does not want the humiliation of him ever running for any office.\"\n\n[Featured Image by Kevin Winter/Getty Images]", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2146221c3bb32c670d1053a99949feba?s=800", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3927558/caitlyn-jenner-pushing-kanye-west-for-presidency-campaign-amid-kardashian-backlash-over-trump-support/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Pushing Kanye West For Presidency Campaign Amid Kardashian Backlash Over Trump Support", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Pushing Kanye West For Presidency Campaign Amid Kardashian Backlash Over Trump Support", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/3927558/caitlyn-jenner-pushing-kanye-west-for-presidency-campaign-amid-kardashian-backlash-over-trump-support/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner Pushing Kanye West For Presidency Campaign Amid Kardashian Backlash Over Trump Support", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-01-28 02:57:42Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Caitlyn Jenner Pushing Kanye West For Presidency Campaign Amid Kardashian Backlash Over Trump Support", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1485572262.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
