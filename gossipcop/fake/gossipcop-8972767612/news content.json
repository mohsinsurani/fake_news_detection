The New York Times\u2018 Dave Itzkoff highlighted the moment with a video on Twitter, sparking social media to quickly comment on Pharrell\u2019s taken-aback expression.\n\n\u201cI had an error in the night, which I have to apologize for,\u201d said Bush Hager, who was joined by Al Roker and Natalie Morales on the NBC morning show. \u201cWhen I was interviewing the incomparable Pharrell, who I adore, I accidentally \u2014 in the electricity of the red carpet, which I\u2019ve never done one before \u2014 called Hidden Figures \u2018Hidden Fences.\u2019 I have seen both movies, thought they were both brilliant. I\u2019ve interviewed casts for both of the movies, and if I offended people I am deeply sorry.\u201d\n\nLater in the night, Michael Keaton made the same notable error when presenting the best supporting actress award, sparking the term #HiddenFences to trend on Twitter. While some users posted jokes and memes, others such as Gabrielle Union and Justin Simien noted their disappointment about the confusion and comedian-actress Robin Thede said, \u201cAll movies with black people don\u2019t sound alike.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a mistake, because ya\u2019ll know I\u2019m not perfect,\u201d continued Bush Hager, who at this point began to choke up and get teary-eyed. \u201cI am authentic, but a human. And what I didn\u2019t want to do is make anyone lesser than who they are. I apologize to both the cast, to Pharrell, but it was a mistake and I hope we can move on.\u201d\n\nBoth Roker and Morales swooped in to defend Bush Hager, with Roker blasting the \u201cculture of Twitter and waiting to pounce on people\u201d for what he said is a common mistake for live TV broadcasters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve all been in live situations and you make a mistake,\u201d said Roker, adding how he forgot Braveheart when he was interviewing Mel Gibson and referred to Jessica Biel as Jessica Alba during his Sunday interviews. \u201cHonest mistakes happen in live television and this culture of Twitter and waiting to pounce and get on people, it\u2019s got to stop. It\u2019s got to stop somewhere, because it\u2019s pretty ridiculous.\u201d\n\nHe then chided The New York Times.\n\n\u201cFor The New York Times to pile on and repeat these tweets, it\u2019s a cheap shot,\u201d said Roker.\n\nBush Hager conceded that she has thick skin, but \u201cto act as though I don\u2019t care about people really hurt,\u201d prompting Morales to point out the red-carpet chaos.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like a mosh pit,\u201d she said. \u201cYou\u2019re getting celebrities coming at you from all directions. It\u2019s a lot happening at the same time, and I think you had just interviewed the cast of Fences also, I think you were just right there in the moment, so it happens.\u201d\n\nBut Bush Hager wouldn\u2019t cop to the excuse and ended with more of her apology.\n\n\u201cI know how brilliant those films are and I did not want to make anyone feel lesser,\u201d she said.\n\nShortly after the segment aired, Hidden Figures star Octavia Spencer took to Twitter to say she accepted Bush Hager\u2019s apology. \u201cWe all make mistakes, hon! Thanks for your apology!\u201d she tweeted.\n\nHidden Figures co-star Janelle Monae and director Theodore Melfi \u200falso accepted Bush Hager\u2019s apology on Twitter.\n\nDearest, @octaviaspencer Your kindness means so much to me + your compassion is matched only by your incredible talent in Hidden FIGURES!
