Gossip Cop can exclusively correct this claim. We\u2019re told it\u2019s \u201cnot true.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Mariah-Joe Jonas Hate Fest Rolls On,\u201d reads a headline in this week\u2019s National Enquirer, which claims Carey \u201crefused\u201d to stand next to Jonas and his band in Times Square as the ball dropped on New Year\u2019s Eve. A so-called \u201csource\u201d tells the tabloid, \u201cNow Joe doesn\u2019t want anything to do with Mariah or even be at the same events.\u201d\n\nLet Gossip Cop set the record straight. A rep for Carey exclusively assures us the report is 100 percent \u201cnot true.\u201d The pair, who both performed in New York\u2019s Times Square on New Year\u2019s Eve, the busiest night of the year, weren\u2019t standing anywhere near each other because there were roughly around 1 million people in between them. Once again, the supermarket tabloid has seemingly fabricated yet another imaginary feud.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/60b1133d1f9f8418b4253473?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(180,60)&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Holly Nicol"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-02-are-mariah-carey-joe-jonas-feuding/", "title": "Are Mariah Carey & Joe Jonas Feuding?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "title": "Are Mariah Carey & Joe Jonas Feuding? | Real 99.3", "description": "\u201cThe Mariah-Joe Jonas Hate Fest Rolls On,\u201d reads a headline in this week\u2019s 'National Enquirer.'", "url": "https://real993.iheart.com/content/2017-03-02-are-mariah-carey-joe-jonas-feuding/", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "type": "article", "site_name": "Real 99.3"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#592877", "twitter": {"title": "Are Mariah Carey & Joe Jonas Feuding? | Real 99.3", "description": "\u201cThe Mariah-Joe Jonas Hate Fest Rolls On,\u201d reads a headline in this week\u2019s 'National Enquirer.'", "url": "https://real993.iheart.com/content/2017-03-02-are-mariah-carey-joe-jonas-feuding/", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Real993fm", "creator": "@Real993fm", "domain": "real993.iheart.com", "tile": {"image": {"alt": "\u201cThe Mariah-Joe Jonas Hate Fest Rolls On,\u201d reads a headline in this week\u2019s 'National Enquirer.'"}, "template": {"testing": 1}}, "": {"tile": {"image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)"}}}, "parsely-title": "Are Mariah Carey & Joe Jonas Feuding? | Real 99.3", "description": "\u201cThe Mariah-Joe Jonas Hate Fest Rolls On,\u201d reads a headline in this week\u2019s 'National Enquirer.'", "keywords": "Mariah Carey (31885), Joe Jonas (601051)", "parsely-tags": "Mariah Carey (31885), Joe Jonas (601051)", "parsely-link": "https://real993.iheart.com/content/2017-03-02-are-mariah-carey-joe-jonas-feuding/", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/58b83030b3a7b6a5782beb06?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "Real 99.3", "fb": {"app_id": 304319469632203}, "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-03-02-are-mariah-carey-joe-jonas-feuding/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-03-02T14:46:00Z", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "parsely-author": "Holly Nicol", "parsely-section": "Trending"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488412800.0, "source": "http://altrock993.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
