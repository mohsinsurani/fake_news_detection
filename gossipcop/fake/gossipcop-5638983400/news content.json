Credit:AP\n\nIn the same year Kim Kardashian broke the Internet, Kylie Jenner (alongside Kendall, at this point a seemingly forever united brand) co-authored a (later revealed to be ghost-written, of course) teen dystopian fiction novel called Rebel: City of Indra: The Story of Lex and Livia, a piece of literature with more colons in its title than plot points in its pages. It sold fewer than 13,000 copies worldwide.", "images":
