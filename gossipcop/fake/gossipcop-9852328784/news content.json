She is currently 36 years old.\n\nWhat is her net worth?\n\nBefore finding her prince charming, Markle was successful in her own right.\n\nAlthough much less than her fianc\u00e9\u2019s, it is estimated that she has a net worth of \u00a33.5m ($5m).\n\nShe has worked numerous jobs, including as a calligrapher before becoming a successful actress in Hollywood.\n\nPrior to making it big, Markle had multiple small guest roles on television, including spots on General Hospital, Century City, The War at Home, and CSI: NY.\n\nIn 2011, Markle\u2019s big acting break came when she was cast as Rachel Zane on the show Suits, which she played for seven seasons, until finishing in late 2017.\n\nFor her role on Suits, Fortune magazine estimated she was paid \u00a335,500 ($50,000) per episode or an annual income of \u00a3319,400 ($450,000).\n\nMarkle also worked as the editor-in-chief of lifestyle website, The Tig, and created a line of women\u2019s workwear alongside Canadian clothing company Reitmans. From these ventures and related sponsorships, Markle received an estimated annual income of \u00a356,800 ($80,000).\n\nAnd in 2010, Markle was paid \u00a3132,750 ($187,000) for her role in the film Remember Me and \u00a3121,697 ($171,429) for her role in the short film The Candidate.\n\nAs for the future royal\u2019s clothes, she currently pays for her own wardrobe, according to People magazine.\n\nBut once she ties the knot, Markle\u2019s clothing budget for official outings will be covered by the money Prince Charles gives to Prince William, Kate Middleton, and Prince Harry from his Duchy of Cornwall income.\n\nWho is her family?\n\nAlthough Ms Markle wasn\u2019t raised a royal, her early life was certainly not without its perks.\n\nHer mother, Doria Loyce Ragland, is a social worker and a yoga instructor who lives in California. And her father, Thomas Markle Sr, is an Emmy award-winning lighting director who lives in Mexico.\n\nMarkle\u2019s parents divorced when she was six years old and although she was their only child, she has two older paternal half-siblings.\n\nShe was educated in private schools and attended Northwestern University in theatre and international studies in 2003.\n\nHer mother is African American and her father is Caucasian, a background that Markle has embraced and discussed throughout her career.\n\nIn addition to a successful career, Markle\u2019s father Tom, 72, once won the lottery, winning an estimated \u00a3532,222 ($750,000), according to the Daily Mail.\n\nBoth her parents are expected to attend her wedding on May 19 at St George\u2019s Chapel, Windsor Castle.\n\nThis article has been updated.
