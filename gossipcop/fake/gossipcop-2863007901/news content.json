The rapper, who was briefly involved with Jennifer Lopez when they collaborated on his album, More Life, in late 2016, regrets that their romance fizzled out. And now that A-Rod cheated on J.Lo, the rapper wants another chance with the star!\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been telling pals that it was his biggest mistake and that she\u2019s \u2018the one that got away,\u2019\u201d a source told In Touch. And though he has reached out to tell her so, she isn\u2019t up for a rekindled romance, despite her current heartache. The source added, \u201cShe\u2019s just not interested in him anymore.\u201d\n\nThe singers were hot and heavy during their short-lived romance but called it quits after the 48-year-old star discovered Drake had been cheating. \u201cDrake was sleeping with [former porn star] Sophie Brussaux behind Jennifer\u2019s back,\u201d a source exclusively told Life & Style. When she learned of the hookup, which allegedly happened on a trip to Amsterdam, \u201cShe dropped him.\u201d\n\nOf course Drake, being Drake, hasn\u2019t exactly recovered from the breakup. In one of his latest songs \u2014 \u201cDiplomatic Immunity\u201d \u2014 he raps, \u201c2010 was when I lost my halo / 2017 I lost a J.Lo / A Rotterdam trip had me on the front page, though I had to lay low, Hot Topic like your everyday clothes / Closed off but I could never stay closed.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that the 31-year-old Canadian is trying to reunite with his ex since those close to him revealed that he\u2019s now ready to start a family. \u201cDrake does want to settle down and have kids one day, and he\u2019s confident that the right woman will come along at the right time,\u201d a source told Hollywood Life. \u201cUntil then, Drake\u2019s not forcing anything.\u201d Unfortunately for Drake, it looks like J.Lo doesn\u2019t want any cheaters in her life.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/drake-jennifer-lopez.png?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/drake-jennifer-lopez.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/drake-jennifer-lopez.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/drake-jennifer-lopez-back-together-153596/", "title": "Drake Is Trying to Get Back Together With Ex Jennifer Lopez", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Could Alex Rodriguez\u2019s potential loss be Drake\u2019s gain?
