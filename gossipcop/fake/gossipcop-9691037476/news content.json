The inevitable Cavs-Warriors Finals matchup is here for the third year in a row. And, I\u2019m here to tell you why the Cavs will take the Larry O\u2019Brien gold back to Cleveland. If you\u2019ve got a strong debate prepared, click inside to challenge me\u2026\n\nAh, you\u2019re brave. Welcome to the Cavs den. Yes, I\u2019m obviously predicting for the Cleveland Cavaliers to win the 2017 NBA Finals. Now, Dubs fans \u2014 Before you get up in arms about your beloved Warriors, let me remind you that this is all in fun. Although my shirt currently says \u201cDefend The Land\u201d, that doesn\u2019t mean I don\u2019t think that Golden State are also an incredible team. So, lets talk all things FINALS.\n\nBefore I get into individual reasons, here\u2019s why the Cavs will in the title in the short. Their resume, 3-point shooting, mentality, players in the paint, and the big three, LeBron James, 32, Kyrie Irving, 25, and Kevin Love, 28.\n\nNow, let\u2019s break this down. First of all, have we forgotten about LeBron James\u2019 insane performance in the 2016 finals when he was the catalyst who brought the Cavs back from a 3-1 deficit? He went back to Cleveland and brought them their first championship in a half century! Damn, that gets me every time. And, I know what you\u2019re saying, \u201cWell, that was last year.\u201d Oh, I know. But, at 32-years-old, King James is playing the best basketball of his life. He\u2019s been averaging about 33.4 points, 9.0 rebounds and 7.1 assists per game in the postseason. Not to mention, he\u2019s passed Michael Jordan, 54, on the postseason scoring list. Mic drop, no. 1!\n\nKevin Love. Oh, do I love me some Love. You can\u2019t even say that he isn\u2019t playing the best basketball of his time with the Cavs. And, the Cavs finally know how to use him. He\u2019s proven to be a dynamic player, shooting 47. 5 from the arc and being a beast on the boards, averaging 10.2 rebounds in the postseason. And, can we talk about how he must\u2019ve been a quarterback in a past life? He\u2019s firing long-court passes down to LeBron like it\u2019s no one\u2019s business. What\u2019s up, Tom Brady?!\n\nLet\u2019s talk about Kyrie Irving, aka one of the most clutch players in the NBA. And, that\u2019s exactly what a team needs in the postseason, especially the Finals. The showdown between Irving and Steph Curry, 29, is something that everyone\u2019s been waiting for. Irving has averaged 26.6 points in the past two Finals, while Curry has averaged 24.1. Not to mention, he\u2019s a young pup at 25, having been in the league for six years now. And, by the look on his face when talking about heading to Oakland, I think he\u2019s more than ready for a matchup with Curry.\n\nLook at Kyrie when Ernie Johnson talks about facing the Warriors again in the Finals \ud83d\ude02 pic.twitter.com/8zlx0Nkca8 \u2014 Bleacher Report (@BleacherReport) May 26, 2017\n\nWhat\u2019s something else that the Warriors don\u2019t have? \u2014 Tristan Thompson, 26. He knows how to go hard, yet stay in control in the paint. And, he completely eats the glass when it comes to the boards.\n\nAnother thing that the Warriors don\u2019t have right now? \u2014 Klay Thompson, 27. Where has he been in the postseason? Warriors fans, I\u2019ll give it to you, Thompson is one of the greatest shooters in the NBA. However, he hasn\u2019t been performing that way during this year\u2019s finals. His numbers are lower than last year\u2019s averages during this postseason, and with all do respect, I think he\u2019s in a bit of a funk; which has me thinking that he may be less of a threat for the Cavs on defense.\n\nAnd, speaking of less threats\u2026 Warriors fans are probably praying that Draymond Green, 27, is on his best behavior heading into the Finals. Let\u2019s not forget about last year\u2019s finals when he was suspended for Game 5, for appearing to slap LeBron in the groin in Game 4. Clearly, attitudes are key in the Finals, and the Cavs have their heads on a bit tighter this year.\n\nHere\u2019s my thing \u2014 People continue to doubt the best player in the league, LeBron and the army behind him. Yes, Golden State will be a challenge and yes, they have four All-Star players; But, the Cavs also have three as well. I think the real hype is on Golden State because some people have given Curry this persona that he somehow, someway needs to seek revenge, or redeem himself. UM, redeem himself from what, exactly? [And, here is where I defend Steph for a hot second]. Why on earth would the 2-time MVP have to prove anything to anyone? The man is only 29-years-old, has a ring, AND shooting records that have set the bar at an unrealistic level that league has ever seen. And, he\u2019s the best point guard in the league; behind Kyrie Irving, of course. Come on, I\u2019m a Cavs fan, remember?\n\nGame 1 kicks off Thursday, June 1 in Oakland, California, at 9 PM ET. And, you can catch all of the action, right here at HollywoodLife.com!
