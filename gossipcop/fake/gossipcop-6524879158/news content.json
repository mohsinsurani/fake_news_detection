The pop star kicked off her highly anticipated \u201cReputation\u201d world tour last night in Glendale, Ariz.\n\nTaylor kept to her true self during the opening show and had a little real-talk moment with her fans about bullying and her reptile theme \u2014 there were a lot of snakes at the concert. The singer explained she hit a low point when \u201csomeone\u201d called her a snake on social media. She even considered giving up music altogether, but she turned the scandal into a teachable moment with her fans.\n\nThough Taylor didn\u2019t use any names, it\u2019s easy to assume who she\u2019s talking about in the video. During the height of the great Taylor Swift-Kanye West feud of 2016, Kim Kardashian dissed the singer on Snapchat in a series of videos, and she did it on National Snake Day.\n\nWait it's legit National Snake Day?!?!?They have holidays for everybody, I mean everything these days! \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) July 17, 2016\n\nThe 60,000 or so Swifties in the arena last night cheered as Taylor told her story of triumph over Kim the \u201cbully,\u201d but Twitter was not so kind to the singer. Overall, they sided with Kim!\n\nAnother reason why I only listen to @taylorswift13 music. Calling @KimKardashian a bully bc she exposed your lie? ok To say your career was at stake bc she called you out is over exaggeration at it\u2019s finest. But I guess you don\u2019t love the drama, it loves you, right? \u2014 Ashley Torres (@ashleyeatorres) May 9, 2018\n\nSTOP. PLAYING. THE. VICTIM. You're not three, Taylor.\n\nTaylor Swift Addresses Being Bullied by Kim Kardashian West https://t.co/lO5h2KIqFD via @vulture \u2014 Angelica Frey (@angelica_frey) May 9, 2018\n\nI\u2019m tired of her. Everyone has moved on but her. \u2014 breezega (@breezega) May 9, 2018\n\nHey @taylorswift13, isn\u2019t @KimKardashian the reason you\u2019re hundo-mill-dollars richer from #Reputation? She essentially lit the path of the creative process and rebranded you\u2026You should thank her\u2026 just a thought \u2014 Julia Hofer (@jchofer) May 9, 2018\n\nI swear this girl LOVES playing the \u201cvictim\u201d. It\u2019s her favorite role. \u2014 jenn (@_xmarissabee) May 9, 2018\n\n@Taylorswift13 is on her latest attempt to cash in on the #KardashianKash Snake is now a bully word. Comon. No its a person who hides in the shadows and pops out for a meal. @KimKardashian https://t.co/SsniGJIrLG \u2014 JewZ (@hilaryveach) May 9, 2018\n\nIf you dont wanna be called a (@taylorswift13)\u2026.then dont LIE in the first place! \u2764 (@KimKardashian) \u2014 FromDerek (@FromDerek3) May 9, 2018\n\nOn a real note is Taylor Swift actually trying to play the bully card! GTFO @KimKardashian is no bully ! \u2014 Samantha (@Melendrez_sja) May 9, 2018\n\nGiven the sheer amount of snakes present during the concert, we doubt Taylor will just shake it off \u2014 the snake is part of her brand now, and she has dozens of shows ahead of her to share the tale. However, there is still a chance for Kim and Taylor to make up \u2014 just ask Katy Perry.\n\nStory continues\n\nWatch: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian supports Tristan Thompson at Cavs game\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_w_entertainmentv2.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197800334&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fentertainment%2Ftaylor-swift-calls-kim-kardashian-bully-fans-call-bs-180443353.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7JOOHnw2N_SFubWRzMV56A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTM0MjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d7f38f00-340b-11eb-b7bf-540525a865da", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/RLJsmlni9xZHmv4EAJF9wA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgwO2g9ODA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-12-07/3ec7d670-db75-11e7-8862-7b5edd633ade_Heather-Gardner-.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oFJN0jwNZ0I7RmIiTE8YuQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-05-09/803d6a00-53b3-11e8-b7cb-9b14bb359028_Tay-Kim.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oFJN0jwNZ0I7RmIiTE8YuQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-05-09/803d6a00-53b3-11e8-b7cb-9b14bb359028_Tay-Kim.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-calls-kim-kardashian-bully-fans-call-bs-180443353.html", "title": "Taylor Swift calls Kim Kardashian a bully \u2013 and fans call BS!", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Taylor Swift, Kim Kardashian, Tristan Thompson", "twitter": {"title": "Taylor Swift calls Kim Kardashian a bully \u2013 and fans call BS!", "description": "Taylor Swift kept to her true self during the opening show of her tour and had a little real-talk moment with her fans about bullying and her reptile theme \u2014 there were a lot of snakes at the concert.", "site": "@Yahoo", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oFJN0jwNZ0I7RmIiTE8YuQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-05-09/803d6a00-53b3-11e8-b7cb-9b14bb359028_Tay-Kim.jpg", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oFJN0jwNZ0I7RmIiTE8YuQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-05-09/803d6a00-53b3-11e8-b7cb-9b14bb359028_Tay-Kim.jpg"}, "creator": "@heathergtv", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift calls Kim Kardashian a bully \u2013 and fans call BS!", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/taylor-swift-calls-kim-kardashian-bully-fans-call-bs-180443353.html", "description": "Taylor Swift kept to her true self during the opening show of her tour and had a little real-talk moment with her fans about bullying and her reptile theme \u2014 there were a lot of snakes at the concert.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oFJN0jwNZ0I7RmIiTE8YuQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/creatr-images/GLB/2018-05-09/803d6a00-53b3-11e8-b7cb-9b14bb359028_Tay-Kim.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "al": {"android": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=3dc066e0-b94e-3515-9997-6996eaa6b223&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo"}, "ios": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=3dc066e0-b94e-3515-9997-6996eaa6b223&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842}}, "description": "Taylor Swift kept to her true self during the opening show of her tour and had a little real-talk moment with her fans about bullying and her reptile theme \u2014 there were a lot of snakes at the concert.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
