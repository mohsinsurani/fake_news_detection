On Wednesday they pressed new U.S. Sen. Kamala Harris to work to ensure a more reliable source of water for the nation\u2019s most bountiful farming region.\n\n\u201cThis area is drying on the vine,\u201d Ryan Jacobsen, executive director of the Fresno County Farm Bureau, told Harris during a roundtable with Central Valley officials.\n\nA long-term solution can only come through federal and state action to protect the area\u2019s water supply, he said.\n\nJason Phillips, chief executive of the Friant Water Authority, said recent rainfall had done little to stem problems caused by nearly a decade of drought.\n\nA canal that runs from Fresno to north of Bakersfield sunk in some places as much as 2 feet in two years, he said, wreaking havoc on a system that operates on the force of gravity.\n\n\u201cWe cannot get all the water to our growers,\u201d he said.\n\nThe meeting between Harris and nearly two dozen agriculture and water officials was meant to ease what is typically a fraught relationship between the state\u2019s Democratic leaders \u2014 all of whose power bases are in metropolitan areas \u2014 and the mostly Republican Central Valley powers that traditionally look at them with skepticism.\n\nSen. Dianne Feinstein has worked for two decades to aid the agricultural industry \u2014 at the roundtable, several nodded as Harris referred to the senior senator as an \u201cincredible warrior\u201d for the area.\n\nBut Harris\u2019 predecessor, former Sen. Barbara Boxer, was allied more with environmental groups that have fought dams and other water systems. As a result, she was viewed negatively by many here.\n\nHarris was intent Wednesday on persuading the Central Valley representatives of her interest in places beyond her base in Alameda and San Francisco counties.\n\nThey, on the other hand, worked to convince her to be more in the Feinstein mold on issues important to the area \u2014 from reliable water to immigration programs to environmental protections that take into consideration the area\u2019s needs.\n\nPresident Trump was highly popular in much of the Central Valley, apart from Fresno County, which leans Democratic because of its metropolitan shadings. But some issues important to the valley cut in politically unorthodox ways.\n\nRepublicans here are more concerned than those elsewhere with passing a plan that would give legal status to immigrants, on whom agriculture depends. With undocumented workers worried about deportation, and the border tightening to those not yet here, the labor supply has already shrunk, farmers said.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re out there working, being productive people,\u201d said farmer Joe Del Bosque. \u201cThey work hard for us, and we have nowhere to reach.\u201d\n\nDel Bosque said he recently held a training session for new workers. Of the 200 people who showed up, only a handful were born in the United States, he said.\n\nEnvironmental regulations prized by Democrats elsewhere are often frowned on by some party members here and blamed for the area\u2019s water difficulties.\n\nSeveral of the participants lobbied Harris for her support of dams that have long been under consideration by federal and state officials, particularly the Temperance Flat Dam, which would be constructed on the San Joaquin River.\n\nHarris offered no assurances on the topic to the group on Wednesday. Afterward, speaking to reporters, she also did not take a position.\n\n\u201cOne of the things that we\u2019re going to have to figure out ... is what is the right solution for that,\u201d she said of a plan to construct the Temperance Flat Dam and several others. \u201cIs it going to be about the building of dams? Is it also going to be about looking at \u2014 also looking at \u2014 other sources of renewable and sustainable reliable sources?\u201d\n\nBoth sides signaled they did not expect an alliance on all fronts. But Harris said she would serve as an advocate for farmers during the crafting of a new farm bill and other measures before the Senate.\n\nWilliam Bourdeau, executive vice president of the politically influential Harris Farms, told the senator he wished the majority of her supporters who reside in urban areas would have a \u201cbetter understanding\u201d of the risks and challenges of farming.\n\n\u201cWe need somebody to explain the symbiotic relationship we have,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI agree with you completely,\u201d she replied.", "images":
