Chris [Brown] is angry, hurt and kind of heartbroken after hearing Rihanna was looking pregnant at the Grammys . They were each other\u2019s first real love and he still misses her.always had high hopes for their future together and even though there are only rumors that she could be pregnant with some other guy\u2019s baby, he is still pretty upset and sad to hear about it. He feels like that should be his baby. He always hoped it would be him having a family with Rihanna and he regrets how things ended between them,\u201d a source close to Chris tellsEXCLUSIVELY.\n\nWe had no clue Chris Brown, 28, was still so hung up on Rihanna, 29. But sometimes it takes a huge milestone like a potential pregnancy for feelings to resurface again. Obviously, Rihanna has not yet confirmed or denied the rumors, but fans went into a tizzy, following her sexy performance of \u201cWild Thoughts\u201d with DJ Khaled and Bryson Tiller during the 60th annual Grammy Awards on Jan. 28. Fans thought Rihanna was dancing more \u201cdelicately\u201d than usual, and they accused her of looking like she had gained a bit of weight. We think Rihanna looked great, but that doesn\u2019t mean she\u2019s not pregnant. She very well could be, but until she confirms or denies the news, we can\u2019t say for certain.\n\nEither way, Chris is definitely upset. And we can\u2019t really blame him \u2014 they have so much history together. It makes sense that he would hold out hope for some sort of reconciliation in the future. But for now, Rihanna is happily dating her billionaire beau Hassan Jameel. They were even spotted partying together after the show.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do YOU feel bad for Chris Brown?
