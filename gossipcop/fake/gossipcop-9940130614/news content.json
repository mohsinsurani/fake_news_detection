At the time, Apatow was a producer.\n\n\"I wasn't attracted to nice boys at the time,\" Mann told ABC News. \"I was at the tail end of that stage. And then Judd somehow worked his way into my life, and it just kind of hit me. It was a great day when I finally realized what was right in front of me.\"\n\nSince then, Mann has starred in several of Apatow's films, gradually taking on larger roles.\n\nBut what kinds of romance movies does Mann most like to watch? Her answers may surprise you.\n\nRecently, Mann shared her five favorite romantic flicks with ABCNews.com -- and they aren't your typical love stories.\n\nWhen ranking romantic comedies, most people probably wouldn't put this 1971 cult classic on their list. But the unique love story definitely delivers romance in addition to dark, slapstick comedy. \"Harold and Maude\" follows the relationship between Harold, a 19-year-old who has a fascination with faking his own death, and Maude, a 79-year-old free spirit who dabbles in things such as stealing hearses and modeling nude for ice sculptures.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/vegas-stabbings_hpMain_20221007-090546_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/uvalde-1-gty-er-221007_1665161778549_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/lyntell-washington-main-ht-jt-221003_1664840618551_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/WireAP_32c62fc05df8484e89cb2ac6e019fd0d_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-white-house-oval-office-gty-jt-221004_1664919462010_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/abc_news_default_2000x2000_update_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/Movies/story?id=8271226&page=1", "title": "Leslie Mann Shares Her Top 5 Romantic Movies", "meta_data": {"description": "Actress Leslie Mann shares her top 5 favorite romance movies with ABCNews.com.", "keywords": "leslie mann, romantic movies, top 5, Harold and Maude, Tootsie, Foul Play, The Apartment, Raising Arizona", "copyright": "2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.
