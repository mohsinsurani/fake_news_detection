Blake Shelton sure looked like he was loving life when he happily stepped out to go to church on Mother\u2019s Day with Gwen Stefani and her kids. See the adorable pics here!\n\nBlake Shelton, 41, looked as comfortable as could be when he stepped out with girlfriend Gwen Stefani, 48, and her three sons, Kingston, 11, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4, to attend a mass at church for Mother\u2019s Day on May 13 and it was truly special to see. The country singer carried little Apollo and walked with a smile as Gwen held Zuma\u2019s hand and Kingston walked beside them. At one point, Blake also cozily held onto Gwen too. The precious party of five were all dressed in business casual attire that included button-down shirts and pants for the boys while Gwen rocked a black jacket, a pair of black leggings and leopard print heeled boots.\n\nThe holiday outing is just one of many that Blake, Gwen and her boys have been on together since the loving couple started dating back in 2015. From fishing trips in Blake\u2019s hometown in Oklahoma to other holiday outings like the one on Easter, it\u2019s always amazing to see how in tune they all seem to be around each other! Gwen and Blake often express their admiration for each other in public interviews and Blake truly seems to love spending time with Gwen\u2019s boys as if they were his own. It\u2019s always wonderful to see such love and support between families!\n\nAlthough Blake doesn\u2019t have any children of his own, his family outings with Gwen and her boys prove he\u2019d be the best dad ever. It seems Gwen\u2019s boys, who she had with ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, 52, love Blake just as much as he loves them! There are even reports that they would love for him to propose to their mom so that they can call him their stepdad. That would be awesome to see now wouldn\u2019t it?!\n\nWe\u2019ll continue to follow Blake and Gwen\u2019s adorable romance and we hope they continue living their best lives together if it makes them happy!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blake-shelton-sweetly-puts-his-arm-around-gwen-stefani-carries-little-apollo-on-mothers-day-post-3.jpg?w=620&h=930", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F13%2Fblake-shelton-gwen-stefani-mothers-day-church-kids-pic-photos%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3140519", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/selena-gomez-screamed-after-seeing-bella-hadid-the-weeknds-kissing-pic-she-was-completely-shocked-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15476338&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/meghan-markle-mortified-family-profitting-off-royal-wedding-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/timeless-recap.jpg?w=200&resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/nup_182364_0559.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blake-shelton-sweetly-puts-his-arm-around-gwen-stefani-carries-little-apollo-on-mothers-day-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blake-shelton-sweetly-puts-his-arm-around-gwen-stefani-carries-little-apollo-on-mothers-day-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/5bab5d8745869e374761b0ad11609de5?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/1-bella-hadid-feature.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/harry-meghan.png?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blake-shelton-sweetly-puts-his-arm-around-gwen-stefani-carries-little-apollo-on-mothers-day-post.jpg?w=620&h=930", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blake-shelton-sweetly-puts-his-arm-around-gwen-stefani-carries-little-apollo-on-mothers-day-post-2.jpg?w=620&h=930", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blake-shelton-sweetly-puts-his-arm-around-gwen-stefani-carries-little-apollo-on-mothers-day-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/blake-shelton-sweetly-puts-his-arm-around-gwen-stefani-carries-little-apollo-on-mothers-day-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Silvia"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822/http://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/13/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-mothers-day-church-kids-pic-photos/", "title": "Blake Shelton Sweetly Puts His Arm Around Gwen Stefani & Carries Apollo On Mother\u2019s Day", "meta_data": {"description": "Blake Shelton puts his arm around Gwen Stefani as he holds her son Apollo", "news_keywords": "Apollo Rossdale, Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton Sweetly Puts His Arm Around Gwen Stefani & Carries Apollo On Mother\u2019s Day", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180514043822/http://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/13/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-mothers-day-church-kids-pic-photos/", "description": "Aw!
