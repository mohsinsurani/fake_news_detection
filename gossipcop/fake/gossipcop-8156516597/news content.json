Justin\u2019s family loves Selena, but Selena\u2019s family has put her in a very conflicting spot because they still don\u2019t trust Justin,\u201d an insider tells Us Weekly exclusively. \u201cSelena has tried to convince her family that Justin has changed \u2026 but her family just isn\u2019t budging right now.\u201d\n\nThe relationship between the \u201cWolves\u201d singer, 25, and her mother, Mandy Teefy, became rocky when Gomez started seeing Bieber again after undergoing a kidney transplant and recuperating from complications last summer. (She split from The Weeknd in October 2017 after 10 months of dating.) Though the \u201cSorry\u201d singer, 24, and the 13 Reasons Why executive producer went public with their reunion shortly after, Gomez chose not to bring Bieber along to celebrate Thanksgiving with her family. A source told Us Weekly at the time that Gomez didn\u2019t think her mom in particular \u201cwould approve.\u201d\n\n\u201cHer relationship with Justin has really affected her relationship with her mom, and it\u2019s been hard for her because she is super close with her mom. Her mom was her rock when she was having her health complications,\u201d the insider also adds to Us. \u201cJustin and Selena decided to take a break to give her family some more time to heal and take in the idea of her and Justin being a couple again.\u201d\n\nAnother source tells Us that another contributing factor to the on-off couple is that Bieber \u201cdoesn\u2019t care about anyone but himself.\u201d Adds the source: \u201cThe second she saw it, she walked away, especially now with her health. She knows she doesn\u2019t need him.\u201d\n\nThe pair, who have dated off and on since they were first linked in 2011, were last seen leaving church separately on March 8 after vacationing in Jamaica. The couple visited the Caribbean island nation in February for the wedding of Bieber\u2019s father.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-breakup.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1625px%2C854px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-breakup.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1625px%2C854px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz-Stanton", "Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-taking-a-break-mainly-because-of-her-mom/", "title": "Justin Bieber, Selena Gomez Taking a Break \u2018Mainly Because of\u2019 Her Mom", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are taking a break, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez Are Taking a Break", "description": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are taking a break, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-taking-a-break-mainly-because-of-her-mom/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-12T14:52:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-breakup.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1625px%2C854px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-breakup.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1625px%2C854px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-11T17:24:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-12T14:52:48+00:00"}, "author": "Leanne Aciz-Stanton", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Why Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez Are Taking a Break", "description": "Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber are taking a break, Us Weekly can exclusively reveal \u2014 find out more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-breakup.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1625px%2C854px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520789056.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
