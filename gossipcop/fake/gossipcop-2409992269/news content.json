Holmes divorced ex-husband Tom Cruise in June 2012.\n\nFoxx was taking part in the \"NBA All-Star Celebrity Game\" on 16 February when host Michael Smith brought up photos of Holmes playing basketball on Valentine\u2019s Day, during a live broadcast.\n\n\u201cI know you\u2019ve prepared and I saw pictures,\u201d Smith says in the interview. \u201cDid you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine\u2019s Day? Like some real \u2018Love and Basketball\u2019?\u201d\n\nFoxx can be seen smiling as he takes his headphones and mic off and walks away. An assistant unclips the equipment and throws some side-eye at the camera.\n\n\u201cUh oh, did we lose him?\u201d Smith asks, as the camera shows Foxx warming up on the court. \u201cOh, he ready to go, he ready to hoop.\u201d\n\nAlso taking part in the game were Justin Bieber, Black Panther star Michael B Jordan, Stranger Things actor Caleb McLaughlin, Black-ish stars Anthony Anderson and Miles Brown, and Olympic sprinter Andre de Grasse.\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "http://www.independent.co.uk/img/pixels-player-logo.svg", "http://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roisin O'Connor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-dating-valentines-day-basketball-interview-walks-out-tom-cruise-divorce-a8215251.html", "title": "Jamie Foxx walks out of live interview after being asked about Katie Holmes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Hollywood actors have reportedly been dating since 2013", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Jamie Foxx walks out of live broadcast after being asked about Katie Holmes", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/jamie-foxx-katie-holmes-dating-valentines-day-basketball-interview-walks-out-tom-cruise-divorce-a8215251.html", "type": "article", "description": "Hollywood actors have reportedly been dating since 2013", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Roisin O'Connor", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 250, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2018-02-17T13:40:48.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Jamie Foxx walks out of live broadcast after being asked about Katie Holmes", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Hollywood actors have reportedly been dating since 2013", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/02/17/10/screen-shot-2018-02-17-at-10.53.14.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Katie Holmes,Jamie Foxx,Basketball,Justin Bieber,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518874848.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
