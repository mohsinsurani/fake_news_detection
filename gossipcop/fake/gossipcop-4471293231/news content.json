Well, at least no one is criticizing the stunning images that ran with it.\n\nLooks great, right? Problem is, the accompanying article has definitely rankled a lot of folks, including Robbie\u2019s fellow Australians:\n\nThis paragraph is a declaration of war https://t.co/Cve3eq9r24 pic.twitter.com/iSpO72gzKV \u2014 David Mack (@davidmackau) July 6, 2016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/_AmyGray_/status/750825415531311104https://twitter.com/CameronAtfield/status/750820048617385985\n\nCohen has also been savaged on Twitter for the way he writes about Robbie, which some say overly sexualizes the admittedly very sexy Wolf of Wall Street star.\n\nthanks @VanityFair for letting America's Greasiest Creepy Uncle profile Margot Robbie. it was illuminating if not for the reason you planned \u2014 Patrick Cosmos (@veryimportant) July 6, 2016\n\nhttps://twitter.com/rgay/status/750762148695912448\n\nMy face while reading Vanity Fair's article about Margot Robbie, who deserves so much better: pic.twitter.com/ZMQmUQcErM \u2014 \ud83c\udf08 Kristen Haynes (@kristenhaynes_) July 6, 2016\n\nBut clearly, some comments are being wrongly criticized for being \u201ccreepy,\u201d when they actually aren\u2019t all that horrifying.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember what she was wearing, but it was simple, her hair combed around those painfully blue eyes. We sat in the corner. She looked at me and smiled.\u201d\n\nThis? Totally normal. Was she supposed to frown?\n\n\u201cWe sat for a moment in silence. She was thinking of something; I was thinking of something else.\u201d\n\nOK, it\u2019s perhaps not the most delicate way to phrase it, but this doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he\u2019s thinking about something sexual. But then again maybe Cohen was thinking about how sexy Margot Robbie looked sitting in front of him. Can you really blame him?\n\nThen again, some comments actually were a little strange.\n\n\u201cShe can be sexy and composed even while naked but only in character.\u201d\n\n???\n\n\u201cAs I said, she is from Australia. To understand her, you should think about what that means.\u201d\n\nIs Cohen saying he can\u2019t understand her because of her accent? Maybe hasn\u2019t watched that oddly riveting video where she explains Aussie slang.\n\n\"She is from Australia. To understand her you should think about what that means. She's upside-down like ninety percent of the time\". \u2014 Jo Thornely (@jothornely) July 6, 2016\n\nWhile it\u2019s understandable that the story struck a nerve, it\u2019s also not the most offensive celebrity interview of recent times. It\u2019s not even that offensive, if you think about it.\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Margot Robbie is an absolute babe, and Cohen, who recently wrote for HBO\u2019s now-canceled Vinyl, was just a guy trying to keep his shit together in the presence of her undeniable greatness. (Though he\u2019s on his own with the Australian stuff).\n\nMoral of the story? There\u2019s really no need to collectively lose our minds over the Vanity Fair story on Margot Robbie. Thank you and goodnight.", "images": ["https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss10-margot-robbie-august-2016.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/maxim-footer-logo.png", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss07-margot-robbie-august-2016.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/maxim-logo-transparent-458x129-1.png", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss03-margot-robbie-august-2016.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/themes/maxim-child-theme/assets/imgs/maxim-bet-400x150.jpeg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111-744x443.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss09-margot-robbie-august-2016.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/august-cover-margot-robbie.jpg", "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/themes/maxim-child-theme/assets/imgs/MaximBet_Primary_Wordmark_MaximWebsite.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=36102373&cv=3.6.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zeynep Yenisey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/margot-robbie-vanity-fair-story-controversy-2016-7/", "title": "The Internet Isn\u2019t Too Happy With Vanity Fair\u2019s Cover Story About Margot Robbie", "meta_data": {"msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/cropped-favicon-336x336.png", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111-336x452.jpg"}, "description": "It's been slammed as \"creepy and lecherous\"--but is it really that bad?", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Internet Isn't Too Happy With Vanity Fair's Cover Story About Margot Robbie - Maxim", "description": "It's been slammed as \"creepy and lecherous\"--but is it really that bad?", "url": "https://www.maxim.com/entertainment/margot-robbie-vanity-fair-story-controversy-2016-7/", "site_name": "Maxim", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111.jpg", "width": 744, "height": 1000, "alt": "ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2016-07-08T19:22:55-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "The Internet Isn't Too Happy With Vanity Fair's Cover Story About Margot Robbie - Maxim", "description": "It's been slammed as \"creepy and lecherous\"--but is it really that bad?", "image": "https://www.maxim.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/ss02-margot-robbie-august-2016111.jpg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Zeynep Yenisey", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "AMP for WP 1.0.77.43", "BridPlugin": "site:20042|oauth_token:01110011 01100101 01100011 01110010 01100101 01110100|ver:3.6.3|widget:1|disable_video_autosave:|channels:Array|width:900|height:506|autoplay:0|aspect:1|user_id:17159|default_channel:18|ovr_def:1|async_embed:1|google_seo:1|raw_embed:0|unit:18669|unit_width:480|unit_height:270|player:27509|video_image:|onready:"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1468020175.0, "source": "http://www.maxim.com", "summary": ""}
