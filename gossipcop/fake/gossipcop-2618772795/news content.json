After catching preview performances, she declared that the musical about her life could use a little more life.\n\n\u201cSome times, I was having a blast. Some times, my mind was wandering. I think those are the parts that are going to get better,\u201d she said in a Q&A with the Chicago Tribune.\n\nNever one to hold back, Cher said the production is a work in progress.\n\n\u201cSome parts of it are really fabulous. We\u2019re going to work on the other parts,\u201d the 72-year-old pop icon said. \u201cIn many parts, it was much, much better than I thought it would be. And there were no parts where I wanted to gouge my eyes out.\u201d\n\nGet more celebrity news and photos delivered to your inbox for free on weekdays.\n\nSign up for our Coffee Break newsletter here.\n\nCher, seeing the show for the first time, said the show focuses on the key men in her life (ex-husbands Sonny Bono and Gregg Allman, Robert Altman), her movies, her relationship with her mother. Three different actresses portray her at different stages of her life, but at times all three share the stage, singing and interacting with each other.\n\nCher said she pushed for the show to be honest as possible.\n\nRelated Articles Entertainment | Dwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson on if he\u2019s running for president\n\nDwayne \u2018The Rock\u2019 Johnson on if he\u2019s running for president Entertainment | Could Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u2018nuclear\u2019 child-abuse allegations destroy Brad Pitt?\n\nCould Angelina Jolie\u2019s \u2018nuclear\u2019 child-abuse allegations destroy Brad Pitt?
