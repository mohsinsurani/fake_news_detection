We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details that he wanted to avoid an awkward run-in with Beyonc\u00e9 at all costs.\n\nThere\u2019s a good reason that Kanye West, 40, skipped the celebrity wedding of the season when tennis great Serena Williams married Reddit founder Alexis Ohanian, 35 in a lavish New Orleans wedding on Nov. 16. While wife Kim Kardashian, 37, attended the big event, he knew that Serena\u2019s close pal Beyonce, 36, was going to be on hand and he didn\u2019t want an awkward confrontation. Especially after he dragged Bey and hubby JAY-Z, 47, so viciously during a Sacramento concert in Nov. of 2016. \u201cIt was no accident that Kanye chose to avoid Serena\u2019s wedding. Kanye is not particularly close with Serena, or her husband, who are more Kim\u2019s friends so Kanye opted out of what he felt may be an awkward evening for him. Kanye knew that Beyonc\u00e9, a close friend of Serena\u2019s, would likely be at the wedding which might make for an uncomfortable situation,\u201d a Yeezy insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cKanye still has a lot of unresolved issues with Beyonc\u00e9 and her husband. So, Kanye told Kim that he was going to sit this one out as to prevent causing a scene and risk stealing attention away from Serena\u2019s big day, which Kim agreed was the smart decision,\u201d our source continues. Yeezy hasn\u2019t come face to face with Bey or Jay since his epic concert rants against them and the worst place for that to happen would be at a joyous event like someone\u2019s wedding.

Beyonc\u00e9 also appeared to want to keep the attention on Serena and not any beef she or Jay might still have with Yeezy by leaving her husband at home as well. Kim and Beyonc\u00e9 have never been close, and so no one expected any fireworks with those two being in the same room. They were both seated in the front row for Serena\u2019s wedding, but were separated by Bey\u2019s former Destiny\u2019s Child bandmate Kelly Rowland, 36, and her husband Tim Weatherspoon. The night belonged to the tennis G.O.A.T.\u2019s fairytale wedding and not anyone else\u2019s drama.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it was wise of Kanye to skip a confrontation with Beyonc\u00e9 at Serena\u2019s wedding?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/tyler-baltierra-catelynn-lowell-ftr-21.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/the-weeknd-reportedly-never-stopped-loving-bella-hadid-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F11%2F17%2Fwhy-kanye-west-skipped-serena-williams-wedding-beyonce-feud%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2876327&comment_count=2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/california-mother-shot-5-times-while-saving-her-kids-from-gunman-gets-ignored-by-bystanders-after-pleading-for-help-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/629a3bdca6d1b82dbc92a7226593390f?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kanye-skipped-serenas-wedding-to-avoid-awkward-run-in-beyonce-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kanye-skipped-serenas-wedding-to-avoid-awkward-run-in-beyonce-ftr.jpg?w=620", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/kanye-skipped-serenas-wedding-to-avoid-awkward-run-in-beyonce-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/17/why-kanye-west-skipped-serena-williams-wedding-beyonce-feud/", "title": "Kanye West Skipped Serena Williams\u2019 Wedding To Avoid \u2018Awkward\u2019 Run In With Beyonce", "meta_data": {"description": "Kanye West skipped out on accompanying Kim Kardashian to Serena Williams' wedding to avoid and awkward confrontation with Beyonce.", "news_keywords": "Beyonce, Kanye West, Serena Williams", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kanye West Skipped Serena Williams\u2019 Wedding To Avoid \u2018Awkward\u2019 Run In With Beyonce", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171118215626/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/17/why-kanye-west-skipped-serena-williams-wedding-beyonce-feud/", "description": "While Kim Kardashian made it to Serena Williams\u2019 wedding, Kanye West was noticeably not her plus one.
