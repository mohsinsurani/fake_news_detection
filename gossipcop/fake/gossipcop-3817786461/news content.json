He just needs to rest for a few days and he should be good to go.\u201d\n\nSo what prompted the trip to the hospital? Apparently, Kim insisted because the couple\u2019s 2-year-old son Saint was hospitalized for pneumonia in January.\n\n\u201cKanye had been sick for a few days and didn\u2019t get better,\u201d the source explained. \u201cThey wanted to make sure that he didn\u2019t have something serious like pneumonia since they had that scare with Saint before.\u201d\n\nBack Grid\n\nThough he apparently wasn\u2019t feeling well, Kanye, 41, attended rapper Pusha T\u2019s wedding to longtime love Virginia Williams at the historic Cavalier Hotel in Virginia Beach on Saturday, joining A-list guests like Pharrell Williams, Fabolous, The Dream and Trey Songz.\n\nThe \u201cFlashing Lights\u201d rapper rocked a classic black tuxedo, Kim, 37, was right by his side, looking glamorous in a glittery gold minidress.\n\nLast month, Kanye released his eighth studio album, Ye. The album came months after he and Kim welcomed their third child, daughter Chicago.\n\nAdam Barnes Photography\n\nDaughter North, 5, has been helping her dad heal.\n\n\u201cI can still feel the love,\u201d Kim tweeted on Tuesday morning, sharing a photo of North giving Kanye a sweet kiss on the cheek.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kanye and Kim Kardashian West\u2019s 2-Year-Old Son Saint Hospitalized with Pneumonia\n\nNews of Saint\u2019s hospitalization, meanwhile, broke in January \u2014 nearly a month after his second birthday.\n\nThe tiny tot was hospitalized for three days due to the illness, and then recovered at home.\n\n\u201cMy precious baby boy is so strong!\u201d Kim wrote on Instagram. \u201cAfter spending three nights in the hospital & seeing my baby get multiple IV\u2019s and hooked up to oxygen machines, our end of year was challenging. Pneumonia is so scary.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just want to thank every nurse & doctor out there who works so hard around the clock,\u201d the KKW Beauty mogul continued. \u201cWe are so grateful for you all! He\u2019s home and all better. He\u2019s so resilient I\u2019m sure he will still say the ambulance ride was cool! My strong Saint \ud83d\udc7c\ud83c\udffd\u201d", "images":
