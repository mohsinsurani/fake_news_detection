But like Beyonce\u2019s still with Jay,\u201d she said.\n\nDave M. Benett/Getty\n\nPaltrow has had a very public friendship with Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY Z with both of their children growing up together.\n\nThe music-mogul couple has been part of Apple, 14, and 12-year-old Moses Martin\u2019s lives for a long time. The Goop creator even dedicated her 2016 cookbook, It\u2019s All Easy, to Bey and Jay\u2019s daughter Blue Ivy, now 6.\n\nPaltrow and her Coldplay frontman ex also were among the select few to attend Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY Z\u2019s low-key wedding in 2008.\n\nLeon Bennett/WireImage\n\nWhen Beyonc\u00e9 released \u201cSorry,\u201d she left all women named Becky cringing, and everyone else wondering who the mystery mistress she seemed to be referencing, could be.\n\nFollowing 2014\u2019s elevator-gate, when video surfaced of sister Solange Knowles attacking JAY Z as Beyonc\u00e9 stood and watched, reports circulated that the incident was related to JAY Z having a mistress, though the alleged \u201cBecky\u201d was never verified.\n\nAfter Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade HBO special, some fans accused designer Rachel Roy as being \u201cBecky,\u201d after she reportedly \u201cprovoked\u201d Solange in the infamous elevator incident. Roy later denied the \u201cBecky\u201d rumors, telling PEOPLE she respects \u201clove, marriages, families and strength.\u201d", "images":
