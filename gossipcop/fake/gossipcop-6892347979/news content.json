There will just be reputation.\u201d\n\nIt was a clever tease, given that \u201cReputation\u201d is the name of her new album set to drop on November 10.\n\nSince Tay has yet to give the low down on what it all means, we\u2019ll attempt to break it down for you:\n\nThe death of her rep\n\nThe singer gets right down to it, opening up her video with a tombstone that reads \u201cHere lies Taylor Swift\u2019s reputation\u201d before a zombie version of Swift climbs out of the grave.\n\nTaylor Swift - Look What You Made Me Do\n\nAnd how did her reputation die?\n\nThe viewers don\u2019t get a cause of death, so one is left to assume Swift is making a statement about all the bad press she\u2019s gotten in the last year or so with everything from her break up and spat with producer and DJ Calvin Harris, to her highly-publicized falling out with rapper Kanye West and his wife, Kim Kardashian.\n\nSwift and the couple have had competing narratives as to whether Swift signed off on West calling her a \u201cb***h\u201d in a song lyric.\n\nSome fans think Swift took a shot at West with the lyrics \u201cI don\u2019t like your little games, don\u2019t like your tilted stage/The role you made me play of the fool, no, I don\u2019t like you.\u201d The rapper\u2019s last concert tour featured a floating and tilted stage.\n\nThe moment at the end of the video when Swift said \u201cGetting receipts, gonna edit this later\u201d as she pointed her camera phone and mimicked the act of recording a video was interpreted by some fans as a swipe at Kim Kardashian, who was said to have \u201cbrought receipts\u201d to her husband\u2019s spat with the pop star.\n\nSaid \u201creceipts\u201d\u2013 an internet catchphrase used to call for proof or evidence \u2013 was a video of a phone conversation between the rapper and Swift, which Kardashian said proved the singer knew about the song lyric she later complained about. Swift shot back at the time that no where did the video show her approving being called a \u201cb***h.\u201d\n\nShading an old frenemy?\n\nThe internet also has some theories about a scene in which Swift dressed up to look like Katy Perry.\n\nOne fan tweeted a screen grab of the scene writing \u201c#TaylorSwift personates #KatyPerry holding a #Grammy because Taylor has plenty & Katy doesn\u2019t have one.\u201d\n\nThe two have had a long-standing feud and interestingly enough Perry was the host of the VMAs this year.\n\nRemember the Tay-shirt controversy?\n\nSwift gave a nod to last year\u2019s hoopla over then-boyfriend actor Tom Hiddleston, who wore a white \u201cI Heart T.S.\u201d tank while the pair frolicked with friends at the beach for Fourth of July weekend.\n\nShe cheekily had a group of male backup dancers wear crop tops with the same message, though in black, possibly to match the stilettos they rocked.\n\nAnd if you dig the look, you too can proclaim your love as it\u2019s part of the merch for sale on her site.\n\nTaylor Swift Is Selling the 'I Heart T.S.'

Why? Oh, cause she\u2019s dead.\u201d\n\nSwift mocks Swift\n\nThose old Taylors help Swift close out her music video as she uses them to parody some of the stinging comments that have been made about her over the years.\n\nThere\u2019s earnest, nerdy Swift from the \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d video who was scolded by zombie Swift saying, \u201cStop making that surprise face, it\u2019s so annoying.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t possibly be that surprised all the time,\u201d said ballerina Swift, who appeared in the \u201cShake It Off\u201d music video.\n\nThe just starting out, acoustic guitar version of Swift from her teen years was told to \u201cStop acting like you\u2019re so nice, you are so fake\u201d by circus ringleader Swift from the 2012 MTV European Music Awards.\n\nWhen baby Swift starts to cry, a nearby Swift says \u201cThere she goes playing the victim, again.\u201d\n\nThe video ends with the version of Swift who was famously interrupted by West during her acceptance speech at the 2009 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nWearing that same off the shoulder gown and clutching her VMA award, Swift utters her now infamous line \u201cI would very much like to be excluded from this narrative\u201d which was part of her official statement to the whole West-Kardashian kerfuffle, to which the rest of the Swifts respond with a resounding \u201cShut up!\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday, YouTube announced that \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d had the biggest debut of any video in its history with 43.2 million views in 24 hours.\n\nThe previous record holder was Psy\u2019s \u201cGentleman\u201d with 36 million views in the first 24 hours.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170828124008-01-taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?q=x_237,y_0,h_1421,w_2525,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929104601-lisa-france-profile-image.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/3tmd-ClpJxA/hqdefault.jpg", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170828124008-01-taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?q=x_237,y_0,h_1421,w_2525,c_crop/h_270,w_480"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170828124008-01-taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?q=x_237,y_0,h_1421,w_2525,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/entertainment/taylor-swift-new-music-video-guide/index.html", "title": "Taylor Swift\u2019s new music video: A guide to what it all means", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift's new music video: A guide to what it all means | CNN", "description": "Taylor Swift has used her latest video to throw some shade and let the world know she's heard everything people have been saying about her.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170828124008-01-taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?q=x_237,y_0,h_1421,w_2525,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/28/entertainment/taylor-swift-new-music-video-guide/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Taylor Swift's new music video: A guide to what it all means | CNN", "description": "Taylor Swift has used her latest video to throw some shade and let the world know she's heard everything people have been saying about her.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170828124008-01-taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?q=x_237,y_0,h_1421,w_2525,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Taylor Swift has used her latest video to throw some shade and let the world know she's heard everything people have been saying about her.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-28T14:41:11Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-29T17:02:05Z", "tag": "arts and entertainment, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, celebrities, media industry, music, music industry, music releases, taylor swift, kanye west, awards and prizes, entertainment and arts awards, music awards, kim kardashian, rap and hip-hop music", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "arts and entertainment, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, celebrities, media industry, music, music industry, music releases, taylor swift, kanye west, awards and prizes, entertainment and arts awards, music awards, kim kardashian, rap and hip-hop music", "author": "Lisa Respers France", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503874800.0, "source": "http://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
