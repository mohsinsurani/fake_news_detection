Rihanna is in Barbados this weekend for the Crop Over Festival, noticeably without boyfriend Hassan Jameel. HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned why she left her man behind.\n\nAll of Rihanna\u2018s favorite things are packed into this weekend. Her native country of Barbados, the Crop Over Festival, and dressing up in elaborate outfits. The only thing missing is new boyfriend Hassan Jameel. The ANTI-hitmaker, 29, \u201chasn\u2019t invited him because she doesn\u2019t want the pressure of having to look out for him and entertain him,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe just wants to let her hair down and relax with friends. Attending the Crop Over festival is extremely important to Rihanna, she\u2019s proud of her roots and loves to give back by bringing publicity to her homeland.\u201d\n\nThe girl is obviously fiercly independent. As much as she\u2019d love to have Hassan there, she doesn\u2019t need him in order to have fun. \u201cRihanna loves to party, and there is no better way to do it than on Kadooment Day. When she\u2019s in Barbados she\u2019s never hassled or bothered, everybody respects and loves her and allows her to do her thing. She gets to hang with family and friends, and she\u2019s allowed to just be herself\u2026instead of having to play Rihanna the superstar.\u201d\n\nTry as she may to keep her getaway low-key and casual, those words don\u2019t necessarily exist in the \u201cSex With Me\u201d singer\u2019s dictionary. Did you see the way she dressed up on Aug. 5?! Rihanna flew into her home country a few days before the major holiday and immediately had all eyes glued on her. Nobody could miss her in that feathered bikini with a killer headpiece! The pop star flaunted her sizzling body in jewels, gold chains, and a pair of wings like it was Halloween or something. Crop Over festival makes Coachella look like child\u2019s play.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think it\u2019s a bad sign that Rihanna didn\u2019t bring Hassan to the Barbados?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/t-i-gets-funky-flirty-with-strippers-in-nyc-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/07/kailyn-lowry-gives-birth-to-baby-3-fellow-teen-mom-stars-send-their-congrats-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/rihanna-sexiest-jeweled-crop-tops-ftr1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/maddox-sixteenth-birthday-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F08%2F05%2Fwhy-rihanna-crop-over-festival-without-hassan-jameel%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2727179", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/140c0e0fd0ad702646ff54aed53914eb?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/rihanna-sexiest-jeweled-crop-tops-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Radvan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170806061708/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/05/why-rihanna-crop-over-festival-without-hassan-jameel/", "title": "Rihanna At Crop Over Festival: Why She Decided To Leave Love Hassan Behind", "meta_data": {"description": "Party for one!
