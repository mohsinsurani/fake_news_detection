But fans can\u2019t help but wonder one thing since the big news got out: Is Ryan going to leave Live With Kelly and Ryan now?\n\nWhile everything seems quite peachy on the surface, things aren\u2019t going too well behind the scenes of the morning talk show. \u201cThe show is a wreck at the moment,\u201d an insider told Life & Style. \u201c[Kelly] feels stabbed in the back and believes she\u2019s going to lose Ryan just like she lost Michael [Strahan].\u201d Back in April 2016, Kelly\u2019s former co-host Michael abruptly decided to leave Live to join Good Morning America without even giving Kelly a heads up. She was devastated and even took a few days off from work to cope.\n\nMORE: Michael Strahan Reveals How He Really Feels About Ryan Seacrest as Kelly Ripa\u2019s New \u2018Live\u2019 Co-Host\n\nKelly is scared she\u2019s going to experience de\u0301ja\u0300 vu again with Ryan this time, however, according to multiple reports, Ryan will balance both of the gigs just fine. It\u2019s been said that he will host Idol in LA on Sunday nights and then quickly jet back to NYC to be there for Live With Kelly and Ryan for Monday through Friday. Although he\u2019s attended the nationwide auditions in the past, he won\u2019t be doing that for the revival to avoid conflicting with his Live With Kelly and Ryan role too much.\n\nBut, Kelly isn\u2019t too happy about his complex schedule. \u201cKelly is truly pissed that, after all the time ABC spent negotiating with Ryan for Live, they would then buy the show that made him a household name, and take him away,\u201d another source told Life & Style. \u201c[Kelly] really thought Live would be Ryan\u2019s focus.\u201d\n\nMORE: Kelly Ripa Is Faced With Low Ratings After Adding Ryan Seacrest as Her \u2018Live\u2019 Co-Host\n\nAnd while the back and forth may seem doable to Ryan now, he could potentially get tired of being so busy, especially since he feels he\u2019s not getting the most out of his Live With Kelly and Ryan experience. \u201cRyan thought the gig would very much be a joint co-hosting effort with Kelly. But he\u2019s come to learn that Live is really Kelly\u2019s show.\u201d The next few months should be very interesting!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ryan-seacrest-leaving-live-with-kelly.png?resize=588%2C436&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TITANIC_300x490_7_11r.gif?fit=300%2C490&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/ryan-seacrest-leaving-live-with-kelly.png?resize=588%2C436&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/is-ryan-seacrest-leaving-live-with-kelly-138275/", "title": "Is Ryan Seacrest Leaving Live With Kelly and Ryan?
