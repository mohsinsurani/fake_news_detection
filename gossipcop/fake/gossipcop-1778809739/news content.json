And I think it\u2019s important that in all couples, the mom gives the husband as much attention as the kids.\u201d\n\nAs Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s family blossoms (they are also the parents of daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2), so does their relationship. \u201cHe\u2019s taught me to have more of an opinion,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ve taught him to be a bit more calm or cautious. We\u2019re a good balance.\u201d\n\nAs Us Weekly exclusively revealed in July 2017, the couple hired a surrogate to carry Chicago because the reality star suffered from placenta accreta during her previous pregnancies.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a really tricky thing,\u201d she recalled of the process. \u201cWhat sex do you put in? I just said, \u2018Which one is the healthiest? Pick the healthiest one,\u2019 and that was a girl.\u201d\n\nBut Kardashian wasn\u2019t a momzilla with her gestational carrier. \u201cI straight-up told her, \u2018Look, I ate doughnuts every single day. If you want doughnuts and ice cream, go for it. Do whatever you feel. I\u2019m not going to be picky like that. That\u2019s just ridiculous,\u2019\u201d she told the publication.\n\nIn the end, the social media mogul knew she made the right decision. \u201cI hated being pregnant,\u201d she said. \u201cBut as much as I hated it, I still wished I could have done it on my own. The control is hard at the beginning. Once you let that go, it\u2019s the best experience. I would recommend surrogacy for anybody.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elm040118wlcoverstory002-wm_kim-kardashian-elle-magazine-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elm040118wlcoverstory002-wm_kim-kardashian-elle-magazine-zoom.jpg?crop=70px%2C0px%2C1930px%2C1090px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elm040118wlcoverstory002-wm_kim-kardashian-elle-magazine-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kim-kardashian-on-why-she-wont-have-more-than-four-kids/", "title": "Kim Kardashian on Why She Won\u2019t Have More Than Four Kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kim Kardashian opened up in a new interview about her children, her relationship with Kanye West and using a surrogate to carry their daughter Chicago \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian: Why I Won\u2019t Have More Than Four Children", "description": "Kim Kardashian opened up in a new interview about her children, her relationship with Kanye West and using a surrogate to carry their daughter Chicago \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kim-kardashian-on-why-she-wont-have-more-than-four-kids/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-08-21T17:21:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elm040118wlcoverstory002-wm_kim-kardashian-elle-magazine-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elm040118wlcoverstory002-wm_kim-kardashian-elle-magazine-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-13T13:58:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-21T17:21:45+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim Kardashian: Why I Won\u2019t Have More Than Four Children", "description": "Kim Kardashian opened up in a new interview about her children, her relationship with Kanye West and using a surrogate to carry their daughter Chicago \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/elm040118wlcoverstory002-wm_kim-kardashian-elle-magazine-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520949484.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
