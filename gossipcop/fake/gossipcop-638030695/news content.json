It\u2019s just that they think she\u2019s too straitlaced for him. And that\u2019s reflected in her look and style: \u201cThey joke that Katie needs a makeover!\u201d\n\nThe Oscar winner recently confided in his friends about his plans to marry Katie and start a family with her. \u201cThis is a dream come true for Katie. For years, she has wanted Jamie to be her husband and has wanted to give her daughter, Suri, a brother or sister \u2014 and now Jamie\u2019s ready to give that all to her,\u201d a second source previously shared of the couple, who\u2019ve attempted to hide their relationship for four years. \u201cNow she feels like all their time spent hiding was well worth it.\u201d\n\nSome fans are convinced that Katie is already carrying Jamie\u2019s child. While attending his launch party for Priv\u00e9 Revaux in NYC, the 39-year-old actress arrived separately \u2014 and a few guests thought they spotted a baby bump!
