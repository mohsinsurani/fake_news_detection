We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\n\n\u201cNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly. Whatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another. \u201d\n\nThe couple announced that they split at the end of the last year, however, they celebrated the New Year together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico alongside a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.\n\nThe two spent quite a bit of time apart in recent months raising questions. Theroux was often spotted in New York City away from their L.A. home. They have also had a busy year as Aniston signed on with Reese Witherspoon for a new Apple TV series and filmed Dumplin\u2019 in Atlanta, while Theroux, 46, filmed the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest.\n\nOn Saturday, Aniston made an appearance at Ellen DeGeneres\u2018 birthday party without Theroux. She was spotted standing outside the Hollywood venue chatting with Pharrell.\n\nThe next day, the actress rang in her 49th birthday without the actor. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering including pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday.\n\nTheroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. (Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends).\n\nSplash News Online\n\nSources recently told PEOPLE that their busy schedules worked for both of them and helped their marriage.\n\n\u201cJustin often spends a few days in NYC by himself,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE. \u201cWhen he is in NYC, Jen will catch up with friends and enjoys her own life. When Justin is in L.A., it\u2019s very special for them. They socialize together with friends. They often go out to dinner or have people over.\u201d\n\nAniston showed off the $21 million L.A. home they designed together in the March issue of Architectural Digest, saying, \u201cI look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there\u2019s nowhere else I want to be.\u201d\n\nAniston and Theroux first met on the Hawaii set of 2008\u2019s Tropic Thunder and began dating in 2011. They later married in a surprise and secret ceremony on August 5, 2015 \u2014 just a few days before Theroux\u2019s 44th birthday. A source close to the actress told PEOPLE at the time that the two were happy to have pulled off the surprise wedding, inviting friends to a backyard party under the ruse of celebrating Theroux\u2019s birthday.\n\n\u201cThey seemed ecstatic,\u201d the source said. \u201cThey celebrated late and barely slept, but they were in the best mood. They were giddy to have pulled off an amazing wedding celebration with their friends. And they were proud to finally be married.\u201d\n\nAniston was previously married to Brad Pitt from 2000 to 2005 after starting their relationship in 1998. She later dated Vince Vaughn and John Mayer after her divorce from Pitt.\n\nThis is Theroux\u2019s first marriage after previously dating hair stylist Heidi Bivens for 14 years before their breakup in 2011, shortly before he started dating Aniston. Theroux and Bivens shared an apartment in New York City before the split.", "images":
