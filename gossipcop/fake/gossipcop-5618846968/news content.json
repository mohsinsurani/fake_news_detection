However, days after Foxx was seen getting cozy with another woman, reports broke today that he and Holmes had actually been separated for months.\n\nHere, take a look back at all of the key moments in Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx's secretive courtship, from how they met to their secretive split.\n\n2004: Foxx works with Tom Cruise on Collateral.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBefore Cruise meets and marries Holmes, he works with Foxx on the movie Collateral.
