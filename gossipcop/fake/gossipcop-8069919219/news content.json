Nick Cannon hosted the show for eight seasons, but he quit after Season 12 (and was later replaced by Tyra Banks) after NBC threatened to fire him for ridiculing the network in his Showtime comedy special Stand Up, Don\u2019t Shoot. Speaking to Yahoo Entertainment a year after the scandal, Cannon says he has no regrets and calls the move \u201cprobably one of the best decisions\u201d of his career.\n\n\u201cIt was super-controversial for some time \u2026 but it was a freedom-of-speech process and me standing firm for my own beliefs and culturally who I am, and really for all the employees who have been thumb-pressed by their bosses,\u201d Cannon says, discussing the importance of adhering to his brand. \u201cI kind of stood up and said, \u2018Yo, I was threatened for some content that I created.\u2019 And they wanted me to shape up and get in line and watch my choice of words or how I speak about the network. \u2026 I was threatened to be fired. I told them, \u2018You can\u2019t fire a boss. I quit!\u2019\u201d\n\nAt the time, Cannon\u2019s choosing to walk away from a reported $4.5 million paycheck shocked his fans, and even people in his camp thought Cannon was making a mistake. \u201cPeople on my own team, people that were with me, man, like they scared for me,\u201d he says, chuckling. \u201cAnd I was like, \u2018Yo, that job doesn\u2019t define me.\u2019 \u2026 As an artist, that was a self-defining moment, because a lot of people was like, \u2018How can you walk away from such an amazing job? You\u2019re the No. 1 host on television, highest-paid,\u2019 all of that stuff. And I was like, \u2018None of that stuff matters to me. I\u2019m an artist, and it\u2019s not about money. It\u2019s about having my own self-worth.\u201d\n\nSince wrapping his final AGT season in 2016, Cannon certainly hasn\u2019t slowed down. He\u2019s been working on the 11th season of his comedy game show Wild \u2018N Out, studying in his \u201cspare time\u201d at Howard University, and, most important, releasing new music.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve probably made so much more money since walking away from [AGT] and doing it the way that I wanted to do it. I\u2019m almost like, \u2018Man, I should\u2019ve stepped away earlier,\u2019\u201d Cannon says. \u201cYou ever had those decisions where you\u2019re kind of in your comfort zone and so you kind of go about the mundane process, and as soon as you step out of your comfort zone it\u2019s all of this freedom and the universe starts to just throw so many things in your direction? That\u2019s what happened. I\u2019m elated with everything that I\u2019ve been doing since I stepped away from America\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\nFollow Lyndsey on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Google+, Amazon, Tumblr, Spotify", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190830/aol-logo.svg", "https://s.aolcdn.com/caas-assets-production/assets/v1/images/icons/happening-now-icon-white.svg", "https://s.aolcdn.com/aoldotcom-releases/lazyload/blank.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MNu3A5voFZoYHWFJhOHjHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b243e6b086a0e774def4c4adf62c95e6", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ddxJ3kLuN260nX_S6cxFBg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTU3MDtoPTgw/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d7f38f00-340b-11eb-b7bf-540525a865da", "https://s.aolcdn.com/caas-assets-production/assets/v1/images/icons/close.svg"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MNu3A5voFZoYHWFJhOHjHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b243e6b086a0e774def4c4adf62c95e6", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aol Staff", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/nick-cannon-quitting-americas-got-talent-one-best-decisions-ever-made-career-051757372.html", "title": "Nick Cannon on quitting 'America\u2019s Got Talent': 'One of the best decisions I ever made in my career'", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.aol.com"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@AOL", "dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "com.aol.mobile.aolapp"}, "name": {"googleplay": "Aol App"}, "url": {"googleplay": "https://www.aol.com/nick-cannon-quitting-americas-got-talent-one-best-decisions-ever-made-career-051757372.html"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@AOL", "domain": "www.aol.com", "description": "\"I'm almost like, \u2018Man, I should've stepped away earlier,\u2019\u201d Cannon says of his controversial career move.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MNu3A5voFZoYHWFJhOHjHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b243e6b086a0e774def4c4adf62c95e6", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MNu3A5voFZoYHWFJhOHjHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b243e6b086a0e774def4c4adf62c95e6"}, "title": "Nick Cannon on quitting 'America\u2019s Got Talent': 'One of the best decisions I ever made in my career'", "account_id": 66237835}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=646100661,app-argument=https://www.aol.com/nick-cannon-quitting-americas-got-talent-one-best-decisions-ever-made-career-051757372.html", "news_keywords": "Nick Cannon, America\u2019s Got Talent, Tyra Banks", "robots": "index,follow", "author": "AOL Staff", "google-site-verification": "ko2245Ra2QPRrivJQepBc3qAXmApiF8Wrb1nbWAP_jc", "msapplication-config": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/aolfp/metadata/browserconfig.xml?q=12347133", "msapplication-TileColor": "#39f", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/aolfp/metadata/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "AC51FE4BBA33843E8A3FC86F4B7024F2", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "category": "entertainment", "publish-date": "May 29, 2018", "description": "\"I'm almost like, \u2018Man, I should've stepped away earlier,\u2019\u201d Cannon says of his controversial career move.", "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Aol App", "package": "com.aol.mobile.aolapp", "url": "https://www.aol.com/nick-cannon-quitting-americas-got-talent-one-best-decisions-ever-made-career-051757372.html"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Aol App", "app_store_id": 646100661, "url": "https://www.aol.com/nick-cannon-quitting-americas-got-talent-one-best-decisions-ever-made-career-051757372.html"}}, "og": {"type": "website", "app_id": 183146218394780, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/MNu3A5voFZoYHWFJhOHjHQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xODAw/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/b243e6b086a0e774def4c4adf62c95e6", "description": "\"I'm almost like, \u2018Man, I should've stepped away earlier,\u2019\u201d Cannon says of his controversial career move.", "title": "Nick Cannon on quitting 'America\u2019s Got Talent': 'One of the best decisions I ever made in my career'", "url": "https://www.aol.com/entertainment/nick-cannon-quitting-americas-got-talent-one-best-decisions-ever-made-career-051757372.html"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527548400.0, "source": "http://www.aol.com", "summary": ""}
