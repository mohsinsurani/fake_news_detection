Apparently t's still awesome being semi-secretly with British boyfriend of over a year, Joe Alwyn. \u201cShe seems to be in a great place both career and love wise,\u201d a source told the outlet. Alwyn tries to attend her concert dates when he can, the source added. Footage of him there hasn't really been shared on social media, except for at the first show\u2014a testament to how undercover these two can keep things.\n\nAlwyn is really the best though, the source made abundantly clear: \u201cJoe is just an amazing boyfriend. He is very supportive. Taylor adores his family. She\u2019s in a very good place.\u201d\n\nSwift and Alwyn were last photographed out together on a North London pub date at the end of May. And that outing was rare itself: Swift has only been photographed out with Alwyn a couple times and has never spoken about him besides in her songs.\n\nLast August, a source told People that this whole keeping the relationship out of the press thing really works for her. \"Her decision to keep her relationship with Joe quiet is making her happy,\" the source said then. \"They have been getting to know each other slowly without any pressure.\u201d\n\nIn People's new report today, its source also mentioned that Swift \u201chas a few days off for July 4th\u201d but gave no indication whether she'd throw the usual Taymerica party for her celeb friends at her Rhode Island estate. She didn't last year, but the year before, it was truly a \"I Heart TS\" spectacle.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-arrive-at-zuma-on-october-06-news-photo-1665150988.jpg?crop=0.591xw:0.531xh;0.226xw,0.0403xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078833.jpg?crop=0.388xw:0.259xh;0.304xw,0.0578xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-attend-a-private-reception-as-news-photo-1664913566.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.146xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sarah-jessica-parker-and-kristin-davis-are-seen-on-the-set-news-photo-1664990757.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.751xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-on-september-04-news-photo-1665077679.jpg?crop=0.758xw:0.569xh;0.143xw,0.0276xh&resize=180:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-gettyimages-981939524-1530307501.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-charles-prince-of-wales-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-1665070899.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0817xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/te-le-chargement-1665080515.png?crop=0.505xw:1.00xh;0.162xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664981510.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.735xh;0,0.0444xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-princess-of-wales-smiles-during-her-visit-to-the-news-photo-1665066747.jpg?crop=0.655xw:0.444xh;0.175xw,0.0369xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rihanna-bgus-2478374-004-1664978615.jpg?crop=0.566xw:0.377xh;0.186xw,0.0331xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2019-elle-songassociation-ep93-lewiscapaldi-jp-cm-kk-v3-ap-v2-1575927996.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-gettyimages-981939524-1530307501.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leo-gigi-gettyimages-1662584674.jpg?crop=0.492xw:0.984xh;0.508xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-princess-of-wales-prince-william-prince-of-wales-news-photo-1665073240.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-gettyimages-981939524-1530307501.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/a22003873/taylor-swift-joe-alwyn-romance-in-great-place-fourth-of-july-report/", "title": "How Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's Private Romance Is Doing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "How Taylor Swift and Joe Alwyn's Private Romance Is Doing - Taylor Swift Fourth of July Plans", "description": "For those wondering how much Taylor Swift is still enjoying keeping her love life almost completely private, \u200bPeople\u200b \u200bhas an update.
