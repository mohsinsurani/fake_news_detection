A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com her reaction!\n\nSelena Gomez, 25, is seriously wishing Charlie Puth, 26, didn\u2019t divulge their former relationship. A source close to Selena EXCLUSIVELY gave us the deets about how Selena reacted to Charlie\u2019s confirmation that they dated. \u201cSelena wishes Charlie would have kept his mouth shut about what they had because she is definitely interested in keeping that kind of stuff and her dating life as much under wraps as possible,\u201d our source said. It\u2019s clear that when it comes to who she dates, Selena apparently is all about maintaining her privacy.\n\nAccording to our source, it\u2019s only a matter of time before Selena responds to Charlie\u2019s bombshell admission that they were briefly an item \u2014 and that Justin Bieber, 23, may have caused the two to go their separate ways. \u201cNow, she will definitely have to respond down the line, and it\u2019s just frustrating when people add their dirty laundry to a situation,\u201d our source added. \u201cShe\u2019s learned from the first time dating Justin and The Weeknd that less is more, which explains her relationship with Justin now being much more under the radar.\u201d We reported earlier how Selena and Justin put to rest rumors that they had split by reuniting at one of his hockey games. While they arrived separately, the two of them definitely left together.\n\nTime will tell if Charlie\u2019s big reveal will throw a wedge into Jelena\u2019s relationship, but all signs point to the two of them continuing to make it work in 2018. Click here to see pics of celebs, including Selena and Justin, who got back together in 2017.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think that Selena has every right to be upset with Charlie or do you believe he didn\u2019t do anything wrong?
