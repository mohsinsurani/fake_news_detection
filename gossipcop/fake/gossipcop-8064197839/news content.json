Pattinson\u2019s comments soon went viral, even eliciting praise from the animal rights group PETA, which thanked him for declining to participate.\n\nNow, the actor, 31, is trying to set the record straight. \u201cThe story I told on Jimmy Kimmel last night seems to have spiraled out of control,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cWhat didn\u2019t come across is that this was supposed to be a joke. No one at all expected or assumed that anything like that would happen on the Good Time set.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cWe are all huge animal lovers and would obviously never do anything to harm an animal. Everyone involved in Good Time are amazing professionals and have come together to make a movie that I\u2019m extremely proud of. I feel embarrassed that in the moment, I was trying to make Jimmy laugh, only to create confusion and a false impression.\u201d\n\nPattinson, 31, plays the role of Connie, a New Yorker who will go to all sorts of measures to save his brother and resorts to robbing banks. The actor revealed that his character also happens to have an affinity for dogs, putting Pattinson in a tricky situation on set.\n\n\u201cOh, God, I don\u2019t know if I can say this. There\u2019s a lot of things in this movie which really cross the line of reality. It\u2019s not even on the line, it\u2019s way beyond the line,\u201d Pattinson said on the talk show. \u201cThere was initially this scene \u2014 I don\u2019t think I should say this \u2014 but it\u2019s like, my character, Connie, has this affinity with dogs. He thinks he is a dog in a previous life and he thinks he has control over animals and stuff.\u201d\n\nA drug dealer then busts into the room where Pattinson\u2019s character is performing a sexual act on the dog.\n\nAurore Marechal/ABACA/INSTARimages.com\n\nThe Twilight star burst into laughter when recounting the scene to Jimmy Kimmel, saying that the \u201cdirector was like, \u2018Just do it for real, man! Don\u2019t be a p\u2013!\u2019 And then the dog\u2019s owner was like, \u2018Well, he\u2019s a breeder, I mean, you can.\u2019 He\u2019s like, \u2018You just gotta massage the inside of his thighs.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn the end they went with a more staged approach.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t agree to do the real one, so we made a fake red rocket,\u201d he revealed. \u201cIt was fun. It\u2019ll be on the DVD extras.\u201d\n\n\u201cWow, Hollywood is a great place folks. It really is. If you get a chance to send your kids to film school,\u201d Kimmel teased.\n\nThe indie drama received a six-minute standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, ET reported, and hits select theaters
