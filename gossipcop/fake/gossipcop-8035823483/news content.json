Grand Central Publishing is tentatively scheduled to release the Jenner book in the spring of 2017.\n\nRumors have swirled about a possible book deal for Ms. Jenner since last April, when she announced that she was becoming a woman during an interview with Diane Sawyer that drew nearly 17 million viewers.\n\nThe interview was followed by a Vanity Fair cover story, written by Mr. Bissinger, in which Ms. Jenner revealed her new identity as Caitlyn, and described her decades-long struggle with gender dysphoria. The flurry of publicity culminated in the premiere of a documentary series on E!, \u201cI Am Cait,\u201d which will begin its second season this March, about Ms. Jenner\u2019s new public life as a woman.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=404&w=772&s=58734df4cf77f0681b36fc6f5a50cdf8c0d1230c0dc22492faea4ced7d44ba5a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=404&w=772&s=58734df4cf77f0681b36fc6f5a50cdf8c0d1230c0dc22492faea4ced7d44ba5a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Alter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Publish a Memoir About Her Transformation", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Ms. Jenner will write the book, tentatively scheduled to be released in the spring of 2017, with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Publish a Memoir About Her Transformation (Published 2016)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=404&w=772&s=58734df4cf77f0681b36fc6f5a50cdf8c0d1230c0dc22492faea4ced7d44ba5a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Caitlyn Jenner will write a memoir with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger."}, "description": "Ms. Jenner will write the book, tentatively scheduled to be released in the spring of 2017, with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner to Publish a Memoir About Her Transformation (Published 2016)", "description": "Ms. Jenner will write the book, tentatively scheduled to be released in the spring of 2017, with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-articleLarge.jpg?year=2016&h=917&w=600&s=52cb32f98e71a2cfece3e24fb7aee7589bfa67e061fae7977935eb1a65ad40d3&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Caitlyn Jenner will write a memoir with the Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Buzz Bissinger."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/37719de1-5cc0-5a4c-9ad9-ef24fa3d3c1c"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-01-19T13:30:08.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-04-23T13:57:11.648Z", "section": "Books", "tag": "Grand Central Publishing", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000004151962, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/37719de1-5cc0-5a4c-9ad9-ef24fa3d3c1c", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/9722c9d132a04279bbd0890be72aa412", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2016/01/19/arts/20JENNERweb/20JENNERweb-facebookJumbo-v3.jpg?year=2016&h=404&w=772&s=58734df4cf77f0681b36fc6f5a50cdf8c0d1230c0dc22492faea4ced7d44ba5a&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Alexandra Alter", "news_keywords": "Caitlyn Jenner;Bruce Jenner,Books,,Transgender;Gender Fluid;Non-Binary,Grand Central Publishing", "pdate": 20160119, "CG": "books", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/37719de1-5cc0-5a4c-9ad9-ef24fa3d3c1c", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2016/01/20/books/caitlyn-jenner-to-publish-a-memoir-about-her-transformation.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1453248000.0, "source": "http://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
