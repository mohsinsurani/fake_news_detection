Janet Jackson is a mom to a one-year-old baby son, Eissa, and while he was with his father and her estranged ex-husband Wissam Al Mana on Saturday night at the Nobu hotel in Malibu, she reportedly called the police from to check on the welfare of her little boy.\n\n\u201cDeputies were there [and] called to the scene. They decided the child was okay and they left,\u201d a Malibu Lost Hill\u2019s Sheriff\u2019s Station spokesperson told People.\n\nEntertainment Tonight also spoke to Janet\u2019s brother Randy Jackson who revealed the pop star decided to call 9-1-1 after the nanny (who was helping Wissam babysit) called her worried about Wissam\u2019s aggressive behavior. \u201c[She was] terrified by his behavior and locked herself in a bathroom, so she could contact Janet,\u201d he told the news outlet.\n\nJanet and Wissam previously married in 2012 and split in April 2017, just three months after Eissa was born in January 2017. \u201cI just want to keep it real for you guys for a second \u2014 yes I separated from my husband. We are in court and the rest is in God\u2019s hands,\u201d Janet told her concerned fans at the time. It was subsequently reported that Janet felt like a \u201cprisoner\u201d in her own marriage. \u201cShe thought he had become too controlling during the pregnancy and she had already allowed him to dictate her appearance and even the way she performed at concerts,\u201d a source told Page Six.\n\nNow, Janet is allegedly dating her ex-boyfriend Jermaine Dupri, whom she previously dated from 2002 until 2009. \u201cJanet\u2019s taking it slowly, but yes, she and Jermaine are dating,\u201d an insider recently In Touch. \u201cShe\u2019s comfortable with him. They know everything about each other, and she\u2019s happier than ever.\u201d We\u2019re just glad Eissa is okay!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/janet-jackson-police-wissam-al-mana-baby-son.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/janet-jackson-police-wissam-al-mana-baby-son.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/janet-jackson-husband.jpg?fit=400%2C568&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C568", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/janet-jackson-police-wissam-al-mana-baby-son.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/janet-jackson-police-wissam-al-mana-baby-son-161133/", "title": "Janet Jackson Called Police on Ex Wissam Al Mana to Check Welfare of Their Baby Son", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "This divorce is getting ugly.
