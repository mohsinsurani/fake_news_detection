A short, sharp reminder that she can still be torn down at any moment. So it was at Glastonbury last weekend, when an audience member at Kanye West\u2019s set chose to wave an enormous flag printed with a still image from a sex tape showing Kardashian performing oral sex on her former partner Ray J. The tape was leaked in 2007 without Kardashian\u2019s consent.\n\nKardashian, who is four months pregnant, was present, so she got to witness the moment the photo was displayed to her husband and a huge crowd of his fans. Printed on the flag were the words \u201cGet Down, Girl, Get Head Get Down\u201d, a play on the lyrics from West\u2019s song Gold Digger. Luckily, a compassionate Twitter user immortalised the moment by posting a picture with a suitably disapproving caption:\n\nSomeone printed kim k giving ray j head on a flag and waved it about as Kanye performed at Glastonbury ahahahaha pic.twitter.com/QXrp1gedwL \u2014 Jacob (@JacobWTurner01) June 28, 2015\n\nMany online were quick to share their glee, describing the flag as \u201cthe BEST Glastonbury flag ever\u201d, \u201cflag of the day\u201d, \u201c#BESTEVER\u201d, \u201cgenius\u201d and \u201chilarious\u201d. The Lad Bible declared that it \u201cwins the internet\u201d. Just in case she hadn\u2019t noticed the flag itself during her husband\u2019s set, thoughtful users tweeted it into Kardashian\u2019s mentions to be sure the picture be waiting for her when she got home.\n\nThe precise intent behind the stunt isn\u2019t clear, though the idea that a man should be threatened or shamed by his partner\u2019s past sexual history is as old as it is misogynistic. The use of West\u2019s lyrics suggests it might have been intended to suggest that Kardashian is herself a gold digger, despite her own enormously successful media and business ventures. Is it possible that the flag waver was trying to make a point about sexism in West\u2019s lyrics? At a stretch, yes. Is it likely? No. And even if that were the case, the ends wouldn\u2019t justify the means, any more than they did when the person who threatened to leak naked photos of Emma Watson later claimed it was all in the name of a campaign against the internet site 4Chan. Thank goodness for these towering heroes of morality.\n\nRegardless of intent, the outcome was yet another very successful woman being reminded that no matter how high she climbs, she can always be torn down by a slut-shaming, misogynistic double standard. There are powerful echoes here of the blame and outrage directed at the victims of last year\u2019s nude celebrity photo hacks. These are women who we pressure to be hyper-sexualised when they are objects for public consumption, in magazines or films or on television. We love to squeal over their \u201cbarely there\u201d dress or \u201cplunging cleavage\u201d when they\u2019re walking the red carpet, packaged for an approving audience. But when they dare to take ownership of their own bodies, to have sexual agency, or even, heaven forbid, to enjoy sex for themselves, we are ready to scream shame and demand grovelling public apologies. What Kardashian was doing in that sex tape was private and consensual. The only piece of wrongdoing was the publication of the tape without her consent; one amplified by the flag bearer in revictimising her before a live audience.\n\nThough Kardashian is not the only A-lister to have suffered this publicising of her sexual past as a weapon against her, there are noticeable differences in the way she is treated. While there was an outpouring of sympathy and support for many of the photo hacking victims, it was noted at the time that there was a nasty streak of venom reserved particularly for Kardashian.\n\nThere was a classist undertone of sneering, as some suggested that she was \u201casking for it\u201d because she often chooses to share revealing photographs with her fans, or that as a reality star she doesn\u2019t really deserve to be treated as a celebrity. It is regularly suggested that she leaked the tape intentionally to find fame, though she has made it very clear this was not the case.\n\nIt was the same classist sexism that saw the Duchess of Cambridge, pregnant with Prince George, praised for her pregnancy style and svelte silhouette, while Kardashian, pregnant at the same time with baby North, faced nasty memes comparing her to a whale, and front-page stories about her \u201cgorging\u201d on fast food. While the Duchess topped Vanity Fair\u2019s \u201cbest-dressed pregnant celebrities\u201d list, Kardashian was described as \u201cbrash\u201d and \u201ctrashy\u201d.\n\nWe will praise women for being sexy, as long as it\u2019s the right kind of sexiness. As long as they\u2019re the right \u201ckind\u201d of woman. As long as they\u2019re not in control. As long as we can remind them of their place at any moment.\n\nThis wasn\u2019t \u201cbanter\u201d. This wasn\u2019t a hilarious stunt. This was the very public shaming of a pregnant woman in front of her husband and a crowd of strangers. And if that sounds positively medieval, then it should tell you something about our \u201cmodern\u201d attitudes towards women.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMtYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=768bd664192d0a5e458a14563422333e", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Kim+Kardashian%2CWomen%2CCelebrity%2CCatherine%2C+Princess+of+Wales%2CLife+and+style%2CFeminism%2CGlastonbury+2015%2CKanye+West%2CGlastonbury+festival"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMtYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=768bd664192d0a5e458a14563422333e", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west", "title": "The Kim Kardashian sex-tape flag at Glastonbury was a particularly nasty attack", "meta_data": {"description": "Social-network users were quick to express their glee at the banner featuring a still from a leaked video featuring Kanye West\u2019s wife \u2013 but to humiliate a pregnant woman this way is an extreme and ugly piece of victimisation", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMtYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=768bd664192d0a5e458a14563422333e", "height": 720}, "title": "The Kim Kardashian sex-tape flag at Glastonbury was a particularly nasty attack", "description": "Social-network users were quick to express their glee at the banner featuring a still from a leaked video featuring Kanye West\u2019s wife \u2013 but to humiliate a pregnant woman this way is an extreme and ugly piece of victimisation", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-bates", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-02-22T10:18:16.000Z", "section": "Life and style", "published_time": "2015-06-30T15:06:46.000Z", "tag": "Kim Kardashian,Women,Celebrity,Catherine, Princess of Wales,Life and style,Feminism,Glastonbury 2015,Kanye West,Glastonbury festival"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west", "iphone": "gnmguardian://lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2015/jun/30/kim-kardashian-sex-tape-flag-glastonbury-kanye-west?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/static/sys-images/Guardian/Pix/pictures/2015/6/30/1435673442393/1b22908c-b8ac-4fa7-b26c-1bf046efeaff-2060x1236.jpeg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctb3BpbmlvbnMtYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&s=7ce3bbe69ba0d15ef829bd9a134b5af2", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1435618800.0, "source": "http://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
