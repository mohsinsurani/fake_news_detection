Kim Kardashian wants to stop any type of rap war between hubby Kanye West and brother Rob\u2019s ex Blac Chyna. We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how she wants to avoid the drama.\n\nIf there\u2019s one person the Kardashian clan wants to stop from spilling their family secrets, it\u2019s Blac Chyna, 29. She\u2019s currently at war with her ex and baby daddy Rob Kardashian, 30, and has taken out a restraining order against him that has already led to dramatic claims of violence and suicide attempts. The last thing the family wants is more publicity towards this ugly feud, and Kim Kardashian, 36, wants to make sure her hubby Kanye West. 40, doesn\u2019t escalate matters by starting a rap war with Chyna. Especially since she\u2019s starting a new career as a hip hop artist.\n\n\u201cKim is a bit disturbed with Blac Chyna\u2019s recent legal action towards the family and she wants to avoid any talk or interaction with Chyna at all costs. She has already told Kanye time and time again not to rap about her in any future music to the point it would affect their relationship in a bad way if he crossed Kim on this request,\u201d a source close to the reality star tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t want any reference to Blac Chyna either positively or negatively in any of Kanye\u2019s music because that lives forever and she would rather have Chyna in the background and out of her family\u2019s life as much as possible moving forward,\u201d our insider adds.\u201d Chy has claimed in court papers that Rob was abusive to her and threatened suicide several times. Not to mention, she has 11-month-old daughter Dream by Rob and a child with Kylie Jenner\u2019s ex Tyga, 27, so she\u2019s totally intertwined with the Kardashian crew. See Chyna\u2019s court papers documenting her claims against the family, here.\n\nSo far Chyna has already spilled in court documents obtained by HollywoodLife.com, that she alleges that the Kardashian family was responsible for using their \u201cpower and influence over the E! network to kill the second season,\u201d of her reality TV show with Rob. She also claimed to have texts that said Rob was going to kill himself, multiple times and said he knocked her to the ground in front of her son by Tyga, four-year-old King Cairo. Yeah, she\u2019s not holding back anymore, so it would be wise for Kanye to keep out of this mess.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kanye will stay out of Chyna\u2019s beef with the Kardashians?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F10%2F18%2Fkim-kardashian-kanye-west-blac-chyna-diss-track-rob-lawsuit%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2833611", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/629a3bdca6d1b82dbc92a7226593390f?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/john-kelly-calls-frederica-wilson-wacky-theyre-insulting-you-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kim-kardashian-37-sexy-photos-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kim-kardashian-urging-kanye-west-not-to-drop-blac-chyna-diss-track-after-she-sues-rob-family-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kim-kardashian-urging-kanye-west-not-to-drop-blac-chyna-diss-track-after-she-sues-rob-family-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kenneka-jenkins-new-evidence-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/kim-kardashian-urging-kanye-west-not-to-drop-blac-chyna-diss-track-after-she-sues-rob-family-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/18/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-blac-chyna-diss-track-rob-lawsuit/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Urging Kanye West Not To Drop Blac Chyna Diss Track After She Sues Rob & Family", "meta_data": {"description": "Now that Blac Chyna is at legal war with the Kardashians, Kim is urging hubby Kanye West to stay out of the mess and not drop a diss track on her.", "news_keywords": "Blac Chyna, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian Urging Kanye West Not To Drop Blac Chyna Diss Track After She Sues Rob & Family", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171021135911/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/18/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-blac-chyna-diss-track-rob-lawsuit/", "description": "Uh oh!
