Even worse, she fears that she will somehow be blamed for his bad luck this season.\n\n\u201cKendall [Jenner] feels horrible about Blake [Griffin]\u2018s injury. Kendall fears she will somehow be blamed for his bad luck. She has heard about the Kardashian curse for years and thinks it is just ridiculous. She also understands how dedicated fans may look for anyway to make sense of a bad situation. But in the end, Kendall feels like any accusations towards her are simply unfair, misguided anger. Kendall loves watching Blake play and she knows how important basketball is in his life, so she is going to do everything she can to care, support and help him get back to his teammates ASAP,\u201d a source close to Kendall tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nAt this time, it\u2019s not clear how Blake\u2019s injury (which occurred during a game on Nov. 28) will affect the rest of his basketball season, but sources told ESPN that he could be out for two months! And that wouldn\u2019t be good for the Los Angeles Clippers, who have already endured a 9-game losing streak. Obviously, these things happen, but Kendall is afraid fans will blame her for Blake\u2019s recent bad luck. As we EXCLUSIVELY learned, fans are already blaming Kendall for the team\u2019s horrible season. \u201cThe Clippers are playing terrible and have lost nine in a row and the blame is going all around to every player in the organization,\u201d a source close to the team EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cSome of the teammates of Blake who are superstitious to it all believe that the Kardashian Curse is a real thing and has something to do with their woes even though Blake is laughing all that off and isn\u2019t taking that as the reason for their losing streak and bad play. It hasn\u2019t started a riff between teammates yet but the talk in the locker room has involved Kendall so it should be interesting moving forward how people continue to react to it all.\u201d\n\nWe don\u2019t think the \u201cKardashian curse\u201d is real, but we can see why Kendall\u2019s now afraid fans will also blame her for Blake\u2019s injury. Hopefully, she ignores the haters and just focuses on helping Blake return to the court as soon as possible!\n\nHollywoodLifers, is the \u201cKardashian cure\u201d to blame for Blake\u2019s injury?
