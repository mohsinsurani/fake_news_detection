I think when it\u2019s funny, it\u2019s funny,\u201d but added, \u201cSometimes it goes from funny to mean.\u201d\n\nSpicer, who was famously impersonated on SNL by Melissa McCarthy throughout his time as press secretary, noted, \u201cI think that there were parts of it that were funny, but there\u2019s a lot of it that was over the line. It wasn\u2019t funny. It was stupid, or silly, or malicious.\u201d He added, \u201cBut there were some skits on late-night television that I did crack up at. \u2026 You have to have a little bit of a thick skin if you\u2019re going to do this.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his sudden resignation announcement, Spicer explained that though Trump didn\u2019t want him to leave, the two eventually came to an agreement on what would be best for the administration.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s been very gracious throughout this process. He wanted to bring some new folks in to help rev up the communications operation,\u201d Spicer said of Trump, who hired new White House communications director and New York financier Anthony Scaramucci. As his first act on the job, Scaramucci announced that Sarah Huckabee Sanders \u2014 who had, up until now, acted as Spicer\u2019s deputy and filled in for him in recent weeks as he worked more behind the scenes \u2014 would be the new press secretary.\n\n\u201cAfter reflection, my decision was to recommend to the president that I give Anthony [Scaramucci] and Sarah [Huckabee Sanders] a clean slate to start from so that they can talk about the president\u2019s agenda and help move it forward,\u201d Spicer continued. \u201cHe, after some back and forth, understood that the offer that I was making was something that was in the best interest of this administration. I thanked him for the opportunity, and I\u2019m looking forward to watching Anthony and Sarah do a tremendous job.\u201d Spicer added, \u201cI\u2019m leaving it in capable hands.\u201d\n\nWatch the latest video at video.foxnews.com\n\nAccording to those close to the situation, Spicer\u2019s decision to resign comes after he reportedly objected to the hiring of Scaramucci, whom he considered unfit for the position.\n\nSpeaking with Hannity, however, Spicer said he didn\u2019t feel his role was being \u201cdiminished\u201d in any way. He explained that he wanted to give Scaramucci and Sanders \u201cthe opportunity to operate without me in the way. \u2026 I just thought it was in the best interest of our press organization to not have too many cooks in the kitchen.\u201d On Trump\u2019s reaction, Spicer said, \u201cHe\u2019s always thinking of others, and I assured him that I would be just fine. \u2026 He assured me that he would continue to be as supportive as he always has been.\u201d\n\n.@seanspicer on @POTUS\u2019 reaction to his resignation: \u201cHe assured me that he would continue to be as supportive as he always has been.\u201d pic.twitter.com/9gUQ1AhY2a \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) July 22, 2017\n\nDuring his explanations, Spicer mentioned the new team continuing \u201cthe president\u2019s agenda\u201d several times. He also commented on the state of the media and gave his opinions on Trump\u2019s war against \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think most people aren\u2019t really privy to how stories are developed and what stories make it to the front page or to mainstream media. \u2026 I think they\u2019d be shocked and disappointed to see the bias that exists,\u201d Spicer said, \u201cand how members of the media do their job, or don\u2019t do their job.\u201d He noted that reporters now have a \u201cclick-bait mentality.\u201d\n\n\u201cBy and large, we\u2019re seeing more and more where it\u2019s about the clip or the click,\u201d he added.\n\nAsked by Hannity whether he believes the American people are being served by the media, Spicer noted, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t paint it with a broad brush; I think some, yes \u2026 but in a lot of cases, the answer is no.\u201d\n\n.@seanspicer on media: The stories we hear from around the country aren\u2019t necessarily the stories being covered by those in Washington. pic.twitter.com/FUYwLGcvxw \u2014 Fox News (@FoxNews) July 22, 2017\n\nWhite House chief of staff Reince Priebus, who was interviewed later in the segment, echoed similar sentiments about media bias and agreed with Spicer on the \u201cover the top\u201d nature of being parodied on late-night TV and SNL.\n\n\u201cPerhaps they should give equal time to another opinion,\u201d said Priebus of the NBC sketch series, adding that Spicer\u2019s job requires thick skin. \u201cYou just don\u2019t care what some of this stuff says because you know it\u2019s garbage.\u201d\n\nSpicer\u2019s resignation ended an oft-maligned six-month tenure. He will remain in the position through August.\n\nIn a statement, Trump said of Spicer, \u201cI am grateful for Sean\u2019s work on behalf of the administration and the American people. I wish him continued success as he moves on to other opportunities. Just look at his great television ratings.\u201d\n\nScaramucci also weighed in, saying of Spicer, \u201cHe\u2019s a military serviceman, he\u2019s got a great family, and he\u2019s done a great job,\u201d adding that \u201cthis is a difficult situation to be in, and I applaud his efforts.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-816375396-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-816375396-h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-816375396-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Huff Meena Jang", "Lauren Huff", "Meena Jang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/sean-spicer-tells-hannity-snl-went-line-melissa-mccarthy-impressions-1023505/", "title": "Sean Spicer Says \u2018SNL\u2019 Went \u201cOver the Line\u201d in First Post-Resignation Interview on \u2018Hannity\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Spicer also commented on the current state of the media, saying many outlets are \"biased\" with a \"click-bait mentality.\"", "news_keywords": "saturday night live, Sean Hannity", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Meena Jang", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1023505, "title": "Sean Spicer Says 'SNL' Went \"Over the Line\" in First Post-Resignation Interview on 'Hannity'", "published_at": "2017-07-21 18:42:37", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-816375396-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Sean Hannity", "topics": "News", "body": "White House press secretary Sean Spicer spoke with Fox News' Sean Hannity\u00a0to discuss his decision to resign\u00a0Friday and his thoughts on\u00a0Saturday Night Live's lauded parodies of President Donald Trump's administration.\r\nIn an interview that aired Friday night on Hannity, Spicer admitted, \"I'm a prankster, I like a good joke.
