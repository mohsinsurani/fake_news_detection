coverage of him.\n\nShelton and Bauer have settled the lawsuit that the country singer and \u201cThe Voice\u201d coach filed against the publisher, according to court papers obtained by TheWrap.\n\nA stipulation for dismissal filed in federal court in California on Thursday notes that all parties have agreed to dismiss the suit with prejudice, meaning that it cannot be filed again later.\n\nAlso

responsible for its own costs and attorneys\u2019 fees.\n\nShelton filed suit against Bauer Publishing Company and Bauer Media Group in October 2015 over two articles that In Touch published, claiming that Shelton had cheated on his former wife, Miranda Lambert, and that he was heading to rehab after hitting \u201crock bottom.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlake Shelton has had enough,\u201d the lawsuit read.\n\nAlso Read: Blake Shelton Denies He Peed on a Mailbox in New Court Filing\n\nShelton\u2019s complaint noted that the singer was prepared to let the first story, that he cheated on Lambert go, but then the rehab story was published.\n\n\u201cMr. Shelton is not in rehab and has no plans to go to rehab, which Bauer would have known had it bothered to contact any of Mr. Shelton\u2019s representatives prior to publication of its misleading Rehab Story,\u201d the lawsuit read.\n\nAlleging libel per se and false light invasion of privacy, Shelton\u2019s lawsuit sought damages \u201cnot to be less than\u201d $2 million.\n\nPamela Chelin contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/BlakeShelton.jpg",
