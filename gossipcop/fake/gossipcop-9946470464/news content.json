Photo: Getty Images\n\nWelcome to You Know What I Heard, the Cut\u2019s weekly celebrity gossip column about the peregrinations of the rich and famous. Have gossip? Email me at allie.jones@nymag.com, send me a message on Twitter, or contact me on Signal (ask for the number).\n\nWhen Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux announced their breakup last Thursday evening, they did so with a joint statement issued by Aniston\u2019s longtime publicist, Stephen Huvane. It had Jen written all over it: The statement called out the malicious \u201cgossip industry\u201d and insisted that \u201cwhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative.\u201d\n\nSince Thursday, a lot has been printed about the split, and a lot of it seems to be coming from Theroux\u2019s friends. So who\u2019s really running this breakup?\n\nSources close to Theroux in New York have been telling \u201cPage Six\u201d that Theroux was \u201creally bored by [Aniston\u2019s] whole Hollywood crowd\u201d and that he \u201cinitiated\u201d the separation. Unfortunately for Aniston, Official Hollywood Bible People has more or less backed up those \u201cPage Six\u201d reports, citing sources who say that Theroux was done with the marriage and wanted to take the breakup public ASAP.\n\nIn one report, published Sunday, a source close to Aniston told People that \u201cJen didn\u2019t want to announce [the split] for as long as possible, because she wanted to avoid the media attention.\u201d But Theroux didn\u2019t play ball. Instead, he walked around getting photographed in New York throughout Aniston\u2019s birthday weekend, while Aniston celebrated at home with girlfriends in L.A. (We definitely noticed that last week.)\n\n\u201cJen hoped that Justin would be low-key on her birthday so people weren\u2019t wondering why he wasn\u2019t with her, but that\u2019s not Justin\u2019s style,\u201d People\u2019s source said. \u201cHe wanted to make the announcement so he can live his life.\u201d Theroux apparently flew to L.A. to talk to Aniston three days after her birthday (on Valentine\u2019s Day!), and Aniston agreed to release a statement the next day.\n\nSo: Theroux initiated the breakup and took it public before Aniston was ready because \u2026 why? What life does he want to live? The Sun reported this weekend that one source of contention in his marriage to Aniston was his desire to \u201cparty\u201d with the \u201cNew York art scene.\u201d Specifically, Sun sources claimed that Aniston was upset over Theroux\u2019s desire to hang out with 25-year-old photographer and \u201cart beauty\u201d Petra Collins.\n\nThe Sun tends to be more accurate when reporting on British stars (like Taylor Swift\u2019s boyfriends), so who knows where its reporters are getting this information, but Theroux and Collins do know each other. Collins shot Theroux for a spread in L\u2019uomo Vogue last year. The shoot took place at Paul\u2019s Baby Grand in Tribeca; you can see it on Collins\u2019s website.\n\nHypothetically, what would a Collins-Theroux romance mean for gossip? Collins isn\u2019t just an indie darling; she\u2019s also a collaborator and close friend of Selena Gomez. Gomez has publicly gushed, many times, about how much she loves Aniston. (They met a few years ago through their management.) Will Gomez have to pick a side?\n\nSelena Gomez and Jennifer Aniston.

Though they had a surprise wedding in the back yard of Aniston\u2019s Bel Air mansion in 2015, TMZ reported this weekend that the couple never filed for a marriage license, confidentially or otherwise, in L.A. County. And neither Aniston nor Theroux has hired a divorce lawyer.\n\nTheroux\u2019s friends may be talking to the tabloids, but Theroux himself is not ready to address the rumors: He backed out of a scheduled appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert tonight.\n\nSelena Gomez, meanwhile, is reportedly in Jamaica with Justin Bieber for Bieber\u2019s dad\u2019s wedding. Jeremy Bieber, 42, is marrying his \u201clongtime girlfriend\u201d Chelsey Rebelo, 29. Here\u2019s a photo of Gomez posing with some of Rebelo\u2019s friends and relatives:\n\nSo Gomez and Bieber are going strong, despite her family\u2019s disapproval. According to People, the on-again couple spent Valentine\u2019s Day with a visit to Hillsong and a makeout at the Montage in Beverly Hills.\n\nWe haven\u2019t heard much from Ben Affleck and his SNL-producer girlfriend Lindsay Shookus so far this year, but you\u2019ll be happy to know they are still together and still color-coordinating their outfits.\n\nBen Affleck and Lindsay Shookus.

News, the couple spent Valentine\u2019s Day house-hunting in L.A. \u201cThey visited two homes in the $8 million\u2013$10 million range with a broker who gave them tours,\u201d a source told the site. Those homes were in the tony neighborhood of Pacific Palisades, where Affleck\u2019s ex-wife Jennifer Garner lives with their three kids. The house tours were very romantic, apparently.\n\n\u201cWhile Ben and Lindsay were waiting for the first house to be opened, Ben grabbed Lindsay on the doorstep and pulled her in close for a hug,\u201d E!\u2019s source said. \u201cThey were swaying back and forth hugging and laughing. He kissed her on the forehead. He walked with his arm around her and put his hand on her lower back. They seemed very happy and close.\u201d\n\nShookus can\u2019t be planning to move to L.A. full-time, though, can she? Her daughter and ex-husband live in New York. And she has SNL. Currently, she\u2019s living in Affleck\u2019s $28,000-a-month rental on the Upper West Side.\n\nOne small blessing from this week:\n\nHere is a photo of Rooney Mara and her boyfriend Joaquin Phoenix going to a mall in Sherman Oaks.\n\nJoaquin Phoenix and Rooney Mara.

During the talk, she said she\u2019d like to use her character\u2019s skills to figure out \u201cwhat\u2019s going on with Karlie Kloss and Taylor Swift.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the God\u2019s honest truth,\u201d she added. \u201c[It\u2019s] keeping me up at night.\u201d\n\nLove or hate J.Law, she is a great gossip. Most celebrities pretend not to pay attention to the tabloids, but she regularly brings up feuds and rumors in public conversations. (See this appearance on Andy Cohen\u2019s Watch What Happens Live! or her interview with Kim Kardashian West on Jimmy Kimmel\u2019s show.) I, too, would love to know why Kloss and Swift broke up. This past weekend, Kloss attended the NBA All-Star Game with her boyfriend Josh Kushner. Before that, she was spotted hanging out with sworn-Swift-enemy Katy Perry. Swift has been hanging out with herself. Will J.Law\u2019s comment prompt Swift to make a statement?\n\nThanks so much for gossiping this week.
