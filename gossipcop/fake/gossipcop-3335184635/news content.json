A handful of tabloids claimed that Aniston is still getting over Theroux, but she wants to show him that she\u2019s doing much better since they broke up.\n\nThe speculations heightened after Theroux was spotted hanging out with Emma Stone in while serving as brand ambassadors for Louis Vuitton. Some tabloids reported that Theroux and Stone are an item, but rumor-debunking site Gossip Cop clarified that they are simply working professionals.\n\nPrior to the clarification, a tabloid said that Aniston got hurt over the thought that Theroux moved on from her very quickly.\n\n\u201cSo Jen decided the best revenge was to focus on herself. Jen\u2019s been feeling more and more insecure about looking older, and her split from Justin only made her feel worse\u2026 She knows she can\u2019t compete with 20- and 30-something women,\u201d the tabloid noted.\n\nThe same publication also said that Aniston consulted with professionals to help improve her physical appearance.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s already consulted with some of the most advanced and progressive anti-aging specialists in Hollywood. She started having anti-aging IV drips and diamond facials, which are setting her back $7000 each time. She\u2019s also doing Evian water baths twice a day \u2013 which is costing Jen around $70,000 per week,\u201d the tabloid claimed.\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop alleged that there is no truth to any of these rumors. Aniston is not getting a pricey makeover at the moment. And if she is, it has nothing to do with Theroux and their recent split.\n\nIn related news, Aniston also made headlines on Saturday after her former co-star, Courtney Cox, expressed her love for the 49-year-old actress. Cox has also supported Aniston through her split from Theroux.\n\nA source told E! News in February that among all of her female friends, Aniston has leaned on Cox the most following the fall out of her relationship.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Rich Fury", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/17/jennifer-aniston.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/16/daca.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/16/justin-trudeau-donald-melania-trump.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/17/mick-mulvaney-acting-cfpb-director.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/16/us-china-relations.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/15/google_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/17/ulchi-freedom-guardian.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2018/06/17/jennifer-aniston.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/16/rtx69d3m.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/06/15/tesla-solar.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/17/jennifer-aniston.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654/http://www.ibtimes.com/jennifer-aniston-didnt-spend-100k-makeover-months-after-justin-theroux-split-2691684", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Didn\u2019t Spend $100K On Makeover Months After Justin Theroux Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "jennifer aniston justin theroux split, jennifer aniston did not get $100k makeover, jennifer aniston hurt justin theroux emma stone dating rumors, justin theroux emma stone dating, jennifer aniston courtney cox friendship, jennifer aniston makeover rumors", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654/http://www.ibtimes.com/jennifer-aniston-didnt-spend-100k-makeover-months-after-justin-theroux-split-2691684", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Didn\u2019t Spend $100K On Makeover Months After Justin Theroux Split", "description": "Jennifer Aniston did not undergo an expensive makeover due to her ex Justin Theroux.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/17/jennifer-aniston.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "modified_time": "2018-06-17T05:19:20-04:00", "published_time": "2018-06-17T05:19:20-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Didn\u2019t Spend $100K On Makeover Months After Justin Theroux Split", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://www.ibtimes.com/jennifer-aniston-didnt-spend-100k-makeover-months-after-justin-theroux-split-2691684", "description": "Jennifer Aniston did not undergo an expensive makeover due to her ex Justin Theroux.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180617114654im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/06/17/jennifer-aniston.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "Jennifer Aniston did not undergo an expensive makeover due to her ex Justin Theroux."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529227160.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
