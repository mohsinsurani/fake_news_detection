And her supporters back home aren\u2019t too happy, either. \u201cFriends and family called to tell me, \u2018We really don\u2019t like it. We know it\u2019s not you \u2013 and that woman sounds horrible,\u2019\u201d Vergara told the Hollywood Reporter. Meanwhile, the identity of this vocal artist with the \u201chorrible\u201d voice remains a mystery - and 20th Century Fox Television did not return inquiring phone calls. Someone should just ask Manny who she is; haven\u2019t we learned by now there\u2019s nothing that kid doesn\u2019t know?
