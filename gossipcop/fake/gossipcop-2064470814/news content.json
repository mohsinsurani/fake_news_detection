It\u2019s Just That No One Cared.\u201d\n\nMy mind immediately went back to a year ago, when the HBO series \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d premiered. I remember the preponderance of reviews \u2014 written by male critics \u2014 dismissing the show as soapy melodrama dressed up as prestige TV. And I wanted to go back and remind myself of the ways these cultural arbiters, with their influential platforms, engaged with the show\u2019s portrayal of domestic violence.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBecause the way we talk about fiction can influence how we view these same types of stories in real life. How we talk about movies and TV shows says something about what we value as a society \u2014 and whose stories we believe.\n\nSo let\u2019s scroll back and refresh our memories. Among the many story threads in \u201cBig Little Lies,\u201d which is set amid a very white and very wealthy beachside community, is that of a glamorous woman (Nicole Kidman) married to an equally charming and attractive man (Alexander Skarsgard) who has a volatile, hair-trigger temper. He attacks her physically and mentally. Sometimes the violence involves sex. All of it happens in private, where their seemingly perfect marriage disintegrates, becoming increasingly dangerous as the season progresses.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nReviewing the show in the New York Times, Mike Hale listed the various characters and their traits, noting that Kidman plays \u201cthe abuse victim who\u2019s reluctant to leave her husband, a subplot that\u2019s more disturbing (than the others) but also strays into \u2018Fifty Shades\u2019 territory.\u201d He calls the storyline \u201cunoriginal.\u201d\n\nOr here\u2019s Robert Rorke, writing about the show for the New York Post: \u201cWe\u2019re subjected to scenes of S&M sex games \u2026 which feel like the Sunset magazine version of Kidman\u2019s other sex game movie, \u2018Eyes Wide Shut.\u2019\u201d\n\nWhat a strange and cavalier way to write about the narrative of a woman raped and beaten by her husband.\n\nSarah Seltzer is a feminist writer and critic and \u2014 frustrated by those \u201cFifty Shades\u201d/S&M references \u2014 told me, \u201cThat is just a profound misunderstanding of what\u2019s happening on screen. And I don\u2019t think many women viewers misunderstood what was going on. At all.\u201d\n\nI think that\u2019s right.\n\n\u201cShows that flirt with genre can be a vehicle for exploring serious issues,\u201d she said, \u201cand women viewers are very comfortable going back and forth between soap opera-y tropes and serious issues. How is that any different than the way \u2018The Sopranos\u2019 uses mob tropes as a vehicle to talk about American masculinity and existential despair?\u201d\n\nI think we need to ask ourselves why there are prominent critics who don\u2019t see domestic violence as a subject worthy of serious TV. When Hale tweeted out a link to his review, he noted that for him, watching the show \u201cwas like watching three Lifetime movies at once.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s an interesting thing to say. Because on some level it\u2019s true \u2014 Lifetime has been among the only consistent producers of TV movies willing to examine these stories. And maybe somewhere along the way we started believing that domestic abuse was tawdry fodder best suited for basic cable. What I want to know is, why aren\u2019t critics questioning that? Why aren\u2019t we all?\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen people think, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s just a Lifetime thing,\u2019 they\u2019re thinking that only women care about domestic violence,\u201d said Feminista Jones, a writer and activist. \u201cThey think it\u2019s distasteful and depressing and who really wants to deal with that? But let\u2019s get real, we\u2019ve been talking about this since \u2018The Burning Bed,\u2019 since \u2018The Color Purple,\u2019 since \u2018What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It.\u2019 We\u2019ve been talking about this, that\u2019s what frustrates me.\n\n\u201cBut as someone who looks at the cultural impact of TV and film,\u201d she said, \u201cwhat\u2019s promising for me is that it seems like this stuff is no longer avoidable. So if anybody tries to continue to pretend that these aren\u2019t the real and lived experiences of women, then they\u2019re going to find resistance.\u201d\n\nYou can count on one hand the number of studio films that address intimate partner violence. When you look at how underrepresented women \u2014 especially women of color \u2014 are in Hollywood decision-making roles, this isn\u2019t a surprise. \u201cWhose voices are we hearing?\u201d as Jones put it.\n\nWhen \u201cThe Burning Bed\u201d aired on NBC in 1984 it was a huge hit for the network. Seventy-five million viewers tuned in to watch that broadcast (it\u2019s one of the most-watched TV movies ever made), and there was a palpable shock in seeing Farrah Fawcett playing against her fizzy \u201cCharlie\u2019s Angels\u201d persona as a visibly battered wife who is ultimately pushed over the edge.\n\n\u201cThere were shelters that were flooded with calls after it aired and it was partially because of the incredible audience response,\u201d said Diane Shoos, who is an associate professor at Michigan Technological University.\n\nShoos also is the author of \u201cDomestic Violence in Hollywood Film: Gaslighting,\u201d which is a close read on movies such as 1991\u2019s \u201cSleeping With the Enemy\u201d starring Julia Roberts, 1995\u2019s \u201cDolores Claiborne\u201d starring Kathy Bates and 2002\u2019s \u201cEnough\u201d starring Jennifer Lopez.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cFilms about domestic violence rely very heavily on pretty standard Hollywood genres,\u201d she said. The suspense thriller, especially. \u201cIn order for these stories to even be produced in the first place, they have to rely on this formulaic approach where we absolutely anticipate there will be a confrontation between the victim and the abuser. So the work of the narrative is to completely isolate her and make it \u2014 ironically \u2014 totally her problem that she has to solve. In a strange way these movies are seen as empowering to women but they\u2019re not, because everything is put back on women\u2019s shoulders.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s astounding,\u201d said Shoos, \u201cis that the prototypical narrative is for the woman to kill the abuser. And as any kind of real-life solution, this is totally fantastical and in fact dangerous; women who confront their abusers typically are attacked and killed themselves.\u201d\n\nShoos also looks at the 1993 Tina Turner biopic \u201cWhat\u2019s Love Got to Do With It\u201d starring Angela Bassett and Laurence Fishburne. It\u2019s a film that stands out because of its Oscar nominations for Bassett and Fishburne, but also as a rare example of a star (Turner) allowing her story of abuse to be told on the big screen: Yes, this happened to me. It was brutal and terrifying and humiliating. And shame on every one of you who shrugged it off as celebrity gossip.\n\n\u201cI think that movie is really complex in terms of race and class,\u201d said Shoos. \u201cThere\u2019s a scene where Ike abuses Tina in a diner \u2014 the cake scene \u2014 and there\u2019s a white mother with her kids and they have this horrified look on their faces. One of the things that conveys is: These are black celebrities and there\u2019s a white spectator on screen going, \u2018Oh my God, look at what these black people are doing to each other.\u2019 As an audience, we should want to understand how this movie can run into these racist ideas \u2014 and we have to be attentive to the fact that this might allow people to dismiss the idea that domestic violence is in fact a larger societal problem because, \u2018Oh well, it\u2019s a black musician, he took drugs \u2014 what do we expect anyway?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe movie experienced some pushback from black moviegoers. That was also true, Jones said, for \u201cThe Color Purple.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe pushback from the black male community was ferocious. People lost their minds, they could not believe it. They hated the fact that their violence was being exposed by Hollywood. And they hated that Steven Spielberg \u2014 a white man \u2014 was the one who made it happen. And they hated \u2018What\u2019s Love Got to Do With It\u2019 for the same reason. There were black women who felt empowered by that movie, but some women were also were like, \u2018This is not something we should be talking about.\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLet\u2019s look at how the Tribune talked about it upon that movie\u2019s release. Here\u2019s Clifford Terry, reviewing it for the paper as a \u201cspirited but standard showbiz biopic, a funky updating of those pictures that Fox turned out in the '40s and '50s, although, if memory serves, Dan Dailey never slapped around Betty Grable. It is also a big-screen version of a wife-abuse Movie of the Week.\u201d\n\nThat was written 25 years ago. And yet it\u2019s not all that different from the casually flippant language used just a year ago in those reviews of \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d What is really going on when men have so much trouble centering abused women in these stories?\n\nLongtime MTV correspondent Kurt Loder is the co-author of Turner\u2019s autobiography \u201cI, Tina,\u201d on which the movie is based. Concerned about the legacy of Ike Turner\u2019s musical contributions, Loder told The Hollywood Reporter that \u201cthe story about Ike abusing Tina reduced him to nothing more than a wife-beater in the public\u2019s estimation.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s what that says to me: The abuse happened, but how important is it really? I feel like we\u2019ve been hearing some version of this argument one way or another lately. If you were the one abused, I\u2019d imagine it matters quite a bit, actually.\n\nAt Ike Turner\u2019s funeral in 2007, music producer Phil Spector disputed \u201cthe things they said about Ike that were in that piece of trash movie they made about him.\u201d Spector himself was out on bail at the time, awaiting trial for the murder in his home of actress Lana Clarkson; she was killed by a gunshot to the mouth. Spector was ultimately convicted.\n\nThat women die at the hands of the men in their lives isn\u2019t something movies or television really want to explore. Too ugly for a mass audience? Too real? Four years ago, Jones created an awareness campaign called \u201cYou OK, Sis?\u201d as a bystander intervention tool for people to assist women of color experiencing street harassment. The campaign eventually grew to cover domestic violence as well.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI think we\u2019ve been able to use this to highlight the number of black women and black trans women who are being killed by their partners,\u201d Jones said. \u201cThere is this misunderstanding of how fatal domestic abuse is for black women, so whenever there\u2019s a news story, we use the hashtag #YouOKSis? to say, \u2018See? We\u2019ve been telling you this is happening.\u2019\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s how Shoos put it: \u201cWhen you have a social problem like domestic violence, which is behind closed doors, what\u2019s in these movies matters incredibly. The public conversation is still uncomfortable. Or just one that\u2019s not as likely to happen. So what the screen is telling us is really important. It\u2019s going to be a primary factor in forming our opinions.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s what is so eerie about \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d \u2014 why those aforementioned reviews of the show are tied (in my mind at least) to some of the conversations about Porter.\n\nThe president, we\u2019ve learned, was privately shocked to hear that his aide \u2014 \u201cthis clean-cut Harvard guy with the perfectly parted hair\u201d \u2014 was capable of emotionally and physically abusing his two ex-wives.\n\nClean-cut Harvard guy with the perfectly parted hair.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely the archetype Skarsgard plays on \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe suit, the career, the haircut, all of it confers legitimacy and trustworthiness. But he is a monster when alone with his wife. \u201cThe whole show,\u201d Seltzer said, \u201cis playing on that theme of appearance vs. reality.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s OK to not like \u201cBig Little Lies.\u201d It\u2019s fine if it isn\u2019t to your taste. You can make valid critiques about so much of it. That\u2019s a critic\u2019s job.\n\nBut this show was telling us something about ourselves.\n\nAnd those reviews I can\u2019t shake? They were telling on us:\n\n\u201cRob Porter\u2019s History of Domestic Abuse Wasn\u2019t a Secret. It\u2019s Just That No One Cared.\u201d\n\nWell. Yes. Those reviews said as much.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nnmetz@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @Nina_Metz\n\n[ 'What's Love Got to Do With It' review: Pain and triumph mark Tina Turner story ]\n\n[ When make-believe becomes all too real, what are movie audiences to make of those scenes? ]\n\n[ It's time Hollywood's male stars use their power to level playing field ]", "images": ["https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/GEg3tvWFpZ5ZqQ973BlfLkwKnII=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(1077x341:1087x351)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/Y2Q2EO75LNHUDALIJ7E5J763GA.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/-aMg3cEwJRHlejiViqwrYhtkgdU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VNM7VDOQJJAIBMTHNYNP4AWNGM.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/yR9dobXSWmhty8GvM6yEhQSuFQI=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/7WFEQGBJ4JDYVJV4S7LQZOFFWA.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/i2IrMOjBIgl4W7UwkwWWloEVR20=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/www.trbimg.com/img-5a839f59/turbine/ct-1518575445-qs1184mqer-snap-image", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/pf/resources/icons/Menu_Icon.svg?d=87", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/WsKl6CA3t17zMpgHI9jKTfJeYVA=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/5SMGIXN5MNF5DDFJA5COD5B5WE.jpg", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/tronc/1657752787005.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/-aMg3cEwJRHlejiViqwrYhtkgdU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VNM7VDOQJJAIBMTHNYNP4AWNGM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-mov-how-we-talk-about-domestic-violence-movies-0216-story.html", "title": "When women are abused on screen \u2014 and how that shapes opinions about whose stories we believe in real life", "meta_data": {"language": "English (United States), en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "content-id": "F3EILVHMJBCEBA67QEN3DQUX4U", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkidF3EILVHMJBCEBA67QEN3DQUX4U", "description": "How we talk about movie and TV shows that portray domestic violence says something about what we value as a society \u2014 and whose stories we believe.", "twitter": {"description": "How we talk about movie and TV shows that portray domestic violence says something about what we value as a society \u2014 and whose stories we believe.", "title": "When women are abused on screen \u2014 and how that shapes opinions about whose stories we believe in real life", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/-aMg3cEwJRHlejiViqwrYhtkgdU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VNM7VDOQJJAIBMTHNYNP4AWNGM.jpg", "site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "How we talk about movie and TV shows that portray domestic violence says something about what we value as a society \u2014 and whose stories we believe.", "title": "When women are abused on screen \u2014 and how that shapes opinions about whose stories we believe in real life", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/-aMg3cEwJRHlejiViqwrYhtkgdU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/VNM7VDOQJJAIBMTHNYNP4AWNGM.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Tribune", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-mov-how-we-talk-about-domestic-violence-movies-0216-story.html", "locale": "en_US"}, "keywords": "Big Little Lies,domestic violence,domestic abuse,What's Love Got to Do With It,The Burning Bed", "robots": "noarchive", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "googlebot-news": "index", "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2022, Chicago Tribune", "fb": {"page_id": "5953023255,104061989632161,330360537007411,264870045299,73734231949,53310156364,40762490776,60569705796,121922684499844,182379588445160,62915602634,1987930441432108,119608021389933,745745225518281", "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/chicagotribune", "app_id": 306836229411287, "admins": 100000786395051}, "fb_title": "When women are abused on screen \u2014 and how that shapes opinions about whose stories we believe in real life", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "article": {"publisher": "Chicago Tribune", "tag": "Nicole Kidman,HBO,21st Century Fox,Jennifer Lopez,Julia Roberts,Steven Spielberg", "content_tier": "locked"}, "google": "nositelinkssearchbox"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.chicagotribune.com", "summary": ""}
