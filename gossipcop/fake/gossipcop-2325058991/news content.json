On Saturday, Woods retweeted a tweet that criticized the age gap between the two characters, to which Hammer responded: \u201cDidn\u2019t you date a 19-year-old when you were 60\u2026\u2026.?\u201d\n\nDidn't you date a 19 year old when you were 60\u2026\u2026.? \u2014 Armie Hammer (@armiehammer) September 11, 2017\n\nWoods was 59 when he reportedly started dating 19-year-old girlfriend Ashley Madison. They split after more than six years of dating; in 2013, the 66-year-old Woods began dating 20-year-old Kristen Bauguess.\n\nCall Me By Your Name debuted earlier this year to glowing reviews at the Sundance Film Festival and will hit theaters Nov. 24.\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of another movie where two men are so openly and honestly with each other,\u201d Hammer told EW earlier this summer. \u201cWe made a movie that\u2019s so tender and enjoyable, it can bridge gaps.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/plugins/vip-do-not-include-on-wpcom/vip-powered-wpcom/images/vip-powered-light-small.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/it-16807r.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cmbyn_s.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/the-current-war.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/04/41_t3d-15636.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/50-shades.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/it-18787r2.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/clueless.jpg?crop=219px%2C353px%2C1462px%2C978px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-11-at-10-42-56-am1.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/superman.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/it-16887r1.jpg?crop=5px%2C0px%2C2690px%2C1799.7380952381px&resize=420%2C281", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cmbyn_s.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devan Coggan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114/http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/11/armie-hammer-james-woods-call-me-by-your-name/", "title": "Armie Hammer slams James Woods after homophobic tweet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1143086910", "description": "'Didn\u2019t you date a 19-year-old when you were 60.......?'", "keywords": "Armie Hammer, James Woods, Armie Hammer James Woods tweet, James Woods homophobic tweet,", "news_keywords": "Armie Hammer, James Woods, Armie Hammer James Woods tweet, James Woods homophobic tweet,", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Armie Hammer Disses James Woods for Denouncing Gay Romance 'Call Me By Your Name'", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114/http://ew.com/movies/2017/09/11/armie-hammer-james-woods-call-me-by-your-name/", "description": "Armie Hammer is firing back after actor James Woods claimed Hammer\u2019s critically acclaimed gay romance film Call Me By Your Name \u201cchips away the last barriers of decency.\u201d Based on\u2026", "site_name": "EW.com", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170911220114im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cmbyn_s.jpg", "secure_url": "https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/cmbyn_s.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-11T18:36:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-11T18:36:14+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WordPresscom"}, "fb": {"pages": 52150999700}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "creator": "@ew"}, "application-name": "EW.com", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://ew.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/782bdf163168ca78e52d32d27b830793?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505084400.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
