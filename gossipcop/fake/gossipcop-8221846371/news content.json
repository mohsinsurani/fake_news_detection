She just debuted mid-length brown locks, that resemble her BF Scott Disick\u2019s ex! But, it turns out, that was her plan all along\u2026\n\nSofia Richie, 19, has a new do\u2019 and it wasn\u2019t a spur of the moment decision. The model\u2019s new, long brown locks were modeled off of her boyfriend, Scott Disick\u2018s ex, Kourtney Kardashian, 38, HollywoodLife.com has learned. \u201cSofia is purposely transforming herself into a Kourtney Kardashian clone because she knows it\u2019s a huge turn on for Scott,\u201d a source close to Sofia tells us. \u201cHe has a type and Sofia is morphing into that for him, and it just so happens to be a lot like Kourtney.\u201d As for how Scott feels? \u2014 \u201cHe\u2019s playing a big part in this too,\u201d the insider admits, adding \u201cHe\u2019s very controlling with her and even tells her what clothes to wear and how to style her hair.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Scott has had a tough time getting over his ex of over a decade. The pair also share three children together \u2014 Mason, 8, Penelope, 5, and Reign, 3 \u2014 which requires them to see a lot of one another. He\u2019s even openly admitted on Keeping Up With The Kardashians that he\u2019s had trouble finding someone after his split with Kourt. He had a brief fling with actress, Bella Thorne, 20, which ended after the two spent some time together at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2017. And, that\u2019s when he linked up with Sofia; They too met at Cannes.\n\nSofia and Scott, who have a 15-year age difference, have only been dating for a few months. The duo first sparked romance rumors at the Cannes Film Festival in May, and, they\u2019ve been inseparable ever since. So far, they\u2019ve vacationed in Miami, Puerto Vallarta, Los Cabos, Milan and Venice, Italy, and most recently Aspen, since going public with their relationship. The two have put on multiple PDA episodes, despite Sofia\u2019s attempt at shutting down the relationship buzz back in May, calling the pair \u201chomies.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Kourtney Kardashian is living her best life with boyfriend, Younes Bendjima, 24. They\u2019ve been dating since late 2016, when she met him on the same night of Kim Kardashian\u2018s Paris robbery on October 3, 2016. Kourt and Younes have vacationed all over, including Mexico and France. In January 2018, Kourt finally opened up about her relationship, which she takes very seriously, during the latest season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Sofia and Kourtney look alike?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/hope-hicks-ftr-1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kourtney-kardashian-sofia-richie-look-alike-embed1.jpg?w=620&h=700", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kourtney-kardashian-sofia-richie-look-alike-ftr1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/suri-cruise-reportedly-desperate-to-see-father-tom-after-nearly-5-years-apart-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kourtney-kardashian-sofia-richie-look-alike-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F26%2Fsofia-richie-brown-hair-photos-transforming-kourtney-kardashian-relationship-scott-disick%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2965601&comment_count=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/carmelo-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c9673a64e776066d542c0bc87ddf3530?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kourtney-kardashian-sofia-richie-look-alike-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Entertainment", "News Writer Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126230316/http://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/26/sofia-richie-brown-hair-photos-transforming-kourtney-kardashian-relationship-scott-disick/", "title": "Sofia Richie Purposely Transforming Into Kourtney Kardashian For Scott Disick: It\u2019s A \u2018Huge Turn-On\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Sofia Richie debuts new brown locks that look a lot like Kourtney Kardashian's.
