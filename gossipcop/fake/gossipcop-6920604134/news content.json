The location of a park across the road provided paps with the ideal location to snap Jen as she came and went from her home. This also irked the neighbours, adding more tension to the drama.\n\n\"...What really pissed off the neighbours was just the constant commotion outside their door all the time with the photographers. It made for an awkward living situation for Jen and Justin because they knew the neighbours weren't happy.\"\n\nThen, it gets weird, with a tidbit known as 'the bologna incident'. Apparently, Justin came downstairs one day to find that his motorcycle had been covered in slices of bologna (Italian sausage to you and I), and Jen was convinced that the neighbours had done it. It almost seems too farfetched to be untrue, to be honest, but we'll let you make your own mind up.\n\nDespite their differences, the couple really wanted it to work. The source concluded,\n\n\"She just never really could get settled in, she wasn't happy [in New York]. They really were a great couple. And they cared a lot about each other. Justin was always really protective of her. They both wanted this to work.\"\n\nHere's a look back on their relationship...\n\nTheir meeting\n\nAfter her five-year marriage ended to Brad Pitt in 2005, Jennifer Aniston became the poster girl for single women everywhere.\n\nShe dated several high profile celebrities including Vince Vaughn, Paul Sculfor, John Mayer and Bradley Cooper and finally found love again falling for Justin Theroux.\n\nThe pair met in 2007 on the set of Tropic Thunder, which Justin co-wrote with Jen's close friend, Ben Stiller. Nothing happened for three years although she admitted even then he had made an impression on her.\n\nShe told Popsugar: \"I thought he was very sweet and he was always very nice.\"\n\n\"But I remember thinking he was very dark. At first, you think he could be like a serial killer, but he is actually the nicest person in the world.\"\n\nSecond chance\n\nThe pair got a second shot at romance when they were filming Wanderlust in 2010 together. Justin was still dating stylist Heidi Bivens but the pair became good friends.\n\nThey were spotted together in May 2011 before they took their relationship public in June at the MTV Movie Awards afterparty.\n\nJustin was the first person Jennifer had dated seriously since John Mayer in 2009.\n\nThe proposal\n\nJennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux got engaged during a romantic break to Rome.\n\nA rep for Theroux revealed that the screenwriter and actor popped the question to the Friends star on his 41st birthday.\n\nSpeaking to People, his publicist said: \"Justin Theroux had an amazing birthday on Friday, receiving an extraordinary gift when his girlfriend, Jennifer Aniston, accepted his proposal of marriage.\"\n\nSpeaking about the interest in his new fiancee's love life, Justin said: \"I understand the curiosity [about me and Jen], but other than saying I am happy, I am not going to indulge it.\"", "images": ["http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-header.b4cc6108dd2e242eb0e486e2c46c586c606e48ac.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633c13b2e878d221f9f5ff31/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6272579903acd3413b93f92c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e34501b1fdc56bb5ad/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/justin-theroux-gl-16feb18_getty_b.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6319b0af354bcad4dc703e96/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/63219f6d0b7ff79534dc73b7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/63341139084dd6d288f59f2e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e0e2e190b1f7b27565/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Matt-LeBlanc-and-Matthew-Perry-_glamour_12aug15_rex_b.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e11145ea59e77e772e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brad-pitt-jen-an_glamour_2mar17_gettyimages_sq.jpg", "http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.3f0191bfffefe68806346fb250bf5976c111a9de.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e34c8f4b78b7c63e47/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-anniston-and-justin_glamour_6apr17_gettyimages_p.jpg", "http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.b4cc6108dd2e242eb0e486e2c46c586c606e48ac.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633eb1ea5754f406be4d42b4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633d56ee11a32370a8bb3b19/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e35ebdbf876576c216/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brad-pitt-and-jennifer-aniston-gl-16feb18_getty_b.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e11145ea59e77e772e/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/brad-pitt-jen-an_glamour_2mar17_gettyimages_sq.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e254a5dc97887e94d1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-aniston-justin-glamour-9aug16-rex-b.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138b1e11145ea59e77e772e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brad-pitt-jen-an_glamour_2mar17_gettyimages_sq.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Samantha Mcmeekin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-engaged", "title": "Jennifer Aniston denies Brad Pitt rumours following her split with Justin Theroux", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Justin Theroux and Jennifer Aniston are getting a divorce after two and a half years of marriage.
