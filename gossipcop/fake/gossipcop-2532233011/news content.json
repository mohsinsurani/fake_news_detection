Four weeks after welcoming their first child together, the rapper surprised Jenner with enough flowers to fill a cruise ship.\n\nThe mom of daughter Stormi shared a photo of the extravagant arrangement in a Thursday, March 1, Snapchat video. She captioned the clip: \u201cOk baby daddy.\u201d\n\nScott, 25, knows his way around a flower shop. Last month he sent the 20-year-old Life of Kylie star 443 white-stem roses that she showed off on social media. In her post, Jenner revealed the adorable reason he selected that exact number. Stormi was born at 4:43 p.m. on February 1.\n\nBut Scott doesn\u2019t just do gifts that need water to survive. He gifted his girlfriend of 11 months a black Ferrari as a push present. The custom vehicle \u2014 reportedly worth $1.4 million \u2014 features red interior and butterfly doors.\n\nThe Lip Kit creator has maintained a low profile since Stormi came on to the scene, preferring to stay at home with her newborn. A source previously told Us Weekly that Jenner is \u201cvery involved and hands-on\u201d with Stormi and \u201cshe\u2019s never seemed happier.\u201d\n\nJenner shocked the world on February 4 when she finally confirmed her pregnancy after months of speculation and revealed that she had given birth. \u201cI\u2019m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions,\u201d she tweeted, revealing she had given birth on the first of the month. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt happiness like this. I could burst! Than you for understanding.\u201d\n\nScott told TMZ on February 17 that his little one is \u201cbeautiful.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/travis-scott-kylie-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1876px%2C986px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/travis-scott-kylie-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C15px%2C1876px%2C1060px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/travis-scott-kylie-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1876px%2C986px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-receives-flowers-from-baby-daddy-travis-scott/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Receives Flowers From \u2018Baby Daddy\u2019 Travis Scott", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kylie Jenner showed off flowers she received from \u2018baby daddy\u2019 Travis Scott on Thursday, March 1 \u2014 see the picture", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "See Kylie Jenner\u2019s Extravagant Gift From \u2018Baby Daddy\u2019 Travis Scott", "description": "Kylie Jenner showed off flowers she received from \u2018baby daddy\u2019 Travis Scott on Thursday, March 1 \u2014 see the picture", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-receives-flowers-from-baby-daddy-travis-scott/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-15T12:47:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/travis-scott-kylie-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1876px%2C986px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/travis-scott-kylie-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1876px%2C986px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-01T18:37:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-15T12:47:55+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "See Kylie Jenner\u2019s Extravagant Gift From \u2018Baby Daddy\u2019 Travis Scott", "description": "Kylie Jenner showed off flowers she received from \u2018baby daddy\u2019 Travis Scott on Thursday, March 1 \u2014 see the picture", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/travis-scott-kylie-jenner.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1876px%2C986px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@rachelpaula", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519929459.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
