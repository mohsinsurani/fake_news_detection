Endometriosis is an often-painful condition in which uterine tissue grows outside the uterus.\n\n\u201cMy doctor told me, \u2018Unless we start you on birth control to manage it, there\u2019s no guarantee that you won\u2019t get endometriosis on the other ovary and lose it, too,\u2019\u201d said Jarnagin, who works at a bath and beauty store in Denver. \u201cIt\u2019s a necessity for me.\u201d\n\nHer reaction to the administration\u2019s decision: \u201cI deserve to have affordable medications for a condition that I have no control over. I have always been an advocate for access to health care, and it\u2019s frustrating that I may have to fight or pay more for health care that I\u2019ve already do.\u201d\n\nMuch of the controversy over providing contraception to women centers on its use for family planning. But many medical conditions also require the use of hormonal birth control methods.\n\nAllison Phipps, left and her sister Rachel Jarnagin. Courtesy Allison Phipps\n\n\u201cI saw this announcement, and it made me really angry,\u201d said Jarnagin\u2019s older sister, Allison Phipps, 32. \u201cEndometriosis is a very common problem. My mom had it when she was 27 and had a portion of both of her ovaries removed. I might even have it, because many women don\u2019t even know it\u2019s there until the symptoms start.\u201d\n\nPhipps herself was on the pill for 11 years and believes it might have protected her from developing the condition that has plagued the women in her family.\n\n\u201cPersonally, that\u2019s why it\u2019s important to me for birth control to be covered,\u201d said Phipps, who works as an art director in Denver, \u201cbut I also believe it\u2019s very important to women as a family planning method.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was in college and having to pay for it,\u201d she said. \u201cFor a generic mini pill, it was $30 a month, and with no job and student loans, that was a big deal. That was ramen noodle packages for a month.\u201d\n\nPhipps, like many women, took to social media to express outrage, often using the hashtag #HandsoffmyBC.\n\nJennifer Lawson, 43, a best-selling author and blogger from San Antonio, used the hashtag to share how she used birth control in her youth to control excruciating cramps.\n\nListen. I was on bc pills when I was still a virgin bc it helps with cripplingly painful cramps... https://t.co/RvAZdwZ2fE #handsoffmyBC \u2014 Jenny Lawson (@TheBloggess) October 6, 2017\n\nHer cramps, she wrote in an email, were \u201cso severe they made me physically sick. A doctor put me on birth control pills to help and it made a big difference. I still had cramps and nausea but they were finally manageable to the point that I wasn\u2019t missing days of school and falling behind in life.\u201d\n\nChildren\u2019s book author Jessie Talbot had an even stronger reaction. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have BC, I\u2019d be dead now,\u201d she posted.\n\n\u201cMy issues came to an abrupt end when I got a hysterectomy 17 years ago,\u201d Talbot said in an interview. \u201cThe birth control helped for a while but there was actually too much wrong for it to save the day. At least I had that option at the time.\u201d\n\nAtlanta interactive designer Deb Nilsen has polycystic ovary syndrome, a hormonal imbalance often treated with birth control. If left untreated, it can lead to serious health issues such as heart disease and diabetes.\n\n\u201cI think that the idea of the rollback on birth control is ridiculous and shortsighted,\u201d Nilsen posted on Facebook. \u201cWomen like me, who have PCOS, typically do not have regular cycles and take birth control in order to get a period and not to prevent pregnancy. If a woman with PCOS doesn\u2019t have access to birth control, I think it could be a risk factor for her.\u201d\n\nNone of these reactions comes as a surprise to Dr. Anne Davis, an OB-GYN in New York who serves as consulting medical director for the nonprofit Physicians for Reproductive Health. After the 2016 election, she says, she heard women warning each other that their access to birth control might dwindle once the president-elect took office.\n\nBut worry is much different from reality.\n\nFriday, Davis was fitting an intrauterine device for a patient who has a condition that makes it medically dangerous to have more children. \u201cI asked her if she\u2019d seen the news,\u201d Davis said. \u201cShe told me that she saw it and it was really hard for her not to cry.\u201d\n\nJust a decade ago, says Davis, most women in her practice never considered using an IUD. \u201cI would tell them, \u2018Your insurance isn\u2019t going cover it, and it\u2019s 800 bucks.\u2019 And people just shrugged their shoulders and said, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t have 800 bucks.\u2019 It was completely out of reach financially for most of my patients.\u201d\n\nOne of those patients, she recalls, used a condom for contraception but, due to accidents, ended up having an abortion, and then another.\n\n\u201cAfter the Obamacare mandate, she was able to get an IUD,\u201d Davis said. \u201cYears later, she\u2019s planning a family, in a place and time in her life where she can support children. It was a sea change for her.\u201d\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\nWhat\u2019s next for women who find themselves reliant on birth control for their medical conditions?\n\n\u201cPeople are feeling deeply unsettled,\u201d Davis added. \u201cThey don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\nLawson, the author and blogger, said, \u201cNo employer knows me well enough to decide what is or isn\u2019t acceptable for myself, my daughter, or anyone else. And they shouldn\u2019t have to know me well enough because it\u2019s none of their business.\u201d\n\nLawson says she no longer has to take birth control pills but would be terrified of how the Trump decision would affect her if she were still suffering as she did when she was younger.\n\n\u201cBut just because it doesn\u2019t affect me personally doesn\u2019t mean I will stop fighting for those who it will negatively impact,\u201d Lawson said. \u201cWe\u2019re in this together. Or at least, we should be.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/120120101754-birth-control-ts.jpg?q=x_2,y_380,h_972,w_1729,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/111103032643-birth-control-generic-pills.jpg?q=x_2,y_381,h_970,w_1726,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171006173202-birth-control-rollback-1006.jpg?q=x_358,y_150,h_619,w_1100,c_crop/h_270,w_480"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/120120101754-birth-control-ts.jpg?q=x_2,y_380,h_972,w_1729,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sandee Lamotte"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/06/health/women-react-trump-birth-control-mandate-bn/index.html", "title": "Women speak out Trump removal of birth control mandate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Beyond just birth control: Rollback leaves some women fearful | CNN", "description": "Women across the US react with concern, anger after Friday's announcement that the Trump administration is giving some employers leeway to exempt birth control coverage on religious grounds.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/120120101754-birth-control-ts.jpg?q=x_2,y_380,h_972,w_1729,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/06/health/women-react-trump-birth-control-mandate-bn/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Beyond just birth control: Rollback leaves some women fearful | CNN", "description": "Women across the US react with concern, anger after Friday's announcement that the Trump administration is giving some employers leeway to exempt birth control coverage on religious grounds.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/120120101754-birth-control-ts.jpg?q=x_2,y_380,h_972,w_1729,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNN"}, "description": "Women across the US react with concern, anger after Friday's announcement that the Trump administration is giving some employers leeway to exempt birth control coverage on religious grounds.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "health", "theme": "health", "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-07T00:40:05Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-07T00:40:05Z", "tag": "contraception, diseases and disorders, donald trump, females (demographic group), government and public administration, government bodies and offices, health and medical, political figures - us, population and demographics, sexual and reproductive health, society, us federal government, white house, internet and www, social media, technology", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "contraception, diseases and disorders, donald trump, females (demographic group), government and public administration, government bodies and offices, health and medical, political figures - us, population and demographics, sexual and reproductive health, society, us federal government, white house, internet and www, social media, technology", "author": "Sandee LaMotte", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507244400.0, "source": "http://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
