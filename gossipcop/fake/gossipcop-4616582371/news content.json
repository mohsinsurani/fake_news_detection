Last week, Sienna Miller was the said woman who had Affleck's attentions, yet this week, it is his \"detox nurse\" Elizabeth Weaver who the Live By Night star is said to be infatuated with. Not only that, but Garner is reportedly \"seeing red\" over the relationship that her estranged husband has with the nurse.\n\nBen Affleck Enjoys Lunch Date With Mystery Blonde Amid Jennifer Garner Reunion Rumors https://t.co/3zcem61YZm #celebrity #gossip \u2014 100% Celeb News 24/7 (@celebnews1456) January 6, 2017\n\n\u2014 100% Celeb News 24/7 (@celebnews1456) January 6, 2017\n\n\"According to the National Enquirer, an 'addiction-challenged' Affleck is 'hooked' on Weaver, who the magazine describes as his 'detox nurse.' A so-called 'source' tells the tabloid, 'Ben is infatuated with her.' The magazine's supposed insider further contends, 'He's feeling pretty vulnerable these days, and Elizabeth has helped him regain his confidence.' ]He adores her,' adds the publication's alleged tipster.\"\n\nAs for Garner's anger about the relationship Ben and Elizabeth have, these claims are also completely false. Both Jennifer and Ben have been longtime friends with Weaver and the nurse is a trusted confidant to both.\n\nAs it seems, based on new claims, Jennifer Garner and Ben Affleck are actually doing better than ever since their split 18 months ago. There have been many ups and downs, yet the estranged couple, who have remained amicable all the while, are said to be on the upswing.\n\nRadar Online shares details about Jen and Ben's current status.\n\nA source close to the stars stated to the publication, \"Jennifer confided in a friend that she and Ben Affleck are getting along better than ever.\" Garner reportedly also stated, \"We weren't having sex before, so now I get the best of both worlds!\"\n\nIt was a very difficult time when Jen and Ben announced their separation back in June of 2015. Following the announcement, the infamous nanny scandal then broke involving the former couple's nanny Christine Ouzounian. The source reminded that it was not the nanny who led to the split between Jen and Ben, stating \"It wasn't the nanny's fault they split because they weren't having sex before that.\"\n\nJennifer Garner And Ben Affleck Spotted Together At Church Amid Reconciliation Rumors https://t.co/BUDBM66Yan \u2014 Lindsay Cronin (@GirlWithGossip) December 13, 2016\n\n\u2014 Lindsay Cronin (@GirlWithGossip) December 13, 2016\n\n\"It's not Ben's job to make me happy. The main thing is these kids\u2014and we're completely in line with what we hope for them. Sure, I lost the dream of dancing with my husband at my daughter's wedding.
