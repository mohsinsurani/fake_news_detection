He and Selena Gomez are happy as can be right now, but HollywoodLife.com has learned EXCLUSIVELY that The Weeknd may be just a little happier if they had a few more people to love!\n\nThe Weeknd, 27, and Selena Gomez, 25, are young and in love, but that doesn\u2019t mean they can\u2019t think about the future. An insider close to the The Weeknd revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY that the \u201cStarboy\u201d singer is very interested in making babies with the \u201cFetish\u201d songstress when the time comes! OMG, we\u2019re dying. Can you imagine these two as parents?!? Well, maybe not right away! Click here to see pics of Selena\u2019s 25th birthday.\n\n\u201cHe has thought about starting a family with Selena at some point down the line, maybe in a few years and he has told her that he would want to have a girl because nothing would be better for him then to have a cute little Selena look-alike bouncing around,\u201d the source said said. \u201cHe\u2019s mentioned to her many times that two of her would always be better than one.\u201d\n\nWe cannot imagine two people who would make a cuter baby than Sel and The Weeknd and we really hope that if they keeping on loving each other, they get to the baby making stage one day! Right now they are both busy with their music careers and touring, and of course still growing and learning more about each other every day. But that doesn\u2019t mean they won\u2019t make great parents someday! Especially to a mini Selena. Okay, we can\u2019t think of that mental image one more time or we\u2019ll die of cuteness overload.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you want Selena and The Weeknd to have a baby one day? Do you think they should have a boy or a girl?
