Kristen Stewart absolutely crushed it at comedy when she hosted Saturday Night Live Feb. 4, and her ex Robert Pattinson, 30, is giving her big applause. She mentioned him in jokes for her opening monologue and not only was he totally okay with it, he\u2019s thrilled that she did it! \u201cRob saws snippets from the show and absolutely loved Kristen\u2019s opening monologue. He thought she was hilarious. He was happy to see her having so much fun and being so at ease with herself,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nK-Stew kicked off her opening bit by reminding the audience how Donald Trump, 70, lost it on Twitter when she cheated on her Twilight co-star back in 2012. \u201cFour years ago I was dating this guy named Robert and we broke up and got back together and for some reason it made Donald Trump go insane,\u201d she joked. She went on to read an actual tweet that our new president put up, where he ranted that she \u201ccheated on him like a dog\u201d and that he shouldn\u2019t take her back. It is so unbelievable to think that the leader of the free world once got involved in a Twitter rage about Kristen\u2019s love life, and that wasn\u2019t lost on her.\n\nKristin reminded us that our ranter-in-chief tweeted a total of 11 times about their romance drama, including \u201cEveryone knows that I am right that Robert Pattinson should dump Kristen Stewart.\u201d She got huge laughs when she said that Donald was totally in love with her former boyfriend and that if he didn\u2019t like her back then, he wouldn\u2019t like her now cause \u201cI\u2019m like so gay, dude.\u201d Oddly enough, for once Donald didn\u2019t hop on his Twitter account and respond. After Kristen totally schooled him, it was probably best to keep quiet.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what did you think of Kristen on SNL? Did you have any idea that she could be so funny?", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kristen-stewart-snl-41.jpg?w=440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/robert-pattinson-absolutely-loved-kristen-stewarts-hilarious-snl-gig-she-was-hilarious-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/moneyspells.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kristen-stewart-snl-3.jpg?w=440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/kristen-steward-snl-hosting-ftr1.jpg?w=440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/robert-pattinson-absolutely-loved-kristen-stewarts-hilarious-snl-gig-she-was-hilarious-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/robert-pattinson-absolutely-loved-kristen-stewarts-hilarious-snl-gig-she-was-hilarious-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Katherine Speller", "Meghan Rose", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/02/11/robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart-snl-opening-monologue/", "title": "Robert Pattinson \u2018Absolutely Loved\u2019 Kristen Stewart\u2019s \u2018Hilarious\u2019 SNL Gig: \u2018She Was Hilarious\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Aww!
