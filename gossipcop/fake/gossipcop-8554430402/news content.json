We\u2019re not so sure that this story checks out.\n\nThe buzz started yesterday, April 9, when Lisa Rinna was a guest on Andy Cohen\u2019s radio show, Radio Andy. The two talked Housewives, Amelia\u2019s history with mental health, and Andy even probed Lisa about her relationship her former Melrose Place co-star.\n\n\u201cDid you have a friendship with [Heather Locklear]?\u201d the Bravo host asked.\n\n\u201cI did and I will say to you, I learned more from Heather [\u2026] I learned professionalism, coming in and owning a set, and being kind to everyone, and polite, and on time, knew their lines, funny,\u201d Rinna tells him. \u201cHeather Locklear was everything and she was one of the biggest starts of that time.\u201d\n\nBut things have not been smooth sailing for Locklear as of late. \u201cIt\u2019s sad whatever demons she\u2019s dealing with,\u201d Andy says.\n\nOf course Andy is referring to Locklear\u2019s brush with the law that happened earlier this year. In February, People reported that the \u201990s icon was arrested on suspicion of domestic battery against her then-boyfriend, Chris Heisser, and three counts of battery on a police officer.\n\nReportedly, Locklear started the altercation when she threw a Red Bull can at Heisser because she felt that he had \u201clied to her.\u201d She told police officers that Heisser had then tried to strangle her in retaliation, and while these validity of these claims proved to be inconclusive, (Heisser denies these claims, saying \u201cI never touched her\u201d), police did find blood on the bridge of Heisser\u2019s nose and red marks across his chest. He told them that Locklear had attacked him, \u201cbit his face,\u201d and struck him from anywhere \u201cbetween 20 \u2013 30 minutes.\u201d When police arrived, things got ugly quickly and the night ended with Locklear in a pair of handcuffs yelling at police, \u201cYou f***ing deserve your kids to die! You f***ing deserve it!\u201d Yikes.\n\nSo is Heather strong enough to duke it out with the ladies of the RHOBH? \u201cYou know it was my fantasy \u2014 wouldn\u2019t it have been great to get Heather on the Beverly Hills Housewives?\u201d Andy tells Rinna.\n\n\u201cMaybe we still can,\u201d Lisa Rinna answers.\n\n\u201cStart checking it with her,\u201d Andy pleads.\n\nNaturally anyone who brings the drama is prime housewives material in our book, but in the case of Heather Locklear we think that this is one rumor that should stay a fantasy.\n\nLet us know, do you think Heather Locklear should be on reality TV?", "images": ["https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/instagram.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/themes/taste-of-reality-2017/img/logos/taste-of-reality-logo2.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/USA-Today.jpg", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/NYdailynews.com_.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=120862978489862&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/mtv-diddy-love-puff-daddy-puffy-kanye-west-feud-white-lives-matter.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/20149133-A073-4C47-88EF-F2C50B130E6F.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/themes/taste-of-reality-2017/img/logos/taste-of-reality-logo-mobile2.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rhobh-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-lisa-rinna-change.org-petition-to-fire-bravo-bully-mean-girl.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/rhobh-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-lisa-rinna-bully-reunion-season-12.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/paris-hilton-dog-missing-pet-detective-reward.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/twitter.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-kuwtk-kendall-jenner-supports-jaden-smith-white-lives-matter-kanye-west.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/08/fb.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kim-kardashians-kanye-west-white-lives-matter-soccer-game-coparent-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-kuwtk.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/love-is-blind-danielle-ruhl-why-it-didnt-work-with-season-2-nick-thompson-divorce-split.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/rhoslc-real-housewives-of-salt-lake-city-tagline-taglines-whitney-rose-meredith-marks-lisa-barlow-heather-gay-jen-shah.png", "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cbsnews.com_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://tasteofreality.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/USA-Today.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Genny Glassman"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofreality.com/is-heather-locklear-joining-rhobh/", "title": "Is Heather Locklear Joining RHOBH?!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Is it possible that former '90s icon, Heather Locklear, is joining the cast of RHOBH?
