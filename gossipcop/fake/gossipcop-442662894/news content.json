In photos posted by the Daily Mail, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, 33, could be seen wearing black pants and a black long-sleeve top, over-the-knee boots, a Panama hat and large hoop earrings, the Cleveland Cavaliers player, 27, was dressed down in a blue and grey tracksuit and baseball cap.\n\nE! News reports that Kardashian threw the party for their friend at the Marble Room and the group of about a dozen people celebrated over dinner in a private room.\n\nBoth the Good American designer and Thompson shared videos on their Instagram Stories of Savas being presented with a birthday cake decorated with a shirtless photo of him, while another video posted on Instagram showed them standing together at the celebration.\n\n\u201cThis is what you\u2019re gonna look like, Savas,\u201d Kardashian told her workout buddy of the six-pack abs depicted on the cake.\n\nAs Us Weekly exclusively reported, the new mom has put her boyfriend\u2019s infidelity in the past and a source told us they are \u201cfully back together,\u201d despite the fact that he cheated on her with at least five women while she was pregnant.\n\nKardashian has remained in Cleveland since giving birth to their daughter, but her mom, Kris Jenner, told Us earlier this month that the Revenge Body host is due to move back to L.A. very soon.\n\nShe also told Us on Friday, June 8, that she stands by her daughter\u2019s decision to stay with the power forward. \u201cI think you just have to be there for your kid and follow their lead,\u201d the momager said. \u201cI\u2019m not in that relationship or in that situation, so I really trust Khlo\u00e9. She\u2019s so smart, and such a great girl, and she\u2019ll figure it out.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian5.jpg?crop=121px%2C10px%2C1690px%2C886px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian5.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian5.jpg?crop=121px%2C10px%2C1690px%2C886px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-step-out-for-friends-birthday/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson Step Out for Friend's Birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson stepped out together on Saturday, June 9, to celebrate a friend's birthday in Cleveland \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson Step Out Together to Celebrate Pal's Birthday", "description": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson stepped out together on Saturday, June 9, to celebrate a friend's birthday in Cleveland \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-step-out-for-friends-birthday/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:03:20+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian5.jpg?crop=121px%2C10px%2C1690px%2C886px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian5.jpg?crop=121px%2C10px%2C1690px%2C886px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-10T23:10:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:03:20+00:00"}, "author": "Kathy Campbell", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson Step Out Together to Celebrate Pal's Birthday", "description": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson stepped out together on Saturday, June 9, to celebrate a friend's birthday in Cleveland \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian5.jpg?crop=121px%2C10px%2C1690px%2C886px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528672224.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
