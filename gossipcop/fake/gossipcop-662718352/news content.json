Such a super funny, cool, charismatic actor. Loved the show as a kid, still love the show now. POW!\u201d\n\nBurt Ward, who played Robin to West\u2019s Batman on the TV show and remained close friends with the actor for years after, told Variety he is \u201cdevastated\u201d by the loss of one of his \u201cvery dearest friends.\u201d \u201cAdam and I had a special friendship for more than 50 years,\u201d he said. \u201cWe shared some of the most fun times of our lives together. Our families have deep love and respect for each other. This is a terribly unexpected loss of my lifelong friend. I will forever miss him. There are several fine actors who have portrayed Batman in films. In my eyes, there was only one real Batman that is and always will be Adam West. He was truly the Bright Night.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-613009508-1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-613009508-1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ariana Bacle", "June", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/06/10/adam-west-dead-celebrities-react/", "title": "Burt Ward and other celebrities pay tribute to Batman star Adam West", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Celebrities paid tribute to the late actor, who played Batman in the '60s television series and died this week at age 88", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Burt Ward and Other Celebrities Pay Tribute to 'Batman' Star Adam West", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/06/10/adam-west-dead-celebrities-react/", "description": "Celebrities paid tribute to the late actor, who played Batman in the '60s television series and died this week at age 88", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-613009508-1-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/06/10/adam-west-dead-celebrities-react/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-613009508-1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/06/10/adam-west-dead-celebrities-react/", "title": "Burt Ward and Other Celebrities Pay Tribute to 'Batman' Star Adam West", "description": "Celebrities paid tribute to the late actor, who played Batman in the '60s television series and died this week at age 88", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-613009508-1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/06/10/adam-west-dead-celebrities-react/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497049200.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
