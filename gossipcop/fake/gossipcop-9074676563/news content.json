We learned exclusively the 2 didn\u2019t expect taking care of twins would be so challenging & since their arrival, they\u2019ve \u2018hardly slept!\u2019 Find out if it\u2019s affecting their marriage.\n\nWhile Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 47, have been parents for over five years now, as their five-year-old daughter Blue Ivy was born back in 2012, nothing could have prepared the couple for welcoming twins! In fact, the two apparently have their hands totally full with newborns Rumi and Sir Carter, who were born on June 13. But although it\u2019s tough, Jay and Bey are also making time for each other \u2014 and so far, so good! Click here to see Beyonce\u2019s hottest pics since giving birth.\n\n\u201cAfter raising Blue Ivy for five years, Beyonce really thought she had the whole parenting thing in the bag \u2014 but oh boy was she in for a shock!\u201d a source close to Beyonce told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cEverything she thought she knew is out the window when it comes to twins. Beyonce knew it wouldn\u2019t be easy, and that two newborns means twice the work, but she really didn\u2019t imagine it would be THIS hard.\u201d Although the two artists do have plenty of help with their kids, they reportedly still want to make sure they\u2019re as hands-on as possible. And just because Rumi and Sir are infants, doesn\u2019t mean they aren\u2019t a handful! After all, the two little ones apparently have big personalities ALREADY.\n\n\u201cEven though they\u2019re only four months old, they already have really different personalities \u2014 Sir is super sweet, happy, and calm, while Rumi is a tiny bunch of energy and mischief,\u201d our insider explained. \u201cBoth Beyonce and Jay have hardly slept since the twins were born, but they finally seem to be getting the babies into a routine, and they feel like things are definitely getting a little easier.\u201d But although it\u2019s a bit crazy at the Carter house right now, Jay and Bey have made sure to spend special time together, even going out for one-on-one date nights.\n\n\u201cDespite having newborn twins though, as well as a five-year-old, Beyonce and Jay are still managing to make time for each other, and their marriage is stronger than ever,\u201d the source added. \u201cAlthough they\u2019re completely exhausted, and it seems like life is now consumed by feedings and dirty diapers, they wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d Aw!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 are you hoping to see more pics of Rumi and Sir soon?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/wendy-williams-secretly-meets-with-her-attorneys-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F10%2F06%2Fjay-z-beyonce-raising-twins-harder-than-thought-marriage-relationship-trouble%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2816919&comment_count=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/beyonce-jay-z-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/shakira-gerard-pique-split-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/colorado-teen-murders-ex-girlfriend-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/beyonce-jay-z-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007050329/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/06/jay-z-beyonce-raising-twins-harder-than-thought-marriage-relationship-trouble/", "title": "Beyonce & JAY-Z Had No Idea Raising Twins Would Be So Tough: Is It Hurting Their Relationship?", "meta_data": {"description": "Are Beyonce &amp; JAY-Z in over their heads?
