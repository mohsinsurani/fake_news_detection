The actress dismissed silly speculation by saying the timing is all in the name of work.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m at work, you can\u2019t wear a wedding ring in costume,\u201d the 27-year-old actress told \u201cExtra\u201d on Monday. \u201cIf your character\u2019s not married, it\u2019s gonna look really weird if you have a wedding ring on. There is nothing more to it \u2014 I simply cannot wear it when I am in costume.\u201d\n\nRobbie secretly married her husband, Tom Ackerley, last December in Australia. The two later confirmed their nuptials with a sassy picture that was a hit on social media.\n\nA post shared by @margotrobbie on Dec 19, 2016 at 7:56pm PST\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve seen so many other people on Instagram announce their engagement that way now,\u201d the actress told Vogue Australia. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of funny, so bizarre.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRobbie and Ackerley now have a year of marriage under their belt, but the actress insists that \u201cnothing\u2019s really changed.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6340396f22000056006b45c3.jpeg?ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/63402e432500003a004f73df.jpeg?cache=AdnbRabZJs&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1200_630", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1112906175403201&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/633ff8ea2500005e004f73a4.jpeg?cache=Q1MOHMKJiH&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/6340359b2600001a005b83c3.jpg?cache=WSbcF7Ea6S&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/633fdc462200001c006b4555.png?cache=fxogmTwfa0&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/631d16ff2200001900ca9324.png?ops=100_100", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/634032832600001f005b83be.jpg?cache=of3P4Ovoa9&ops=434_244", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/55a51c041400005f0d9a800f.jpeg?ops=scalefit_960_noupscale", "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f1024140000196c50fe30.jpeg?ops=scalefit_720_noupscale", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1200_630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Senior Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/margot-robbie-doesnt-wear-wedding-ring-every-day_n_5a1ef8f1e4b01edb1a81ac9b", "title": "The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Makes sense!", "keywords": "Australia,celebrity relationships, margot robbie", "fb": {"app_id": 238320442863988}, "og": {"title": "The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1200_630", "url": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1200_630", "type": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "url": "https://www.huffpost.com/entry/margot-robbie-doesnt-wear-wedding-ring-every-day_n_5a1ef8f1e4b01edb1a81ac9b", "site_name": "HuffPost UK", "locale": "en_GB", "description": "Makes sense!"}, "article": {"tag": "Australia,celebrity relationships, margot robbie", "section": "Weddings", "published_time": "2017-11-29T21:20:10Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-29T21:20:10Z"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@HPLifestyle", "title": "The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1200_630", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "description": "Makes sense!", "creator": "@ledbettercarly"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "huffpostnews:///?editionID=uk&entryID=uk_5a1ef8f1e4b01edb1a81ac9b", "app_store_id": 306621789, "app_name": "HuffPost"}}, "sailthru.title": "The Simple Reason Margot Robbie Doesn't Wear A Wedding Ring Every Day", "sailthru.tags": "Australia,celebrity relationships, margot robbie", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/5a1f08f91400004f7750fe14.jpeg?cache=UyDkD7IYVW&ops=1200_630", "robots": "max-snippet:-1,max-image-preview:large,max-video-preview:-1", "google-site-verification": "SwSeLtSWlBL7BhzM0utZK77nXk0ojoWmrDJstoXkO9Q", "taboola.category": "weddings"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511990410.0, "source": "http://www.huffingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
