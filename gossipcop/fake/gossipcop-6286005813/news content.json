{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tyga", "text": "American rapper from California\n\nMichael Ray Nguyen-Stevenson[4] (born November 19, 1989), known professionally as Tyga (a backronym for Thank you God always), is an American rapper.[5] After a number of independent releases, Tyga signed a recording contract with Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records and Republic Records in 2008. His major label debut Careless World: Rise of the Last King was released in 2011 and included the successful singles \"Rack City\", \"Faded\" (featuring Lil Wayne), \"Far Away\" (featuring Chris Richardson), \"Still Got It\" (featuring Drake), and \"Make It Nasty\". The album's success was followed up with Hotel California (2013) and Fan of a Fan: The Album (2015), in collaboration with singer Chris Brown.\n\nDue to disagreements with Young Money, Tyga's next album, The Gold Album: 18th Dynasty was released independently on June 23, 2015. The album, executively produced by Kanye West, became his lowest selling album to that point, selling 5,000 album equivalent units in its first week.[6]\n\nAfter a period of poor sales and mixed reception from previous material, his May 2018 single, \"Taste\" (featuring Offset), peaked at number 8 on the Billboard Hot 100, being his first Top 40 single since \"Ayo\" with Chris Brown in 2015. The song would later serve as the lead single for his seventh album Legendary, which was eventually released in 2019.[7]\n\nEarly life\n\nMichael Ray Nguyen-Stevenson was born in Compton, California, on November 19, 1989,[8] and raised there until he \"was about 11, 12\", before moving to adjacent Gardena.[9] He was born to Jamaican and Vietnamese parents.[10] His mother was born in Vietnam and has the maiden name Nguyen.[4] He grew up listening to Fabolous, Lil Wayne, Cam'ron and Eminem among many others.[11]\n\nOn December 3, 2012, debate arose concerning Tyga's upbringing. Tyga claimed to have been brought up in the low socioeconomic area of Compton, but in leaked footage from the unaired television show Bustas, he claimed he grew up in a \"well-to-do\" home in the Valley, where his parents drove a Range Rover. He also claimed that he attained his nickname from his mother calling him Tiger Woods.[12] There has been speculation that his claims on the show were satirical and not to be taken seriously. Tyga responded to the video's leak on Twitter: \"When u 14 an ambitious u don't give a fuk about anything. Scripted tv isn't that what we all live for. Hahahaha.\"[13]\n\nCareer\n\n2007\u20132010: No Introduction and mixtapes\n\nTyga's career began with him releasing a multitude of demo tapes and mixtapes. His 2007 debut mixtape, Young On Probation, garnered the attention of fellow California rapper and Gym Class Heroes lead vocalist, Travie McCoy. Seeing talent in the young artist, McCoy offered him a record deal with the independent label DCD2 Records (known then as Decaydence Records). Tyga also formed the record label G.E.D. Inc. (Grinding every day, Getting every dollar, or Getting educated daily) around the time, the same imprint that helped launch the career of fellow West Coast rapper Schoolboy Q, with whom he's worked with early in his career. Tyga also has a G.E.D. Inc tattoo above his right eyebrow.[14][15]\n\nOn June 10, 2008, Tyga released his debut independent album, No Introduction, on Decaydance Records.[16] The album was preceded by the single \"Coconut Juice\", featuring McCoy. One of the songs from this album, \"Diamond Life\", was used in the video games Need for Speed: Undercover and Madden NFL 2009, as well as in the 2009 movie Fighting.\n\nIn late 2008, Tyga signed a new record deal with Lil Wayne's Young Money Entertainment, which was a subsidiary of Cash Money Records at the time. Tyga met Wayne at the 2008 VMA's, performing the remix of Fall Out Boy's \"This Ain't a Scene, It's an Arms Race\". He was first featured on the song \"Bedrock\" by Young Money soon after signing to the label. He later released the mixtape Fan of a Fan with singer Chris Brown and producers DJ Ill Will and DJ Rockstar. It features other artists such as Bow Wow, Lil Wayne, and Kevin McCall featured in several tracks. Four tracks (\"Holla at Me\", \"G Shit\", \"No Bullshit\" and \"Deuces\") are also accompanied by music videos. The track \"Deuces\" was released as the lead single of the mixtape and reached No. 14 on the Billboard Hot 100 and number 1 on the Billboard Hot R&B/Hip-Hop Songs by August 26, 2010. The track has also been nominated for Best Rap/Sung Collaboration at the 53rd Grammy Awards.[17][18] The track, among others, was on the track list of Chris Brown's fourth studio album, F.A.M.E..

The album was released on February 21, 2012, on Young Money Entertainment, Cash Money Records, and Universal Republic Records. Careless World: Rise of the Last King is a move to the rapping style he featured in the collaboration album We Are Young Money rather than the poppy dance element exemplified on his previous effort, No Introduction.[20] Tyga stated that the album shows he has grown up but still relates to the kids. In preparation for the album, Tyga released the mixtape #BitchImTheShit in December 2011.\n\nThe first official single, \"Far Away\", was released on May 17, 2011, and peaked at 86 on the Billboard Hot 100.

Jason claims that Tyga agreed to pay $28,275 for the jeweler's diamond pantheon watch in August 2012 and that he borrowed a $63,000 diamond Cuban link chain in December 2012 and never returned the item, so he sued Tyga for the cost of both pieces, plus late fees, which totaled up to $185,306.50 in damages, double the original total cost.[82] Tyga fell ill before the interrogation of this debt and was considered not able to proceed.
