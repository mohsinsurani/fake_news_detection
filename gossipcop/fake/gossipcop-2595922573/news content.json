Her life isn\u2019t really changing \u2026 if anything, she\u2019s just busier.\u201d\n\nBoth Dewan and Tatum have been spotted out and about without their wedding rings since jointly announcing their split on April 2. Days after news of their breakup was made public, Dewan went back to shooting her upcoming TV show Mixtape.\n\nThis past weekend, Tatum stepped out for the Honda Indy Grand Prix on Sunday, attending his first public event since he and Dewan announced their split. The 37-year-old actor attended the event in Birmingham, Alabama, where he served as the grand marshal and hung out with Bachelor star Arie Luyendyk Jr.\n\nMeanwhile, Dewan has also slowly been returning to social media \u2014 and removed her married last name from her accounts (Tatum has yet to share anything new on social media).\n\nEthan Miller/Getty\n\nLast week, she updated Instagram with her first post since her separation, writing, \u201cThank you guys for all your love. Love you right back.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Dewan posted her first YouTube video since the split \u2014 dancing to Henry Green\u2019s song \u201cSomething\u201d in a white dress on the beach. The video, titled A Little Dance, was \u201cinspired by this cove, this song, and voila! Love love love xx,\u201d Dewan wrote in the description.\n\nAnother source close to Dewan says, \u201cJenna is great. She seems very energetic and excited about her life. It was very difficult for her to announce the separation. She didn\u2019t want it to happen for a long time.\n\nIn a statement to PEOPLE, Dewan and Tatum announced they were going their separate ways.\n\n\u201cWe have lovingly chosen to separate as a couple,\u201d the pair said, later sharing the same statement on their Twitter and Instagram pages. \u201cThere are no secrets nor salacious events at the root of our decision \u2014 just two best-friends realizing it\u2019s time to take some space and help each other live the most joyous, fulfilled lives as possible.\u201d\n\nDewan and Tatum first met on the set of their 2006 movie Step Up and tied the knot in 2009. Both share daughter Everly, who will turn 5 in May.\n\nA source close to the couple previously told PEOPLE the pair tried to make things work after \u201cgrowing apart\u201d over the past year.\n\n\u201cThey really wanted to make their marriage work,\u201d said the insider. \u201cBut neither of them are people who will stay in something that isn\u2019t fully right.\u201d", "images":
