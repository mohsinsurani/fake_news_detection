Couple\n\nBrin\u2019s and Wojcicki\u2019s orbits collided in 1998, when Brin, a graduate student in Stanford\u2019s computer-science department, moved off campus with classmate Larry Page to set up a search-engine company in Wojcicki\u2019s sister Susan\u2019s garage. Susan, who met Brin when he dated a friend of hers, charged them $1,700 a month rent to offset her mortgage (she is now the most senior female employee at Google, and the new head of YouTube). Brin and Page filled the garage with desks made of old pine doors set on sawhorses, a turquoise shag carpet, and a Ping-Pong table. Their search engine, initially called \u201cBackRub,\u201d evaluated the incoming links on a page instead of keywords, as their competitors did, as well as the importance of the entity doing the linking. (In search, as in life, it\u2019s about who you know.)\n\nBrin\u2019s parents, a pair of Russian-Jewish scientists from Moscow, had experienced prejudice in their home country, and migrated when he was six years old with help from the Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society (a charity to which Brin gave $1 million in 2009, and where his mother, Eugenia, serves on the board). The scientific community outside of Washington, D.C., embraced his parents, though money was still an issue, instilling a sense of frugality in their son.\n\nThe Wojcickis were similarly tight-knit and academic\u2014and, like the Brins, also thrifty and non-materialistic. Wojcicki\u2019s father was the chairman of Stanford\u2019s physics department, and her mother is a journalism teacher. A lightly tanned brunette who was high-energy, athletic, and popular in school\u2014a sort of Jennifer Aniston in Birkenstocks\u2014Wojcicki figure-skated as a child and played ice hockey at Yale, where she majored in biology. After graduation she worked as a health-care investment analyst on Wall Street for 10 years. Her parents weren\u2019t entirely pleased. \u201cIt was always embarrassing to come home,\u201d she has said. \u201cPeople were like, \u2018Oh, Anne, you Wall Street girl.\u2019 \u201d (Neither Brin nor Wojcicki responded to questions from Vanity Fair.)\n\nIn Brin, Wojcicki found another child of baby-boomer academics who could see beyond academia\u2019s cautious, elitist approach to discovering new knowledge, a slow process in which researchers propose a hypothesis, organize an experiment to collect data, submit findings to peer review, and finally, many months later, gain publication in an esoteric journal. Brin and Wojcicki are pioneers of a different model, with enormous potential in both its reach and its speed: they look to advanced, Web-based tools and large data sets as the key to solving problems, from how to target advertising to discovering the drugs to treat cancer. Hypotheses can be limiting and scientists can be led astray; using massive computing power to find patterns is quick, and data sets don\u2019t lie.\n\nAs Wojcicki and Brin started seeing each other, Google had not only weathered the dot-com crash but begun to dominate the search-engine business and was minting money via AdWords, the most effective advertising platform in history. Eventually, Google would employ 55,000 people on its 65-building campus in Mountain View, California, creating the country\u2019s best e-mail platform (Gmail), their own browser (Chrome), a G.P.S. mapping system (Google Maps), a news aggregator (Google News), the world\u2019s largest collection of data-storage servers, and the world\u2019s most popular mobile operating system (Android). Google became a supremely powerful corporation, but in its DNA it remained anti-corporate. While it acted aggressively to innovate, Brin and Page tried as hard as possible to hew to their unofficial motto of \u201cDon\u2019t be evil,\u201d keeping their search engine pure despite attempts by major advertisers to game results. When Google, in a rare misstep, censored its results in China, Brin, whose parents\u2019 experience attuned him to the abuses of totalitarian regimes, took the leading role in pulling the company out of the country.\n\nThe corporate culture that you\u2019ve likely heard about at Google\u2014the lack of a dress code, the free sushi, the pets at work, the free Pilates sessions\u2014was all part of the founders\u2019 mission to create a benevolent workplace. When investors leaned on Page and Brin to hire an established C.E.O.\u2014what\u2019s called \u201cadult supervision\u201d in the Valley\u2014they selected Eric Schmidt, a computer scientist and manager who was known to attend Burning Man, the annual, costumed bacchanal and creativity free-for-all in the Nevada desert that\u2019s a tradition among Google executives. \u201cLarry and Sergey genuinely care about innovation, and part of that means genuinely caring about employees so they do the best and most creative work they can do,\u201d says a former Googler.\n\nCreativity meant thinking about things differently from the way other corporations did, and it\u2019s part of how Google stays on top. It also meant that when Brin got married it wouldn\u2019t be in the traditional way. In 2007 he and Wojcicki invited guests to a secret location in the Bahamas. Wojcicki hadn\u2019t always wanted to get hitched\u2014during her years on the Street she saw bankers cheating on their wives, according to the friend of the couple\u2019s\u2014but Brin was her man. For the wedding, she wore a white bathing suit, and the groom a black one. They swam out to a sandbar to take their vows surrounded by the ocean.\n\n__FAST COMPANY__Wojcicki and Brin at the 2014 Breakthrough Prizes in Fundamental Physics and Life Sciences ceremony, co-hosted by V.F. in Mountain View, California., By Steve Jennings/Getty Images.\n\nA year later, Wojcicki gave birth to their first child just as Google executives started enjoying life as some of the richest people in the world. Schmidt was a pilot, and, according to the friend, he encouraged other Google executives to indulge their desires for yachts and planes. Brin, Page, and Schmidt purchased at least a half-dozen planes, including a 767 and a 757; they basically \u201cown an airline,\u201d says the friend. Brin also purchased a home in New York City\u2019s West Village. Schmidt bought Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s $20 million Montecito mansion, a $15 million New York apartment, which made an appearance as Shia LaBeouf\u2019s pad in the film Wall Street: Money Never Sleeps, and, recently, a $22 million home near the Playboy Mansion, in Holmby Hills.\n\nSchmidt\u2019s wife, Wendy, however, retreated to their compound on Nantucket and didn\u2019t often make the Google social scene. Schmidt, now 58, was sometimes accompanied by younger women, one of whom briefly worked at Google.\n\nSeveral former Google employees say that the company is casual in its approach to dating at work. One says that Google is \u201cintentionally agnostic about dating,\u201d and that there are hundreds of \u201cGoogle couples\u201d among its global offices. In fact, Google\u2019s code of conduct does not ban dating between employees, saying, \u201cRomantic relationships between co-workers can, depending on the work roles and respective positions of the co-workers involved, create an actual or apparent conflict of interest. If a romantic relationship does create an actual or apparent conflict, it may require changes to work arrangements or even the termination of employment of either or both individuals involved.\u201d\n\nConcerning the culture of office romances at Google, one Atherton socialite with close connections to the company says, \u201cWhen you have executives dating employees, it\u2019s like a doctor-nurse relationship\u2014it\u2019s not illegal, but it seems like it shouldn\u2019t be happening. Tech is a man\u2019s world. Most of these guys are married, and then there are these young fresh [female] sharks, and they\u2019re smart too.\u201d But the men have hundreds of millions of dollars. The socialite trots out an old saw: \u201cIt\u2019s almost like you get a Stanford degree so you can work at Google, so you can find a husband.\u201d\n\nOver the years, there have been several notable workplace romances at the top levels of Google, including one between Page and Marissa Mayer, now the C.E.O. of Yahoo. There were hallway discussions about the two of them dating, and some believed being close to Mayer was helpful when trying to quickly secure Page\u2019s approval for a project.\n\nWojcicki, unlike many wives of rich men, wasn\u2019t enthusiastic about collecting art or jewelry, and she argued against buying planes and boats, says the friend of the couple\u2019s. Some say she can be headstrong and withholding of praise, hot to her own ideas and dismissive of others\u2019. Wojcicki is adamant about wanting a \u201cnormalized\u201d life, says a source close to her, using the Silicon Valley billionaires\u2019 phrase for \u201cnormal.\u201d But there\u2019s nothing normal about the astronomical wealth, or the power that comes from being the ones changing the world.\n\nIn 2006, Wojcicki co-founded 23andMe and soon raised several rounds of financing, including $6.5 million from Google. She hoped to attract over a million customers to her company, coaxing them to spit into a tube and send the saliva to her DNA-genotyping lab for today\u2019s low price of $99. Her mission was to pass along as much information as possible about each person\u2019s health and ancestry, on the principle that this knowledge, by rights, is ours. But not everyone receives good news; many have learned about elevated levels of risk for breast cancer, Alzheimer\u2019s, or Parkinson\u2019s. Some health-care professionals believe it is unwise to give individuals such daunting news without the support of personal counseling.\n\nWojcicki, it turns out, had a more personal stake in her business than one might imagine. Brin\u2019s great-aunt suffered from Parkinson\u2019s, the neuro-degenerative disorder, and his mother was diagnosed with it in 1999. It was long thought that Parkinson\u2019s was not hereditary. But beginning in 2004, researchers suggested that people with a certain gene mutation (more common among Ashkenazi Jews) have a risk of between 30 and 75 percent of succumbing to the disease. (The general population\u2019s risk is about 1 percent.) When Wojcicki tested Brin, his results were positive for the mutation. Brin read the risk as possibly having only about 10 good years left, says the friend of the couple\u2019s.\n\nAfter getting such news, some of us would curl up into a ball, but Brin didn\u2019t. Unlike Steve Jobs, who fiercely guarded news about his health, Brin started a blog and announced his results publicly, at Google\u2019s Zeitgeist conference in 2008 in Mountain View. Brin began exercising even more relentlessly than usual, and drinking coffee, which some doctors recommend for those at risk for the disease, even though he abhorred the taste. (He eventually switched to green tea.) He told Wired magazine that he hoped those steps might reduce his risk by half, and if research on the brain progresses, as he believes it will, his risk could be cut in half again.\n\nIn addition, Wojcicki and Brin have the means to aid such research, and they have given more than $150 million to the Michael J. Fox Foundation and $7 million to the Parkinson\u2019s Institute. They have also donated to the Breakthrough Prizes, one of which was awarded to a Parkinson\u2019s researcher at a ceremony at the NASA Ames Research Center, in Mountain View, last fall co-hosted by Vanity Fair. Research on the 10,000 Parkinson\u2019s sufferers that Wojcicki has recruited at 23andMe, the largest cohort of these genotypes in the world, might cut Brin\u2019s risk even more. \u201cSomewhere under 10 percent\u201d is his own assessment.\n\nA New Life\n\nIn the years following his genetic test, Brin shifted his focus at Google. Like many leaders in Silicon Valley, he had grown bored with quotidian problems and started to dream more about things that were literally out of this world, like space travel and robots who will become our friends. As Microsoft co-founder Paul Allen invested $200 million on a superplane that can launch a rocket, and Tesla\u2019s Elon Musk talked about the Hyperloop, Brin, working at a company with the country\u2019s top engineers, threw his energy into Google X, the company\u2019s \u201csecret lab,\u201d in two nondescript buildings near the Mountain View campus.\n\nIn 2012, to debut Google Glass, Brin coordinated a skydiving stunt, with a team of jumpers leaping out of a zeppelin over downtown San Francisco. The media was enthralled: Brin, they said, was the real-life Tony Stark, the comic-book genius innovator played by Robert Downey Jr. in the Iron Man films. (Actually, director Jon Favreau says Musk was his inspiration.) Glass was Brin\u2019s first big project at X; now he\u2019s ready to turn his attention to driverless cars, beta versions of which are crisscrossing San Francisco today, like so many ghosts.\n\nThe first incarnation of Glass, a 10-pound, head-mounted display attached to cables that looped to a box on the user\u2019s belt, was not sexy, but Brin had it redesigned as sleek, lensless frames in shades of \u201ccotton,\u201d \u201ctangerine,\u201d and \u201csky.\u201d Still, they screamed \u201cnerd.\u201d At an Allen & Co. conference in Sun Valley, Idaho, Brin and Wojcicki approached designer Diane von Furstenberg with an idea: perhaps she would like to collaborate. The designer was tickled by the notion of her models wearing Glass at a fashion show. It would lend a bit of tech gloss to her company, and fashion glamour for Glass.\n\nFor the event the Glass team, including Amanda Rosenberg, descended on New York to collaborate with von Furstenberg\u2019s studio. Brin and Wojcicki threw a party at their home in the West Village and Glass\u2019s palette was matched to von Furstenberg\u2019s clothes. On the day of the show, during New York\u2019s Fashion Week, Rosenberg posed with von Furstenberg and Brin for celebratory photos. She posted a picture of herself sitting in the front row, using Glass to record the show. \u201cYou can see that everyone looks pretty cool, whereas I can barely contain my excitement,\u201d Rosenberg wrote, with her usual sense of self-deprecating humor.\n\nWhile Glass was blowing up in the press, a friend admits, Wojcicki may have been a bit hard on Brin. \u201cAnne is great, but she can be difficult,\u201d says the friend. \u201cShe\u2019s hard on Sergey, and she doesn\u2019t let him get away with things.\u201d She was focused on saving him: when research discovered that a gene variant might protect those with Brin\u2019s rare Parkinson\u2019s-related mutation, Wojcicki patented it. (Like many of her business decisions, patenting genes\u2014a move often seen as an attempt to corner a drug market\u2014is controversial in the medical establishment.)\n\nWojcicki still wanted a normal life, or as normal as she could have: to be a dedicated mom and for the family to have dinner together. But \u201cinstead of just being a Google founder, Sergey was suddenly awesome, a cool person, a performer\u2014a celebrity!\u201d says the friend of the couple\u2019s. \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018Wait a second\u2014I\u2019m doing all this cool stuff, and then I have to come home and change diapers?\u2019 \u201d\n\nWojcicki began to help Brin informally on Google Glass, says the friend. Rosenberg wanted to get the product into the hands of moms, so she came over to Wojcicki\u2019s home to discuss reaching out to the many kid-oriented services in Los Altos. At the time, Rosenberg\u2019s boyfriend was Hugo Barra, a high-ranking executive on Google\u2019s Android team. A Brazilian educated at M.I.T., he was essentially the face of their new mini-tablet, the Nexus 7, and a well-regarded, creative product manager. Rosenberg posted internal videos of the two of them together and was \u201cso proud when she started dating him,\u201d says a co-worker. Over the holiday season in 2012\u201313, says the couple\u2019s friend, Wojcicki and Rosenberg became close enough that Wojcicki bought Rosenberg a Christmas present. The two of them went to a birthday dinner for Russian investor Yuri Milner, with Barra, Brin, and both Wojcicki\u2019s and Brin\u2019s parents. Rosenberg was smoking cigarettes, and Barra wanted her to stop. Wojcicki lectured her about the health risks.", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/631f2e626009e759e6638f7c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac00851062027081ff7a4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008b8f23e3a03159023/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dbec146d7fce1e25ce37f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/631d72a9c1df471d836f1b56/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008b624d691057695ee/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/image.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6320d298b63c9570a030ca22/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Vanessa Grigoriadis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/04/sergey-brin-amanda-rosenberg-affair", "title": "Sergey Brin and Amanda Rosenberg: Inside the Google Co-Founder\u2019s Romance with the Google Glass Marketing Manager", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.", "id": "54cb02145106202708207238", "keywords": "google,technology,society,magazine,april 2014 issue", "news_keywords": "google,technology,society,magazine,april 2014 issue", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "54cb02145106202708207238", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/image.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/image.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Sergey Brin and Amanda Rosenberg:\u00a0Inside the Google Co-Founder\u2019s Romance with the Google Glass Marketing Manager", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2014/04/sergey-brin-amanda-rosenberg-affair"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2014-03-12T04:00:11.892Z", "modified_time": "2014-03-12T04:00:11.892Z", "author": "Vanessa Grigoriadis"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The high-profile love triangle involving Sergey Brin, Anne Wojcicki, and Amanda Rosenberg\u00a0has\u00a0Silicon Valley\u00a0facing\u00a0emotional issues, from office romance to fear of mortality.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54cac008494254fc09974003/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/image.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Sergey Brin and Amanda Rosenberg:\u00a0Inside the Google Co-Founder\u2019s Romance with the Google Glass Marketing Manager"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1394596811.892, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
