They later wed but also split up.\n\nBut Aniston reportedly leaned on her ex-husband Brad over the course of 15 months as her \u00admarriage to Justin Theroux crumbled.\n\nAniston and Theroux announced their breakup on Feb. 15, 2018 after only two-and-a-half years of marriage.\n\nThe announcement read, in part, \u201cIn an effort to reduce any further speculation, we have decided to announce our separation. This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year.\n\n\u201cWe are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship\u2026.Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u201d\n\nRadar told you first that Aniston and Theroux were breaking up and detailed their many issues.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/brad-pitt-mom-jane-begging-get-back-jennifer-aniston.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://wcmimages.canoe.com/images?url=https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/janeseymour1-e1519430120822.jpg&w=107&h=80", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2c5bf0203da713cbf4fbf7cad8a91035?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://wcmimages.canoe.com/images?url=https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/13x098_6fe4_9-e1519424658461.jpg&w=205&h=153", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://wcmimages.canoe.com/images?url=https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/karllll1k.jpg&w=205&h=153", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://wcmimages.canoe.com/images?url=https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/brad-pitt-mom-jane-begging-get-back-jennifer-aniston.jpeg&w=107&h=80", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/canoe-com-logo-white-vertically-centered.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/990309138/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://wcmimages.canoe.com/images?url=https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/jlo-kids-e1519429354528.jpg&w=107&h=80", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://wcmimages.canoe.com/images?url=https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/jlaw-red-e1519428226796.jpg&w=107&h=80", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://wcmimages.canoe.com/images?url=http://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/920795764.jpg&w=205&h=153", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106im_/https://postmediacanoe.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/brad-pitt-mom-jane-begging-get-back-jennifer-aniston.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["More American Media Inc."], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180224033106/http://canoe.com/entertainment/celebrity/brad-pitts-mom-wants-him-to-get-back-with-jennifer-aniston", "title": "Brad Pitt's mom wants him to get back with Jennifer Aniston", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive", "description": "Brad Pitt&lsquo;s family &ndash;
