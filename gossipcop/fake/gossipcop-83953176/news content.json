It wasn\u2019t so bad on the scale of celebrity breakups, but after less than three years of marriage (a lifetime in Hollywood), it was a tabloid downer for a day or two.\n\nIn case there are still people busying themselves wondering if Aniston is happy (just a note, she really doesn\u2019t want you to), please stop. According to the latest tabloid reports, she\u2019s doing just fine. She\u2019s reportedly back on the dating scene with two different beaus, per Us Weekly, and her friends are having trouble not talking about it. One man is reportedly a bachelor who recently split from his wife and the other is an \u201cindustry creative,\u201d whatever that ever means. Neither of them is an actor.\n\nBut there\u2019s no reason to believe we\u2019ll learn more anytime soon. In July of 2016, Aniston wrote a pretty searing op-ed for HuffPost in which she scolded paparazzi that are constantly obsessed with whether she\u2019s in love or having babies.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I am not pregnant,\u201d she wrote then. \u201cWhat I am is fed up. I\u2019m fed up with the sport-like scrutiny and body-shaming that occurs daily under the guise of \u2018journalism,\u2019 the \u2018First Amendment,\u2019 and \u2018celebrity news.\u2019\u201d\n\nO.K., so, Jennifer Aniston is happy. She\u2019s dating. This is great. Now time to leave her alone and talk about the fact that Justin Theroux knows someone in the South of France with a really great hot tub.", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b0ff980016c7568e478cb98/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/emma-stone-south-of-france.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3ba8848ff299585cab1b55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-aniston-is-dating.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3ba8848ff299585cab1b55/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jennifer-aniston-is-dating.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7a20d498700f55543c61e7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-aniston-style-evolution-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/631b88369abfd8a85cba4188/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/632891edc1df471d836f1d99/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b1ae2316cf0c55cfe0c40e3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Roberts-Cox-Aniston.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7a20d3158db24f427a1ae8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-aniston-style-evolution-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a7a20d3eab54264e43b45dd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jennifer-aniston-style-evolution-ss03.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3ba8848ff299585cab1b55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-aniston-is-dating.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Hilary Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/jennifer-aniston-latest-dating-rumors", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Latest Dating Rumors Are Shrouded in Mystery", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "It\u2019s been months since she and Justin Theroux announced their divorce, and the tabloid cycle has begun anew.", "id": "5b3ba7ccacd469252aac12bc", "keywords": "jennifer aniston,tabloid,architectural digest,los angeles,body shame", "news_keywords": "jennifer aniston,tabloid,architectural digest,los angeles,body shame", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b3ba7ccacd469252aac12bc", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"It\u2019s been months since she and Justin Theroux announced their divorce, and the tabloid cycle has begun anew.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3ba8848ff299585cab1b55/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/jennifer-aniston-is-dating.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3ba8848ff299585cab1b55/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/jennifer-aniston-is-dating.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "It\u2019s been months since she and Justin Theroux announced their separation, and the tabloid cycle has begun anew.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3ba8848ff299585cab1b55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-aniston-is-dating.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Latest Dating Rumors Are Shrouded in Mystery", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/jennifer-aniston-latest-dating-rumors"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-07-03T16:50:46.140Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-03T18:14:28.752Z", "author": "Hilary Weaver"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "It\u2019s been months since she and Justin Theroux announced their separation, and the tabloid cycle has begun anew.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b3ba8848ff299585cab1b55/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/jennifer-aniston-is-dating.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Jennifer Aniston\u2019s Latest Dating Rumors Are Shrouded in Mystery"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530636646.14, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
