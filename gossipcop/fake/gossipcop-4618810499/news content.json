It\u2019s hard to believe that it\u2019s only been one year since Kylie Jenner and Tyga split \u2014 especially because so much has changed for Kylie since then. The Keeping Up With the Kardashians star is now a mom to an adorable little girl named Stormi Webster \u2014 whom she shares with her new boyfriend, rapper Travis Scott \u2014 and even though she\u2019s already moved on and had a whole baby with another man, sources exclusively revealed to In Touch that Tyga isn\u2019t really over Kylie.\n\n\u201cEven though they\u2019re not together, Tyga misses Kylie. For real,\u201d the insider told In Touch. \u201cHe misses her sexiness. Her body. The lavish life, connections, money and exposure she gave him. He misses all of that and kicks himself every day for letting their relationship die.\u201d\n\nKylie and Tyga dated for about three years \u2014 which is an eternity in celeb time \u2014 but they broke up in 2017 shortly after Valentine\u2019s Day. Fans were shocked to learn that Kylie had moved on so quickly from Tyga when she started dating Travis in April 2017 \u2014 and it was even more shocking that she got pregnant less than two months into their relationship. Sources revealed that Kylie\u2019s pregnancy was especially hard for Tyga to accept, because he eventually hoped to start a family with the lip kit mogul \u2014 and even though Kylie seems to be happy and in love with Travis and their little family, Tyga is still holding on to hope that there might still be a chance for him to get back togegther with her.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s worse: she\u2019s got a baby with Travis. That gnaws at him,\u201d the insider continued. \u201cHe wanted to be the one who gave Kylie a baby. He wanted that so much but she was opposed. Tyga\u2019s pissed about that. But even still, he forgives her because he loves her. And he knows he could still have a baby with her later down the line if they were ever to rekindle the passion they once had.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tyga-misses-kylie-jenner.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tyga-misses-kylie-jenner.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Hernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/tyga-misses-kylie-jenner-158840/", "title": "Tyga Misses Kylie Jenner, Hopes to Get Back Together With Her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "She's the one who got away!
