It won\u2019t \u2013 for a bunch of reasons, the most important of which is that Robert Mueller, who is running the investigation, doesn\u2019t seem to believe a sitting President can be indicted.\n\nThe much more likely outcome is that Mueller releases the findings from his investigation sometime this fall \u2014 and lets the chips, as they relate to Trump, fall where they may. Which means \u2014 and this is what Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani have understood for months \u2014 that, ultimately, this isn\u2019t a legal fight, it\u2019s a public relations one.\n\nGiuliani tipped his hand on that strategy Monday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota. \u201cI\u2019ll be here with my version of the report and they\u2019ll have their version of the report and the American people, in that sense, are going to decide it,\u201d Giuliani said of the Mueller investigation.\n\n\u201cMy version\u201d vs. \u201ctheir version.\u201d What that construct from Giuliani misses, of course, is that one of the \u201cversions\u201d will be the result of a Justice Department-commissioned investigation led by the former head of the FBI that has already spanned more than a year. The other \u201cversion\u201d will be Giuliani\u2019s cable TV appearances and President Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\nThat is, on its face, an apples-and-oranges comparison. But remember what Giuliani and Trump know: The debate over whether and how much Trump did wrong (if anything) is almost certain to be decided in the court of public opinion, not an actual court. And in the court of public opinion \u2013 particularly given the fealty that rank-and-file Republicans have shown (and continue to show) to Trump, the comparison is far more favorable to Trump\u2019s side.\n\nQuick, do this thought experiment: Name the first 10 words that come to mind when someone says \u201cMueller probe.\u201d If you are being honest with yourself, my guess is that the words \u201cno collusion,\u201d \u201cwitch hunt\u201d and maybe even \u201c13 Angry Democrats\u201d made it into that top 10. What that means is that even if you roll your eyes when you hear \u201cno collusion,\u201d it seeps into your consciousness \u2014 and that\u2019s a win for Trump.\n\nEspecially when you consider that lots and lots of people aren\u2019t rolling their eyes when Trump unleashes a tweet blasting the allegedly partisan bias of Mueller\u2019s team or how the whole probe is based on false pretenses. In a CBS News poll released earlier this week, 70% of Republicans described the Mueller probe as a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d That same poll showed that more than nine in 10 \u201cstrong Trump supporters\u201d trust Trump for \u201caccurate information\u201d as compared to 63% who trust \u201cfamily and friends\u201d and 11% who trust the \u201cmainstream media.\u201d\n\nNeed more? In March, roughly three in 10 Republicans approved of Robert Mueller in CNN polling. By May, that number was down to 17% approval. That data is backed up by other polls. Last July, a Politico/Morning Consult survey showed that 27% of Republicans had an unfavorable view of Mueller. By this June, that number was 53%.\n\nThose numbers speak to the effectiveness of the PR campaign against Mueller (and his team) by Giuliani and Trump. It also speaks to the fact that this is largely a one-sided conversation. Mueller himself never speaks in public. The special counsel\u2019s office has released only a handful of statements since it was created. Mueller is, rightly, focused on running an effective and thorough investigation. But that leaves him and his team uniquely vulnerable to the campaign-style attacks by Trump and Giuliani. An attack unresponded to, in the context of politics, is an attack believed by some chunk of the voting public. Again, that isn\u2019t Mueller\u2019s concern. He is focused on drawing fact-based conclusions and releasing them in a report. He\u2019s not planning to run for anything.\n\nTrump, on the other hand, is running for a second term. And the President has shown time and time again he is willing to say and do whatever it takes to win an argument in the court of public opinion. Which is what he has set about doing over the past six months or so.\n\nMock all the \u201cno collusion\u201d and \u201ccollusion isn\u2019t even a crime\u201d comments if you want. But remember that a big chunk of people already believe \u2014 before Mueller has released a single final finding \u2014 that his whole probe is a partisan witch hunt that should never have been started in the first place. Short of Mueller producing an email from Trump saying \u201cYes, let\u2019s collude with Russia ASAP!\u201d those people will not change their view \u2014 either on Mueller or Trump. (In truth, even if Mueller did produce an email from Trump that clearly showed collusion with the Russians, I\u2019m not sure that would change the base\u2019s view.)\n\nThat\u2019s the secret Trump and Giuliani know \u2013 and have been executing against for months. And like it or not, it\u2019s working.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180713124904-dana-bash-reax.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1078,w_1915,c_crop/w_250",
