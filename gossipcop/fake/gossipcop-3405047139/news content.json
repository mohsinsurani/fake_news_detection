Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott were guests at MTV\u2019s epic awards show on Aug. 20, but some fans thought they didn\u2019t look like they were enjoying themselves enough\u2026 especially during Jennifer Lopez\u2019s epic medley performance!\n\nJLo was honored with the annual Video Vanguard award, but before she accepted it she performed a medley of basically every song you can think of. \u201cGet Right,\u201d \u201cJenny From The Block,\u201d \u201cGet On The Floor,\u201d \u201cAin\u2019t Yo Momma,\u201d \u201cLove Don\u2019t Cost A Thing,\u201d seriously, all the faves. To make it more epic, she brought out Ja Rule, DJ Khaled, and more stars to perform with her.\n\nAnd yet, when the cameras cut to the audience, they caught Kylie and Travis just sitting there, staring off into space without so much as a smile. Meanwhile, everyone around them was up out of their chairs dancing the night away, as you do. Suffice it to say, fans were offended by the #disrespect.\n\nKylie can show some damn respect to JLo #VMAs \u2014 Alex Murillo (@Alextacy21) August 21, 2018\n\nif @KylieJenner doesn't get her billion dollar ass up from that chair -_- #VMAs \u2014 kyle. (@kylzuur) August 21, 2018\n\nKylie get your sorry ass up to pay respects to the queen JLO #VMAs \u2014 FRC (@fannyyrc) August 21, 2018\n\nMaybe Kylie and Travis didn\u2019t enjoy themselves as much as they should have, but plenty of other fans were beyond thrilled about the performance. \u201cJLo, watching your performance and then your speech made me even prouder than I already was,\u201d said one heartfelt tweet. \u201cKeep rocking like you\u2019ve always done, you will forever be my inspiration and I love you.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jennifer-lopez-kylie-jenner-travis.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jennifer-lopez-kylie-jenner-travis.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kylie-jenner-travis-scott-jennifer-lopez-vmas-164963/", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Look Bored During Jennifer Lopez's VMAs Performance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "How can you be bored at the Video Music Awards?!
