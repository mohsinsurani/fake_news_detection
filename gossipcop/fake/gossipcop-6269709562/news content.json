It\u2019s been almost two months since she split from her ex-boyfriend The Weeknd (real name: Abel Tesfaye) and even though they\u2019ve both moved on, there\u2019s one major thing that the former couple is still fighting about \u2014 the dog that they adopted while they were still together! Sources exclusively reveal to Life & Style that Sel thinks she should keep their Cavalier King Charles Spaniel pup, Charlie, \u201cand so does Abel.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelena is angry,\u201d says the source, \u201cbecause she feels like it was more of a gift from Abel to her than a mutually adopted pet, so she\u2019s determined to keep it.\u201d\n\nSelena Gomez gave her dog Charlie a kiss while on set of her untitled film project.

It also seemed like they shared custody of the pup even though Selena is the only one who had been spotted with Charlie in public. But it seems like Abel has grown attached to Charlie too, and he shared photos of the adorable dog on his Instagram story before their split.\n\nSelena got Charlie just days after she announced that she had spent the summer recovering from a kidney transplant as a result of her battle with lupus, so it seems like Charlie helped her get through that health scare. But now that she\u2019s feeling better, Sel is getting back to work on an untitled project with controversial filmmaker Woody Allen and that\u2019s why Abel thinks he should be the one to have custody of Charlie.\n\n\u201cHe thinks Selena won\u2019t be able to take care of Charlie as well as he will because of her schedule,\u201d the source says, adding that Selena isn\u2019t listening \u2014 and she won\u2019t give up Charlie without a fight. \u201cShe is in love with her puppy.\u201d\n\nFor more on your favorite celebrities, pick up the new issue of Life & Style on stands now!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-dog-charlie.jpg?fit=400%2C292&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C292", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-dog-the-weekend.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-dog-the-weekend.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/selena-gomez-dog-the-weeknd-148366/", "title": "Selena Gomez and The Weeknd Fighting Over Custody of Their Dog", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The heart wants what it wants \u2014 and Selena Gomez's heart just wants her puppy back!
