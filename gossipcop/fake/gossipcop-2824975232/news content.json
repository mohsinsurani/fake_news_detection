A source tells HollywoodLife.com, \u2018Yes.\u2019\n\nUPDATE: It looks like a break wasn\u2019t even needed! At least, not a long one. Justin and Selena reunited for a hot pilates date on Jan. 3\u2026 less than 24 hours after their fight upon their return to California. A night apart from each other must have done the trick! See the pics here.\n\nThis is probably hard for diehard Jelena fans to hear, but HollywoodLife.com has learned EXCLUSIVELY from a source close to the couple that Justin Bieber, 23, and Selena Gomez, 25, need some alone time after their Cabo vacation together. The couple reportedly had a fight aboard their private jet on the way home from vacation in Cabo San Lucas. They were spotted arguing on the tarmac when they arrived in LA, too!\n\nEvery couple needs a little space after a huge fight, but was Justin and Selena\u2019s argument explosive enough that they\u2019re already ending their rekindled relationship? Not so fast, the source says! \u201cThey are good, they are still in a relationship even after their fight,\u201d the source told us EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThe fight they had was legit but all they just need now is some time away from each other. They have seen each other a little too much and they need a short break, but no one should worry because they aren\u2019t breaking up.\u201d\n\nBreathe, Jelena fans! It sounds like all is going to be okay! And we\u2019re so glad about that. These two seem like they\u2019re so in love after years apart. In fact, as HollywoodLife.com learned EXCLUSIVELY from a separate source, Selena is so enamored with Justin that she\u2019s been calling him her \u201chusband!\u201d Despite her family\u2019s disapproval of their relationship, Selena is still determined to make their relationship work. \u201c[Justin\u2019s] changed and she knows that in time everyone will see that for themselves,\u201d the source said.\n\nHollywoodLife.com reached out to Justin and Selena\u2019s reps for comment.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Justin and Selena are going to break up?
