It truly is the end of an era.\n\nRELATED STORY (Image credit: Getty Images) Angelina Jolie Talks Relationship with Brad Pitt\n\nRecently, news broke that Jolie had been seeing a new man (opens in new tab), amid rumors that Pitt has been dating new people too. A source revealed (opens in new tab) to Entertainment Tonight in March 2018 that, \"Angie has told some friends she isn't ready to date, but she has been seeing a handsome, older-looking man who is a real estate agent.\"\n\nAnd now, the Daily Mail (opens in new tab) reports that the former couple has \"agreed on terms\" for their divorce, and that they \"are believed to have finally made their relationship 'respectful' for the sake of their six children.\" Sadly, it looks like Pitt and Jolie are never, ever getting back together.\n\n(Image credit: Getty Images)\n\nThe Sun (opens in new tab) is also reporting that the divorce is imminent, and that the progress Jolie and Pitt have made is actually really positive: \"It\u2019s a huge turnaround from where the marriage ended, especially given the claims Angelina made against Brad, but they are now on pretty good terms.\" The pair are ready to co-parent their six kids, but move on romantically.\n\nThe divorce news follows reports that Pitt has made some positive changes in his life since his dramatic split from Jolie. As People (opens in new tab) noted last month, \"Brad seems to be in a better place. The separation was very dark for him, but lately he looks healthier and happier. He seems excited about life.\"", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvaimWPTkvo7xDHLsr3m6X-1200-80.jpg", "http://www.marieclaire.com/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/marieclaireus/missing-image.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/XyMu9wUB29p4DhJ4ZfZJMb-415-80.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvaimWPTkvo7xDHLsr3m6X-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Mackelden", "Iris Goldsztajn", "Mehera Bonner", "The Editors", "Andrea Park", "Katherine J Igoe", "Bianca Rodriguez", "Neha Prakash", "Rachel Epstein", "Window.Slicecomponents"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a19655273/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-finalized/", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Will Be Finalized Very Soon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2018-04-02T05:19:46+00:00", "description": "Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie moving on by finalizing divorce: \"They are now on pretty good terms.\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/l0uowirhzd1627591128.svg", "og": {"site_name": "Marie Claire Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvaimWPTkvo7xDHLsr3m6X-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Will Be Finalized Very Soon", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a19655273/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-finalized/", "description": "\"They are now on pretty good terms.\""}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire", "published_time": "2018-04-02T05:19:46Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-02T05:19:46.260Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "f2G4HQaa3rdw6PbxVkEs6M", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-04-02T05:19:46Z", "parsely-title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Will Be Finalized Very Soon", "parsely-link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a19655273/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-finalized/", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvaimWPTkvo7xDHLsr3m6X.jpg", "parsely-section": "Celebrity", "parsely-tags": "Category: Celebrity,Category: News,celebrity,standard-article,serversidehawk", "parsely-author": "Amy Mackelden", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@marieclaireus", "title": "Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt's Divorce Will Be Finalized Very Soon", "description": "\"They are now on pretty good terms.\"", "creator": "@marieclaireus", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/uvaimWPTkvo7xDHLsr3m6X-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 15469402}, "google-site-verification": "G8uYPAX70T_vfdmDhxnUNSykxtjRTkSvHhloGBWT6R8", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a19655273/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-divorce-finalized/"}, "botify-site-verification": "gEo2ltw4ZxjJkBcaADHlIGePpMrucY2w", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522646386.0, "source": "http://www.marieclaire.com", "summary": ""}
