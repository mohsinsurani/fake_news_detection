Coral bookmakers in the U.K. had to suspend betting on the actor, The Guardian reports, after a huge bet launched the actor\u2019s perceived chances from 2-1 to 1-2. Similarly, the Ireland-based independent bookmaker BoyleSports announced Sunday in a press release that they\u2019d also been forced to suspend betting after Hiddleston\u2019s support skyrocketed. It seems, regardless of what anyone claims, the world is really trying to will this casting decision into existence\u2014and really, who can blame anyone for trying?\n\nAccording to BoyleSports\u2019s release, Hiddleston was the 6-4 favorite for them before the whirlwind of bets\u2014including one four-figure online bet from the U.K. Hiddleston was his nearest rival at 5-2, followed by Idris Elba and Damian Lewis, who were tied at 5-1.\n\n\u201cJudging by the gamble on Tom Hiddleston we expect that it\u2019s only a matter of days before he is announced as Daniel Craig\u2019s replacement,\u201d BoyleSports representative Liam Glynn said in the press release. That might be a little hyperbolic, and lacking in knowledge of how Hollywood business deals usually work, but it\u2019s easy to see why Glynn is excited. Hiddleston speculation\u2014and betting\u2014has been on the rise at least since March.\n\nEarlier this month, Hiddleston delivered a typically charming deflection of the rumors he was being eyed as Bond on The Graham Norton Show. \u201cI promise, no one\u2019s talked to me about it,\u201d he said with a chuckle. It\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s had to deny it, and it won\u2019t be the last. But this particular surge probably springs from the fact that a \u201csource\u201d told the Daily Mail that Hiddleston had been spotted meeting with Bond director Sam Mendes. Mendes, for his part, has already said he\u2019s really done with the franchise this time following Spectre. And of course, Hiddleston\u2019s reps have already said the storied meeting was \u201ccompletely false.\u201d\n\nSo, where does this leave Bond fans? Basically, right back where they started\u2014waiting to find out whether or not Daniel Craig is actually done with the role, and brainstorming all of his enticing potential replacements. Except, you know, with no bets for a little while.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/632272a609f6acbba8ee6b0c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined",
