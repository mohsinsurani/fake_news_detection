That being said, it looks as though their relationship is growing strained as they pursue successful solo careers.\n\nAccording to HollywoodLife, Zayn is growing increasingly fearful that Harry\u2019s new solo material will outshine his own. A source close to the \u201cPillow Talk\u201d singer revealed that he\u2019s \u201cbeen flying high on his success as a solo artist, but he\u2019s stressing now that Harry\u2019s coming out with a new album. He\u2019s worried that Harry is going to steal his thunder and overshadow what he\u2019s worked so hard for.\u201d Check out the video teaser for Harry\u2019s debut single, due out April 7th.\n\nPlay\n\nVideo Video related to is there a feud brewing between zayn malik & harry styles? 2017-03-27T18:25:42-04:00\n\nThe source goes on to say that \u201cOut of all the 1D guys, Harry is the one Zayn has always felt the most competitive with, and with good reason. He\u2019s been hearing from music insiders that Harry\u2019s new work is the bomb, it\u2019s edgy, it\u2019s different, and it\u2019s going to dominate the charts.\u201d Zayn\u2019s exit from the group was amicable in 2015, and there was never any ill will towards his One Direction peers, as he told The Sun: \u201cI feel like I\u2019m doing what\u2019s right\u2013 right by myself and right by the boys, so I feel good.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, will the stress of Harry\u2019s musical buzz lead to a legitimate musical feud? Both albums are tentatively scheduled for sometime this summer, only furthering what seems to be a competitive rollout in the making. In the meantime, listen to Zayn\u2019s latest single, \u201cStill Got Time,\u201d below.", "images": ["https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/zayn-malik-and-harry-styles-photos-by-kevork-djansezian-and-eamonn-m-mccormackgetty.jpg?quality=65&strip=all", "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/zayn-malik-and-harry-styles-photos-by-kevork-djansezian-and-eamonn-m-mccormackgetty1.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20567959cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/justin-bieber-zayn-malik-photos-by-gustavo-caballero-and-pascal-le-segretaingetty1.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=242&h=161&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/bf922f581d064252c8ce95fd95bd5c4c?s=71&d=mm&r=pg"], "top_img": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/zayn-malik-and-harry-styles-photos-by-kevork-djansezian-and-eamonn-m-mccormackgetty1.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Danilo Castro"], "canonical_link": "https://heavy.com/music/2017/03/is-there-a-feud-brewing-between-zayn-malik-and-harry-styles-new-music/", "title": "Is There A Feud Brewing Between Zayn Malik & Harry Styles?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 360, "msapplication-TileColor": "#121212", "theme-color": "#121212", "description": "Rumors are surfacing that there could be a musical competition between the former One Direction stars.", "news_keywords": "zayn malik, zayn malik new album, harry styles, harry styles new album", "keywords": "zayn malik, zayn malik new album, harry styles, harry styles new album", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, noodp, noydir", "msvalidate.01": "D36F6DC077CF4906C4E074037A94917B", "author": "Danilo Castro", "og": {"type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://heavy.com/music/2017/03/is-there-a-feud-brewing-between-zayn-malik-and-harry-styles-new-music/", "title": "Is There A Feud Brewing Between Zayn Malik & Harry Styles?", "description": "Rumors are surfacing that there could be a musical competition between the former One Direction stars.", "image": "https://heavy.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/zayn-malik-and-harry-styles-photos-by-kevork-djansezian-and-eamonn-m-mccormackgetty1.jpg?quality=65&strip=all&w=780", "site_name": "Heavy.com"}, "article": {"author": "https://heavy.com/author/danilocastro213/", "published_time": "2017-03-27T18:25:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-03-27T18:40:11+00:00", "section": "Music", "tag": "Zayn Malik", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/heavycom"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1103740676351644, "admins": 1041016861}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@heavyonsports", "creator": "@heavyonsports", "url": "https://heavy.com/music/2017/03/is-there-a-feud-brewing-between-zayn-malik-and-harry-styles-new-music"}, "publisher": "Heavy", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "google-site-verification": "nfPVut3DNEWv3BaV0stQ8yOV3TeBg_TWFdQzQYaG8Qs"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1490639142.0, "source": "http://heavy.com", "summary": ""}
