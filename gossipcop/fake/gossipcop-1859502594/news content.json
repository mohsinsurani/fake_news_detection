Rob Kardashian competed in the 13th season and became the first runner-up.\n\nWhile recruiting the trans activist could be a good idea for ratings, we\u2019re told insiders are worried about potential backlash because of her political views. Jenner has been confronted before over her opinions. In June 2017, Amanda Seales took her to task at Katy Perry\u2019s \u201cFriends and Family: Dinner with Discourse\u201d event.\n\nWhen asked about the casting news, ABC told Page Six in a statement, \u201cWe do not confirm or comment on casting rumors. We\u2019ll be announcing our cast closer to our premiere date.\u201d Season 26 is expected to premiere this spring.\n\nJenner\u2019s rep simply said, \u201cNot true.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/caitlyn-jenner.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/caitlyn-jenner.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/caitlyn-jenner.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/01/24/dancing-with-the-stars-is-courting-caitlyn-jenner/", "title": "\u2018Dancing with the Stars\u2019 is courting Caitlyn Jenner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
