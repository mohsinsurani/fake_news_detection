From an early age Urban\u2019s influences reflected the tastes of his parents, who enjoyed country music.[10] His father, who owned a convenience store, put an ad for a guitar teacher in his shop window.[11] Urban took lessons from his teacher, Sue McCarthy,[12] and began entering local competitions, in addition to acting in a local theatre company.[1] Urban has stated that his guitar playing was influenced by two rock players, Mark Knopfler (Dire Straits) and Lindsey Buckingham (Fleetwood Mac).\n\nIn 1983, Urban was a contestant on the Australian TV talent show New Faces.[13] A few years later, he began making inroads into the Australian country music scene, with regular appearances on the Reg Lindsay Country Homestead TV Program, Mike McClellan's Music Program, and various other TV programmes performing duets with local Brisbane girl Jenny Wilson. They won a Golden Guitar award at the Tamworth Country Music Festival. Urban also performed regularly on stage at the Northern Suburbs Country Music Club in Bald Hills, where he was a member.

Allmusic's Thom Jurek described the first and third singles favorably, and praised the instrumental track \"Rollercoaster\", saying that Urban was \"flat picking his Stratocaster like it was another extremity he was born with.\" He thought that those songs \"balance the slick and sometimes too-soft production on the record\".[24]\n\n2002\u20132006: Golden Road and Be Here [ edit ]\n\nUrban in 2004\n\nUrban released his second American album, Golden Road, in 2002.

By late 2004, this song became Urban's fifth number one hit on the country chart. Although it was not officially released, \"You Look Good in My Shirt\" spent one week at number 60 on the country charts in July 2004[33] and remained a fan favourite.[32] The next single from this album was the #2 \"You're My Better Half\", followed by the five-week number 1 \"Making Memories of Us\", which was written by Rodney Crowell and previously recorded by both Tracy Byrd[34] and Crowell's side project The Notorious Cherry Bombs.[35] The next singles from this album were \"Better Life\" and \"Tonight I Wanna Cry\".

That same month, Urban recorded a new version of \"You Look Good in My Shirt\" and released it as a single in June of that year. \"Over the years it (\"You Look Good In My Shirt\") has always played like a hit song,\" Urban said. \"That, combined with numerous requests from both fans and radio about why it was never a single, inspired us to get back into the studio and re-record the song.\" The single was a precursor to the \"Love, Pain & the Whole Crazy World Tour\" concert DVD release in the fall of 2008. Later that year, Urban served as a duet artist for Brad Paisley's single \"Start a Band,\" on which both he and Paisley sang and played guitar.
