On his track \u201cFinesse,\u201d Drizzy talks about a former gyal that he can\u2019t help but think about, saying he wants his baby to have her eyes.\n\nCertain lines talking about Fashion Week and saying it\u2019s \u201cmore your thing than mine\u201d are leading many to believe he could be referring to his rumoured past fling with Bella Hadid. \u201cI can\u2019t even lie, I\u2019d rather stay inside/I can\u2019t do suit and tie/Can\u2019t be in a room with you and stand on different sides,\u201d he sings. \u201cOne thing at a time/I have to learn to hide/One thing at a time/Emotions running high/I wish you felt alright.\u201d\n\nHe adds, \u201cyou and your sister/Too hot to handle,\u201d that could very well be referring to Bella\u2019s older sister, Gigi Hadid.
