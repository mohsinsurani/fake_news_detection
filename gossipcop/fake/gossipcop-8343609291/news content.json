Muguruza, 23, won in straight sets: 7-5, 6-0.\n\n\"I tried my best to do the same things you do,\" Williams later said in a message to her pregnant younger sister Serena Williams, who was absent from play this year at the All England Club. \"I think there'll be other opportunities, I do.\"\n\nVenus Williams on Centre Court at Wimbledon on Saturday. Tim Ireland / AP\n\nWilliams hadn't won a Wimbledon championship since 2008, when she defeated her sister. She was also going for her eighth Grand Slam singles trophy overall.\n\nFollow More at NBC Sports\n\nHer loss follows a difficult few weeks for the 10th-seeded American, who was involved in a car crash on June 9 near her home in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nA passenger in the other vehicle, 78-year-old Jerome Barson, was rushed to the hospital, but died from his injuries 13 days later.\n\nBarson's estate has filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Williams seeking unspecified damages. Linda Barson, 68, who was driving the car, suffered numerous fractures to her arm.\n\nIt was later determined by police that Williams legally entered the intersection, but was cut off by another car \u2014 setting off a chain of events that led to the fatal crash with the Barsons.\n\nWhen asked about the incident at a press conference at Wimbledon last week, the veteran player burst into tears and briefly left the room to compose herself.\n\nRelated: Venus Williams Legally Entered Intersection Before Crash, Police Say\n\nIn a message posted on her Facebook last month, Williams wrote: \"I am devastated and heartbroken by this accident. My heartfelt condolences go out to the family and friends of Jerome Barson and I continue to keep them in my thoughts and prayers.\"\n\nWilliams remained focused during the tournament. In the first women's final played under the Centre Court roof, a high-quality first set gradually built toward a captivating conclusion.\n\nIn the first set, Muguruza saved two set points in the 10th game, the first a 19-stroke rally that ended when Williams netted a forehand. The Spaniard broke in the following game when another lung-bursting rally ended on a forehand error from the American.\n\nGarbine Muguruza of Spain celebrates victory with the trophy alongside runner-up Venus Williams.

As time passed, many questioned whether Williams might retire, but she kept going and has been on a consistent winning streak over the past year.\n\nThe turning point came at Wimbledon last year when she it made it to the semifinals. Then in January, Williams reached the final of the Australian Open, losing to her sister, who was eight weeks pregnant at the time.\n\nThis year, Williams avoided a contest with Serena, who is taking a hiatus from the sport while pregnant.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_28/2073951/170715-venus-williams.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_28/2073966/wimbledon.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3190971/190708-saphora-smith-byline-753.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_28/2073951/170715-venus-williams.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201707/f_la_venus_crash_170707.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_28/2073951/170715-venus-williams.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms", "Saphora Smith", "Saphora Smith Is A London-Based Reporter For Nbc News Digital."], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/venus-williams-after-wimbledon-loss-spain-s-garbi-e-muguruza-n783331", "title": "Venus Williams After Wimbledon Loss to Spain's Garbi\u00f1e Muguruza: 'I Tried My Best'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/sports/venus-williams-after-wimbledon-loss-spain-s-garbi-e-muguruza-n783331", "title": "Venus Williams to Serena after Wimbledon loss: 'I tried my best'", "description": "Williams hadn't won a Wimbledon championship since 2008, when she defeated her sister.
