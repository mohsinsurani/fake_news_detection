A palace source reveals the 35-year-old doesn\u2019t want her offspring lumped together.\n\n\u201c[She wants the twins to] be seen as individuals and allowed to develop their own personalities,\u201d the source shares. And, like she did with Prince George, 4, and Princess Charlotte, 2, Kate is keeping the gender(s) under wraps, but those closest to her say she\u2019s having identical girls.\n\nThough fans have been on the lookout for clues based on the brunette beauty\u2019s wardrobe, she\u2019s been all over the map! In her first public appearance since the pregnancy announcement in September, Kate wore a blue Temperley long-sleeved dress, but followed that up a week later with a pale pink Orla Kiely frock.\n\nKate and husband Prince William are currently in the process of designing duel nurseries for their new additions, who are due in April. \u201cThe twins will sleep in separate bedrooms but will share a playroom with George and Charlotte,\u201d the palace source explains. \u201cKate feels that it\u2019s important for her eldest two to bond with the newborns. She\u2019s obviously worried that George and Charlotte will be jealous of the babies, especially Charlotte, who loves being the center of attention. But Kate knows that sibling rivalry is all part of the process of growing up.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s still suffering from hyperemesis gravidarum, or severe morning sickness, but recently gushed about William\u2019s attentiveness. \u201cI\u2019m very lucky. He looks after me as much as possible,\u201d Kate said.\n\nLife & Style previously revealed that despite being fifth and sixth in line for the throne, the twins\u2019 births could affect the rules of succession. They were previously changed in March 2015 to ignore gender bias, so even if Kate does have one girl and one boy, whichever one is born first would be next in line behind Charlotte.", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kate-middleton-baby-bump.jpg?fit=400%2C575&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C575", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kate-middleton-twins-7.jpg?resize=1000%2C566&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kate-middleton-twins-7.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kate-middleton-twins-7.jpg?resize=1000%2C566&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Life", "Style Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/kate-middleton-twins-145821/", "title": "Kate Middleton\u2019s Twins Won\u2019t Wear Matching Outfits (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "As Life & Style exclusively reported, Kate Middleton is pregnant with twins, but don't expect the royal \u2014 who loves to coordinate her kids' clothes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Middleton\u2019s Twins Won\u2019t Wear Matching Outfits (EXCLUSIVE)", "description": "As Life & Style exclusively reported, Kate Middleton is pregnant with twins, but don\u2019t expect the royal \u2014 who loves to coordinate her kids\u2019 clothes \ufffd\ufffd\ufffd to dress her babies exactly alike.
