Alec Baldwin and his wife, Hilaria, welcomed their first son, Rafael, in the early morning hours of June 17.\n\n\u201cI thought I couldn\u2019t be in labor,\u201d yoga pro Hilaria tells Us Weekly of her early morning pains. Earlier that same day a doctor had told the spouses of three years that their baby boy was still two weeks away from arriving.\n\nBut it turns out the doc was wrong and Hilaria had a 23-hour labor ahead of her. The 31-year-old cofounder of NYC\u2019s Yoga Vida admitted she was in tears after the birth of her son while Alec, 57, was in awe.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s his first son,\u201d she says.\u201dHe can\u2019t even believe it,\u201d adding, \u201cAlec does other things, not change diapers.\u201d\n\nThe family of four, including the couple\u2019s 22-month-old daughter Carmen, posed for an exclusive newborn photo shoot taken by Hilaria\u2019s pal Eroula Dimitriou in the couple\u2019s NYC home.\n\n\u201cShe wants to kiss him, hold him, sing to him, and feed him food he can\u2019t eat,\u201d Hilaria tells Us of Carmen. \u201cShe\u2019s a good big sister.\u201d\n\nAs for the family\u2019s plans to expand (Alec is also dad to 19-year-old Ireland Baldwin with ex-wife Kim Basinger), Hilaria notes, \u201cI think we\u2019ll have one more eventually.\u201d\n\nFor more photos of the Baldwin\u2019s beautiful family photo shoot, pick up the latest issue of Us Weekly on stands now!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1435855182_alec-baldwin-hilaria-baldwin-carmen-rafael-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1435855182_alec-baldwin-hilaria-baldwin-carmen-rafael-zoom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1435855182_alec-baldwin-hilaria-baldwin-carmen-rafael-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Rachel Mcrady", "Jennifer Peros"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/alec-hilaria-baldwin-introduce-baby-son-rafael-first-photos-201527/", "title": "Alec, Hilaria Baldwin Introduce Baby Son Rafael: See the First Photos!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Photos", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Alec and Hilaria Baldwin welcomed their son Rafael on June 17 -- see the adorable first photos of the family, including big sister Carmen!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "See the First Photos of Alec and Hilaria Baldwin's Baby Son Rafael!", "description": "Alec and Hilaria Baldwin welcomed their son Rafael on June 17 -- see the adorable first photos of the family, including big sister Carmen!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/alec-hilaria-baldwin-introduce-baby-son-rafael-first-photos-201527/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T05:26:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1435855182_alec-baldwin-hilaria-baldwin-carmen-rafael-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1435855182_alec-baldwin-hilaria-baldwin-carmen-rafael-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2015-07-02T16:01:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T05:26:05+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "See the First Photos of Alec and Hilaria Baldwin's Baby Son Rafael!", "description": "Alec and Hilaria Baldwin welcomed their son Rafael on June 17 -- see the adorable first photos of the family, including big sister Carmen!", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1435855182_alec-baldwin-hilaria-baldwin-carmen-rafael-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1435852862.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
