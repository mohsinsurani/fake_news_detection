Says Cellulite makes her feel more feminine! Share this\n\nCaitlyn Jenner, the TV personality, and a former Olympic gold medal-winning decathlon champion is having a different sense of the quality of expressing her womanhood.\n\nShe says that the cellulite in her thighs, hips, and tummy is giving her a different sense of joy, and can\u2019t wait to show it off.\n\nA weird article\n\nThe headline \u201cCellulite Makes Cait Feel So Womanly!\u201d from the National Enquirer/RadarOnline is trending these days. And do you want to know what the article says? You must have some info about this!\n\nIt said:\n\n\u201cCaitlyn Jenner is telling friends she can\u2019t wait to wear a bikini this summer to show off some skin, and her recently acquired cellulite!\u201d\n\nThat seems really weird, doesn\u2019t it? I mean showing it off in a bikini for what? After all, many people try to hide their cellulite and here Jenner is going to a different path.\n\nShe is WAITING for the summer just to show it off! Just to remind you, the article also called her a \u201cblabbermouth\u201d. And I don\u2019t think it could be wrong.

Let\u2019s see what the article had to say other than that.\n\nIt said:\n\n\u201cShe has this weird sense of joy when she sees patches of cellulite on her thighs, hips and tummy. The sight of lumpy flesh doesn\u2019t upset her. It makes her feel more feminine!\u201d\n\nMaybe Caitlyn is trying to respect her body by respecting what she has. You can\u2019t just disrespect your body for having a lumpy flesh.\n\nIt is your body after all and if you disrespect it by yourself and obviously you can\u2019t expect respect from others, can you? And who knows, maybe that lumpy dimpled flesh will look really feminine on her.\n\nIt is creating a buzz in the media as this is not what you hear from a TV personality every day. After all, every ordinary people might have cellulite in their body.\n\nIt also said that Jenner\u2019s view: \u201cdimpled feminine flesh as a rite of passage into true womanhood.\u201d And it was also reported that she wouldn\u2019t mind having more cellulite in her body in the future.\n\nThe story features a zoomed-in photo of purported cellulite on Jenner\u2019s leg. Also, after all these years of being a decathlete and going through dieting for years, Jenner might not want to do it anymore.\n\n\u201cSo let it be!\u201d is what she might have been thinking. Also, the other reason may be her daughter Kim\u2019s cellulite pictures that surfaced online.
