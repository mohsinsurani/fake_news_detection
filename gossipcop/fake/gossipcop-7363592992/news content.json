Weddings aren\u2019t about you, they\u2019re about the guests, so I want for our family and friends to come together and have an incredible time celebrating our love,\u201d he said.\n\nAbasolo previously teased the possibility of having two ceremonies: one in Dallas, where the couple lives, and one in Colombia, where he is from.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t know,\u201d he admitted. \u201cColombia has come on to the radar recently.\u201d\n\nEditor\u2019s note: In our original post of this article, we misquoted Rachel Lindsay.
