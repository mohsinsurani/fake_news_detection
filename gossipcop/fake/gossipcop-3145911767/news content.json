At least that's according to an article that appeared in Life & Style. The online tabloid claims that an \"inside source\" spilled the beans, allegedly telling them that Aniston spent $200,000 on beauty since she's become single. But celebrity rumor watchdog Gossip Cop is on the case, and they say that the story is untrue.\n\nAs Gossip Cop notes, Life & Style claims that the $200,000 price tag includes the costs of personal trainers, Botox, fillers, and other products. The tabloid's \"source\" says that Jen started investing heavily in these beauty treatments back in February, and that her goal was to show Justin \"what he's missing.\" According to Gossip Cop, the article then quotes a plastic surgeon, who said that Jennifer looks like she has had Botox and microneedling done on her face.\n\nBut the doctor they cited has never treated Aniston, which is a red flag about the credibility of the source and the article. Gossip Cop reports that they checked with Aniston's rep, who said that Jennifer is not spending big bucks on beauty treatments so that she can get revenge on her former flame.\n\nPeople Magazine has previously reported that Jennifer Aniston is moving on from the split and made no mention of expensive cosmetic procedures. A source told People that Jennifer and Justin have had some contact since they broke up, but that they have no plans to resume their romantic relationship. Justin is back in New York, the magazine's insider says, while Jennifer has remained in Los Angeles. They also added that the former Friends actress's life hasn't really changed now that she's single again. She's still \"socializing with friends,\" and otherwise enjoying her life. Aniston is also in a new movie called, The Yellow Birds.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-split-divorce-rebound-plastic-surgery-brad-pitt.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/14800743-abae-4146-ae2e-3b7a37ab5d23.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-split-divorce-rebound-plastic-surgery-brad-pitt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4891029/jennifer-aniston-did-not-get-200000-in-cosmetic-procedures-after-justin-theroux-split-debunked/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Did Not Get $200,000 In Cosmetic Procedures After Justin Theroux Split [Debunked]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Aniston Did Not Get $200,000 In Cosmetic Procedures After Justin Theroux Split [Debunked]", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4891029/jennifer-aniston-did-not-get-200000-in-cosmetic-procedures-after-justin-theroux-split-debunked/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Jennifer Aniston Did Not Get $200,000 In Cosmetic Procedures After Justin Theroux Split [Debunked]", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-breakup-split-divorce-rebound-plastic-surgery-brad-pitt.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-05-06 21:38:15Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Jennifer Aniston Did Not Get $200,000 In Cosmetic Procedures After Justin Theroux Split [Debunked]", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525642695.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
