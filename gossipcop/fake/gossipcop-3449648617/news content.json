Jill and I, and all of the Bidens, are with you, Julia. pic.twitter.com/JP0c2wtrJ6 \u2014 Joe Biden (@JoeBiden) September 28, 2017\n\nAs you may recall, the former vice president made a madcap \"Veep\"-themed video with Louis-Dreyfus in 2014 for the White House Correspondents' Dinner, and the duo shared a meal or two along the way. So of course Louis-Dreyfus made sure to tweet him back:\n\n.@JoeBiden yes we do. Love back to all of you https://t.co/Vgwm0Vxgsc \u2014 Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) September 28, 2017\n\nBut Biden was far from the only politico to reach out via social media:\n\nJulia, you're in our thoughts and our hearts. Inspired but not surprised to see you using your platform for good in this difficult moment. \u2014 Hillary Clinton (@HillaryClinton) September 28, 2017\n\nAnd Meghan McCain, the newly-announced \"View\" co-host and daughter of Senator John McCain, wrote: \"Sending so much love and strength to Julia Louis-Dreyfus @OfficialJLD and her family.\"\n\nOf course, her co-workers past and present stepped up with condolences and good wishes:\n\n@OfficialJLD so sorry you have to go thru this, pal, but I know you will prevail. We are here if/when you need and we love you. \ufe0f \u2014 jason alexander (@IJasonAlexander) September 29, 2017\n\nWhile fellow former \"Seinfeld\" star Michael Richards told People magazine, \"I wish Julia godspeed and a full recovery.\"\n\nWe love this woman. pic.twitter.com/EqvF6HXpj0 \u2014 Tony Hale (@MrTonyHale) September 28, 2017\n\nShe is one of the strongest and caring people I know. Nothing can stop her. Not even this. https://t.co/SAUd3kfp6j \u2014 Sam Richardson (@SamRichardson) September 28, 2017\n\nIt is possible to be dignified and fierce at the same time. I, and millions others, send Julia our love and support. https://t.co/XpVsiQrmj6 \u2014 Armando Iannucci (@Aiannucci) September 28, 2017\n\nCo-star Usman Ally wrote, \"Much love and positivity from me to you @OfficialJLD You are incredible.\"\n\nAnd other fellow actors and comedians also posted words of encouragement and love:\n\nJ sending all my healing energy your way. You are incredible to use this moment as an opportunity to support others. Thank you. Much love xd https://t.co/okgfVDUeAW \u2014 Debra Messing (@DebraMessing) September 28, 2017\n\n\ufe0f\ufe0fso sorry and so in awe https://t.co/eHIrXiKm3h \u2014 Sarah Silverman (@SarahKSilverman) September 28, 2017\n\nMama, find me. Let's talk if you want \u2014 christina applegate (@1capplegate) September 28, 2017\n\nThoughts and prayers are with you, Julia. God bless you. Stay strong. https://t.co/OmDpPvnHiR \u2014 Rita Wilson (@RitaWilson) September 28, 2017\n\nI am heartbroken today to hear about @OfficialJLD but I know that if anyone is strong enough to fight this & beat it, it\u2019s her. We love you. \u2014 Josh Gad (@joshgad) September 28, 2017\n\nLove you @OfficialJLD Thinking of you and all the brave women today. \ufe0f https://t.co/jsv1xwq9VF \u2014 Bobby Moynihan (@bibbymoynihan) September 28, 2017\n\nCancer is no match for you. Stomp it good. xox \u2014 Michael McKean (@MJMcKean) September 28, 2017\n\nSending you love and strength but it appears you beat us to it and are sending the world love and strength. https://t.co/tctqlziwhS \u2014 Judd Apatow (@JuddApatow) September 28, 2017\n\nAnd \"Pitch Perfect\" star Anna Kendrick wrote, \"I don't think I realized how much I love this woman, who I don't know. Love her more for speaking up for others in this moment.\"\n\nMeanwhile, at least one fan has visited Louis-Dreyfus' star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame, only to find it decorated with kind words and stickers, which we heartily endorse:\n\nStopped by to add these to @OfficialJLD Hollywood Star. Nothing but respect for MY President! #RaisedRight pic.twitter.com/RZEFlFDGHx \u2014 Trevor Barnette (@trevor_barnette) September 29, 2017\n\nGood luck on fighting this, Julia, and get well
