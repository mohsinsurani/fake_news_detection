In 2017 though, the pair were photographed together walking hand in hand along a beach in Malibu, California, and everyone thought then that they were going to be more public with their relationship. But as it turns out, they still don\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nHere\u2019s what we know about the ultra-private couple and why they still refuse to speak publicly about each other.\n\nFoxx and Holmes have never confirmed relationship\n\nEven though the cat is out of the bag, Foxx and Holmes have never actually confirmed their relationship. In fact, they did the opposite and denied it on many occasions by pulling the old \u201cjust friends\u201d line.\n\nSo, despite their Labor Day PDA photo, or picture of them grabbing dinner in NYC, or gazing into one another\u2019s eyes at a pre-Grammy event, we shouldn\u2019t expect these two to suddenly do red carpets together anytime soon.\n\nNext: Have they kept quiet because of Tom Cruise?\n\n\n\nDid they stay silent because of a Tom Cruise ban?\n\nFoxx and Holmes initially sparked dating rumors back in 2013, but up until 2012 the actress was married to Tom Cruise. One report claimed that as part of their divorce settlement, Holmes had to keep any new relationship under wraps for five years so Cruise wouldn\u2019t be embarrassed.\n\nThat five-year mark was up in 2017 when the Malibu photo surfaced, but Gossip Cop debunked the allegation of a ban put in place by the Mission Impossible calling it \u201cfiction.\u201d Moreover, if Holmes and Foxx only kept quiet over the years because of some ban, then why wouldn\u2019t they be more public now?\n\nNext: They spend time together out of the spotlight.\n\n\n\nThe couple spends most of their time together at home\n\nWith only of few photos of them out and about, the couple has gone to great lengths to remain under the radar and one way they do that is by spending time together at home.\n\nAn insider told People that on date nights they hang out at their houses in Los Angeles saying, \u201cThey only spend time together at each other\u2019s homes\u201d to avoid the paparazzi.\n\nNext: Foxx isn\u2019t talking.\n\n\n\nFoxx ends interview after being asked about Holmes\n\nDuring NBA All-Star weekend in February 2018, the Oscar winner showed everyone that he doesn\u2019t appreciate being asked about his lady by abruptly ending an interview when a journalist went there.\n\nReferring to some pictures that were published a day earlier, ESPN\u2019s Michael Smith asked, \u201cDid you and Katie Holmes play basketball for Valentine\u2019s Day?\u201d Foxx responded by saying nothing at all and simply removed his microphone and walked away, proving that if you want to talk to him, don\u2019t bring up Holmes.\n\nNext: They made a pact not to speak about their romance.\n\n\n\nThey agreed not to talk about relationship\n\nOne of the main reasons, Foxx and Holmes have chosen not to discuss their love life is because it\u2019s something they agreed upon early on.\n\n\u201cKatie and Jamie have an agreement that they\u2019ll never talk about their relationship or each other in the press,\u201d a source close to the Dawson\u2019s Creek alum explained to Us Weekly.\n\nThe source added that Holmes was happy with the way Foxx handled the ESPN interview because she \u201cfelt he was respecting their agreement.\u201d\n\nNext: They are still going strong.\n\n\n\nWhy it works for them\n\nSomething these two have proved is that keeping things private works for them. A source told Us Weekly that their relationship also works \u201cbecause of the love, compassion, trust and support they have for each other.\u201d\n\nThe source further explained that while they \u201clead their own separate lives, they confide in and rely on each other pretty heavily.\u201d\n\nNext: They don\u2019t need to give attention to breakup rumors.\n\n\n\nThey don\u2019t have to deal with cheating, split rumors\n\nFinally, there have been reports about Foxx allegedly cheating on Holmes, and the pair breaking up. But since the couple makes it a point to not talk about their relationship, they never have to address the made up splitsville rumors put out there by the tabloids.\n\nFollow Michelle Kapusta on
