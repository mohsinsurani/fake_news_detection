(Curtis is also a mom to son Ethan, 20, who she shares with ex Steven Cimini.)\n\nHarper \u2014 who Curtis says she is still breastfeeding, though less frequently, as she practices baby-led weaning \u2014 is splitting time between Los Angeles and Michigan, where she films her show, and Maguire, a businessman, is based.", "images":
