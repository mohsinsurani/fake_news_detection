He popped the question and Kate later shared the good news on Instagram with an adorable photo. She captioned the kissing selfie, \"Let\u2019s go! \ud83d\udc70\u200d\u2640\ufe0f\ud83d\udc92\ud83e\udd35\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2642\ufe0f.\"\n\nKate kept the proposal news under wraps for a while, but she revealed all on Sept. 13. And, she debuted her sparkling diamond ring at the Met Gala.\n\nNaturally, the IG comments filled with congrats and well wishes from their friends, family, and fans.Trainer Amanda Kloots wrote, \"Omg congratulations!!!!,\" while journalist Katie Couric added, \"SO happy for you two, congratulations!!! XO \u2764\ufe0f.\" And all Gwyneth Paltrow had to say was \"LETS DO THIS\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f.\"\n\nKate's soon-to-be sister-in-law Sara Foster added, \"Whoa. It\u2019s official \ud83d\ude31. Not gonna lie, been a hard secret to keep. I may have slipped and told a few people. \u2764\ufe0f\"\n\nLucky for Kate, Danny makes her busy life brighter, even when they\u2019re not on the best terms. \"He makes me feel beautiful every single moment of the day, even when we have fought,\" she said in a recent People cover story. \"I still feel loved. His devotion to the family unit makes me feel safe and confident and secure.\"\n\nKate, who has two sons from a previous relationship, in addition to her daughter with Danny, explained that they don\u2019t have a \"traditional setup\" family- or relationship-wise. \"And I have to say, I have zero regrets of my life. I\u2019ve never defined myself through the way that a man sees me. But I can define myself in the unit that we can create together,\" she explained.\n\nA partnership like this doesn't happen by accident, though. Kate, 42, and Danny, 35, have a long, adorable history. Here's everything you need to know about Kate's longtime friend\u2014and now fianc\u00e9 and baby daddy\u2014Danny Fujikawa.\n\nThe two made their red carpet debut as a couple in May 2017...\n\nIt was at the premiere of Snatched in LA, where Kate and Danny first kissed and posed for photos together on a red carpet. \u201cMy cute man. He\u2019s the best!\u201d she told Extra at the premiere.\n\nAnd, when asked what she loves most about him, Kate said, \u201cHow long do you have? He\u2019s a good man.\u201d But rumors about their relationship started popping up in March of the same year, since the couple was spotted kissing during a lunch date in Los Angeles, according to People.\n\n...But Danny and Kate knew each other for years before they started dating.\n\nKate said in an Instagram post in December 2017 that she first met Danny when she was 23 and pregnant with her son, Ryder. Danny's stepsisters are Kate\u2019s best friends, she says, so they\u2019ve been in the same circles for years.\n\n\u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date,\u201d Kate wrote in her Instagram caption. \u201cNo moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter. So on our 15th year of knowing each other we were able to open our hearts to each other to feel so much pure love and it\u2019s been truly incredible!\"\n\n\n\nHe's a total family man.\n\nKate has two children, Ryder Russell Robinson, 17, and Bingham Hawn Bellamy, 10, from previous relationships with Chris Robinson and Matt Bellamy, respectively. She also has a daughter, 2, with Danny. Kate and Danny have found a way to make blended family life work for them.\n\n\u201cIf I have to go to a dinner meeting, he can be home,\u201d Kate told WH. \u201cHis number one priority is family. And when we have our disputes, I feel the thing that allows us to get through them is having the same ultimate goal, and that includes being in each other\u2019s life. It just feels so nice.\u201d\n\nDanny is Kate's support system.\n\nKate Hudson is an absolute powerhouse (see: her interview in the Women's Health December issue for proof). She's an actress, business mogul, and mom of three who still manages to find time for self-care and three to four workouts a week (including pole dancing!). But her crazy schedule wouldn't be nearly as manageable without a little help from her fianc\u00e9.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the best man,\u201d Kate previously told Women's Health. \u201cIt\u2019s the first time I feel like I have a real teammate in this. We\u2019re able to pick up where the other one has to leave off.\u201d\n\nThey welcomed their first child together in October 2018.\n\nThe actress posted a simple Instagram photo that reads: \"10-2-18\" on top of a pink background. \"She\u2019s here \ud83d\udc95,\" Kate shared in the caption.\n\n\n\nKate also wrote that she and Danny decided to name their daughter Rani Rose Hudson Fujikawa. It's their first baby together, btw!\n\n\u201cWe have decided to name our daughter Rani (pronounced Ronnie) after her grandfather, Ron Fujikawa. Ron was the most special man who we all miss dearly. To name her after him is an honor,\u201d Kate wrote in her announcement post.\n\nShe added: \u201cEveryone is doing well and happy as can be. Our family thanks you for all the love and blessings that have been sent our way and we send ours right back.\u201d\n\nThey were very excited for Rani's arrival.\n\nKate told People that she \"[looks] forward to having feminine energy\" around.\n\nAnd her brothers Oliver Hudson and Wyatt Russell confirmed both she and Danny were very excited about their daughter on the way.\n\n\u201cI was teary-eyed because I know how badly she wanted a girl,\u201d he told People in April. \u201cI know Danny, I\u2019m sure in some part of every man\u2019s brain you\u2019re like, \u2018I\u2019d love to have a little me.\u2019\u201d\n\nWyatt added: \u201cBut when he met my brother\u2019s little girl Rio, who\u2019s the cutest thing in the entire world, she made him be like, \u2018Okay, I want a girl.\u2019 So they\u2019re really excited.\u201d\n\nBoth Danny and Kate went into full-blown nesting mode.\n\nIn Kate's Instagram story at the end of September 2018, Kate posted a series of photos that revealed she and Danny were prepping their baby's nursery as they eagerly awaited her arrival.\n\nThe story pics included a poll about wallpaper, a photo of the bassinet they chose for the room, and finally a photo of Danny wearing a baby carrier with the caption \"I think someone's ready to go!\"\n\nThey announced Kate's pregnancy in the cutest (and realest) way.\n\nKate and her honey first announced they were expecting a baby girl together back in April 2018 with an Instagram video. The post showed the couple\u2014along with Kate's sons Ryder and Bingham\u2014popping four huge balloons that contained pink confetti. (Cue everyone screaming.)\n\n\u201cSURPRISE!!! If you\u2019ve wondered why I\u2019ve been so absent on my social channels it\u2019s because I have never been more sick!\u201d Kate wrote in the caption. \u201c[It] was the most sick first trimester of all my children. Boomerangs have made me nauseous, Superzoom is an easy way to have my head in the toilet, food Instagrams make me [queasy] and thinking too much about Insta stories made me even more exhausted than I already had been.\u201d\n\nDanny fits in perfectly with Kate's family.\n\nFollowing the actress's birthday, Kate posted this cute pic with Danny, along with the caption: \"#tbt To my favorite birthday moment. You can\u2019t really see my kiddos in the front but I was getting love from all my boys at once. #FeelingLucky.\"\n\nDanny is a musician.\n\nDanny is another musician\u2014like Kate\u2019s former husband Chris Robinson and ex Matt Bellamy. Danny is the former singer and guitarist for the band Chief.\n\nHe also owns the record label Lightwave Records, which he started in 2013 with The Delta Mirror frontman Chris Acosta, according to the label\u2019s Facebook page.\n\n\n\nHe worked on Kate's promo videos for her clothing line.\n\nDanny can officially add professional Instagram/social media boyfriend to his resume. In a recent post, he shared a video for Kate's clothing line Happy x Nature, that he not only edited but composed the music for too!\n\nHe captioned the video, \"Here lies the teaser I edited and musically composed for my baby\u2019s new \u201cready-to-wear\u201d clothing line. Of all the clothes in the world that are ready to wear, these are the most ready. #happyxnature #THX\"\n\nAnd of course, Kate looks amazing.\n\nHe clearly has a great sense of humor.\n\nKate's boo seems like a pretty hilarious guy. He regularly posts pics on Instagram of himself doing funny things like posing in a sheet mask and \u201ccrying\u201d after he shaved off his long beard.\n\nThey've traveled the world together.\n\nIt's clear from their Instagrams that these two love to travel and share experiences together. The couple have sailed in Cambodia, hit the skii slopes for Valentine\u2019s Day and just recently went to Dubai, where Kate and Danny gave falconry a try.\n\nEven while Kate was six months pregnant with Rani, the couple took a \"babymoon\" trip and traveled through Italy, with friends and family.\n\nAnd they returned to Italy with toddler Rani a few years later, when Kate shared this super cute snap:\n\nNo doubts about it\u2014they're a jet-setting fam.\n\nThey're #workoutbuddy goals, too.\n\nKate's a big fitness fan, and Danny works out right by her side. It's unclear if he joins for all her sweat sessions, but he shared one hilarious gym video on Instagram.\n\nKate's also open to having more kids with Danny.\n\nThe actress chatted about having another baby with Danny on The Ellen Degeneres Show in February. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m done. I\u2019m in that place of like, right now, Rani is at that age where you\u2019re like, \u2018I want another baby.\u2019 But once she gets like 4 or 5, you\u2019re like, \u2018I feel like my life is kinda back a little bit [and] they\u2019re kinda in a groove,\u2019 \u201d she told Ellen. \u201cIt\u2019s weird\u2026 it\u2019s like a window.\u201d\n\nPower couple alert!", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/hbz-katehudson-1523397820.jpg?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.212xw,0&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-of-the-tampa-bay-buccaneers-celebrates-with-news-photo-1663094193.jpg?crop=0.548xw:0.776xh;0.324xw,0.0658xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/natalia-verza-wears-vuitton-sunglasses-a-white-t-shirt-and-news-photo-1663013717.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-hudson-nursery-images-1537457864.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gabby-and-rachel-are-each-down-to-one-man-looking-for-news-photo-1663795755.jpg?crop=0.771xw:0.964xh;0.101xw,0.00601xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/following-last-weeks-shocking-canceled-rose-ceremony-gabby-news-photo-1662990094.jpg?crop=0.612xw:0.766xh;0.191xw,0.0261xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/091322-1663356184.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.240xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-index-2000x1000-relatonship-behati-prinsloo-and-adam-levin-1664559741.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/marilyn-monroe-and-joe-dimaggio-circa-1954-news-photo-1664566741.jpg?crop=0.761xw:1.00xh;0.0849xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gabby-and-rachel-enter-a-crucial-week-of-getting-to-know-news-photo-1663007176.jpg?crop=0.647xw:0.810xh;0.179xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wh-ptm-hhm-lovea-1661374861.png?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ahead-of-the-season-premiere-of-the-bachelorette-press-news-photo-1660246981.jpg?crop=0.378xw:0.473xh;0.317xw,0.0581xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-hudson-arrives-at-the-the-daily-front-rows-5th-annual-news-photo-1579895675.jpg?crop=0.833xw:0.316xh;0,0.0487xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/danny-fujikawa-and-honoree-kate-hudson-attend-wcrfs-an-news-photo-1573758015.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.333xh;0,0.0748xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/woman-having-coffee-and-texting-on-her-phone-at-royalty-free-image-1641918176.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "http://www.womenshealthmag.com/_assets/design-tokens/womenshealthmag/static/images/logos/network-logo.6f764c4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bunch-of-red-heart-shaped-balloons-royalty-free-image-1664470945.jpg?crop=0.667xw:1.00xh;0.215xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/danny-fujikawa-and-honoree-kate-hudson-attend-wcrfs-an-news-photo-1573758015.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.333xh;0,0.0748xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.womenshealthmag.com/relationships/a19704346/danny-fujikawa-kate-hudson-boyfriend/", "title": "Meet Kate Hudson's Fianc\u00e9 & Baby Daddy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Who Is Danny Fujikawa - Meet Kate Hudson's Fianc\u00e9 & Baby Daddy", "description": "Who is Kate Hudson engaged to?
