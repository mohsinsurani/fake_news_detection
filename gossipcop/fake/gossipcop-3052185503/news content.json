While Harington and Leslie announced their news in a very old-fashioned and traditional way (a notice in The Times!), the social media-savvy Jonas and Turner revealed their news Sunday via carefully coordinated Instagram posts.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nJonas and Turner have been dating since at least last November and went public just this past January. Playing coy about her relationship at the Golden Globes that month, Turner flashed a bejeweled finger for the camera and joked: \u201cAnd my engagement ring that isn\u2019t really an engagement ring.\u201d The very famous couple have kept their relationship low key ever since; Jonas attended the Los Angeles premiere of Game of Thrones this past summer with Turner but didn\u2019t walk the red carpet by her side. In fact, the pair have never been photographed together in any official capacity and have only appeared together very rarely on each other\u2019s social media accounts and in paparazzi shots.\n\nGiven their private nature, the couple have not revealed any further details on their engagement\u2014as in how long they are going to wait to tie the knot. Game of Thrones Season 8 will be shooting until summer of 2018 and Harington has reportedly asked production to be put on a brief hold next year so the cast can attend his wedding to Leslie. Perhaps he wants to make it a double wedding with Turner? A double Game of Thrones wedding, what could possibly go wrong?", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59c430a5b84563517d67a0b9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GoT-Set-Location-S7E1-2-Recovered.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/598223b5f3c6f80e768c805a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GoT-Set-Location-S7E1-Itzurun-beach.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/632dc358d0fb4a008fafbae2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e3c2e3093abd063fb4c7c9/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/sophie-turner-joe-jones-engaged.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/631ba0c5c1df471d836f1af4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63373327aecc7e6debb40bc8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59c4331dc40e794e53fa5274/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GoT-Set-Locations-S7E3-Castle-of-Trujillo.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e3c2e3093abd063fb4c7c9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-joe-jones-engaged.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6324a88a6009e759e6639146/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e3c2e3093abd063fb4c7c9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-joe-jones-engaged.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Joanna Robinson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-engaged-joe-jonas-kit-harington-rose-leslie", "title": "Game of Thrones Star Sophie Turner Is Engaged to Joe Jonas", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The couple have been dating just under a year.", "id": "59e3c0606df15f77368261b4", "keywords": "game of thrones,sophie turner ,joe jonas,kit harington,rose leslie", "news_keywords": "game of thrones,sophie turner ,joe jonas,kit harington,rose leslie", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59e3c0606df15f77368261b4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The couple have been dating just under a year.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e3c2e3093abd063fb4c7c9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/sophie-turner-joe-jones-engaged.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e3c2e3093abd063fb4c7c9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/sophie-turner-joe-jones-engaged.png\"}", "og": {"description": "The couple have been dating just under a year.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e3c2e3093abd063fb4c7c9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-joe-jones-engaged.png", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Game of Thrones Star Sophie Turner Is Engaged to Joe Jonas", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/game-of-thrones-sophie-turner-engaged-joe-jonas-kit-harington-rose-leslie"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-15T20:46:52.193Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:46:52.193Z", "author": "Joanna Robinson"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The couple have been dating just under a year.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59e3c2e3093abd063fb4c7c9/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/sophie-turner-joe-jones-engaged.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Game of Thrones Star Sophie Turner Is Engaged to Joe Jonas"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508100412.193, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
