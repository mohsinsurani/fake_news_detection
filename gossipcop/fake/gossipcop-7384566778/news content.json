But a source tells PEOPLE she was there celebrating away from the cameras.\n\n\u201cKylie looked great but didn\u2019t really draw any attention to her baby bump,\u201d the source says. \u201cShe still acts like she wants to keep her pregnancy private.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, her sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, \u2014 who earlier this week confirmed that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson are expecting their first child together \u2014 accentuated her own baby bump in a skin-tight, sparkly jumpsuit with a white fur coat.\n\n\u201cKhlo\u00e9 was beaming all night,\u201d the insider says of the 33-year-old Revenge Body host. \u201cShe kept touching and showing off her cute baby belly.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 showed off her bump on Instagram as well.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!! May you sparkle and shine this festive season, may all of your wishes and dreams come true,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 captioned a gallery of shots showing her touching her belly. \u201cI pray that we all may feel this happiness all year round. God bless you! \u2728 #BabyBump\ud83e\udd17\u201d\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas!!!!! Wishing all of you and your families much Joy Happiness Peace and Health\u2026\u201d Kris added in her own post, a photo of her and Khlo\u00e9 alongside Kendall Jenner. \u201cLove you guys!!!!!!!! #christmas #blessed #ohholynight.\u201d\n\nKhloe Kardashian/Instagram\n\nKim Kardashian West, Kris Jenner and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\n\nKhloe Kardashian/Instagram\n\nKhlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Scott Disic\n\nAside for Khlo\u00e9 and Kendall, Kris\u2019 party also brought together siblings Kim Kardashian West (who\u2019s expecting her third child, via a surrogate), Kourtney Kardashian, and their kids: Kim\u2019s daughter North, 4, and son Saint, 2; and Kourtney son Reign, 3, daughter Penelope, 5, and son Mason, 8.\n\nKourtney\u2019s ex-boyfriend Scott Disick was there, too \u2014 without girlfriend Sofia Richie.\n\n\u201cHe mingled, looked good and didn\u2019t drink,\u201d the source says, adding that there wasn\u2019t any awkwardness with Kourtney\u2019s new boyfriend Younes Bendjima.\n\n\u201cKourtney seemed so happy that Younes joined her,\u201d the insider says. \u201cThey are so cute together. He kept bringing her drinks and doting on her. Younes fits right into the family. He didn\u2019t seem uncomfortable that Scott was there. They said hello, but that was it. It was very civil.\u201d\n\nOther guests included Kim\u2019s husband Kanye West, celebrity hair stylists Jen Atkin and Chris Appleton, singer Christina Aguilera and Keeping Up with the Kardashians executive producer Ryan Seacrest. Kris appeared to be in a good mood throughout the night, dancing with Kim and Khlo\u00e9 and playing MC while Babyface, Toni Braxton and Brian McKnight performed.\n\n\u201cEveryone had the most amazing time,\u201d the source tells PEOPLE. \u201cKris always throws the best parties. It was all gorgeous. There was no drama.\u201d\n\nKhloe Kardashian/Instagram\n\nRob Kardashian and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\n\nKhloe Kardashian/Instagram\n\nKylie Jenner and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\n\nOn Christmas morning, the family gathered at Kourtney\u2019s house to open presents and celebrate the holiday in matching elf-patterned onesies and beanies.\n\n\u201cMerry Christmas! People think you weren\u2019t there last night,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 said to Kylie, 20, in one Snapchat video as the younger sister replied: \u201cI was.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a secret little bunny,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 teased.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: See the Hilarious Christmas Gift Jennifer Lawrence Gave Her \u2018BFF\u2019 Kris Jenner\n\nKylie has yet to confirm her pregnancy publicly. The Kylie Cosmetics owner has kept out of the public eye by sticking close to her house in Calabasas. As a source told PEOPLE in October, \u201cKylie wants to keep a low profile.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe feels good, but her body is changing,\u201d the source continued. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be photographed. At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has company. She\u2019s very excited about the baby, though. She talks about the baby nonstop.\u201d\n\nAnother insider told PEOPLE last month that Kylie is \u201conly trusting her closest friends and her sisters right now.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe wants to reveal things on her own terms but she\u2019s, of course, having fun teasing everyone,\u201d said the insider, referring to her social media presence. \u201cShe knows all the attention is on her and her baby bump, but she won\u2019t share until she wants to.\u201d", "images":
