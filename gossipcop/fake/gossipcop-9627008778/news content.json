The divorce isn\u2019t yet finalized but is progressing, sources have said, as the two have been in mediation with leading L.A. divorce lawyer Laura Wasser to settle privately.\n\nSince then, they have continued to happily co-parent their three children, Violet, 12, Seraphina, 9, and Samuel, 6, and spent Easter weekend together with them in Hawaii, where Affleck has been shooting his new movie Triple Frontier.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re doing well, and are both committed to providing a supportive environment for their kids,\u201d a source close to Affleck tells PEOPLE. \u201cThey continue to remain cordial to one another. There is a lot of love and respect there.\u201d\n\nPascal Le Segretain/Getty; Axelle/Bauer-Griffin/FilmMagic\n\nThe day before the holiday, the whole family made a group trip to Sea Life Park in Oahu. \u201cThey made a family trip to interact with dolphins, sea lions and stingrays,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cThey spent several hours at the park and looked like they had the best time. The kids were all very interested in learning about the animals. They all seem like huge dolphin fans.\u201d\n\nDuring the trip, Garner stayed at a resort while Affleck stayed at a nearby house. \u201cJen seemed excited about the trip. She hasn\u2019t been to Hawaii for a while and always loved it,\u201d added the source.\n\n\u201cThe kids love when they all spend time together,\u201d said a second source.\n\nWhen filming breaks allow, the actor, 45, visits the kids at home in Los Angeles. \u201cHe\u2019s found a really good routine,\u201d an insider said. \u201cHe\u2019s in a great place, enjoying his work on the new film and being able to fly back to spend time with the family during downtime.\u201d\n\nGal/BACKGRID\n\nDays before Garner and the children arrived in Hawaii, Affleck\u2019s girlfriend, Saturday Night Live producer Lindsay Shookus, 37, also visited him.\n\nSources have said the two are in a committed relationship but taking it slow.\n\n\u201cBen is in a very committed relationship with Lindsey Shook us and they too work hard to balance time between work, friends and their families,\u201d says the source close to Affleck.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Garner was spotted out in N.Y.C. looking relaxed and happy. The actress, 45, was smiling ear to ear as she attended an event at the famous French bakery Ladur\u00e9e.\n\nGarner remains supportive as the Justice League star, who\u2019s continuing his treatment for alcohol addiction, moves on. \u201cAs long as Ben keeps working on himself, Jen is happy,\u201d another insider said. \u201cShe will continue to support him because it benefits the kids.\u201d\n\nThe actor is looking to buy a home, listed for $19.2 million, near Garner in Los Angeles. Affleck has his eye on the space that boasts seven bedrooms and nine bathrooms along with a screening room, gym, family room and maid\u2019s room as well as a backyard with pool, spa, outdoor BBQ and guest house.\n\nThis comes months after the father of three was first spotted house hunting with Shookus.\n\n\u201cBen is looking to buy a family friendly house,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE in October 2017. \u201cLindsay shared her opinions, but it was clear that they are not buying a house together.\u201d\n\nAffleck had been living in a rental since he moved out of the family estate he used to share with Garner. Prior to their divorce filing last April, he was living in the family\u2019s guesthouse.", "images":
