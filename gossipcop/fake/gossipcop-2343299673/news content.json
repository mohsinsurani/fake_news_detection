The star is still very focused on his shared children with Angie and, apparently, things have never been better between the actor and his youngsters! While Brad reportedly doesn\u2019t see the kids every single day, he has been spending time with them regularly, which has apparently brought him tons of happiness! Angie and Brad share six kids together: 16-year-old Maddox, 14-year-old Pax, 13-year-old Zahara, 11-year-old Shiloh and 9-year-old twins Vivienne and Knox. Click here to see adorable pics of the Jolie-Pitt kids then and now.\n\n\u201cDating hasn\u2019t been a priority because Brad wants to spend more time with the children,\u201d a source for ET told the publication. \u201cHe has been working on himself. Brad has been spending a lot of time learning to play guitar and hanging with musician friends.\u201d When he\u2019s with the kids though, they\u2019re 100 percent his main focus, according to the publication, and he wouldn\u2019t have it any other way! \u201cThe children continue to live with Angelina full-time, but they visit Brad at his house a few days a week,\u201d the site\u2019s insider added. \u201cThey don\u2019t spend full days with him, just a few hours, and they\u2019re either accompanied by bodyguards or their nannies.\u201d\n\nBrad has apparently been so consumed with making sure his kids are doing well, that dating has even been put on the back burner in some respects. \u201cHe loves those kids,\u201d the source continued. \u201cThey have been and always will be his first priority.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean the actor isn\u2019t dating at ALL though. In fact, while he\u2019s reportedly not interested in anything serious right now, he has been seeing women from time to time.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very private about who he\u2019s seeing, but he does continue to casually date,\u201d ET\u2018s source said. \u201cThe women he sees are not in the public eye.\u201d For the time being, Brad wants to make sure his relationships stay out of the public eye too. \u201cHe invites his dates over to his house and never takes women out in public. While it\u2019s been a year and a half [after their split], it still feels too soon to him,\u201d the source explained. Either way though, Brad is happy that he continues to have his children in his life!", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/moneyspells.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/brad-pitt-now-seeing-his-6-kids-several-times-a-week-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/brad-pitt-now-seeing-his-6-kids-several-times-a-week-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/brad-pitt-now-seeing-his-6-kids-several-times-a-week-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Katherine Speller", "Meghan Rose", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/26/brad-pitt-sees-his-kids-multiple-times-week-more-often/", "title": "Brad Pitt Now Seeing His 6 Kids Several Times A Week \u2014 Inside Their Private Time Together", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Brad Pitt is now seeing his kids regularly and, according to a new report, he &amp; his children are getting along better than ever before!", "news_keywords": "Angelina Jolie, Brad Pitt, Shiloh Jolie-Pitt", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/26/brad-pitt-sees-his-kids-multiple-times-week-more-often/?ia_markup=1"}, "author": "Kathleen Harper", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt Now Seeing His 6 Kids Several Times A Week \u2014 Inside Their Private Time Together", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/03/26/brad-pitt-sees-his-kids-multiple-times-week-more-often/", "description": "Brad Pitt is now seeing his kids regularly and, according to a new report, he & his children are getting along better than ever before!
