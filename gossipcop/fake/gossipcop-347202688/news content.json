You have to work at your sobriety every day and he does that.\u201d\n\nSince their separation in 2015, the exes have not officially divorced. While Garner, 46, has remained fiercely private and protective of her family, she has, on occasion, spoken about Affleck and their children.\n\nHere\u2019s everything she\u2019s said about Affleck since their split:\n\nJuly 2018\n\nGarner opened up about the pressures of public life on her marriage and her family during a CBS Sunday Morning interview, saying, \u201cLooking back on that, I really feel the stress of it. I really \u2014 I could cry talking about it.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cWhat I think I\u2019ve learned is that the scrutiny in your private life puts a pressure to make something happen. You feel a pressure to hurry up and get married, \u2018cause you think that\u2019ll end the, \u2018Are they engaged? Are they not?\u2019 And that\u2019s true in reverse, as well. If you are \u2014 if there is any inkling of trouble, or if the tabloids decide there\u2019s trouble, it can create trouble. But to be honest, public scrutiny, everyone says, \u2018Oh, you\u2019ve had to go through this in public.\u2019 The public isn\u2019t what\u2019s hard. What\u2019s hard is going through it.\u201d\n\nJune 2018\n\nFor Father\u2019s Day, Garner penned a rare and touching tribute to Affleck on Instagram, writing, \u201cOur kids are lucky to have a dad who looks at them the way you look at them and loves them the way you love them, @benaffleck. #happyfathersday #threeluckykids #haveagreatday.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nNovember 2017\n\nIn an interview with news.com.au, Garner talked about being separated from the father of her children, saying, \u201cI would not have chosen this life for myself or for my kids. I would not choose to be single or be in this position. It\u2019s something that we are working through.\u201d\n\nMay 2017\n\nAfter People magazine released a cover story about Garner\u2019s new life as a single mom, Garner took to Facebook to set the record straight.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t a tragedy by any measure, but it does affect me and my family and so, before my mom\u2019s garden club lights up her phone, I wanted to set the record straight,\" she said. \"I did not pose for this cover. I did not participate in or authorize this article. While we are here, for what it\u2019s worth: I have three wonderful kids and my family is complete.\u201d\n\nOctober 2016\n\nGarner spoke with ET\u2019s Denny Directo at the Save the Children Illumination Gala about how she and Affleck have chosen to raise their kids.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so important that you model for your kids how to be a citizen of the world, and I think that\u2019s the best thing you can do,\u201d she told ET, adding that she and Affleck each have special causes that they try to teach their kids about.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really important at home, to make sure that our kids know that we both have causes that we care so much about\u2026 that we dedicate time, resources, and our energy toward making our own little slice of the world a little bit better,\u201d she said.\n\nAugust 2016\n\n'We are definitely a modern family': #JenniferGarner talks to @nmoralesnbc about family and marriage https://t.co/jJpZAE5BoG \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) August 4, 2016\n\nGarner was praised on the Today show for putting her kids first while dealing with the end of her marriage.\n\n\u201cIt has to be,\u201d she said. \"You don\u2019t have a choice. It has to be.\u201d\n\nCalling their family unit \u201cdefinitely a modern family,\u201d she added, \u201cWe\u2019re doing really well.\u201d\n\nShe also opened up about her decision to take her kids to London for the filming of Justice League, in which Affleck played Batman.\n\n\u201cBen was working on Justice League, and I thought, \u2018Well, the kids should have that experience,'\u201d she explained. \u201cHe and I are great friends, and we just all went en masse.\u201d\n\nFebruary 2016\n\nVanity Fair\n\nOpening up for the first time since the couple announced their split in June 2015, Garner told her side of the story in a Vanity Fair cover piece. She had both kind and honest words for her estranged husband in the article.\n\n\u201cIt was a real marriage,\u201d she said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for the cameras. And It was a huge priority for me to stay in it. And that didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nShe added that she\u2019d do it all over again, saying, \u201cI didn\u2019t marry the big fat movie star; I married him. And I would go back and remake that decision. He\u2019s the love of my life. What am I going to do about that?\u201d\n\nAs for Affleck\u2019s personality, Garner admitted, \u201cI always say, \u2018When his sun shines on you, you feel it.\u2019 But when the sun is shining elsewhere, it\u2019s cold. He can cast quite a shadow.\u201d\n\nOf their bond, she admitted, \u201cHe\u2019s still the only person who really knows the truth about things. And I\u2019m still the only person that knows some of his truths.\u201d\n\nWhen it comes to the public\u2019s response to Affleck, she noted, \u201cNo one needs to hate [Ben] for me. I don\u2019t hate him. Certainly we don\u2019t have to beat the guy up. Don\u2019t worry \u2014 my eyes were wide open during the marriage.\u201d\n\nHere's more on Garner and Affleck:\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nInside What Led to Ben Affleck's Return to Rehab (Exclusive)\n\nJennifer Garner Takes Ben Affleck Back to Rehab After His Struggles With Sobriety\n\nJennifer Garner Doesn't Want to 'Police' Who Ben Affleck Dates Amid Romance With Playboy Model (Exclusive)\n\nRelated Articles:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_w_entertainmentv2.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197800334&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fentertainment%2Feverything-jennifer-garner-said-ben-113604502.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ah.zH2Cz3o7dYIXtOmd7Xw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTUwO2g9NDg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/07b8d210-243d-11eb-bbff-617af51ac603", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cYZGJsf_Q1a1eoVeVoATKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/45faf34ab2e832651cb1c32d7bff4233", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QUHh5GbdRzCvnFM6w7boug--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTEzNDc-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/.x_jpV6ZlK9G8nKTxGluXA--~B/aD04OTg7dz02NDA7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/76b58ee39c7a25af40c6ec5d61100555", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cYZGJsf_Q1a1eoVeVoATKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/45faf34ab2e832651cb1c32d7bff4233", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/everything-jennifer-garner-said-ben-113604502.html", "title": "Everything Jennifer Garner Has Said About Ben Affleck Since Their Split", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Jennifer Garner, Ben Affleck, Jennifer Garner, Ben Affleck, Batman", "twitter": {"title": "Everything Jennifer Garner Has Said About Ben Affleck Since Their Split", "description": "The actress drove her ex to rehab on Wednesday.", "site": "@Yahoo", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cYZGJsf_Q1a1eoVeVoATKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/45faf34ab2e832651cb1c32d7bff4233", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cYZGJsf_Q1a1eoVeVoATKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/45faf34ab2e832651cb1c32d7bff4233"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"title": "Everything Jennifer Garner Has Said About Ben Affleck Since Their Split", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/everything-jennifer-garner-said-ben-113604502.html", "description": "The actress drove her ex to rehab on Wednesday.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/cYZGJsf_Q1a1eoVeVoATKA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/45faf34ab2e832651cb1c32d7bff4233", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "al": {"android": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=ead37a7d-0693-35ed-9248-93a4ca9303c7&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo"}, "ios": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=ead37a7d-0693-35ed-9248-93a4ca9303c7&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842}}, "description": "The actress drove her ex to rehab on Wednesday.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
