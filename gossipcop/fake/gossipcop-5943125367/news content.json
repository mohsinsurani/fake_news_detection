Yes, he was her love interest in the 2017 Baywatch film but the actress claims that, in real life, they\u2019re just \u201cgood friends.\u201d Alexandra clarified their relationship in an interview with PEOPLE. Crushing the hopes of Baywatch fans everywhere, she said on May 31, \u201cWe\u2019re very good friends. Zac and I\u2019ve worked together, and we\u2019re very good friends.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time that Alexandra has claimed that Zac, 30, is in the friendship zone. In May 2017, she told E! News, \u201cWe work together closely; he\u2019s my love interest in the film. I understand why people would go crazy over something like that, but Zac and I are very good friends.\u201d So, what happened? Alexandra\u2019s comments don\u2019t match what HollywoodLife and other outlets have been told about the status of her relationship with Zac. In April a source EXCLUSIVELY told us that the actress has been \u201cvery coy\u201d about their rumored romance. The person added, \u201cBut people that are close to her know that this a defense mechanism because she really wants it to work and doesn\u2019t want anything to get in the way of a great love match. She wants to make it look like she is single in public but is 100 percent all about Zac and the relationship they are brewing.\u201d\n\nIf we take Alexandra at her word, she and Zac have definitely \u2013 at the very least \u2013 formed their own mutual admiration society. On March 16, he posted a tribute to the actress on his Instagram page. Next to a photo of them together, he wished her a \u201cHappy Birthday\u201d calling her the, \u201cmost real, down to earth, stunning, intelligent, creative, loving and most rare Pokemon ever created.\u201d And on April 4, when Alexandra posted a photo of her looking at her dog on Instagram, he commented, \u201cTwo hot b*tches.\u201d Because, with flirting like that, of course people wouldn\u2019t think they\u2019re dating. Right?", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/moneyspells.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zac-efron-alexandra-daddario-deny-dating-rumors-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alexandra-daddario-zac-efron-rex-3.jpg?w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alexandra-daddario-zac-efron-rex-2.jpg?w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/alexandra-daddario-zac-efron-rex.jpg?w=440", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zac-efron-alexandra-daddario-deny-dating-rumors-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/zac-efron-alexandra-daddario-deny-dating-rumors-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marissa Charles", "Katherine Speller", "Meghan Rose", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/06/01/alexandra-daddario-zac-efron-relationship-friends-not-dating/", "title": "Alexandra Daddario Slams Rumors She\u2019s Still Dating Zac Efron \u2014 What Happened?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Alexandra Daddario and Zac Efron's relationship has been clarified.
