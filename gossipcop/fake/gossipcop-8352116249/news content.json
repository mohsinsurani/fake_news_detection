Since their breakup, both have found love with someone new: Kardashian, 39, with boyfriend Younes Bendjima and Disick, 35, with girlfriend Sofia Richie.\n\nThough Kardashian and Disick are no longer romantically linked, they continue to co-parent their three children: sons Mason Dash, 8\u00bd, and Reign Aston, 3\u00bd, and daughter Penelope, 6.\n\n\u201cI think Scott will always be family, and so we really try to have a good relationship for the kids,\u201d Kardashian told PEOPLE about Disick while promoting the new season of Keeping Up with the Kardashians.\n\nShe also revealed that KUWTK audiences will catch a glimpse of how their relationships with their significant others has impacted their co-parenting rhythm.\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019ll see that on the season a bit, but you know we really do our best to make the kids the priority,\u201d she said.\n\nIn addition to appearing on KUWTK, Disick will soon be starring in his own E! reality show about his hobby of flipping home.\n\n\u201cIt will probably come out next year, and it\u2019s basically about me doing things that I\u2019m interested in, which is buying and selling properties,\u201d he told PEOPLE last weekend.\n\nAnd as he embarks on this new endeavor, Kardashian will be cheering him on from the sidelines.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited! I think that he\u2019s great at that; it\u2019s always been a passion of his,\u201d she said. \u201cHe puts his own spin on the houses, so I think it\u2019s amazing. I can\u2019t wait to see it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kourtney Kardashian \u2018Trusts\u2019 Sofia Richie with Her and Scott Disick\u2019s Kids: Source\n\nWith the season 15 premiere episode just days away, Kardashian also hinted that there will be lots of drama in store for viewers.\n\n\u201cI think this was probably our craziest fight that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d she shared about an explosive moment between her and sister Kim Kardashian West.\n\nShe explained, \u201cI think I\u2019ve always been the sister who like I would just tell them like it is or if they said something to me, I\u2019d just break them right down the fastest and make them upset and now I\u2019ve been working on being more in touch with my feelings. I think I just couldn\u2019t take it anymore. I just felt like we needed to make a change and not be so critical.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve always been a family who will do anything for each other and we know that at the end of the day, but sometimes there\u2019s criticism and I felt not good hanging out with them everyday and I couldn\u2019t take it anymore,\u201d said Kardashian. \u201cSo you\u2019ll see in the season how it plays out.\u201d\n\nSeason 15 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians premieres Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images":
