Rumors are flying that the two have been hanging out \u2018as more than friends\u2019 and you\u2019ve got to see the details!\n\nNina Dobrev and Orlando Bloom caused the Internet to have a freakout when they were spotted leaving The Promise premiere in LA together on Thursday, Apr. 12. The 28 year-old Vampire Dairies stunner has reportedly been spending some time with the 40 year-old Pirates of the Caribbean star and not just as buddies! \u201cThey\u2019ve known each other for a while,\u201d a source told PEOPLE, \u201crecently they\u2019ve been hanging out as more than friends.\u201d\n\nTry not to get too excited just yet though because things are still reportedly in the early stages between them. \u201cIt\u2019s super casual,\u201d the insider added and pointed out Orlando attended a Coachella party on Friday night with a woman who was not Nina. The actress has been having a ball at the music festival in Indio, CA this weekend too, but without Orlando. These two are definitely keeping things on the down low and casual!\n\nOrlando just got out of his one-year relationship with singer Katy Perry, 32, in Feb. 2017. He told Elle UK that even though they split up, things did not end badly between them. \u201cWe\u2019re all grown up. She happens to be someone who is very visible, but I don\u2019t think anybody cares about what I\u2019m up to. Nor should they. It\u2019s between us. It\u2019s better to set an example for kids and show that [breakups] don\u2019t have to be about hate,\u201d he told the mag. \u201cWe\u2019re friends, it\u2019s good.\u201d Sounds like Orlando is ready to move on. Could it be with Nina?\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Nina and Orlando are dating?
