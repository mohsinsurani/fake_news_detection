We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how he stormed off the set after fighting with his director on his new film.\n\nIt\u2019s been so long since we\u2019ve seen Brad Pitt, 53, on the silver screen, being the dreamy movie star that he is. Nearly a year after Angelina Jolie, 42, filed for divorce from him, he\u2019s hard at work filming the sci-fi thriller Ad Astra. But the pain of his personal life is never far from his mind. \u201cBrad stormed off set after one of his toughest days yesterday.

There was some creative tension, but it wasn\u2019t anything that could have derailed the production in any way. Sometimes friends fight and that\u2019s what happened between Brad and the director,\u201d our insider continues. According to imdb.com, the film\u2019s plot is \u201cAn Army Corps engineer searches across the galaxy for his father, who disappeared on a mission to find alien life 20 years ago.\u201d That means some tricky stunt work and that helped push the star over the edge. \u201cIt was a grueling day, Brad had been attached to wires, it was intense and his discussions with his director,, whom he has known for decades got very heated. There was some creative tension, but it wasn\u2019t anything that could have derailed the production in any way.
