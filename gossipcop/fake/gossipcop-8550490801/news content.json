Hoda and Savannah Guthrie became the first all-female co-anchor team in the 65-year history of the Today show.\n\nBut while enthusiasm for Kotb's promotion resulted in public congratulations from her colleagues and media industry peers, rumors soared of a nasty feud taking place when the Today show cameras were turned off. The feud initially involved Hoda's co-host for the wine-sipping hour of the Today show, Kathie Lee Gifford.\n\nWhen Gifford was absent from the show, fans speculated that she was jealous of Kotb's promotion, and some thought Kathie Lee would quit. There were also reports that Hoda feels she has become \"too big\" for her gig with Gifford and is ready to quit as well, as the Inquisitr reported.\n\n\"The atmosphere is so bad around Megyn Kelly at Today that producers of the 7-to-9 a.m. slot, hosted by Savannah Guthrie and Hoda Kotb, are openly sniping at her.\"\n\n\"We talked recently about how, 10 years ago, your life was very different,\" said Kelly on air to Kotb. \"You were going through a dark period.\"\n\nStaffers assumed that Megyn was talking about Hoda's breast cancer diagnosis and subsequent surgery. But rather than explain that to viewers, Kelly probed Kotb, asking if Hoda ever took time to contemplate her life and think \"holy moly.\"\n\n\"Everybody in the control room gasped when Megyn brought up Hoda's 'dark period,' because many viewers likely won't know exactly what she was referring to. That comment was awkward, mean-spirited. It really stung.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa8aa86244d76bf2aee7e2fb5b934ea3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4746609/today-hosts-hint-at-rumored-feud-hoda-kotb-savannah-guthrie-megyn-kelly-trade-mean-girl-jabs-on-air/", "title": "'Today' Hosts Hint At Rumored Feud: Hoda Kotb, Savannah Guthrie, Megyn Kelly Trade 'Mean Girl' Jabs On Air", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Today' Hosts Hint At Rumored Feud: Hoda Kotb, Savannah Guthrie, Megyn Kelly Trade 'Mean Girl' Jabs On Air", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4746609/today-hosts-hint-at-rumored-feud-hoda-kotb-savannah-guthrie-megyn-kelly-trade-mean-girl-jabs-on-air/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "'Today' Hosts Hint At Rumored Feud: Hoda Kotb, Savannah Guthrie, Megyn Kelly Trade 'Mean Girl' Jabs On Air", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-01-21 10:59:42Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "'Today' Hosts Hint At Rumored Feud: Hoda Kotb, Savannah Guthrie, Megyn Kelly Trade 'Mean Girl' Jabs On Air", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516532382.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
