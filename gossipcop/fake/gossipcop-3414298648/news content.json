Three years after their stormy breakup, Selena Gomez and Justin Bieber have mended fences, multiple sources exclusively tell Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cSelena is simply trying to make peace with Justin after her illness,\u201d one insider reveals, referring to the kidney transplant that the \u201cWolves\u201d singer underwent earlier this year due to complications with lupus. \u201cHe has been great to her since her surgery and they are on good terms right now. They got back in touch recently through their friends and have seen each other at church.\u201d\n\nA second source tells Us that the exes began speaking \u201ca couple months after her surgery.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a source close to Gomez tells Us, \u201cJustin and Selena recently started speaking. I don\u2019t know when exactly but it\u2019s because of the same church they go to. The community there is pretty tight knit and Justin and Selena have a lot of mutual friends who brought them back together. They realized it was time to grow past their history and move on. They\u2019re grown up a lot in the past couple of years and are mature about the situation.\u201d\n\nBieber, 23, and Gomez, 25, have also spent some time together at her home in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles. The Ontario native was spotted arriving in his white G-Wagon to his ex-girlfriend\u2019s $2.25 million property on Sunday, October 22. TMZ reported that they hung out with mutual friends until at least midnight.\n\nThe Disney alum is still dating The Weeknd, though. \u201cHe has been on tour and she\u2019s been traveling back and forth to L.A., but they are 100 percent still on,\u201d the first source tells Us, while the second notes, \u201cThe Weekend is well aware Selena and Justin are talking.\u201d\n\nThe Gomez insider says, \u201cThe Weeknd doesn\u2019t think Selena talking to Justin again is weird at all. He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nBieber and Gomez dated on and off from 2011 to 2014. \u201c[She] is someone I love dearly,\u201d he told Access Hollywood in 2015. \u201cI\u2019m never going to stop loving her. I\u2019m never going to stop checking in on her. \u2026 We always respected each other and we still respect each other.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBad Liar\u201d songstress began dating The Weeknd, 27, in January, while the \u201cBaby\u201d crooner has been linked to Kourtney Kardashian, Sofia Richie and Hailey Baldwin.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-talking-again.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-talking-again.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-reunited-after-her-kidney-transplant/", "title": "Selena Gomez, Justin Bieber Reunited After Her Kidney Transplant", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Exclusive,Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Selena Gomez and ex Justin Bieber 'got back in touch' after her kidney transplant, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena and Justin 'Got Back in Touch' After Her Kidney Transplant", "description": "Selena Gomez and ex Justin Bieber 'got back in touch' after her kidney transplant, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-reunited-after-her-kidney-transplant/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:34+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-talking-again.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-talking-again.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-10-25T21:04:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:34+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Selena and Justin 'Got Back in Touch' After Her Kidney Transplant", "description": "Selena Gomez and ex Justin Bieber 'got back in touch' after her kidney transplant, a source exclusively tells Us Weekly \u2014 find out more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-talking-again.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508965471.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
