He\u2019s only 30-years-old and has the world in the palm of his hands, but one day he wants a tamer life with a wife and kids. \u201cDrake does want to settle down and have kids one day, and he\u2019s confident that the right woman will come along at the right time. Until then, Drake\u2019s not forcing anything, and he\u2019s making the most of the lifestyle that comes along with being Drake,\u201d a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. He\u2019s tried his best at settling down with incredible ladies such as Rihanna, 29, and Jennifer Lopez, 48, and if those stunners can\u2019t get him to be a one woman man, it\u2019s going to be awhile before he puts a ring on anyone\u2019s finger. Click here for pics of Drake and JLo\u2019s romance.\n\nThe fatherhood part might be happening sooner than Drizzy planned for, as artist and former porn star Sophie Brussaux claims she\u2019s pregnant with Drake\u2019s child. The 27-year-old is expecting a baby girl and just posted a sonogram of the growing fetus on July 19 with the caption \u201csecond trimester.\u201d While the \u201cPortland\u201d rapper has slammed Sophie\u2019s allegations that he\u2019s her baby\u2019s daddy, his rep told us in May that, \u201cIf it is in fact Drake\u2019s child, which he completely doesn\u2019t believe, he would do the right thing by the child and support it financially.\u201d\n\nUntil the right woman comes along, Drizzy\u2019s not lonely when it comes to bedroom activities. \u201cDrake has a bunch of booty calls he can dial up when he feels the need, and he has a lot of female friends, so he\u2019s not lacking in the woman department. Drake\u2019s really focused on his music right now and doesn\u2019t want the drama that always seems to come with the women he dates \u2014 he prefers an easy and chill life,\u201d our insider adds.\n\nHollywoodLifers, when do you think Drake will finally find the right woman and settle down? Or was Rihanna is true soul mate and he complete blew it?", "images": ["https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jen-aniston-loved-wet-brush-now-kid-friendly-disney.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drake-rex-01.jpg?w=440", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/howtosupportiran.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/drake-wants-kids-marriage-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/drake-wants-kids-marriage-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drake-michael-b-jordan-basketball-game-backgrid.jpg?w=352", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/drake-17.jpg?w=337"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/drake-wants-kids-marriage-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Taylor Jeffries", "Roya Backlund", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/25/drake-marriage-children-family-right-woman/", "title": "Drake Hoping For Marriage & Children \u2014 He\u2019s Confident He\u2019ll Find The Right Woman", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Drake might be a player now, but he's hoping to one day find the right woman to settle down with and start a family.", "news_keywords": "Drake", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "author": "Beth Shilliday", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Drake Hoping For Marriage & Children \u2014 He\u2019s Confident He\u2019ll Find The Right Woman", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/07/25/drake-marriage-children-family-right-woman/", "description": "Drake may be loving his player lifestyle right now, but he knows he\u2019ll find the right woman to tame his ways one day.
