The two recently appeared in Thor: Ragnarok together.\n\nDamon spokeswoman Jennifer Allen said Damon has been to Australia a lot recently. But Damon has not bought a home there nor is he relocating there, she said.\n\nThe New York Post\u2019s Page Six gossip site, citing an unnamed source, said the Good Will Hunting and Jason Bourne star told friends and colleagues he wanted to leave the country because he disagrees with Mr Trump\u2019s policies.\n\nWhen asked about Damon\u2019s rumoured motivation, Ms Allen wrote in an email, \u201che\u2019s not moving out of the US\u201d. Damon has publicly supported Democrats, including Mr Trump\u2019s rival in the 2016 presidential election, Hillary Clinton.\n\nThe reports first emerged on Thursday and claimed Damon was moving to Australia along with his four daughters and wife, Luciana Barroso.\n\nDamon has previously shown his lack of support for the President. In January last year, during a panel in Davos, he said America was heading into \u201cnew territory\u201d with the President.\n\nMeanwhile, during the 2016 US presidential elections Damon expressed he was \u201cnervous\u201d about the prospect of a Trump presidency. \u201cThere\u2019s no way we can let this guy be the [president]. To let that dude have the nuclear football, are you kidding me? He\u2019s impulsive and rash and doesn\u2019t seem to think deeply about too many things,\u201d he said in an interview on ABC\u2019s Popcorn With Peter Travers.\n\nEarlier this week, Damon and Ben Affleck announced they will implement inclusion riders and will employ diverse casts and crews to work on their upcoming projects. The pair, founded Pearl Street Films in 2012 and have followed Ghostbusters director Paul Fieg and Michael B Jordan in championing social inclusion within the film industry.\n\nAdditional reporting from AP", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/17/15/matt-damon.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/17/15/matt-damon.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/17/15/matt-damon.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Khalili-Tari"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/matt-damon-publicist-moving-australia-donald-trump-good-will-hunting-jason-bourne-hillary-clinton-a8261126.html", "title": "Matt Damon\u2019s publicist forced to deny reports actor is moving to Australia because he can't stand Donald Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Press agent debunks rumours previously circulated by news outlets claiming Hollywood star intended to leave with family because he disapproved of President's policies", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Americas", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/world/americas", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-03-17T16:17:57.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Matt Damon forced to deny he's moving to Australia to escape Trump", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/matt-damon-publicist-moving-australia-donald-trump-good-will-hunting-jason-bourne-hillary-clinton-a8261126.html", "type": "article", "description": "Press agent debunks rumours previously circulated by news outlets claiming Hollywood star intended to leave with family because he disapproved of President's policies", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/17/15/matt-damon.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/17/15/matt-damon.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-17T16:17:57.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-17T16:17:57.000Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "World", "author_name": "Daniel Khalili-Tari", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 498, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 4, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2018-03-17T16:17:57.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Matt Damon forced to deny he's moving to Australia to escape Trump", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Press agent debunks rumours previously circulated by news outlets claiming Hollywood star intended to leave with family because he disapproved of President's policies", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/17/15/matt-damon.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Matt Damon,Donald Trump,Australia,Sydney,Good Will Hunting,Jason Bourne,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521303477.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
