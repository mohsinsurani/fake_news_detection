Though she stepped away from Hollywood in 2005 after decades in the business, the former exec still fondly remembers her time there and opens up to PEOPLE about some of the movie superstars she worked with.\n\nRead on for behind-the-scenes stories straight from the best source \u2014 the producer and exec who made the films.\n\nAngelina Jolie\u2019s life-changing moment\n\nWhen Angelina Jolie was cast as Lara Croft in Tomb Raider, the studio felt she was a risky choice due to her wild-child reputation. But after the actress fought for the role, she immediately impressed the studio and the crew with her hard work and talent on camera.\n\n\u201cIn the dailies, she was riveting,\u201d Lansing recalls in the book. \u201cShe took what might have been a cardboard character and added a layer of mystery and emotion and humanity.\u201d\n\nBRENT STIRTON/GETTY\n\nJolie with Maddox in Cambodia in 2006\n\nAnd Lansing says she was more than just impressive on film. The former executive got to witness Jolie begin her life as a philanthropist after working in Cambodia where the film was shot \u2014 and where she eventually ended up adopting her first son, Maddox, in 2002. The actress had already become involved with the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees at the time, for which she is now a Special Envoy, thanks to her trips to the Southeast Asian country.\n\n\u201cI saw it earlier on,\u201d Lansing tells PEOPLE of Jolie\u2019s passion for philanthropy. \u201cRight after Tomb Raider, she was on my same flight out of London where she sat next to me. She had nothing with her but a backpack and she was going back to Cambodia to work with the refugees. She was always interested in causes bigger than herself and she always worked hard for those causes. She\u2019s done amazing good to make the world a better place.\u201d\n\nTom Cruise was like a \u201cbrother\u201d to her\n\nThere were some people Lansing worked with whom she formed close relationships with \u2014 including Tom Cruise. She says she and Cruise were like \u201cbrother and sister\u201d as they collaborated on movies like the Mission: Impossible franchise and War of the Worlds, while Cruise\u2019s production company, Cruise/Wagner Productions, had an exclusive deal with Paramount.\n\n\u201cI knew Tom when he was a young boy when he was cast in Taps,\u201d Lansing tells PEOPLE. \u201cThe Tom Cruise that I met all those years ago is the same person he is today \u2014 the hardest-working actor, brilliant, focused and kind. He\u2019s nice to everyone and he treats everyone with respect.\u201d\n\nL. Cohen/WireImage\n\nThe two grew to trust each other, with, according to the book, Cruise coming to rescue in 2005 when Mission: Impossible II was delayed a year. When Lansing started panicking, since the sequel was supposed to be Paramount\u2019s big summer blockbuster that year, Cruise repeatedly told her it was going to be okay. To her surprise, she got a call from Steven Spielberg about Paramount releasing War of the Worlds the very same weekend Mission: Impossible II was slated to open, therefore giving the studio exec the blockbuster she needed.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mel Gibson\u2019s Changing Looks!\n\nAfter an early clash, Mel Gibson was \u2018easy to work with\u2019\n\nThe former exec worked closely with the then-novice director Mel Gibson on his breakout film Braveheart and got to experience a different side of the actor. After budget negotiations for the epic film got heated, Lansing says she admired the way Gibson was passionate about his work.\n\n\u201cWe had this whole budget fight and at the end of the day I said to him, \u2018I\u2019m sure you have a dartboard where you have a picture of me,\u2019 and he said, \u2018No, you were doing your job and I was doing mine,\u2019 \u201d Lansing tells PEOPLE. \u201cHe was so easy to work with and so passionate. He\u2019s tireless in his hard work and he\u2019s one of the most talented actors and one of the most brilliant directors in the business.\u201d\n\nCrown Archetype\n\nRobert Redford sure can deliver a pickup line\n\nLansing has been on hand to witness filming on some of the greatest movies ever made, like Gibson\u2019s epic war scenes in Braveheart and James Cameron\u2018s perfect recreation of the doomed Titanic ship. But the moments that stand out to her as the best are much smaller.\n\nThe former producer reveals one of the best moments on set for her was when Robert Redford perfectly delivered the pivotal question in Indecent Proposal. \u201cI remember thinking that the movie would succeed or fail on whether or not he could pull that line off,\u201d Lansing tells PEOPLE. \u201cI was sitting in a corner near the camera, watching the first take, when Redford just threw the line away like he was asking someone for a cup of water. And I went, \u2018Oh my God, that\u2019s so brilliant, that\u2019s genius.\u2019 That moment when you see something come to life is so incredible.\u201d\n\nLeading Lady: Sherry Lansing and the Making of a Hollywood Groundbreaker, written by Stephen Galloway, is out now. Lansing will reveal more behind-the-scenes secrets on Friday, April 28 when she sits down with Galloway and Michael Douglas for a talk at the 92nd Street Y theater in New York City.", "images":
