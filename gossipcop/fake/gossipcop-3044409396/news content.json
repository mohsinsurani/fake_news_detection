Rather, it seems what is going on is that the woman accusing Usher, whose name is Laura Helm, was unsatisfied with her attorney. The woman's new lawyer went ahead and dismissed the case without prejudice and \"with intent to refile,\" TMZ reports.\n\nSo, a brand new lawsuit will probably be filed in the coming days and weeks. Quantasia Sharpton has also accused Usher of potentially exposing her to herpes. Sharpton claims that she and Usher had \"sexual contact\" at a Days Inn in Atlantic City. The encounter allegedly took place back in 2014.\n\nUsher has previously been in a similar situation. Back in 2012, the singer settled for $1.1 million after a woman accused him of infecting her with herpes.\n\nUntil the lawsuit is (possibly) refiled, Usher seems to be celebrating.", "images": ["http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6685975&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/rharhrl0ggo2sr4mc98o/usher-shining-star-gala-2017", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/rharhrl0ggo2sr4mc98o/usher-shining-star-gala-2017?fimg-ssr-default", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 203 115\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_author_pic/IMG_5548_cq4nbp.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/rharhrl0ggo2sr4mc98o/usher-shining-star-gala-2017", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abel Shifferaw"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/music/2017/11/usher-20-million-lawsuit-dismissed-for-now", "title": "$20 Million Herpes Lawsuit Against Usher Has Been Dismissed", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ICK39wBGvCQQMHpEUykVHWF8Ox_0MME-_qxe6ixFUik", "theme-color": "#000000", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "There is an \u201cintent to refile.\u201d", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "$20 Million Herpes Lawsuit Against Usher Has Been Dismissed", "description": "There is an \u201cintent to refile.\u201d", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/2017/11/usher-20-million-lawsuit-dismissed-for-now", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/rharhrl0ggo2sr4mc98o/usher-shining-star-gala-2017", "site_name": "Complex"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310521533114641, "pages": 117696581735620}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "$20 Million Herpes Lawsuit Against Usher Has Been Dismissed", "description": "There is an \u201cintent to refile.\u201d", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/2017/11/usher-20-million-lawsuit-dismissed-for-now", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,h_300,q_auto,w_600/fl_lossy,pg_1/rharhrl0ggo2sr4mc98o/usher-shining-star-gala-2017", "site": {"id": 13049362}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
