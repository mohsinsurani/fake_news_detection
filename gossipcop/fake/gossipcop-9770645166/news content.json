No, he won\u2019t have anything to do with it.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard yet, CBS has ordered their Magnum P.I. reboot to series. If you\u2019re a millennial who doesn\u2019t pay attention to old stuff, that\u2019s the loosey-goosey detective show starring the irresistibly charming Tom Selleck that ran on CBS from 1980-1988 and earned him a Best Actor Emmy.\n\nPeter Lenkov, the redo specialist responsible for updating Hawaii Five-O and MacGyver is the guy in charge. He\u2019s hired Jay Hernandez (The Expanse, Suicide Squad) to play Thomas Magnum, like his predecessor, a former Navy Seal turned private investigator who lives in Hawaii.\n\nSo what does Selleck, now happily playing NYPD commissioner Frank Reagan in Blue Bloods, another long-running series \u2014 it will beat Magnum\u2019s length of service next season \u2014 have to say about the new version? He chose to share his feelings for the first time to TV Guide Magazine and TV Insider.\n\nThe actor says when he was in L.A. (he lives on a ranch north of the city when he\u2019s not shooting Blue Bloods) he was asked to come to CBS\u2019s West Coast HQ for a meeting with Lenkov and David Stapf, the CBS TV Studios president.\n\n\u201cCBS is kind of my home network,\u201d says Selleck. \u201cI\u2019ve done The Young and the Restless and (most of) the Jesse Stone movies as well as Magnum and Blue Bloods with them.\u201d They told him if he \u201chad a problem\u201d with the remake, their relationship was important enough that they wouldn\u2019t do it. \u201cPeter was very effusive about the project; he grew up with Magnum and this was his dream,\u201d he adds.\n\nStapf suggested that he talk to Les Moonves, CBS Corporation\u2019s CEO and Chairman of the Board. According to Selleck, Moonves talked about how, since Universal owned the show, they could \u201cdo whatever they want with it,\u201d the actor recalls. \u201cLes said, \u2018We\u2019d like to control the show We think we can do a better job.\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI went home,\u201d Selleck continues, \u201cand thought about it for about a day. In the end, I thought, \u2018We couldn\u2019t have a better bow tied around our show. We went off with our final episode as the number one show on all of television. We\u2019re in the Smithsonian for recognizing Vietnam veterans in a positive light, the first show to really do that. And it led to countless other opportunities. I just felt success is so hard to come by in this business, why do I want to root for somebody to fail. I just stepped back, and said, \u2018I won\u2019t get in your way.\u2019\u201d\n\nHe also won\u2019t be involved in any way. \u201cThey asked and I said, \u2018Absolutely not. I\u2019m busy with Blue Bloods.\u2019\u201d But more than that, he concedes, \u201cIt will never be what in my fantasy world, I would make it to be.\u201d\n\nDon\u2019t expect a fun guest spot either. \u201cI told them that I won\u2019t do some cameo guest spot to let the audience know I approve.\u201d He\u2019s aware that could disappoint some fans of his and the shows. \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019d like it, but I have an obligation to my version. And Peter\u2019s going to do his take on what a Magnum under some similar circumstances should be about.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time that Selleck turned down a TV offer concerning the ionic role. In the early \u201890s, Selleck was working with big fan and best-selling author Tom Clancy \u2014 just off the success of The Hunt for Red October \u2014 on a Magnum movie. \u201cTom and I worked on a story \u2014 a good story for a movie. The character wasn\u2019t done; when we left him, he went back into the Navy. I thought it was time because I was having success with features. Three Men and a Baby had been the number one movie in the world.\u201d\n\nUniversal Studio chief Sidney Sheinberg had other ideas, Selleck says. He wanted to use Magnum in a wheel of rotating mysteries. \u201cI had no interest; they weren\u2019t thinking big enough and they really blew it.\u201d\n\nOver the years, Selleck says he heard rumors about other movies and TV ideas. He didn\u2019t speak ill of them, but he \u201cwasn\u2019t particularly thrilled,\u201d he admits. \u201cThis seemed okay because it\u2019s probably going to happen sooner or later. Why choose to be offended? This is Peter\u2019s dream, let him run with it. He\u2019s a nice man.\u201d\n\nFor lots more from our chat with Tom Selleck, pick up the June 25 issue of TV Guide Magazine.", "images":
