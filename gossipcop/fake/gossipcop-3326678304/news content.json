I like the cane!\"\n\nAnd little Vivienne (twin sister to Knox) is no worse for the wear either. \"Vivi's okay. She was absolutely fine. He took the fall.\"\n\nJolie similarly hurt herself years ago with her eldest, Maddox, 10. \"It happened when Mad was younger. I took a fall as well and cracked my elbow because I wanted to make sure he wasn't injured,\" Jolie said. \"Every parent has injured themselves.\"\n\nAmong their six kids, the child of the weekend was Zahara, who turned 7 on Sunday. \"We are focusing on birthday parties tomorrow for Zahara,\" Jolie added.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1326117825_brad-pitt-vivienne-jolie-pitt-lg.jpg?w=240&h=327&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1326117825_brad-pitt-vivienne-jolie-pitt-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1326117825_brad-pitt-vivienne-jolie-pitt-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Justin Ravitz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-why-im-walking-with-a-cane-201291/", "title": "Brad Pitt: Why I\u2019m Walking With a Cane", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "\"Every parent has injured themselves,\" Angelina Jolie explains", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt: Why I'm Walking With a Cane", "description": "\"Every parent has injured themselves,\" Angelina Jolie explains", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-why-im-walking-with-a-cane-201291/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T21:35:34+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1326117825_brad-pitt-vivienne-jolie-pitt-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1326117825_brad-pitt-vivienne-jolie-pitt-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2012-01-09T15:07:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T21:35:34+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brad Pitt: Why I'm Walking With a Cane", "description": "\"Every parent has injured themselves,\" Angelina Jolie explains", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1326117825_brad-pitt-vivienne-jolie-pitt-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1326121652.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
