Has Calvin Harris tried to beat Taylor to the punch at her own game?\n\nIT\u2019S been almost a year since Scottish music producer Calvin Harris and country-pop superstar Taylor Swift broke up, but after a bitter, public split, it seems there\u2019s no love lost between the high-profile pair.\n\nHarris and Swift\u2019s year-long relationship was a very public affair, with regular glossy, loved-up shots of them together posted to their social media accounts for fans to obsess over.\n\nTheir breakup played out just as publicly: In the months after they broke up, Swift\u2019s team announced that she had actually written one of Calvin\u2019s biggest hits, the Rihanna collaboration This Is What You Came For.\n\n\u201cI figure if you\u2019re happy in your new relationship you should focus on that instead of trying to tear your ex bf down for something to do,\u201d Calvin tweeted at the time, referring to Swift\u2019s short-lived fling with actor Tom Hiddleston.\n\n\u201cHurtful to me at this point that her and her team would go so far out of their way to try and make ME look bad at this stage though.\u201d\n\nOne year on, and Harris today dropped a teaser video for his upcoming fifth album, Funk Wav Bounces Vol. 1 \u2014 announcing an all-star cast of guest vocalists who\u2019ll feature on the project.\n\nIn prime position on the roll call? Katy Perry, aka Taylor Swift\u2019s number one pop rival.\n\nALBUM COMING JUNE 30 pic.twitter.com/zHJpBRdpqq \u2014 Calvin Harris (@CalvinHarris) May 9, 2017\n\nSwift and Perry have publicly traded barbs for years, ever since Swift sat down with Rolling Stone in 2014 to explain who the venom-filled lyrics of her song Bad Blood were about.\n\n\u201cFor years, I was never sure if we were friends or not,\u201d Swift said.\n\n\u201cShe would come up to me at awards shows and say something and walk away, and I would think, \u2018Are we friends, or did she just give me the harshest insult of my life?\u2019 [Then] she did something so horrible. I was like, \u2018Oh, we\u2019re just straight-up enemies.\u2019 And it wasn\u2019t even about a guy! It had to do with business,\u201d she added.\n\nThe business thing came down to each singer\u2019s dancers for their tour.\n\n\u201cShe basically tried to sabotage an entire arena tour. She tried to hire a bunch of people out from under me. And I\u2019m surprisingly nonconfrontational \u2014 you would not believe how much I hate conflict. So now I have to avoid her. It\u2019s awkward, and I don\u2019t like it.\u201d\n\nA day after Swift\u2019s comments, Katy Perry tweeted a reference to Mean Girls.\n\nWatch out for the Regina George in sheep's clothing... \u2014 Katy Perry (@katyperry) September 9, 2014\n\nDuring last year\u2019s This Is What You Came For songwriting feud, Harris even made it clear whose side he was on when he tweeted in regards to Swift: \u201cI know you\u2019re off tour and you need someone new to try and bury like Katy ETC but I\u2019m not that guy, sorry. I won\u2019t allow it.\u201d\n\nSo here\u2019s how you get back at your shady ex-girlfriend when you\u2019re a millionaire music producer: Write a ready-made hit for her biggest pop rival. Bad Blood 2.0, anybody?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170509235759im_/http://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/thumbnail/4b1eaf45cf37a4be91491b023af2a139",
