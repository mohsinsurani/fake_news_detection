Video: CBS\n\nBono has said that US presidential nominee Donald Trump could potentially \"destroy\" America.\n\nIn an interview with Charlie Rose on US network CBS, the U2 front man said Trump is \"potentially the worst idea that ever happened to America\".\n\nBono said America is different from other countries because it is \u201can idea\u201d, one which Trump is \u201ctrying to hijack\u201d.\n\n\u201cThat idea is bound up in justice and equality for all. I think he\u2019s hijacked the party.\n\nREAD MORE\n\n\u201cI think he\u2019s trying to hijack the idea of America. And I think it\u2019s bigger than all of us. I think this is really dangerous.\u201d\n\nIn a separate interview with ATTN, an online media company aimed at younger people, Bono has recalled the historic struggle of Irish immigrants to the United States in calling on the country's political leaders to open its doors to Syrian refugees.\n\nHe said that to turn people away just because they are refugees was \u201ca betrayal of the whole idea of America\u201d.\n\n\u201cThe promised land belongs to those who need it most. The Irish needed it. The Jews needed it. The Syrians now need it,\u201d he said in an interview.\n\nAsked about US political opposition to accepting refugees into the country, Bono said: \u201cI\u2019m Irish. It\u2019s deeply offensive. We were economic refugees. This thing of a continent behaving like an island, this shrivel and pretend the world doesn\u2019t exist, it\u2019s not possible any more in a globalized world. It\u2019s just not possible.\u201d", "images": ["https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/BJJKNJJHDJDGDDODHEER7FDH44.png", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/upkx0PetQkOCVsJSdpeInaRPAGU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/VLIB3KWFAVCUQ5S46GLKLFO4WQ.jpg", "https://cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/T2XGUGDSUZCOZAYIQEKG2TWML4.png", "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/oT0Yv9_lmA03_AFf0b54L0mXtSU=/84x0/filters:format(png):quality(70)/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/irishtimes/2f17d73d-927c-4607-b082-c5959ede1efa.png", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/irishtimes/1647534191733.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8946263&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/upkx0PetQkOCVsJSdpeInaRPAGU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/VLIB3KWFAVCUQ5S46GLKLFO4WQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Simon Carswell", "Wed Sep -"], "canonical_link": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/bono-says-donald-trump-could-destroy-america-1.2799569", "title": "Bono says Donald Trump could \u2018destroy\u2019 America", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "U2 front man says Republican is \u2018potentially the worst idea that ever happened to US\u2019", "twitter": {"description": "U2 front man says Republican is \u2018potentially the worst idea that ever happened to US\u2019", "title": "Bono says Donald Trump could \u2018destroy\u2019 America", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/upkx0PetQkOCVsJSdpeInaRPAGU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/VLIB3KWFAVCUQ5S46GLKLFO4WQ.jpg", "site": "@IrishTimes", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "U2 front man says Republican is \u2018potentially the worst idea that ever happened to US\u2019", "title": "Bono says Donald Trump could \u2018destroy\u2019 America", "image": "https://www.irishtimes.com/resizer/upkx0PetQkOCVsJSdpeInaRPAGU=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-eu-central-1.images.arcpublishing.com/irishtimes/VLIB3KWFAVCUQ5S46GLKLFO4WQ.jpg", "type": "article", "site_name": "The Irish Times", "url": "https://www.irishtimes.com/news/world/us/bono-says-donald-trump-could-destroy-america-1.2799569"}, "keywords": "us-election,charlie-rose,donald-trump", "robots": "noarchive"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.irishtimes.com", "summary": ""}
