The source of that controversy also just so happens to be available for purchase at your nearest seller of fine books. It\u2019s Caitlyn Jenner\u2018s new memoir, and select Kardashian can\u2019t help but keeping talking about how very, very controversial it is.\n\nThe Secrets of My Life comes out almost two years after Jenner revealed she was indeed transgender and has undergone a process to confirm her gender (it\u2019s co-written by Buzz Bissinger, the famed sportswriters who also wrote the Caitlyn Jenner cover story for Vanity Fair). It details Jenner\u2019s experience struggling with her gender identity in private while living as a sports hero, an icon of American masculinity and then, of course, her very public transition.\n\nOf course, Jenner\u2019s reality TV trailblazing family is mentioned throughout, and they clearly are very, very upset with it and don\u2019t care how many members of the book-buying public happen to know about it.\n\nDuring an appearance that airs today on Ellen, one of America\u2019s highest-rated daytime talk shows, Kardashian klan lynchpin Kim discussed her displeasure with parts of the book that happens to have a suggested retail price of $30 but is available to buy now from several online and bricks-and-motor retailers.\n\n\u201cMy heart breaks for my mom [Kris Jenner,] you know, because I feel like she\u2019s been through so much and [Jenner is] promoting this book and she\u2019s saying all these things,\u201d Kardashian , who has just shy of 100 million Instagram followers, told host Ellen DeGeneres, who has 44 million Instagram followers. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s necessary and I just feel like it\u2019s unfair, things aren\u2019t truthful.\u201d\n\nKardashian refers to claims Caitlyn Jenner makes that Kris Jenner knew she was transgender before they were married.\n\nKim Kardashian says that while she hasn\u2019t talked to Caitlyn Jenner for a few weeks ever since news of the contents of the book began to surface in advance of its release, as is standard for any high-profile celebrity memoir, she will always love her.\n\n\u201cI feel like it\u2019s taken [Jenner] a really long time to be honest with herself, so I don\u2019t expect her to be honest about my mom now,\u201d Kardashian West told DeGeneres in a segment obtained by E! News before the interview aired. \u201cBut it\u2019s just so hurtful. I wish her all the success in the world, but not at our expense.\u201d\n\nKris Jenner herself also reacted to the memoir on the family\u2019s long running reality show on an episode that premieres Sunday, just days before the book\u2019s scheduled release. \u201cNone of it makes sense! Everything she says is all made up,\u201d Jenner rants on national television about her portrayal in her ex-spouse\u2019s book. \u201cWhy does everything have to be that Kris is such a bitch?\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Caitlyn Jenner, who also recorded an audio version of the book, recently claimed on Andy Cohen\u2019s SiriusXM talk show that she hasn\u2019t talked to Khloe Kardashian in two years. This despite the fact that claim is contradicted by scenes from the family\u2019s reality show. Still, we are left to assume that Khloe is also very mad about the book, which is also available to download on your Kindle, Nook or other e-reader devices.\n\nOf course, this all begs the question: Will anyone want to read something that apparently has caused so much highly publicized controversy within the Kardashian clan? The book may currently be number 28 on Amazon\u2019s best-seller list, but we can only imagine it might have climbed higher if not for this onslaught of negative publicity that all happens to coincide with its release.\n\nWe can also only hope that someday the wounds heal, and the extended Kardashian-Jenner family can someday reunite back into the family unit that supports each other\u2019s products and endeavors in perfect, publicity-optimized harmony.\n\nRelated: ****Inside Donald J.
