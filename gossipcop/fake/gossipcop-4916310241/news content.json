He was assessed a flagrant-2 on the play.\n\nInstead of leaving the court and going to the locker room, however, Thompson was at the center of a scrum during which he shoved the basketball in the face of Warriors forward Draymond Green.\n\nWhen asked what led tempers to flare, Thompson said Warriors guard Shaun Livingston took an unnecessary shot (NSFW language):\n\nThat confrontation caught the eye of Los Angeles Clippers guard Patrick Beverley:\n\nThompson had a quiet game to open the series. The 6'9\", 238-pound big man posted just two points on 1-of-4 shooting while grabbing five rebounds. He recorded a plus/minus of minus-nine in 20 minutes.\n\nAlthough he did not make an impact in Game 1, Thompson may be a key to victory for Cleveland. When the Cavs won their first-ever championship in 2016, Thompson was a force in the paint, averaging 10.3 points and 10.1 rebounds per game in the Finals.\n\nThe on-court altercation could have led to the suspension of multiple Cavaliers. Like Thompson, Kevin Love also avoided a ban for his Game 1 actions. Love was not checked into the game at the time of the skirmish, but he found himself on the court at the time of the pushing and shoving, though he quickly made his way back to the sideline.", "images": ["https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/molecules/nav/flagUKGray.png", "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/745/044/hi-res-c7003b19650a5029292622ad6aa14442_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/molecules/nav/flagUK.png", "https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/molecules/nav/flagUS.png", "https://media.bleacherreport.com/w_40,h_27,c_fill/br-img-images/003/745/044/hi-res-c7003b19650a5029292622ad6aa14442_crop_north.jpg"], "top_img": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/745/044/hi-res-c7003b19650a5029292622ad6aa14442_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kyle Newport"], "canonical_link": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1", "title": "Tristan Thompson Fined $25K, Not Suspended for Altercation at End of Game 1", "meta_data": {"aol-te-auth": "1c424580-0f86-4d9b-88b2-bc8c0d029d4c", "blitz": "mu-6e4ce5cd-57f20d11-7c0ecee9-d55c79e2", "msvalidate.01": "7A63840181953B2A5A1FEA25FB45A991", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "verify-v1": "+Ntj422Jc4V03qgBqLYbF3LMvrursV0X2btn2Zoqn9w=", "description": "Cleveland Cavaliers center  Tristan Thompson  has avoided a suspension for Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals following his actions near the end of Game 1 on Thursday night...", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 135174055162}, "al": {"iphone": {"url": "teamstream://article/bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1", "app_store_id": 418075935, "app_name": "Bleacher Report"}, "ipad": {"url": "teamstream://article/bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1", "app_store_id": 484725748, "app_name": "Bleacher Report"}, "android": {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1", "app_name": "Bleacher Report", "package": "com.bleacherreport.android.teamstream"}, "web": {"url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1"}}, "og": {"site_name": "Bleacher Report", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Cleveland Cavaliers center  Tristan Thompson  has avoided a suspension for Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals following his actions near the end of Game 1 on Thursday night...", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/745/044/hi-res-c7003b19650a5029292622ad6aa14442_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "title": "Tristan Thompson Fined $25K, Not Suspended for Altercation at End of Game 1", "type": "article", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "0c768466449ebb550411234d6d4ffc30"}, "theme-color": "#000", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "Bleacher Report", "ipad": "Bleacher Report", "googleplay": "Bleacher Report"}, "id": {"iphone": 418075935, "ipad": 484725748, "googleplay": "com.bleacherreport.android.teamstream"}, "url": {"googleplay": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1", "ipad": "teamstream://article/bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1", "iphone": "teamstream://article/bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1"}}, "widgets": {"new-embed-design": "on"}, "site": "@bleacherreport", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Cleveland Cavaliers center  Tristan Thompson  has avoided a suspension for Game 2 of the 2018 NBA Finals following his actions near the end of Game 1 on Thursday night...", "image": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/745/044/hi-res-c7003b19650a5029292622ad6aa14442_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75", "title": "Tristan Thompson Fined $25K, Not Suspended for Altercation at End of Game 1", "url": "https://bleacherreport.com/articles/2779009-tristan-thompson-fined-25k-not-suspended-for-altercation-at-end-of-game-1"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bleacherreport"}, "author": "Kyle Newport", "pubdate": "2018-06-01T22:32:08-04:00", "thumbnail": "https://img.bleacherreport.net/img/images/photos/003/745/044/hi-res-c7003b19650a5029292622ad6aa14442_crop_exact.jpg?w=1200&h=1200&q=75"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://bleacherreport.com", "summary": ""}
