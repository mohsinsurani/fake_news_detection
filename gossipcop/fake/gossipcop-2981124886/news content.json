Now that baby Stormi is four months old, she\u2019s starting to show more defined features in her face and sources exclusively revealed to In Touch that there is a part of Travis that is starting to doubt Stormi\u2019s paternity and whether or not he is the little girl\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cTravis is starting to get a little worried and questioning Kylie about this whole bodyguard situation. Not to diss or say Kylie\u2019s a liar but, he doesn\u2019t watch her every move. He\u2019s not with her 24/7 and there were times they were a part from each other nine months ago. He loves Stormi and truly believes that\u2019s his daughter but can\u2019t help but notice that she doesn\u2019t look like him. In the back of his mind he wonders if Kylie strayed. If that happened and Stormi\u2019s not his, that would be the most devastating news of his life. He flat out wants to talk to Kylie and Tim, together, to once and for all get to the bottom of this.\u201d\n\nEver since Kylie started sharing more and more photos of baby Stormi, fans started to realize that Ky\u2019s daugther kind of looks like she has some of Tim\u2019s features and they started to point it out in the comments. And given the whirlwind nature of Kylie\u2019s relationship with Travis \u2014 they started dating just one month after her split from her ex-boyfriend Tyga \u2014 and the fact that Travis was busy touring during the beginning of their relationship, it seems like there could have very well been a few instances where Kylie could have been alone with her security guard.\n\nAccording to sources, Tim even bragged about how much alone time he has been able to spend with Kylie. \u201cHe\u2019s telling his friends that he\u2019s been alone with Kylie tons of times in her house but when they ask if [they\u2019ve been intimate], he simply smiles,\u201d and an insider revealed to In Touch.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tim-stormi-2.jpg?fit=400%2C400&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C400", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travis-scott-tim-chung-stormi-paternity.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travis-scott-tim-chung-stormi-paternity.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Hernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/travis-scott-tim-chung-stormi-paternity-159907/", "title": "Travis Scott Is Starting to Doubt If He's Stormi's Dad Amid Tim Chung Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Earlier this month, rumors started swirling that Kylie Jenner's daughter Stormi Webster might not be her boyfriend Travis Scott's child because of", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Travis Scott Is Starting to Doubt If He's Stormi's Dad Amid Tim Chung Rumors", "description": "Earlier this month, rumors started swirling that Kylie Jenner\u2018s daughter Stormi Webster might not be her boyfriend Travis Scott\u2019s child because of the shocking resemblence that Stormi has to Kylie\u2019s hot AF bodyguard...", "url": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/travis-scott-tim-chung-stormi-paternity-159907/", "site_name": "In Touch Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-13T01:20:10+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travis-scott-tim-chung-stormi-paternity.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travis-scott-tim-chung-stormi-paternity.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/InTouchWeekly", "published_time": "2018-05-12T21:57:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-13T01:20:10+00:00"}, "author": "Emma Hernandez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Travis Scott Is Starting to Doubt If He's Stormi's Dad Amid Tim Chung Rumors", "description": "Earlier this month, rumors started swirling that Kylie Jenner\u2018s daughter Stormi Webster might not be her boyfriend Travis Scott\u2019s child because of the shocking resemblence that Stormi has to Kylie\u2019s hot AF bodyguard...", "image": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/travis-scott-tim-chung-stormi-paternity.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@heycoffeeeyes", "site": "@intouchweekly"}, "fb": {"admins": 593583017, "pages": 75932763901}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/android-chrome-192x192-1.jpeg?fit=192%2C192&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526162220.0, "source": "http://www.intouchweekly.com", "summary": ""}
