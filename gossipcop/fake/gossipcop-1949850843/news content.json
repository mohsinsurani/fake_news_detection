We've rounded up 11 things you need to know about Sofia!\n\n\n\n1.

It all went down after Justin noticed his fans were leaving cruel comments about Sofia on his Instagram. He warned followers that he was going to make his account private if they continued to harass his new love interest. Selena weighed in, leaving a few messages in the comments section before Justin ultimately deactivated his account. She has since apologized over Snapchat, however.
