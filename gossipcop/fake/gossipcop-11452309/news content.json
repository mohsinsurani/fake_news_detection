As fans may remember, Paula Abdul struggled with an eating disorder years ago, and she thankfully managed to recover her health. However, these days her close ones are worried that getting injured on tour could cause her to relapse into bulimia.\n\nLast month, the former American Idol judge strained a muscle and had to cancel some dates on the Total Package Tour with New Kids on the Block and Boyz II Men.\n\n\u2018This is the last thing Paula needs right now. She has worked so hard to get back into shape. Paula is using muscles she has not exercised in years as part of her grueling stage show, and that is probably the cause of her injury. Paula could start worrying that she hurt herself because she is too heavy \u2014 and that could trigger her eating disorder!\u2019 stated one worried close pal.\n\nPaula has admitted that it hasn\u2019t been easy climbing on stage at the age of 55 and stated that it was crazy she was doing things she used to do 28 years prior.\n\nIn the early 1990s, 5-foot-2 star\u2019s weight was around 103 pounds.\n\nAbdul revealed she used to either eat all the time and then exercise like crazy trying to lose the weight or she wouldn\u2019t eat at all.\n\nOne day, she looked at herself in the mirror and realized she needed professional help.\n\n\u2018My bones were sticking out through my skin. My legs looked as thin as toothpicks. To me, I looked like one of those starving kids from Africa that you see on TV.\u2019\n\nAfter her split from husband, Emilio Estevez in 1994 things got worse as the stress caused her to start bringing again.\n\nShe finally checked into the Laureate Psychiatric Clinic and Hospital in Tulsa.\n\nDr. Gabe Mirkin warns that a bulimia relapse could be very dangerous for Abdul.\n\nThe vomiting would increase acidity in blood flow, ruining the body\u2019s chemical balance and its ability to process food.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEven more terrifying, the acid build-up can lead to gastrointestinal bleeding and ulcers.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Paula-Abdul-Reveals-She-Once-Threatened-To-Quit-American-Idol-Because-Of-This-Contestant-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/62ace192a36e9a7c71f52eb1bb4fcc41?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/karlie-kloss-amaio-bikini-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/katy-perry-christian-siriano-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Carrie-Underwood--700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/arie-luyendyk-jr-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/eisxmppxuaaecui-300x207.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/lamar-jackson-cardchronicle-com_-300x200.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201200%20630%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/yaya-mayweather-and-nba-youngboy-innersane-com_-300x190.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paula-abdul.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/od2uj6ifkamaiwjzqpkk-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/nicki-minaj-pink-hair-300x193.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/amber-portwood-matt-baier-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kandi-burruss-ace-big-brother-300x200.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NickMarkus-1-60x60.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201128081934im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paula-abdul.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Markus", "Barbara Givens", "S.
