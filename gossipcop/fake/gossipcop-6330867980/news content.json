The battle is ON!\n\nJennifer Hudson and Kelly Clarkson are two of American Idol\u2019s most famous alumni\u2026but they won\u2019t be on the show\u2019s judging panel when it returns to ABC next year. That\u2019s because both women are already booked as coaches on The Voice for seasons 13 and 14, respectively. So, now, Idol is going after Christina Aguilera, who\u2019s worked for six seasons on The Voice, as revenge. \u201cABC is ready to make a serious offer to steal Christina from The Voice,\u201d an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThey are looking to pay Christina a lot and sell the fact to her that The Voice has forgotten about her. Idol is very much ready to make the move and hopes Christina bites.\u201d\n\nChristina was one of the original coaches on The Voice, and served on the first three seasons before taking a break during season 4. She returned for seasons 5, 8 and, finally, season 10, when her contestant, Alisan Porter, was named the winner. After that, the powerful singer took some time off to work on her own music, and since J.Hud, Adam Levine, Blake Shelton and Miley Cyrus have already been confirmed for the upcoming season 13, we know she won\u2019t be back then, either. So far, the fourth coach who will join Kelly, Adam and Blake on season 14 has not been announced.\n\nNo American Idol judges have been confirmed just yet, although HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY heard that Katy Perry is very close to signing a deal. The show is also eyeing alums like Chris Daughtry, Fantasia and Carrie Underwood for the reboot, which will premiere in the first half of 2018.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Christina would ever go to American Idol? Do you think she\u2019d be a good coach?\n\nJavaScript is required to load the comments.", "images":
