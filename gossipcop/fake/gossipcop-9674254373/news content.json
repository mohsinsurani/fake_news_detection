In February, for example, she tweeted a photo of herself holding a mobile device, with the caption, \u201cLumee Duo! It launched in Apple stores & has lights on front & the back so u can take insane pics! It\u2019s a softer case now too #LumeeCollab.\u201d The following month, she tweeted another shot of herself on her phone and exclaimed, \u201cThis is happening! The Lumee Black Duo is now in Apple Globally -Loving the back light! #lumeecollab.\u201d\n\nShe similarly noted on Twitter in April, while taking a selfie, \u201cWhite Lumee Duo In Apple stores worldwide #LumeeCollab.\u201d And the Instagram photo above was her promoting an earlier version of LuMee in July 2016, with a link to Amazon and a caption that read, \u201cHey Guys! LuMee cases are featured today as Amazon\u2019s Prime Deal of the Day. Best deal ever! #PrimeDay #LuMee.\u201d\n\nAfter meeting and taking a selfie with then-presidential candidate Hillary Clinton at a fundraiser, Kardashian used the encounter to later promote LuMee. In fact, when Clinton was asked in January 2016 on the \u201cEllen Degeneres Show\u201d about taking a selfie with Kardashian, the Democratic presidential nominee recalled, \u201cShe takes out her phone and she presses a button. I\u2019ve never seen this anywhere else\u2026 it has lights all the way around it. Like little tiny, tiny light bulbs.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres acknowledged, \u201cI saw [Kardashian\u2019s] phone\u2026 It makes you look better,\u201d to which Clinton added, \u201cI have been desperately looking for one of those ever since with no luck!\u201d And right after that, Kardashian tweeted, \u201cSelfies about to be LIT!!! The secret to my selfies http://Lumee.com.\u201d Gossip Cop has reached to SnapLight, LuMee, and Harooni for comment. A rep for Kardashian tells us, \u201cThe patent lawsuit filed by SnapLight has no merit and is just another attempted shakedown. Kim has done absolutely nothing wrong.\u201d\n\nPhoto: AOL", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e060fec1d185c8189dc7c80?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(180,60)&quality=80",
