Fans believed at first that the guy was a Spanish footballer, but he turned out to be a Saudi billionaire. He is the deputy president and vice chairman of Abdul Latif Jameel, one of the largest companies in the world. The Barbadian singer was in an on-and-off relationship with Chris Brown, 28, and it looks like her new beau fears that the \"With You\" singer might win her back.\n\nA source close to Rihanna, 29, recently told Hollywood Life that Jameel is worried that Brown keeps \"lurking in her past\" and is being unpredictable. Although RiRi has opened up to her new beau about her past, the Toyota heir is still concerned that Breezy can still win her back. He feels uncomfortable with the idea that the \"Kiss Kiss\" singer still loves her and might be able to take her back from him anytime.\n\nHowever, a separate source previously told the same news outlet that Rihanna hopes that the well-heeled Saudi Arabian can help her forget her dark past with Chris Brown. Now, fans are convinced that she has moved on gracefully from Breezy. The \"Umbrella\" singer recently stepped out with her new flame Hassan Jameel at the Grammys despite keeping their relationship under wraps.\n\n\"He feels like Chris is capable of trying anything to win her back and that has him feeling uneasy. Hassan tries not to worry about Chris, but knowing he may still love Rihanna makes him feel a bit tense.\"", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/debbc688a76131112f08c65ac894f55f?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c4ca7c76-1956-4818-b67f-af1d1f0cfe0c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e494db4a-e9aa-4be6-a73c-2041f4691eb1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4763486/hassan-jameel-is-reportedly-worried-that-chris-brown-might-win-rihanna-back/", "title": "Hassan Jameel Is Reportedly Worried That Chris Brown Might Win Rihanna Back", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hassan Jameel Is Reportedly Worried That Chris Brown Might Win Rihanna Back", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4763486/hassan-jameel-is-reportedly-worried-that-chris-brown-might-win-rihanna-back/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Hassan Jameel Is Reportedly Worried That Chris Brown Might Win Rihanna Back", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-01-31 00:18:03Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Hassan Jameel Is Reportedly Worried That Chris Brown Might Win Rihanna Back", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517357883.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
