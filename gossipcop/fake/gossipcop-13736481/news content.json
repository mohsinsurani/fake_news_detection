Like most celebrities, we expected Kylie to get back into shape quickly with a healthy diet and exercise. But recent photos reveal just how fast she dropped the pounds \u2014 and we\u2019re all wondering if it\u2019s healthy.\n\nSo, what\u2019s Kylie\u2019s weight-loss secret? Here\u2019s how she managed to lose a reported 25 pounds in just two weeks.\n\n1. Kylie allegedly follows Kim K\u2019s advice and eats super clean\n\nDuring her pregnancy, Kylie admitted to having an obsession with In-N-Out fast food, Insider notes. That\u2019s a serious departure from the way she currently eats, however. And thanks to Kim Kardashian, Kylie is getting serious one-on-one advice on how to drop excess fat and get into shape fast post-pregnancy.\n\nThe Independent says one source added Kim advised Kylie to stick to a strict 1,500 calorie-a-day diet. Along with that, Kim suggests Kylie eats no carbs or sugar, even despite her \u201caddiction\u201d to fast food.\n\nNext: Kylie has been a fan of this dangerous weight-loss method for awhile.\n\n2. She may be a fan of \u2018detox teas\u2019\n\nOne source says in addition to a very strict diet, Kylie is drinking \u201cdetox teas\u201d to help drop pounds, says HollywoodLife.com. This wouldn\u2019t be Kylie\u2019s first attempt at weight loss with these teas, either. She posted a photo of her holding two of her favorite detox formulas on Instagram and promoting their cleansing effects.\n\nHere\u2019s the problem, though: Teas don\u2019t actually have the ability to \u201cdetox\u201d your body. And drinking them won\u2019t automatically help you lose weight, either, though some do have a laxative effect. In this case, you\u2019ll just lose water weight.\n\nNext: This is how Kylie prefers to train.\n\n3. When she works out, she\u2019s sure to incorporate weight training\n\nThough sister Khloe has accused Kylie of not putting much work into her body in the past, those days are seemingly over for the young Jenner. HollywoodLife.com notes one insider reveals the new mom hits the gym for a mix of cardio and weight lifting. She\u2019s reportedly a big fan of running, squats, and push-ups to get that pre-baby body back.\n\nThe insider also says Kylie works out with a personal trainer five days a week for up to three hours a day. If this is the case, she could be leading up to serious burnout in the future, which can hinder her results in the long run.\n\nNext: Could it be true that Kylie is sticking to a diet this low in calories?\n\n4. Kylie sticks to an extremely calorie-restricted diet, some sources say\n\nKim might advise a 1,500 calorie-a-day diet, but could Kylie be going to even bigger extreme? The Inquisitr says one insider mentions Kylie\u2019s eating as little as 1,000 calories a day. They also said sometimes the starlet will just eat soup in the early evening as a meal replacement. And of course, this combined with no carbs or sugary sweets is sure to cause massive weight loss, even if it\u2019s not sustainable.\n\nThe source says it gets even more severe than this, too. Allegedly, Kylie bans anyone from eating junk food around her so she\u2019s not tempted.\n\nNext: Kylie might go overboard quickly with her regimen.\n\n5. Some say she wants to look even thinner than she did pre-pregnancy\n\nInStyle explains pre-pregnancy, Kylie was around 136 pounds, which is perfect for her 5-foot-6 frame. During her pregnancy, however, she gained upwards of 50 pounds. And now, the Inquisitr notes one source says she wants to be even thinner than she was before baby Stormi was ever in the picture.\n\nRush reports Kylie was right in the \u201cnormal\u201d weight range at 136, so she shouldn\u2019t aim to go too far under this number. We\u2019ll have to see how extreme she goes with her regimen \u2014 though hopefully she\u2019ll make healthy adjustments.\n\nNext: Some think this is the reason Kylie\u2019s losing weight so quickly.\n\n6. Others say the weight is falling off naturally due to genetics\n\nIs it possible Kylie\u2019s not really partaking in extreme dieting after all, and the weight is falling off due to good genes? That\u2019s what one source tells HollywoodLife.com. They told the publication that \u201cher biggest weight loss secret is breastfeeding and good genetics. She has always had a great metabolism and breastfeeding has kicked it into high gear.\u201d\n\nCould it be true that the young Jenner isn\u2019t going to any extremes after all? Maybe so. And for more drama, the source also mentions Kim\u2019s jealous the pounds are coming off so easily for Kylie after her own personal struggles with baby weight.\n\nNext: Should Kylie lose weight this fast? Experts weigh in.\n\n7. Here\u2019s what medical experts believe Kylie should be doing post-pregnancy\n\nDr. Elizabeth Ward tells WebMD all about weight gain and loss before and after pregnancy. Ward says a woman at an average weight should expect to gain between 25 and 35 pound, and they should also work to lose that excess weight after a year of having the baby. For at least six weeks postpartum, however, she suggests focusing on a healthy diet instead of cutting calories.\n\nWard also warns new mothers against following celebrity fad diets to lose weight quickly. Good nutrition, sleep, and physical activity are all vital for keeping energy levels up to take care of a newborn. And restricting calories if you\u2019re a nursing mom will affect breast milk quality.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://amplifypixel.outbrain.com/pixel?mid=0034bb066d42696be38e2f3f9e15a0d462", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/GettyImages-178667140-300x200.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Prince-Charles-and-Princess-Diana-Wedding-Photo-300x200.png?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kim-Kylie-Chicago-nursery-640x360.png?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kylie-jenner-prabal-gurung-333x500.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Expecting-baby-640x426.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/05/Woman-Running-Outdoors-300x200.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/warren-buffett2-640x429-300x200.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kylie-Jenner-teatox-609x500.png?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kylie-Jenner-mirror-selfie-in-her-bathroom-587x500.png?x90866", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Kate-and-William-1-300x200.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Brittany-Maynard-2-300x200.png?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/melania-gardening-balmain-300x200.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Brad-Pitt-and-Angelina-Jolie-300x200.png?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-stormi-duo-640x453.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kylie-Jenner-mirrr-selfie.png?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kim-Kylie-Chicago-nursery-640x360.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Two-cups-of-expresso-surrounded-by-coffee-beans-300x200.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Insomnia-300x200.jpg?x90866", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Kim-Kylie-Chicago-nursery-640x360.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Weiler"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180312204214/https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/how-kylie-jenner-lost-weight-post-pregnancy.html/?a=viewall", "title": "Kylie Jenner Has Lost a Startling Amount of Weight Post-Pregnancy, and Here\u2019s How", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cheat Sheet", "robots": "NOODP,NOYDIR", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/how-kylie-jenner-lost-weight-post-pregnancy.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "After Kylie Jenner had baby Stormi, fans freaked out about her sudden weight loss.
