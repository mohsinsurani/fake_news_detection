Naturally, this produced a deluge of reactions online from notable individuals.\n\nThough not normally directly involved with politics, those in Hollywood have never been shy about sharing their opinions on relevant headline-grabbing news. So in addition to the political pundits on news networks such as CNN and Fox, those in the entertainment industry have taken to Twitter to speak out on the Manafort story. This includes James Gunn, Rob Reiner, Rosie O\u2019Donnel, Alyssa Milano and more.\n\nSpecifically, Manafort and business associate Rick Gates have been indicted on 12 counts, which include: conspiracy against the U.S., conspiracy to launder money, unregistered agent of a foreign principal, false and misleading statements related to the U.S. Foreign Agents Registration Act, false statements, and seven counts of failure to file reports of foreign bank and financial accounts. However, none of these charges are directly related to the Trump campaign as of yet. Per the New York Times, the FBI has been investigating Manafort long before he was hired by Trump for suspicion of tax violations and money laundering.\n\nIn this instance, Manafort has been indicted on charges that he \u201cfunneled millions of dollars through overseas shell companies and used the money to buy luxury cars, real estate, antiques and expensive suits.\u201d\n\nMembers of Hollywood wasted no time in adding their voices to the rising chorus against Manafort:\n\nDonald Trump has known Paul Manafort for nearly 40 years. First hired him for lobbying over 30 years ago. He owns a home in Trump Tower. \u2014 Shaun King (@ShaunKing) October 30, 2017\n\nThe Manafort indictments make you wonder anew why Roger Stone was freaking out on Twitter the other day. Who might Paul flip on\u2026? \u2014 Joy Reid (@JoyAnnReid) October 30, 2017\n\nThere are 12 charges. It rather evokes a Xmas carol: \u201cOn the first day of charges, Mueller gave to me: Manafort on treas\u2019nous conspiracy!\u201d \u2014 George Takei (@GeorgeTakei) October 30, 2017\n\nHey @realDonaldTrump! Just a reminder! Paul Manafort is your former campaign manager. He\u2019s turning himself in to the feds. #neverforget \u2014 Alyssa Milano (@Alyssa_Milano) October 30, 2017\n\nWe are being given an opportunity to build a better world. 2/2 \u2014 James Gunn (@JamesGunn) October 30, 2017\n\nToday we're seeing the tip of the tip of the iceberg. The sinking of America's first crime family. \u2014 Rob Reiner (@robreiner) October 30, 2017\n\nWhy did Trump choose a person with close, complex & illegal connections to Russia as his campaign mgr? \u2014 Mia Farrow (@MiaFarrow) October 30, 2017\n\nI called this a year and half ago. pic.twitter.com/U98IwhwdDn \u2014 David Wain (@davidwain) October 30, 2017\n\nPaul Manafort at this moment pic.twitter.com/lqdAp8NWRw \u2014 Ike Barinholtz (@ikebarinholtz) October 30, 2017\n\nFor his part, Trump continues to deny any wrongdoing and instead has suggested that Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign colluded with Russia.", "images": ["https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/gettyimages-524993070.jpg?quality=80&w=970&strip", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=37161820&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/gettyimages-524993070.jpg?quality=80&strip", "https://observer-media.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/gettyimages-524993070.jpg?quality=80&w=970", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=618909876214345&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://observer.com/wp-content/themes/newyorkobserver-2014/images/observer-logo-2015.png"], "top_img": "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/10/gettyimages-524993070.jpg?quality=80&strip", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Katz", "Brandon Katz Is A Pop Culture Junkie", "A Senior Entertainment Reporter Covering Film", "Television.
