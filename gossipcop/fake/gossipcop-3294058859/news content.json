Now a source tells Radar exclusively Barr is asking Seinfeld to consider having her as guest on his show Comedians In Cars Getting Coffee.\n\n\u201cShe wants to give her side of the story in a casual setting and reassure people she\u2019s not the pariah she\u2019s made out to be.\u201d\n\nAs Radar readers are well aware, Barr faced a swift comeuppance after her racist Twitter rant in May. The hit revival of her show was immediately cancelled, and a reboot minus the controversial comedian will replace it.\n\nIn June, Seinfeld came to Barr\u2019s defense, telling ET \u201cI didn\u2019t see why it was necessary to fire her.\n\n\u201cWhy would you murder someone who\u2019s committing suicide?\u201d he asked, then added, \u201cBut I never saw someone ruin their entire career with one button push. That was fresh.\u201d\n\nThe support from one of the country\u2019s most beloved comedians has helped Barr as she tries to recover her reputation.\n\n\u201cShe really appreciated the way Jerry stuck up for her and said she shouldn\u2019t have been fired,\u201d the source said. \u201cThat\u2019s given her hope.\u201d", "images":
