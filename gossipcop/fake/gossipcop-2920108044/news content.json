Her biggest acting job since then is dark British TV comedy \u201cSick Note,\u201d in which she plays a supporting role in the second season that began airing last week.\n\nThe Mykonos beach club is Lohan\u2019s third business venture in Greece following the 2016 opening of a nightclub bearing her name in Athens and a beach house in Rhodes which is due to open this summer.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8&w=800"], "top_img": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8&w=800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-lindsay-lohan-idUSKBN1KK27E", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8&w=800", "src": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180730&t=2&i=1288512599&r=LYNXMPEE6T1I8&w=800"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "description": "Lindsay Lohan, whose promising movie career crashed in a string of legal woes and substance abuse, is returning to U.S. television in a reality series about her night club ventures in Greece.", "author": "Reuters Staff", "keywords": "US,PEOPLE,LINDSAY,LOHAN,Celebrities,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Europe,Greece,Living / Lifestyle,Pictures,Video Available,Personalities / People,Picture Available,Television,United States,Video", "news_keywords": "US;PEOPLE;LINDSAY;LOHAN;Celebrities;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;Europe;Greece;Living / Lifestyle;Pictures;Video Available;Personalities / People;Picture Available;Television;United States;Video", "REVISION_DATE": "2018-07-31T13:00:04Z", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2018-07-31T13:00:04Z", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Staff", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-lindsay-lohan-idUSKBN1KK27E", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "us", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,PEOPLE,LINDSAY,LOHAN,Celebrities,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,Europe,Greece,Living / Lifestyle,Pictures,Video Available,Personalities / People,Picture Available,Television,United States,Video", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-PEOPLE-LINDSAY-LOHAN", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Image-Video", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Lindsay Lohan to make U.S. TV comeback in MTV reality series", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article -
