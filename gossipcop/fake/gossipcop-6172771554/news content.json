Blake isn\u2019t going to lose sleep over it, but he definitely feels like Luke is an amazing get for the show and Idol did it right by getting him.\u201d The American Idol re-boot had a lot of trouble locking down judges after convincing Katy Perry to commit, but at the last minute, they roped in Luke and Lionel Richie. The trio started filming auditions on Oct. 3.\n\nLuke actually helped Blake out as a team advisor on season 12 of The Voice, but at that time, the season 13 coaches\u2019 panel of Blake, Adam Levine, Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson had already been set. For season 14, Blake and Adam will return with Kelly Clarkson and a still-to-be-named fourth coach. So far on the show, there hasn\u2019t been more than one country singer on the panel, so even though Blake was hoping for his pal to join, the possibility probably wasn\u2019t very likely. Now, it looks like the bros will be going head to head in the ratings when both shows air next spring!\n\nBlake has a great track record as a coach on The Voice, and has won the show a total of FIVE times. He has some stiff competition this season, and his fellow coaches are ALL out to take him down, so things should get good as things continue!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you excited to see Luke on American Idol? Do you wish he went to The Voice instead?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/blake-shelton-luke-bryan-join-american-idol-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/eniko-parrish-shows-off-baby-bump-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e599b89c6e3391a17ea5f499b031a076?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/prince-harry-design-custom-ring-for-meghan-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F10%2F04%2Fblake-shelton-luke-bryan-american-idol-jealous-the-voice%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2813822", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/khloe-kardashian-good-american-dominatrix-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/blake-shelton-luke-bryan-join-american-idol-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Writer Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/04/blake-shelton-luke-bryan-american-idol-jealous-the-voice/", "title": "Blake Shelton \u2018Disappointed\u2019 Luke Bryan Joined \u2018American Idol\u2019 Over \u2018The Voice\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Blake Shelton is pretty disappointed that Luke Bryan will be on 'American Idol,' because he wanted his friend to join him on 'The Voice.'", "news_keywords": "American Idol, Blake Shelton, Luke Bryan, The Voice", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton \u2018Disappointed\u2019 Luke Bryan Joined \u2018American Idol\u2019 Over \u2018The Voice\u2019", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/04/blake-shelton-luke-bryan-american-idol-jealous-the-voice/", "description": "Blake Shelton and Luke Bryan are competitors now that Luke is on \u2018American Idol\u2019 \u2014 and HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned that Blake is pretty disappointed about his pal&#8\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/blake-shelton-luke-bryan-join-american-idol-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-04T13:19:55+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-04T15:47:38+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "text": {"title": "Blake Shelton \u2018Disappointed\u2019 Luke Bryan Joined \u2018American Idol\u2019 Over \u2018The Voice\u2019"}, "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171006122019im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/blake-shelton-luke-bryan-join-american-idol-ftr.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blake Shelton \u2018Disappointed\u2019 Luke Bryan Joined \u2018American Idol\u2019 Over \u2018The Voice\u2019", "description": "Blake Shelton is pretty disappointed that Luke Bryan will be on 'American Idol,' because he wanted his friend to join him on 'The Voice.'"}, "author": "Alyssa Norwin", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "application-name": "Hollywood Life", "msapplication-window": "width=device-width;height=device-height", "msapplication-tooltip": "Latest Hollywood Gossip, News & Celeb Pics", "msapplication-task": "name=Subscribe;action-uri=http://hollywoodlife.com/feed/;icon-uri=http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=16"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507071600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
