You heard that over and over \u2014 we heard that for decades. And nothing was done,\u201d the actor said.\n\nWhen asked why no one had come forward if they were aware of the alleged incident, Baldwin replied, \u201cRose McGowan took a payment of $100,000 and settled her case with him. And it was for Rose McGowan to prosecute that case.\u201d\n\nThe actor referenced a New York Times article on the subject of paying off sexual assault victims and posed the question, \u201cDo the settlement of these cases hurt the cause of exposing and bringing us to a place of real change?\u201d\n\nAdded Baldwin, \u201cWhen women take money, and are silenced by that money \u2014 even though they took the money and were silenced because they were told beyond the money it was the right thing for them to do, keep quiet, don\u2019t make too many waves, it\u2019s going to hurt your career \u2014 when they do it, nonetheless, does it set back the course of change?
