Shookus was also still with her husband Kevin Miller, then a fellow SNL producer. The two split in 2014.\n\nHowever, other sources close to Affleck and Shookus maintain that the two were just friends and didn\u2019t date before their respective separations.\n\nSources also say Garner spoke to Shookus\u2019 ex about the affair. After appearing on an episode of Late Night with Seth Meyers, where Miller is now a supervising producer, Garner sought him out for a conversation.\n\nThe first source says she showed him text messages between Affleck and Shookus, adding, \u201cshe had proof.\u201d (Miller and Shookus were already split at the time.)\n\nAffleck and Shookus have been spending time together in L.A. since going public with their relationship last week.\n\nFor much more on Affleck and Shookus, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ben Affleck Reportedly Dating SNL Producer Lindsay Shookus\n\nAffleck and Garner announced their separation in 2015 after over a decade of marriage and filed for divorce this past April. They have continued to closely co-parent their three children \u2014 Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5.\n\n\u201cBen and Jen continue to be dedicated to their family and kids,\u201d says a source who knows Affleck and Garner. \u201cThey have been separated for two years now and have never strayed from that dedication. They do it better than anyone.\u201d\n\nShookus married Kevin Miller in 2010 and the two share a daughter. \u201cThey\u2019re both really good friends still,\u201d says a source close to the situation. \u201cThey\u2019re both good, devoted parents. Lindsay and Kevin\u2019s marriage didn\u2019t end over infidelity. There were issues they couldn\u2019t resolve and they realized they were better as friends than together.\u201d\n\nGarner is handling her ex\u2019s public relationship fine, sources have said. \u201cNothing is new for her here,\u201d says one insider. \u201cShe\u2019s in mama-bear mode.\u201d", "images":
