In the beginning, it seemed like they were seeking privacy to avoid the wrath of Holmes\u2019s ex-husband Tom Cruise. (There\u2019s a persistent but unfounded rumor that Cruise put a five-year \u201cdating ban\u201d clause in the divorce agreement, which would have required Holmes to stay single in public until last year.) Then, it seemed like Foxx was the one who didn\u2019t want to go public with Holmes, to maintain his image as a single man. But over the last year, the two have been more open about the fact that they spend time together: They\u2019ve been spotted out to dinner multiple times and were photographed holding hands on a beach last September. So what\u2019s their status now?\n\nLast week, the mostly fictional gossip site RadarOnline reported that Holmes and Foxx were planning a wedding but recently called it off due to \u201ctrust issues.\u201d Surprisingly, Holmes\u2019s publicist responded to the report, telling People that it was \u201c100 percent untrue.\u201d So \u2026 they\u2019re together still? But not planning a wedding. But they\u2019re in love! At least according to the latest from \u201cPage Six.\u201d\n\nThe gossip site reported yesterday that Holmes and Foxx had a \u201clovey dovey FaceTime chat\u201d as Holmes was about to take off on a plane to Paris for Haute Couture Fashion Week. \u201cKatie was FaceTiming Jamie after they boarded,\u201d a source told the site. \u201cShe said she loves him and asked if he wanted \u2018cookies from Paris.\u2019 He was in Miami.\u201d The source added that Holmes\u2019s daughter, Suri Cruise, a nanny, and another friend were also on the flight.\n\nThis leak says to me that everything is status quo: Holmes and Foxx are together, they\u2019re not going to talk about it publicly, and there\u2019s probably never going to be a wedding.\n\nA few weeks ago we talked about Chris Pratt\u2019s potential new girlfriend, Katherine Schwarzenegger. She\u2019s the 28-year-old daughter of Arnold Schwarzenegger and Maria Shriver. She\u2019s a lifestyle blogger. And she\u2019s a Christian, apparently, which is what makes this Pratt relationship seem very plausible.\n\nPratt, who is 39, has been outspoken about his faith for the last five years or so. He is a regular attendee at Zoe Church, a millennial megachurch in L.A. founded by celebrity pastor Chad Veach. (Justin Bieber and several of Justin Bieber\u2019s girlfriends have attended services there.) Guess who is a close personal friend of Veach? Shriver. She \u201cinterviewed\u201d him for her Facebook page last December and noted that he comes to her house regularly to counsel her children.\n\nSo \u2026 did Veach set Pratt and Schwarzenegger up? Not exactly. According to reports in People and Us Weekly, Shriver was the one to make the match. An Us Weekly source said in a report yesterday that she set her daughter up with Pratt because \u201cthey\u2019re both active in the church.\u201d People\u2019s source said Pratt and Schwarzenegger have been on \u201cmultiple dates,\u201d including a picnic lunch in Santa Barbara that the paparazzi just so happened to catch last month. Did Shriver have something to do with that, too?\n\nOne small blessing from this week:\n\nKaley Cuoco got married in a horse barn.\n\nAnd here\u2019s an interesting blind item from this week, from Enty at Crazy Days and Nights:\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t believe the hype. This former A list mostly movie actress who probably has dropped to A- or maybe even a B+ list because she doesn\u2019t act as much, loves social media. She just doesn\u2019t want the public, or her actor husband [to know] that she has it, especially since she uses some of her secret accounts to make sure he is being relatively faithful.\u201d\n\nHmm \u2026 who just did a big magazine interview complaining about social media?\n\nFinally, I\u2019ll leave you with a rude little \u201cPage Six\u201d story about John Mayer. Mayer, who has been mounting a comeback of sorts in recent months, is apparently having a hard time finding a new famous woman to date. An anonymous celebrity publicist told the site, \u201cI would tell women in Hollywood to steer clear of him. He\u2019s manipulative. He has a reputation \u2026 and it\u2019s better to exercise caution dealing with anybody who kisses and tells.\u201d We all remember what he said about Jessica Simpson, yes? Look out, Cazzie David!\n\nPhoto: Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty Images\n\nThanks so much for gossiping this week.
