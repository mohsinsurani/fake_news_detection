Well, if you\u2019re Beyonce, 36, and JAY-Z, 48, it\u2019s a custom-made, diamond Lorraine Schwartz bracelet, worth a whooping $21,000, according to The Sun. That\u2019s right, Kim Kardashian, 37, and Kanye West\u2018s third baby \u2014 who arrived on January 15 \u2014 is about to be the most decked out infant, well\u2026 ever. And, get this \u2014 Bey and JAY reportedly had the bracelet engraved with the number \u201c3,\u201d to signify Kimye\u2019s third offspring.\n\n\u201cBeyonce and Jay could not be more pleased for them, they can\u2019t wait to meet the little one, and have sent them this gift already,\u201d a source told the outlet. \u201cIt shows they have all moved on from the past, and they are \u2018familia\u2019 once more.\u201d Although all parties involved are reportedly thrilled about burying the hatchet, \u201cKanye is over the moon as he has always considered JAY Z his \u2018big brother,\u2019 and Beyonce has always been one of his closest friends.\u201d Ironically, both power couples have three children each, and \u201cit\u2019s only a matter of time before the playdates begin,\u201d the source added. Bey and JAY are parents to twins Sir and Rumi, who they welcomed in June 2016, and Blue Ivy, 6. Kim and Kanye are parents their daughter, North, 4, and son, Saint, 1, along with their new baby girl.\n\nWhile this report indicates that JAY-Z and Kanye\u2019s feud is over, JAY already hinted that he wanted to bury the hatchet during an interview with The New York Times back in November 2017. \u201cBut, that happens,\u201d JAY admitted about there being tension with Ye\u2019. JAY explained: \u201cIn the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we\u2019re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that. You know what I\u2019m saying? There\u2019s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, \u2018These are the things that I\u2019m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he feels that I\u2019ve done things to him as well. You know what I\u2019m saying? These are \u2014 I\u2019m not a perfect human being by no stretch. You know.\u201d JAY also said that he had recently spoken with Ye\u2019 [at the time] and that they would always be good with each other. \u201cI love Kanye. I do,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated relationship with us.\u201d\n\nAs you may know, JAY and Ye\u2019s friendship took a hit back in 2016. In October of that year, Kanye went on a rant during one of his concerts where he slammed both JAY and Beyonce. He claimed their kids didn\u2019t play together, and he revealed that there was tension between him and JAY because of a TIDAL music dispute. Ye\u2019 even said that JAY and Beyonce didn\u2019t even call after Kim\u2019s 2016 Paris robbery. Just days after his rant, Kanye checked into UCLA Medical Center for an 8-9-day stay for an alleged mental breakdown.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Bey, JAY, Kim and Ye are all friends again?", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kanye-west-and-north-west-vote-for-kanye-splashnews-gal2.jpg?w=342", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kanye-west-and-north-west-vote-for-kanye-splashnews-gal1.jpg?w=331", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Sephora-Beauty-Advent-Calendars-2022.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beyonce-jay-z-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-baby-gift-ftr1.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beyonce-jay-z-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-baby-gift-ftr1.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/kim-kardashian-saint-west-north-west-rex-gallery-05.jpg?w=337", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/taylor-swift-joe-alwn.jpg?w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beyonce-jay-z-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-baby-gift-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Tamara Kraus", "Kristine Fellizar", "Lea Veloso", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/17/beyonce-jay-z-baby-gift-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-third-child-21k-bracelet/", "title": "Beyonce & Jay-Z\u2019s Reported Baby Gift For Kim & Kanye West Costs $23k \u2013 Hollywood Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Did the power couples kiss and make up? \u2014 That's the question after a new report claimed Beyonce and JAY-Z gifted Kimye's third baby with this custom-made, $23k piece of jewelry!", "news_keywords": "Beyonc\u00e9, HollyBaby, Jay-Z, Kanye West, Kim Kardashian", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/17/beyonce-jay-z-baby-gift-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-third-child-21k-bracelet/?ia_markup=1"}, "author": "Jenna Lemoncelli", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Beyonce & Jay-Z Reportedly Sent Kim Kardashian & Kanye West  $21k Baby Gift: Feud Over?", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/17/beyonce-jay-z-baby-gift-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-third-child-21k-bracelet/", "description": "Did the power couples kiss and make up? \u2014 That\u2019s the question after a new report claims Beyonce and JAY-Z gifted Kimye\u2019s new baby girl with this $23k, custom-made piece of jewelry!", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beyonce-jay-z-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-baby-gift-ftr1.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 350}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-17T22:00:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-17T22:38:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Beyonce & Jay-Z Reportedly Sent Kim Kardashian & Kanye West  $21k Baby Gift: Feud Over?", "description": "Did the power couples kiss and make up? \u2014 That's the question after a new report claimed Beyonce and JAY-Z gifted Kimye's third baby with this custom-made, $23k piece of jewelry!", "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/beyonce-jay-z-kim-kardashian-kanye-west-baby-gift-ftr1.jpg?w=620"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516147200.0, "source": "http://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
