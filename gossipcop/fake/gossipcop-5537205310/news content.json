Like famous mother-daughter duo Reese Witherspoon and Ava Phillippe before them, Catherine Zeta-Jones and her 15-year-old daughter Carys Zeta Douglas (her father is Michael Douglas) are carbon copies of one another. Proof: they\u2019re on the cover of Town & Country\u2019s September issue, which at first glance, looks as though you are seeing double \u2014 in the best way possible.\n\nCarys, though young, is in the midst of her show business debut as the third generation of an iconic acting family. She first caused a buzz when she made not one, but two, fashion week appearances, one at Michael Kors and the other at Dolce & Gabbana alongside her superstar mother. Since then, Douglas has developed quite the following, now touting 54,000 Instagram followers \u2014 sealing the deal for her as the next It Girl.\n\nIn the cover feature, Carys and her Oscar-winning mother discuss a number of topics, from their move from Bermuda to Manhattan, to her unique sense of style, which mom Zeta-Jones describes as \u201cmodern but age appropriate.\u201d\n\nBut the up-and-coming teenager isn\u2019t the only member of her family causing a stir, her mom has still got it. In fact, Zeta-Jones is currently filming a dark comedy series about a beauty pageant coach called Queen America. Clearly, as a family, they\u2019ve got a lot going on \u2014 and a ton of talent between them.\n\nTo see the incredible mother-daughter resemblance and get the illustrious details on Carys Zeta Douglas and Catherine Zeta Jones, pick up a copy of Town & Country on newsstands this week and basque in the glory that is Hollywood royalty.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Catherine-Zeta-Jones-and-Carys-Zeta-Jones-Town-and-Country.jpg?crop=83px%2C239px%2C1354px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Catherine-Zeta-Jones-and-Carys-Zeta-Jones-Town-and-Country.jpg?crop=83px%2C239px%2C1354px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Roxanne Adamiyatt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/catherine-zeta-jones-carys-zeta-douglas-on-town-country-cover/", "title": "Catherine Zeta-Jones, Carys Zeta Douglas on 'Town & Country' Cover", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Celebrity Style", "post-cats": "Stylish", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Get the details on the September 2018\u00a0'Town & Country' cover that Catherine Zeta-Jones and her daughter Carys Douglas star on!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Double Take: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Her Daughter Carys Are Twins", "description": "Get the details on the September 2018\u00a0'Town & Country' cover that Catherine Zeta-Jones and her daughter Carys Douglas star on!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/catherine-zeta-jones-carys-zeta-douglas-on-town-country-cover/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-08-01T20:16:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Catherine-Zeta-Jones-and-Carys-Zeta-Jones-Town-and-Country.jpg?crop=83px%2C239px%2C1354px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Catherine-Zeta-Jones-and-Carys-Zeta-Jones-Town-and-Country.jpg?crop=83px%2C239px%2C1354px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-08-01T20:20:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-01T20:16:16+00:00"}, "author": "Roxanne Adamiyatt", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Double Take: Catherine Zeta-Jones and Her Daughter Carys Are Twins", "description": "Get the details on the September 2018\u00a0'Town & Country' cover that Catherine Zeta-Jones and her daughter Carys Douglas star on!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/Catherine-Zeta-Jones-and-Carys-Zeta-Jones-Town-and-Country.jpg?crop=83px%2C239px%2C1354px%2C712px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533154806.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
