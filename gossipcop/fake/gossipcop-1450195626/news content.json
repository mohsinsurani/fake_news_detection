We ended it as best friends, and it was genuinely about encouraging and caring [for each other], and that was pretty remarkable for me.\u201d\n\nBillboard\n\nSources previously told PEOPLE the pair\u2019s relationship became difficult because of The Weeknd\u2019s touring schedule and Gomez\u2019s shooting commitments for her upcoming Woody Allen film.\n\nAs for reuniting with Bieber, 23 \u2014 whom she\u2019s had an on and off relationship with since 2010 \u2014 \u201cI\u2019m 25. I\u2019m not 18, or 19, or 20,\u201d she said. \u201cI cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn\u2019t right. But that doesn\u2019t mean caring for someone ever goes away.\u201d\n\nRuven Afanador\n\nThe star, who is being honored Thursday night as the outlet\u2019s \u201cWoman of the Year,\u201d also got candid about her self-esteem after undergoing a kidney transplant earlier this summer.\n\n\u201cIt was really hard in the beginning,\u201d she said about her surgery scar. \u201cI remember looking at myself in the mirror completely naked and thinking about all the things that I used to bitch about and just asking, \u2018Why?'\u201d\n\nRuven Afanador\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Selena Gomez Opens Up About Lupus Diagnosis And Her Commitment To Finding A Cure\n\nRuven Afanador\n\nThe entertainer also reveals there used to be \u201csomeone\u201d in her life \u201cwho pointed out all the things that I didn\u2019t feel great about with myself,\u201d but she\u2019s since gained a new confidence about her body.\n\n\u201cI just think for me, it could be my eyes, my round face, my ears, my legs, my scar. I don\u2019t have perfect abs, but I feel like I\u2019m wonderfully made,\u201d she said.", "images":
