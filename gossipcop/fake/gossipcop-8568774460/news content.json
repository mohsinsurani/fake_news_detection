{"url": "en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prince_Harry,_Duke_of_Sussex", "text": "Member of the British royal family (born 1984)\n\nPrince Harry, Duke of Sussex,[fn 2] (Henry Charles Albert David; born 15 September 1984)[2] is a member of the British royal family. He is the younger son of King Charles III and his first wife Diana, Princess of Wales. He is fifth in the line of succession to the British throne.\n\nHarry was educated at Wetherby School, Ludgrove School, and Eton College. He spent parts of his gap year in Australia and Lesotho, then underwent officer training at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst. He was commissioned as a cornet into the Blues and Royals, serving temporarily with his brother William and completed training as a troop leader. In 2007\u20132008, he served for over ten weeks in Helmand Province, Afghanistan. He returned to Afghanistan for a 20-week deployment in 2012\u20132013 with the Army Air Corps. In June 2015, he resigned from the army.\n\nHarry launched the Invictus Games in 2014 and remains the patron of its foundation. He also gives patronage to several other organisations, including the HALO Trust and Walking With The Wounded.[3] To encourage people to open up about their mental health issues, Harry, alongside his brother and sister-in-law Catherine, initiated the mental health awareness campaign \"Heads Together\" in April 2016.[4]\n\nIn 2018, Harry was made Duke of Sussex prior to his wedding to American actress Meghan Markle. They have two children, Archie and Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor. In January 2020, the couple stepped down as senior members of the royal family and moved to the Duchess's native Southern California. In October 2020, they launched Archewell Inc., an American public organisation that focuses on non-profit activities and creative media ventures. Together with his wife, Harry also sat down for a much publicised interview with Oprah Winfrey in March 2021, with whom he also produced the mental health documentary series The Me You Can't See.\n\nEarly life\n\nPrince Harry was born in the Lindo Wing of St Mary's Hospital in Paddington, London, on 15 September 1984 at 4:20 pm as the second child of the Prince of Wales (later King Charles III) and his first wife, Diana, Princess of Wales.[5][6][fn 3] He was christened Henry Charles Albert David on 21 December 1984 at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle, by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Robert Runcie.[fn 4] Growing up, he was referred to as \"Harry\" by family, friends, and the public. Harry and his elder brother, William, were raised at Kensington Palace in London, and Highgrove House in Gloucestershire.[10][11] Diana wanted him and his brother to have a broader range of experiences and a better understanding of ordinary life than previous royal children. She took them to venues that ranged from Walt Disney World and McDonald's to AIDS clinics and homeless shelters.[12] He began accompanying his parents on official visits at an early age; his first overseas tour was with his parents to Italy in 1985.[13] He also travelled with his family to Canada in 1991 and 1998.[14][15]\n\nHarry's parents divorced in 1996. His mother died in a car crash in Paris the following year. Harry and William were staying with their father at Balmoral at the time, and the Prince of Wales told his sons about their mother's death.[16] At his mother's funeral, Harry, then aged 12, accompanied his father, brother, paternal grandfather (Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh), and maternal uncle (Charles Spencer, 9th Earl Spencer), in walking behind the funeral cort\u00e8ge from Kensington Palace to Westminster Abbey.[17]\n\nEducation\n\nLike his father and brother, Harry was educated at independent schools. He started at London's Jane Mynors' nursery school and the pre-preparatory Wetherby School.[18] Following this, he attended Ludgrove School in Berkshire. After passing entrance exams, he was admitted to Eton College. The decision to place Harry at Eton went against the past practice of the Mountbatten-Windsors to send children to Gordonstoun, which Harry's grandfather, father, two uncles, and two cousins had attended. It did, however, see Harry follow in his older brother's footsteps and the Spencer family's, as both Diana's father and brother attended Eton.[12] As was the case with his brother, the royal family and the tabloid press agreed Harry would be allowed to study free from intrusion in exchange for occasional photograph opportunities in what became known as the \"pressure cooker agreement\".[19]\n\nIn June 2003, Harry completed his education at Eton with two A-Levels,[20] achieving a grade B in art and D in geography, having decided to drop history of art after AS level.[21] He has been described as \"a top tier athlete\", having played competitive polo and rugby union.[22] One of his former teachers, Sarah Forsyth, has asserted that he was a \"weak student\" and that staff at Eton conspired to help him cheat on examinations.[23][24] Both Eton and Harry denied the claims.[23][25] While a tribunal made no ruling on the cheating claim, it \"accepted the prince had received help in preparing his A-level 'expressive' project, which he needed to pass to secure his place at Sandhurst.\"[23][26] Harry also joined the Combined Cadet Force while studying at Eton and was made cadet officer in his final year, leading the corps' annual parade at the Eton tattoo.[27]\n\nAfter school, Harry took a gap year, during which he spent time in Australia working as a jackaroo on a cattle station, and participating in the Young England vs Young Australia Polo Test match.[28][29] He also travelled to Lesotho, where he worked with orphaned children and produced the documentary film The Forgotten Kingdom.[30]\n\nMilitary career\n\nSandhurst; Blues and Royals; deployment to Afghanistan\n\n(standing next to the horse) on parade at Officer Cadet Waleson parade at Sandhurst , 21 June 2005\n\nHarry entered the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst on 8 May 2005, where he was known as Officer Cadet Wales, and joined Alamein Company.[31] In April 2006, Harry completed his officer training and was commissioned as a Cornet (second lieutenant) in the Blues and Royals, a regiment of the Household Cavalry in the British Army. On 13 April 2008, when he reached two years' seniority, Harry was promoted to lieutenant.[32]\n\nIn 2006, it was announced that Harry's unit was scheduled to be deployed in Iraq the following year. A public debate ensued as to whether he should serve there. In April 2006, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry would be shielded from the front line if his unit was sent to war, with a spokeswoman stating that he was expected to \"undertake the fullest range of deployments\", but his role needed to be monitored as \"his overt presence might attract additional attention\" that would put him or those he commanded at risk.[33] Defence Secretary John Reid said that he should be allowed to serve on the front line of battle zones. Harry agreed saying, \"If they said 'no, you can't go front line' then I wouldn't drag my sorry ass through Sandhurst and I wouldn't be where I am now.\"[34] The Ministry of Defence and Clarence House made a joint announcement on 22 February 2007 that Harry would be deployed with his regiment to Iraq, as part of the 1st Mechanised Brigade of the 3rd Mechanised Division \u2013 a move supported by Harry, who had stated that he would leave the army if he was told to remain in safety while his regiment went to war.[35]\n\nThe head of the British army at the time, General Sir Richard Dannatt, said on 30 April 2007 that he had personally decided that Harry would serve with his unit in Iraq as a troop commander,[36][37] and Harry was scheduled for deployment in May or June 2007 to patrol the Maysan Governorate.[38] By 16 May, however, Dannatt announced that Harry would not serve in Iraq;[39] concerns included Harry being a high-value target (as several threats by various groups had already been made against him) and the dangers the soldiers around him would face should any attempt be made on his life or if he was captured. Clarence House made public Harry's disappointment with the decision, though he said he would abide by it.[40]\n\nIn early June 2007, it was reported that Harry had arrived in Canada to train alongside soldiers of the Canadian Forces and British Army, at CFB Suffield near Medicine Hat, Alberta. It was said that this was in preparation for a tour of duty in Afghanistan, where Canadian and British forces were participating in the NATO-led Afghan War.[41] This was confirmed in February of the following year when the British Ministry of Defence revealed that Harry had been secretly deployed as a Forward Air Controller to Helmand Province in Afghanistan for the previous ten weeks.[42][43] The revelation came after the media \u2013 notably, German newspaper Bild and Australian magazine New Idea[44][45] \u2013 breached the blackout placed over the information by the Canadian and British authorities.[46] He was immediately pulled out due to the fear that the media coverage would put his security and the security of fellow soldiers at risk.[47][48] It was later reported that Harry helped Gurkha troops repel an attack from Taliban insurgents,[49] and performed patrol duty in hostile areas while in Afghanistan.[50][51][52]\n\nHis tour made Harry the first member of the British royal family to serve in a war zone since his uncle, Prince Andrew, who flew helicopters during the Falklands War. For his service, his aunt, Princess Anne, presented Harry with an Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan at the Combermere Barracks in May 2008.[53]\n\nArmy Air Corps and second deployment to Afghanistan\n\nIn October 2008, it was announced that Harry would follow his brother, father and uncle in learning to fly military helicopters.[54][55] Harry attended the Defence Helicopter Flying School at RAF Shawbury, where he joined his brother.[56] Prince Charles presented him with his flying brevet (wings) on 7 May 2010 at a ceremony at the Army Air Corps Base (AAC), Middle Wallop.[57] Harry was awarded his Apache Flying Badge on 14 April 2011.[58] On 16 April 2011, it was announced that Harry had been promoted to captain.[59] In June 2011, Clarence House announced that Harry would be available for deployment in current operations in Afghanistan as an Apache helicopter pilot. The final decision rested with the Ministry of Defence's senior commanders, including principally the Chief of the Defence Staff in consultation with the wishes of Harry, the Prince of Wales, and the Queen.[60] In October, he was transferred to a US military base in California to complete his helicopter gunship training.[61] This final phase included live-fire training and \"environmental and judgment training\" at naval and air force facilities in California and Arizona.[62] In the same month, it was reported that Harry was top of his class in extensive training undertaken at the Naval Air Facility, El Centro, California.[63] While training in Southern California, he spent time in San Diego.[64] In November 2011, Harry returned to England. He went to Wattisham Airfield in Suffolk, in the east of England, to complete his training to fly Apache helicopters.[65]\n\nOn 7 September 2012, Harry arrived at Camp Bastion in southern Afghanistan as part of the 100-strong 662 Squadron, 3 Regiment, Army Air Corps,[66] to begin a four-month combat tour as a co-pilot and gunner for an Apache helicopter.[67] On 10 September, within days of arriving in Afghanistan, it was reported that the Taliban had threatened his life. Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid spoke to Reuters and was quoted as saying: \"We are using all our strength to get rid of him, either by killing or kidnapping.\" He added, \"We have informed our commanders in Helmand to do whatever they can to eliminate him.\"[68] On 18 September 2012, it was reported that Harry had been moved to a safe location after an attack by the Taliban on Camp Bastion that killed two US marines.[69] Defence Secretary Philip Hammond stated that \"additional security arrangements\" were put in place, for Harry could be a potential target, but added that he would face \"the same risk as any other Apache pilot\" while in combat.[70] On 21 January 2013, it was announced that Harry was returning from a 20-week deployment in Afghanistan.[71] He described his deployment as \"a joy for me because I'm one of those people who loves playing PlayStation and Xbox, so with my thumbs I like to think I'm probably quite useful\".[72] On 8 July 2013, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had successfully qualified as an Apache aircraft commander.[73] Harry compared operating the Apache's weapons systems in Afghanistan to playing video games.[74][75] He also discussed killing insurgents while piloting his Apache helicopter, and added \"we fire when we have to, take a life to save a life, but essentially we're more of a deterrent than anything else\".[76]\n\nHQ London District and Invictus Games\n\nOn 17 January 2014, the Ministry of Defence announced that Harry had completed his attachment to 3 Regiment Army Air Corps, and would take up a staff officer role, SO3 (Defence Engagement) in HQ London District. His responsibilities would include helping to coordinate significant projects and commemorative events involving the Army in London. He was based at Horse Guards in central London.[77]\n\nOn 6 March 2014, Harry launched Invictus Games, a Paralympic-style sporting event for injured servicemen and women, which was held on 10\u201314 September 2014.[78] Harry met British hopefuls for the Invictus Games at Tedworth House in Wiltshire for the start of the selection process on 29 April 2014.[79] On 15 May 2014, Harry attended a ticket sale launch for Invictus Games at BT Tower, from where he tweeted on the Invictus Games' official Twitter account as the president of the Games.[80] To promote the Games, he was interviewed by BBC Radio 2's Chris Evans along with two Invictus Games hopefuls. He said: \"[The Invictus Games] is basically my full-time job at the moment, making sure that we pull this off.\" The show aired on 31 July 2014.[81] Harry later wrote an article in The Sunday Times about his experiences in Afghanistan: how they had inspired him to help injured personnel and how, after the trip to the Warrior Games, he had vowed to create the Invictus Games.[82] Harry and officials attended the British Armed Forces Team announcement for Invictus Games at Potters Field Park in August 2014.[83][84] As president of the Invictus Games, he attended all events related to the Games from 8 to 14 September 2014.[85]\n\nIn January 2015, it was reported that Harry would take on a new role in supporting wounded service personnel by working alongside members of the London District's Personal Recovery Unit for the MOD's Defence Recovery Capability scheme to ensure that wounded personnel have adequate recovery plans. The palace confirmed weeks later[86] that the scheme was established in partnership with Help for Heroes and the Royal British Legion.[87] In late January 2015, Harry visited The Battle Back Centre[88] set up by the Royal British Legion, and Fisher House UK at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham. A partnership between Help for Heroes, the Fisher House Foundation and the Queen Elizabeth Hospital Birmingham (QEHB) Charity created the Centre.[89] Fisher House Foundation is one of the Invictus Games' sponsors.[90] In February and March 2015, Harry visited Phoenix House in Catterick Garrison, North Yorkshire, a recovery centre run by Help for Heroes. He also visited Merville Barracks in Colchester, where Chavasse VC House Personnel Recovery Centre is located, run by Help for Heroes in partnership with the Ministry of Defence and Royal British Legion.[91]\n\nSecondment to Australian Defence Force\n\nOn 17 March 2015, Kensington Palace announced that Harry would leave the Armed Forces in June.[92] Before then, he would spend four weeks throughout April and May at army barracks in Darwin, Perth and Sydney whilst seconded to the Australian Defence Force (ADF). After leaving the Army, while considering his future, he would return to work in a voluntary capacity with the Ministry of Defence, supporting Case Officers in the Ministry's Recovery Capability Programme. He would be working with both those who administer and receive physical and mental care within the London District area.[93][94]\n\nOn 6 April 2015, Harry reported for duty to Australia's Chief of the Defence Force, Air Chief Marshal Mark Binskin at the Royal Military College, Duntroon in Canberra, Australia.[95] Harry flew to Darwin later that day to begin his month-long secondment to the ADF's 1st Brigade. His visit included detachments to NORFORCE as well as to an aviation unit.[96] While in Perth, he trained with Special Air Service Regiment (SASR), participating in the SASR selection course, including a fitness test and a physical training session with SASR selection candidates. He also joined SASR members in Perth for live-fire shooting exercises with numerous Special Forces weapons at a variety of ranges. Harry completed an insertion training exercise using a rigid-hull inflatable boat. In Sydney, he undertook urban operations training with the 2nd Commando Regiment. Training activities included remotely detonating an Improvised Explosive Device (IED) and rappelling from a building. He also spent time flying over Sydney as co-pilot of an Army Black Hawk helicopter and participated in counter-terrorism training in Sydney Harbour with Royal Australian Navy clearance divers.[97]\n\nHarry's attachment with the ADF ended on 8 May 2015,[98] and on 19 June 2015 he resigned his short service commission.[99][100]\n\nPost-military service\n\nIn New Zealand, 2018\n\nHarry has described his 10 years in the army as \"the happiest times in my life\".[101] Since leaving the army, he has been closely involved with the armed forces through the Invictus Games, honorary military appointments and other official engagements. On 19 December 2017, he succeeded his grandfather Prince Philip as the Captain General of the Royal Marines.[102] In May 2018, he was promoted to the substantive ranks of Lieutenant Commander of the Royal Navy, Major of the British Army and Squadron Leader of the Royal Air Force.[103]\n\nOn 18 January 2020, Buckingham Palace announced that an agreement had been reached for Harry \"to step back from Royal duties, including official military appointments\".[104] In February 2021, the Palace confirmed that the Duke would give up his position as Captain General of the Royal Marines and hand back all the other honorary military appointments.[105]\n\nPersonal life\n\nBachelorhood\n\nChelsy Davy, the daughter of Zimbabwean, South Africa-based businessman Charles Davy, was referred to as Harry's girlfriend in an interview conducted for his 21st birthday, and Harry said he \"would love to tell everyone how amazing she is but once I start talking about that, I have left myself open.... There is truth and there is lies and unfortunately I cannot get the truth across.\"[106] Davy was present when Harry received his Operational Service Medal for Afghanistan[53] and also attended his graduation ceremony when he received his flying wings from his father.[57] In early 2009, it was reported the pair had parted ways after a relationship that had lasted for five years.[107]\n\nIn May 2012, Harry's cousin Princess Eugenie introduced him to Cressida Bonas, an actress and model who is the granddaughter of Edward Curzon, 6th Earl Howe.[108] On 30 April 2014, it was reported that the couple had parted amicably.[109]\n\nMarriage and fatherhood\n\nPrince Harry and Markle on Christmas Day, 2017\n\nIn July 2016, Prince Harry began a relationship with American actress Meghan Markle.[110][111][112] In November, the prince directed his communications secretary to release a statement on his behalf to express personal concern about pejorative and false comments made about his girlfriend by mainstream media and internet trolls.[113][114] In September 2017, Prince Harry and Markle first appeared together in public at the Invictus Games in Toronto.[115][116] Their engagement was announced on 27 November 2017 by Harry's father Prince Charles.[117][118][110][119] The announcement prompted generally positive comments about having a mixed-race person as a member of the royal family,[120] especially in regard to Commonwealth countries with populations of blended or native ancestry.[121] On 19 May 2018, the marriage ceremony was held at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle.[122][123] The couple later revealed in the 2021 television interview Oprah with Meghan and Harry that, three days prior to the ceremony, they had privately exchanged vows in their garden, in the presence of the Archbishop of Canterbury.[124] However, this earlier exchange of vows was not an official religious or legally recognised marriage.[125][126]\n\nIt was reportedly agreed in advance that excess funds generated from the BBC broadcast of the wedding ceremony would go to a charity chosen by the newlywed couple.[127] In April 2020, Feeding Britain (which provides food packages to families in food poverty) was nominated to receive \u00a390,000 from the BBC.[128]\n\nThe Duke and Duchess initially lived at Nottingham Cottage in London, on the grounds of Kensington Palace.[129] They then moved to Frogmore Cottage in the Home Park of Windsor Castle.[130][131] The Crown Estate refurbished the cottage at a cost of \u00a32.4 million, paid out of the Sovereign Grant, with the Duke later reimbursing expenses beyond restoration and ordinary maintenance.[132][133][134] On 6 May 2019, the Duke and Duchess's son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor was born.[135] Their office was moved to Buckingham Palace and officially closed on 31 March 2020 when the Sussexes ceased \"undertaking official engagements in support of the Queen\".[136][137] After some months in Canada and the United States, the couple bought a house in June 2020 on the former estate of Riven Rock in Montecito, California,[138] where they own a chicken coop with hens rescued from a factory farm.[139] The next month, the Duchess suffered a miscarriage.[140] On 4 June 2021, their daughter Lilibet Mountbatten-Windsor was born.[141] The Duke and Duchess own a Labrador named Pula, and two Beagles named Guy and Mamma Mia, respectively.[142][143]\n\nHarry is godfather to \"five or six\" children, including the daughters of Major Nicholas van Cutsem (the son of Hugh van Cutsem) and Jake Warren, his mother's godson, whose father is the Queen's horse racing manager.[144][145] He became godfather to Charlie van Straubenzee's firstborn daughter in May 2020.[146]\n\nWealth and inheritance\n\nAt the time of the announcement of Harry and Meghan's decision to \"step back\" as senior members of the royal family in 2020, 95% of the couple's income derived from the \u00a32.3 million given to them annually by Harry's father, Charles, as part of his income from the Duchy of Cornwall.[147]\n\nHarry and his brother William inherited the \"bulk\" of the \u00a312.9 million left by their mother on their respective 30th birthdays, a figure that had grown since her 1997 death to \u00a310 million each in 2014.[148][149] In 2002, The Times reported that Harry would also share with his brother a payment of \u00a34.9 million from trust funds established by their great-grandmother, Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother, on their respective 21st birthdays and would share a payment of \u00a38 million upon their respective 40th birthdays.[150] It was reported that Harry would inherit the bulk of the money left by the Queen Mother for the two brothers, as William is set to ascend to the throne which will bring him more financial benefits.[151] Harry's personal wealth was estimated at \u00a330 million by The Daily Telegraph in 2020.[147]\n\nIn 2014, Harry and William inherited their mother's wedding dress along with many other of her personal possessions, including dresses, diamond tiaras, jewels, letters, and paintings. The brothers also received the original lyrics and score of \"Candle in the Wind\" by Bernie Taupin and Elton John as performed by John at Diana's funeral.[149]\n\nHealth\n\nIn November 2000, he broke his thumb while playing football at Eton and underwent a minor operation.[152] In 2002, it was reported that with Charles's encouragement Harry had paid a visit to a drugs rehabilitation unit to talk to drug addicts after it emerged that he had been smoking cannabis and drinking at his father's Highgrove House and at a local pub in the summer of 2001.[153][154][155] In 2017, Harry acknowledged that with the support of his brother he sought counselling years after his mother's death, stating: \"It's all about timing. And for me personally, my brother, you know, bless him, he was a huge support to me. He kept saying this is not right, this is not normal, you need to talk to [someone] about stuff, it's OK\".[156][157] Harry added that he struggled with aggression, suffered from anxiety during royal engagements, and was \"very close to a complete breakdown on numerous occasions\".[156] He later added that he had taken on boxing as a way of coping with mental stress and \"letting out aggression\".[158] In his mental health television documentary The Me You Can't See, which premiered in 2021, he added that he underwent four years of therapy to address his mental health issues following encouragement from his future wife while they were dating.[159]\n\nHe also mentioned that he suffered from \"panic attacks [and] severe anxiety\" in his late 20s and the heavy load of official visits and functions eventually \"led to burnout\".[159] He further stated that he was willing to drink and take drugs, adding that he \"wasn't drinking Monday to Friday, but [he] would probably drink a week's worth in one day on a Friday or a Saturday night\" to help him cope with his issues.[159] In 2021, American journalist Katie Couric recounted a meeting with Harry in her memoir and alleged that during her 2012 interview with him in Belize to mark the Queen's Diamond Jubilee he smelled of cigarettes and alcohol, which seemed \"to ooze from every pore\" of his body.[160] In an episode of Armchair Expert, he attributed his mental health issues to the ineffective parenting style of previous generations and to the \"genetic pain and suffering\" passed down in his family, adding that his issues stemmed from \"the pain or suffering that perhaps my father or my parents had suffered\".[161][162] In a February 2022 live stream for BetterUp, Harry stated that he meditated on a regular basis to maintain his mental health.[163]\n\nPolitical views\n\nMembers of the British royal family are politically neutral by convention.[164] However, in September 2020, Harry and his wife released a video addressing American voters to \"reject hate speech, misinformation and online negativity\" in the 2020 United States presidential election, which was seen by some as an implicit endorsement of Joe Biden.[165] Harry was the subject of a prank by the Russian comedy duo Vovan and Lexus, who posed as climate activist Greta Thunberg and her father during two phone calls on New Year's Eve and 22 January 2020.[166] During the conversations, Harry described his decision to leave the monarchy as \"not easy\" and criticised Donald Trump's stance on climate change and his support of the coal industry.[166]\n\nHarry identifies as a feminist.[167] As part of an interview with Gloria Steinem in August 2020, he was quoted as saying \"You know that I'm a feminist too, right, Gloria? It's really important to me that you know that.\"[168]\n\nIn May 2021, Harry was a guest on Dax Shepard and Monica Padman's podcast Armchair Expert during which he talked about the freedom of speech and laws related to it in the United States, stating \"I've got so much I want to say about the First Amendment as I sort of understand it, but it is bonkers.\"[169] He added that it was \"a huge subject and one which [he didn't] understand\", emphasising that one could \"capitalise or exploit what's not said rather than uphold what is said.\"[169] The comments were met by backlash from conservative Americans and Britons, prompting figures such as Ted Cruz, Dan Crenshaw, Nigel Farage, Candace Owens, Jack Posobiec, and Laura Ingraham to criticise him publicly.[169][170]\n\nIn November 2021, in a panel at Wired's Re:Wired Conference, Harry claimed that a day before the January 6 United States Capitol attack he emailed Jack Dorsey, CEO of Twitter, and 'warned' of potential civil unrest, but had not received a response.[171][172] He added that he and Meghan were no longer on social media, and would avoid it \"until things change\".[173] In the same month, Conservative politician and MP Johnny Mercer, who was leading the efforts to waive visa fees for foreign-born UK veterans and their families, announced in the Commons that the Duke of Sussex was supportive of their proposal and viewed it as \"morally right\" and not as \"a political intervention\".[174]\n\nIn June 2022, in an interview with Jessica Yellin for Vogue, Meghan described Harry's reaction to the Supreme Court of the United States's decision that abortion is not a protected constitutional right as \"guttural\".[175] Harry later condemned the decision as \"rolling back of constitutional rights\" in his address to the United Nations on Mandela Day in July 2022.[176] Associate justice of the Supreme Court Samuel Alito, who wrote the majority decision for the case, criticised foreign figures including Harry for their comments on \"American law\" during a speech.[177]\n\nPublic life\n\nAt the age of 21, Harry became a Counsellor of State and began his duties in that capacity. On 6 January 2009, the Queen granted Harry and William their own royal household. Previously, William and Harry's affairs had been handled by their father's office at Clarence House in central London. The new household released a statement announcing they had established their own office at nearby St James's Palace to look after their public, military and charitable activities.[178] In March 2012, Harry led an official visit to Belize as part of the Queen's Diamond Jubilee celebrations.[179] He continued to the Bahamas and Jamaica, where the Prime Minister, Portia Simpson-Miller, was considering initiating a process of turning Jamaica into a republic.[180] He then visited Brazil to attend the GREAT Campaign.[181] Harry also played tambourine and took part in the music video for the song \"Sing\", which was released in May 2012 to commemorate the Diamond Jubilee.[182]\n\nBetween 9 and 15 May 2013, he made an official visit to the United States. The tour promoted the rehabilitation of injured American and UK troops, publicised his own charities and supported British interests. It included engagements in Washington, DC, Colorado, New York, New Jersey, and Connecticut. He met survivors of Hurricane Sandy in New Jersey.[183][184] In October 2013, he undertook his first official tour of Australia, attending the International Fleet Review at Sydney Harbour.[185] He also paid a visit to the Australian SAS HQ in Perth.[186] In May 2014, he visited Estonia and Italy.

In his statement, he lent his support to the charity by arguing that its role in bringing sport into the life of disadvantaged people would save \"hundreds of millions of pounds\" towards treating the issues among young people.[327]\n\nSussex Royal and Archewell\n\nIn June 2019, it was announced that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex would split from The Royal Foundation and establish their own charity foundation by the end of 2019. Nevertheless, the couple would collaborate with Harry's brother and his wife on mutual projects, such as the mental health initiative Heads Together.[328][329] In July 2019, Harry and Meghan's new charity was registered in England and Wales under the title \"Sussex Royal The Foundation of The Duke and Duchess of Sussex\".[330] On 21 February, it was confirmed that \"Sussex Royal\" would not be used as a brand name for the couple following their withdrawal from public life.[331] On 5 August 2020, Sussex Royal Foundation was renamed \"MWX Foundation\" and dissolved the same day.[332]\n\nIn March 2021, it was reported that the Charity Commission for England and Wales was conducting a review of the Sussex Royal organisation in a \"regulatory and compliance case\" regarding its conduct under charity law during dissolution.[333] Representatives for the couple claimed that Sussex Royal was \"managed by a board of trustees\" and that \"suggestion of mismanagement\" directed exclusively at the Duke and Duchess would be incorrect.[333] The commission later concluded that the foundation did not act unlawfully, but criticised the board of directors for expending a \"substantial proportion of funds\" to setting up and closing the charity.[334][335]\n\nIn April 2020, Meghan and Harry confirmed their new foundation (in lieu of Sussex Royal) would be called \"Archewell\".[336] The name stems from the Greek word \"arche\", which means \"source of action\"; the same word that inspired the name of their son.[336] Archewell was registered in the United States.[337] Its website was officially launched in October 2020.[338]\n\nPublic image\n\nIn his youth, Harry earned a reputation for being rebellious, leading the tabloid press to label him a \"wild child\".[339] At the age of 17, he was seen smoking cannabis, drinking underage with friends, and clashing physically with paparazzi outside nightclubs.[339][340] In early 2005, he was photographed at a \"Colonial and Native\"-themed costume party in Wiltshire wearing a Nazi German Afrika Korps uniform with a swastika armband.[341] He later issued a public statement apologising for his behaviour.[342] In an interview for his 21st birthday he stated that it \"was a very stupid thing to do and I've learnt my lesson\".[343]\n\nIn January 2005, in response to an inquiry about his Zimbabwean girlfriend Chelsy Davy, Harry responded \"She's not black or anything, you know\".[344] In January 2009, the British tabloid, the News of the World, revealed a video made by Harry three years earlier in which he referred to a Pakistani fellow officer cadet as \"our little Paki friend\" and called a soldier wearing a camouflage hood a \"raghead\". These terms were described by the Leader of the Opposition at the time David Cameron as \"unacceptable\", and by The Daily Telegraph as \"racist\". A British Muslim youth organisation called Harry a \"thug\".[346] Further extracts showed him telling a comrade \"I love you\" before giving him a kiss on the cheek and licking his face, and asking another whether he felt gay, queer, or on the side.[347][348] He was also filmed pretending to have a call with his grandmother, stating \"I've got to go, got to go. Send my love to the corgis and Grandpa ... God save you.\"[347] Clarence House immediately issued an apology from Harry, who stated that no malice was intended in his remarks.[349] In the same year, British stand-up comedian Stephen K. Amos alleged that after a stand-up show for the Prince of Wales's 60th birthday celebrations in November 2008 Harry had commented on his performance by saying, \"You don't sound like a black chap\", though he hoped that the remarks were made in jest.[350]\n\nIn October 2007, a video from Harry's trip to Namibia with his friends surfaced, which showed him snorting vodka and licking a male friend's nipples.[351][352] While on holiday in Las Vegas in August 2012, Harry and an unknown young woman were photographed naked in a Wynn Las Vegas hotel room, reportedly during a game of strip billiards. The pictures were leaked by American celebrity website TMZ on 21 August 2012,[353] and reported worldwide by mainstream media on 22 August 2012.[354][355][356] The photographs were shown by the American media, but British media were reluctant to publish them.[357] Royal aides suggested Clarence House would contact the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) if British publications used the pictures.[358] St James's Palace confirmed that Harry was in the photographs, saying that he was essentially a victim whose privacy had been invaded and contacted the PCC upon hearing that a number of British newspapers were considering publishing the photographs.[359] On 24 August 2012, The Sun newspaper published the photographs.[360]\n\nIn September 2010, Harry was the subject of an animal cruelty investigation by the Hurlingham Polo Association after his polo pony was pictured with a wound on its side that some animal welfare activists alleged was caused by spikes on his spurs.[361] He was cleared of any wrongdoing or cruelty after an independent vet concluded that it was more likely the wound had been caused by a collision rather than spurs.[362]\n\nIn view of their environmental activism, Harry and his wife were criticised in August 2019 for reportedly taking four private jet journeys in 11 days, including one to Elton John's home in Nice, France.[363] The criticism was in line with the reactions the royal family faced in June 2019, after it was revealed that they \"had doubled [their] carbon footprint from business travel\".[364][365] Harry received backlash again in August 2021 and 2022 for taking a two-hour flight on private jets between California and Aspen, Colorado, to participate in an annual charity polo tournament.[366][367] In June 2022 and on their way to California after the Queen's Platinum Jubilee, Harry and Meghan boarded a private jet that was estimated to have emitted \"ten times more carbon than flying commercial\".[368]\n\nIn July 2019, Harry and his wife attended the premiere of The Lion King in London.[369] Their attendance garnered commentary and criticism as it took place on the date of a memorial concert for the Royal Marines killed by the IRA, to which Harry was invited as Captain General of the Royal Marines, but had declined to attend.[370]\n\nIn December 2021, reports emerged about Harry's meetings with Saudi businessman Mahfouz Marei Mubarak bin Mahfouz, whose receipt of a CBE became the subject of an investigation by the Scottish Charity Regulator.[371] Mahfouz had met Prince Harry in 2013 and 2014 and donated \u00a350,000 to his charity Sentebale and \u00a310,000 to Walking With The Wounded, of which Harry is patron. The Sunday Times claimed that the meetings with Harry opened the way for Mahfouz to get access to the Prince of Wales.[372] Harry referred to the incident as the \"CBE scandal\" in December 2021 and stated that he severed ties with Mahfouz in 2015 after expressing \"growing concerns\" about his motives, though aides from his father's household denied having any discussions with him regarding Mahfouz.[373] A spokesperson for Sentebale defended the meetings and added that there was not any impropriety regarding the donations.[374]\n\nIn 2018 and 2021, Harry was selected as one of the 100 Most Influential People in the World by Time magazine.[375] In 2019, the magazine named Harry and his wife among the 25 Most Influential People on the Internet.[376] In 2021, they were featured on one of the magazine's seven worldwide Time 100 covers.[377]\n\nPrivacy and the media\n\nLegal issues and incidents\n\nAssociated Newspapers Limited\n\nOn 30 January 2020, the Independent Press Standards Organisation (IPSO) sided with the Mail on Sunday over a dispute between the Duke and the newspaper regarding an Instagram photo involving Harry in which, according to the newspaper, elephants were in fact \"tranquilised\" and \"tethered\" during a relocating process. The IPSO rejected Harry's claim that the paper's description was \"inaccurate\" or \"misleading\".[378]\n\nIn December 2020, Harry's legal team sued Associated Newspapers Limited (ANL) for publishing a story in the Mail on Sunday claiming his working relationship with the Royal Marines had suffered post-royal departure.[379] The newspaper subsequently accepted the claims were false and issued an apology. The prince's lawyer said the \"substantial damages\" paid by the publisher would be donated to the Invictus Games Foundation.[380]\n\nIn November 2021, Harry and Meghan's former communications secretary Jason Knauf gave a statement to the court following ANL's appeal against a judge's ruling that accused the media company of breaching Meghan's privacy for publishing a letter she had sent to her father.[381] Knauf mentioned the Duchess of Sussex directly gave him briefing points to share with Finding Freedom's authors Omid Scobie and Carolyn Durand and added that the Duke of Sussex had welcomed the suggestion that they should conceal their involvement with the process of writing the book, while they both discussed the book \"on a routine basis\".[382] ANL had previously applied to use the book in their defense, arguing that the Duke and Duchess had \"co-operated with the authors of the recently published book Finding Freedom to put out their version of certain events\".[383][384]\n\nIn February 2022, Harry filed a libel suit in the High Court against Associated Newspapers Limited for a Mail on Sunday article which alleged he was trying to keep his legal battle against the Home Office to restore his police protection secret from the public through requesting a confidentiality order on the case.[385][386] His lawyers claimed that the article questioned \"his willingness to pay for police protection\" and asked for the story to be taken down, demanding damages due to a \"frenzy of hostile comments\" that had caused \"considerable distress and hurt\".[387] In June 2022, Mr Justice Nicklin ruled that parts of the article were potentially defamatory as it implied Harry had been \"spinning the facts\" and had only offered to pay for the security arrangements after the legal battle against the Home Office began, though Nicklin rejected claims by Harry's lawyers that the article portrayed him as a liar.[388] Further hearings are scheduled to determine whether the libel case proceeds or fails.[388]\n\nIn October 2022, the Duke of Sussex joined Doreen Lawrence, Sir Elton John, David Furnish, Sadie Frost, and Elizabeth Hurley in launching a legal action against Associated Newspapers Limited for their alleged \"abhorrent criminal activity\", which was said to involve listening to and recording people's phone calls and daily activities, obtaining sensitive information and medical records, and accessing bank accounts and financial transactions.[389]\n\nOther cases\n\nIn February 2014, a judge sentenced the convicted criminal Ashraf Islam to three years in prison, as he had plotted to murder Harry and had given it \"considerable thought\" due to his belief that Harry had \"a moral guilt\" since he was in the army.[390][391] In June 2019, two members of the neo-Nazi group Sonnenkrieg Division were jailed for eighteen months and four years, respectively, for sharing propaganda posters among which was one that labelled Harry as a \"race traitor\" with a gun pointed at his head.[392]\n\nIn May 2019, Splash News issued a formal apology to the Sussexes for sending photographers to their Cotswolds residence, which put their privacy at risk. The agency also agreed to pay damages and legal costs associated with the case.[393][394] In October 2019, it was announced that Harry had sued The Sun, the Daily Mirror and the now-defunct News of the World \"in relation to alleged phone-hacking\".[395] Former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman had previously stated that he had hacked Harry's phone on nine occasions.[396] Among other points discussed in the lawsuit was a report by the News of the World about Harry's visit to a drugs rehabilitation clinic after smoking cannabis in January 2002, which according to his legal team was \"to blag\" his father into believing that Harry was a drunkard and drug addict in order \"to get an exclusive but 'softer' story\" on his alleged issues with drugs and alcohol, a claim that was denied by the outlet's publisher News Group Newspapers.[397]\n\nIn January 2020, lawyers issued a legal warning to the press after paparazzi photographs were published in the media.[398] After his resignation from the royal family was announced, Harry appeared \"to lay the blame at the feet of the press\" for his decision.[399] In March 2020, the couple took Splash UK to court after the Duchess and their son were photographed without permission during a \"private family outing\" while staying in Canada. The case was settled later that year with Splash UK agreeing to no longer take unauthorised photos of the family.[400] On 20 April 2020, the Duke and Duchess announced that they would no longer cooperate with the Daily Mail, the Sun, the Mirror and the Express.[401] They won an apology in October from American news agency X17 for taking photographs of their son at their home using drones.[402]\n\nA September 2020 article by The Times claiming an Invictus Games fundraiser had been cancelled due to its affiliation with a competitor of Netflix, Harry's business partner, became the subject of a legal complaint issued by the Duke.[403] In January 2022, the couple mutually filed a legal complaint against The Times for an article reporting on Archewell raising less than $50,000 in 2020.[404]\n\nDespite the palace congratulating the Duke and Duchess on the birth of their daughter Lilibet in June 2021, a few days later the BBC reported that Harry and Meghan had not sought the permission of the Queen before naming their daughter with her personal family nickname.[405][406] Lawyers for the couple subsequently accused the BBC of defamation and sent letters out to various media organisations saying the report was false and defamatory, and the allegations should not be repeated as Harry had spoken to the Queen before announcing their daughter's name.[407][408]\n\nIn January 2022, it was revealed that Harry, whose taxpayer-funded police security was taken away after he stepped back from royal roles in 2020, had been in a legal fight since September 2021 to challenge the Home Office's refusal to allow him to pay for police protection in a personal capacity when in the UK as he believed his private security team's lack of access to local intelligence and legal jurisdiction abroad would make them unable to protect his family.[409][410] Following the first court hearing of the case, it was revealed that after Harry's decision to step back from his royal duties the Royal and VIP Executive Committee (RAVEC) had placed him in an \"exceptional category\", as a result of which his future police protection in the UK would be contingent on the reason and circumstances of each visit as well as the functions he carries.[411][412] After receiving applications by the Duke and the Home Office to keep parts of the case private, the High Court ruled in March 2022 that some parts of it would remain confidential.[413] Mr Justice Swift also reacted to the Duke's legal team sending a copy of the ruling to someone who was not a lawyer, describing it as \"entirely unacceptable\".[413] In July 2022, Mr Justice Swift granted permission for part of Harry's claim to proceed for a judicial review.[414]\n\nIn August 2022, Harry filed a lawsuit against the Home Office and the Metropolitan Police, challenging the decision by RAVEC from January 2022 which stated that State security could not be made available to private individuals even if they wished to pay for it themselves.[415][416]\n\nHarry and his wife were interviewed by Oprah Winfrey in a television special for CBS, broadcast on 7 March 2021.[417] Meghan spoke about \"stepping into life as a royal, marriage, motherhood\" and \"how she is handling life under intense public pressure\". Harry joined her later, and the pair talked about the initial difficulties associated with their move to the United States in 2020 and their plans for the future.[418] During the interview, Harry criticised his father's parenting style while he was trying to deal with the death of his mother.[419][420] He mentioned his father did not answer his calls and had cut him off financially, and he had no relationship with his brother, Prince William, stating \"The relationship is space, at the moment. Time heals all things, hopefully.\"[421] There was a wide and polarised reaction to the interview.[422]\n\nIn October 2021, Twitter analytics service Bot Sentinel released their analysis of more than 114,000 tweets about the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, as a result of which they found 83 accounts with a combined number of 187,631 followers responsible for approximately 70% of the negative content posted about the couple.[423] The report prompted an investigation by Twitter.[423] Twitter stated that it found no evidence of \"widespread coordination\" between the accounts, and said that it had taken action against users who violated Twitter's conduct policy.[423][424] Bot Sentinel also released three more reports in the following months, arguing that the accounts were part of a \"bot network\" and a similar network could be found on YouTube.[425][426] In January 2022, the BBC named Harry and Meghan among people whose photos and videos were used in fake instant profits advertisements and bitcoin-related investment schemes.[427]\n\nTitles, styles, honours and arms\n\nRoyal monogram\n\nTitles and styles\n\nSeptember 1984 \u2013 19 May 2018: His Royal Highness Prince Henry of Wales\n\nPrince Henry of Wales 19 May 2018 \u2013 present: His Royal Highness The Duke of Sussex [fn 5] In Scotland : 19 May 2018 \u2013 present: His Royal Highness The Earl of Dumbarton [fn 6]\n\nThe Duke of Sussex\n\nOn the morning of his wedding,[429] Elizabeth II granted him the Dukedom of Sussex, as well as two subsidiary titles, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel. Harry uses the earldom in Scotland[430] and the barony in Northern Ireland.[431][432] On 18 January 2020, Buckingham Palace announced that, following their decision to step back from royal duties, from 31 March 2020 Harry and his wife would not use their Royal Highness styles, but as a British prince, he will not be stripped of his style and titles.[433][428]\n\nBefore his marriage, Harry used Wales as his surname for military purposes and was known as Captain Harry Wales in such contexts.[434] On 4 June 2015, as part of the 2015 Special Honours, Harry was knighted by his grandmother, the Queen, for \"services to the sovereign\", being appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order (KCVO).[435]\n\nMilitary ranks\n\nHonours\n\nForeign\n\nAppointments\n\nFellowships\n\nFormer honorary military appointments\n\nIn February 2021, it was announced via written confirmation that Harry's honorary military appointments mentioned above were returned to the Queen.[445]\n\nHumanitarian awards\n\nHarry's charitable efforts have been recognised three times by the international community. In December 2010, the German charity Ein Herz f\u00fcr Kinder (\"A Heart for Children\") awarded him the Golden Heart Award, in recognition of his \"charitable and humanitarian efforts\".[451][452] On 7 May 2012, the Atlantic Council awarded him its Distinguished Humanitarian Leadership Award.[453] In August 2018, the Royal Canadian Legion granted him the 2018 Founders Award for his role in founding the Invictus Games.[454] In October 2018, he was presented with the RSA Badge in Gold, the organisation's highest honour, for his work with injured veterans.[455] In July 2021, Harry and Meghan were among people who were selected by UK-based charity Population Matters to receive the Change Champions award for their decision to have only two children and help with maintaining a smaller and more sustainable population.[456] In February 2022, Harry and Meghan were selected to receive NAACP's President's Award for their work on causes related to social justice and equity.[457]\n\nArms\n\nAncestry\n\nAgnatically, Harry is a member of the House of Gl\u00fccksburg, a cadet branch of the House of Oldenburg, one of Europe's oldest royal houses. Harry's paternal grandmother, Queen Elizabeth II, issued letters patent on 8 February 1960 declaring his father to be a member of the House of Windsor.[460]\n\nAncestors on Harry's father's side include most of the royal families of Europe,[460] and on his mother's side, the earls Spencer\u2014a cadet branch of the Spencer family descended from the earls of Sunderland; the senior branch are now also dukes of Marlborough; the Barons Fermoy; and more anciently from Henry FitzRoy, 1st Duke of Grafton, and Charles Lennox, 1st Duke of Richmond\u2014two illegitimate sons of King Charles II.[461]\n\nHarry and his brother William descend matrilineally from Eliza Kewark, a housekeeper for his eighteenth-century ancestor Theodore Forbes\u2014a Scottish merchant who worked for the East India Company in Surat. She is variously described in contemporary documents as \"a dark-skinned native woman\", \"an Armenian woman from Bombay\", and \"Mrs. Forbesian\".[461] Genealogist William Addams Reitwiesner assumed Kewark was Armenian.[462] In June 2013, BritainsDNA announced that genealogical DNA tests on two of Harry and William's distant matrilineal cousins confirm Kewark was matrilineally of Indian descent.[463][464][465][466]\n\nFilmography\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nPrince Harry, The Duke of Sussex, \"Foreword\", in: Connaughton, Chris (2021).
