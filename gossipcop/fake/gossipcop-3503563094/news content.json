In a preview clip for the hit NBC series\u2019 season 12, debuting Monday, February 27, the four judges reveal their biggest musical influences growing up and give a hint of what\u2019s to come during the upcoming competition. Spoiler alert: It involves puppets.\n\n\u201cWhat got me into music is, I think, what got us all into music \u2014 music playing all around you when you were a kid,\u201d Alicia Keys says. \u201cMy mother had a pretty impressive record collection, and I remember Sundays being a time when a lot of music was played.\u201d Keys is basically right, since Adam Levine credits his parents buying a single for him that he played \u201cevery single day.\u201d And Shelton says his brother influenced his own taste by default; because his brother played his music so loud, Shelton had no choice but to listen to it as well.\n\nOnly Stefani cites something other than family as inspiring her early on. \u201cMy biggest musical inspiration was The Sound of Music,\u201d she reveals. \u201cIt inspired me in music and in fashion and for the rest of my life.\u201d The bubbly blonde also added that the show doesn\u2019t have \u201cany kind of boundaries, so anything can go.\u201d Considering her romance with Shelton, that seems like an accurate statement \u2026 but he doesn\u2019t want to talk about it.\n\nWhile trying to persuade a contestant to team up with her in a preview clip from an upcoming episode, Stefani notes, \u201cI just did a country song with Blake Shelton, so I\u2019ve got the hookup!\u201d\n\nShelton quickly chimes in to chide her for talking about their extracurricular relationship. \u201cThat is so inappropriate to be talking about our hookup!\u201d the country music star jokes. At least it seems like he was joking. Also, for some unknown reason, at one point, Stefani has a puppet version of Levine that she uses to mock him; no word yet on whether she has a puppet version of her boyfriend.\n\nTell Us: Which coach do you think will win season 12 of The Voice?\n\nThe Voice returns to NBC Monday, February 27, at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/nup_177162_0027_adam-levine-alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-the-voice-zoom-c4d5405f-2433-4b6e-9458-e65a8f993ea1.jpg?crop=1px%2C129px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/nup_177162_0027_adam-levine-alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-the-voice-zoom-c4d5405f-2433-4b6e-9458-e65a8f993ea1.jpg?crop=1px%2C129px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Elizabeth Durand Streisand"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-talk-hookup-on-the-voice-w468013/", "title": "Blake Shelton, Gwen Stefani Talk 'Hookup' on 'The Voice'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani discuss their 'hookup' in a promo for 'The Voice' season 12, debuting Monday, February 27 \u2014 watch the clip, which also includes fellow judges Adam Levine and Alicia Keys", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake to Gwen: Don't Tell 'Voice' Contestants 'About Our Hookup'!", "description": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani discuss their 'hookup' in a promo for 'The Voice' season 12, debuting Monday, February 27 \u2014 watch the clip, which also includes fellow judges Adam Levine and Alicia Keys", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-talk-hookup-on-the-voice-w468013/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:11:37+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/nup_177162_0027_adam-levine-alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-the-voice-zoom-c4d5405f-2433-4b6e-9458-e65a8f993ea1.jpg?crop=1px%2C129px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/nup_177162_0027_adam-levine-alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-the-voice-zoom-c4d5405f-2433-4b6e-9458-e65a8f993ea1.jpg?crop=1px%2C129px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-02-21T19:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:11:37+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blake to Gwen: Don't Tell 'Voice' Contestants 'About Our Hookup'!", "description": "Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani discuss their 'hookup' in a promo for 'The Voice' season 12, debuting Monday, February 27 \u2014 watch the clip, which also includes fellow judges Adam Levine and Alicia Keys", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/nup_177162_0027_adam-levine-alicia-keys-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-the-voice-zoom-c4d5405f-2433-4b6e-9458-e65a8f993ea1.jpg?crop=1px%2C129px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1487703600.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
