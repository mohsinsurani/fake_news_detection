After a torrent of updates on their on-again, off-again relationship, it appears that the couple may have broken up for good.\n\nDespite the fact that they\u2019ve reportedly been taking time to work on themselves, in the wake of Gomez\u2019s breakup from the Weeknd, self-improvement apparently isn\u2019t enough to mend their relationship. At least according to the latest gossip. \u201cSelena realized even though he\u2019s made some positive improvements, they just aren\u2019t a perfect match right now,\u201d a source told E! News, adding that they aren\u2019t talking at the moment.\n\nThat explains why Bieber has been spotted spending his time with another savvy Instagram user, a former Miss Alabama Teen USA turned model and influencer named Baskin Champion. The pair were seen together over the weekend when Champion showed up to Bieber\u2019s home to hang and, a few days earlier, at the Los Angeles premiere of Midnight Sun. (Champion\u2019s sister is currently dating the film\u2019s star, Patrick Schwarzenegger.) According to a source at E! News, however, Selena doesn\u2019t have anything to worry about.\n\n\u201cJustin was introduced to Baskin through his friend group and they have only hung out a few times,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe has definitely been liking her company, but to say they are dating is a huge stretch. Justin isn\u2019t trying to be serious with anyone but Selena.\u201d\n\nWhether or not Gomez wants to be with Bieber is a different story, however. While no one knows what Gomez is thinking outside of Gomez, the singer and actress shared her feelings on romance in a subtle way last fall, telling Billboard, \u201cI\u2019m 25. I\u2019m not 18, or 19, or 20. I cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn\u2019t right. But that doesn\u2019t mean caring for someone ever goes away.\u201d\n\nRight now, the relationship Gomez seems most focused on is the one with herself. Last week, she opened up about how she stays confident and blocks out the noise on Instagram, where she shared a reference to Naomi Wolf\u2019s feminist manifesto The Beauty Myth. \u201cThe beauty myth\u2014an obsession with physical perfection that traps modern woman in an endless cycle of hopelessness, self consciousness, and self-hatred as she tries to fulfill society\u2019s impossible definition of flawless beauty. I chose to take care of myself because I want to, not to prove anything to anyone,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWind in her sails.\u201d ??\u201d\n\nRelated: Francia Ra\u00edsa Looks Back on Her Wild Year, Which Started By Donating a Kidney to Selena Gomez and Ended with a Starring Role on the Hit TV Series Grown-Ish", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dbba6ae42128c8627724_0316.w.selena.lo203.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dbabc884813ee94b3aa0_0316.w.selena.lo5_.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dc15c884813ee94b3aa6_0316.w.selena.lo202.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dbb23789303f568fbd01_0316.w.selena.lo14.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/28/7a3f0c1f-f605-48ba-a124-fdf346739758-gettyimages-1389379651.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5507&fp-y=0.2764", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dba46ae42128c8627721_0316.w.selena.lo2_.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dbbad767767a5bbdf66f_0316.w.selena.lo20.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8db9fc884813ee94b3a9d_0316.toc_.lo_.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/23/51eaad25-b7b3-44e7-a6f3-ce954e22e545-c4d4bbe2-ce28-4276-9170-f237868900a6-259611871_977138656172116_5833667957703203122_n.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.524&fp-y=0.2132", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dba5cc05a639a03f0266_0316.w.selena.lo4_.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/03/27/5abaaa8cbb407f69382bd29c_selena-gomez-justin-bieber-break-up.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dba1cc05a639a03f0263_0316.cover_.lo_.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dbaad767767a5bbdf669_0316.w.selena.lo6_.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dc11c884813ee94b3aa3_0316.w.selena.lo9_.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/03/27/5abaaa8cbb407f69382bd29c_selena-gomez-justin-bieber-break-up.jpg?w=414&h=313&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/08/08/57a8dbb2d767767a5bbdf66c_0316.w.selena.lo13.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/03/27/5abaaa8cbb407f69382bd29c_selena-gomez-justin-bieber-break-up.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-break-up-for-good-rumors", "title": "Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez May Have Broken Up for Good This Time", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marissagmuller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-break-up-for-good-rumors", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez May Have Broken Up For Good This Time", "description": "Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have reportedly broken up for good.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/03/27/5abaaa8cbb407f69382bd29c_selena-gomez-justin-bieber-break-up.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have reportedly broken up for good."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
