Superman, the second installation of the newly re-launched DC Universe, is that he\u2019s gotten bigger in stature, muscle, and armor. The next? He\u2019s also badder\u2014gruff, aggressive, and the kind of character willing to square up to the Man of Steel. Given this, you might miss the third fact, that Batman \u2014 or at least Ben Affleck, the actor playing him\u2014is also, well, middle-aged.\n\n\u201cI knew that a big part of the audience\u2019s expectation around the role would be how I looked physically,\u201d Affleck, 43, tells Men\u2019s Journal over email. \u201cAnd that was something I had some control over. If I was going to fail in this role, I wasn\u2019t going to let it be in a way that could have been prevented if I had worked harder.\u201d Director Zack Snyder believes that he got the job done, recently voicing his approval of Affleck\u2019s portrayal as the iconic character, in both of his personas: \u201cHe\u2019s an amazing Bruce Wayne, let\u2019s just be frank about that. And then when he puts the cowl on, you know he\u2019s got the chin for it.\u201d\n\nAffleck accomplished the proper frame with help from longtime trainer Walter Norton Jr., of the Institute of Performance and Fitness, who he began training with through a mutual friend during his fitness preparation for 2010\u2019s The Town. Based in Boston, Norton makes almost weekly flights between his hometown and wherever Affleck is, whether it\u2019s in Los Angeles or on location. \u201cGetting ready for this role meant working hard, day in and day out with Walter,\u201d says Affleck. \u201cBut it was the kind of work where I felt gains in not only my size, but also my mental and physical health.\u201d\n\nThere are benefits of having history with a trainer. \u201cSeven years ago the body bounced back a little quicker,\u201d says Norton. \u201cLike any relationship, it\u2019s all about communication and honesty. I can tell him a little something that he doesn\u2019t want to hear and that\u2019s fine. We\u2019re not tiptoeing around issues. So we just addressed it right at the top. We did what we needed to do to take care of him and protect his joints.\u201d\n\nBut that does not mean that Affleck had it easy. Every week Norton created a new regime for him with specific goals, targeting each muscle group relentlessly, and with that mentality they found themselves even overachieving their target numbers. In context, Affleck weighed in at 198 pounds for The Town, and for Batman V. Superman, he went all the way to 231 at 7.7 percent body fat, which they ended up \u201cdialing back\u201d to 225. \u201cThis time around we did more bodybuilding. We wanted him to be strong but we wanted to add mass. The volume was higher. We lived on a lot of the basics, 80-pound dumbbell curls, heavy-loaded carries, and farmers walks with 60-pound weights.\u201d\n\nAffleck needed that extra strength on set: The batsuit weighs some 75 pounds. There are also plenty of workout scenes making their way into the final cut, showing off his ripped physique, like one he shot in the Batcave doing pull-ups, while strapped to an additional 50 pounds in weight. \u201cIf I had to say there were any critical exercises that we always went back to, it was pull-ups and chin-ups.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted him to look like a thick MMA heavyweight puncher,\u201d explains Norton. \u201cThis is a Bruce Wayne who\u2019s been lifting for 20 years, hitting that heavyweight bag, and working out every day in the manor. I\u2019ll just say that if you lined up all the Batmans before Ben and stood them next to each other, they\u2019re not 6\u20194\u201d, and they don\u2019t weigh 225 pounds. He\u2019s in a whole other class.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a two-day glimpse at the workouts Norton created for Affleck as part of their two-year training program. You might not want to try this one on your own, though. \u201cI recommend that people find a trainer who they get along with, create their own program suiting their own goals, and if they approach it with the same enthusiasm that Ben did, they can also make gains like a hero.\u201d\n\nDay 1:\n\nBlock 1 (32 minutes): Warm-up & Movement\n\nElliptical (Strength Program): 15 minutes\n\nRumble Roller (Hip/TFL/VMO/2 Way Glute/Calf): 9 minutes\n\nPlank with Arm Extension: 10 seconds (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)\n\nSpiderman: From a plank, bring you right foot next to your right hand. 3 reps for each side (hold for 2 breaths)\n\nInchworm: From touching your toes with straight legs, walk your hands out to a plank, then walk your feet back under you, 5 reps (hold for 1 breath)\n\nCalf Stretch: 15 seconds (each leg)\n\nBlock 2 (40 minutes): Torso & Strength\n\nDumbbell Farmer\u2019s Walk: 4 walks with appropriate weight for 1 minute\n\nAlternating Hanging Knee-Up: 11 reps (for each leg)\n\n\u00bd Kneeling Row: Kneel on your right knee in front of a cable machine, row with your right arm, 4 sets of 12 reps on each side\n\nBack Bridge: 2 reps of 15 second hold (5-second pause between)\n\nAlternating Dumbbell Reverse Lunge: 8 reps (for each leg)\n\nPull-Up: 6 sets of 4 reps (hold for 4 seconds up and 4 seconds down)\n\nShoulder Bridge: 10-second hold (then 8 reps of 2-second extension for each side)\n\nBlock 3 (22 minutes / Doing As Many Sets As Possible): Strength & Fitness\n\nAirdyne Bike Sprint: 20 seconds\n\nV-Grip Pulldown: 15 reps\n\nSeated Row Handle Grip: 12 reps\n\nAlternating Dumbbell Open Curl: 5 sets of 5 reps (each arm, then 5 reps together)\n\nGoblet Squat: 8 reps\n\nLateral Squat: 6 reps (each side)\n\nDay 2:\n\nBlock 1 (30 minutes): Warm-up & Movement\n\nAirdyne Bike Sprint: 10 reps of 5 minutes at 75% (finish with 15-second sprint, then 45-second rest)\n\n\n\nSoft Roller (Upper Back/Lat/Quad/Glute/Ham Junction): 8 minutes\n\nBrettzel Stretch : 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)\n\nKneeling Lat: 1 rep each side (hold for 5 breaths)\n\n\u00bd Kneeling Quad Stretch: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)\n\nBrettzel: 2 reps for each side (hold for 5 breaths)\n\nBlock 2 (32 minutes): Torso & Strength\n\nOff-Bench Oblique Side Crunch: 8 reps dynamic (followed with hold for 8 seconds)\n\nValslide Body Slide: 4 sets of 12 reps\n\nDumbbell Lateral Raise: 4 sets of 12 reps\n\nBack Bridge with March: Hold bridge for 8 seconds (then 4 knee raises on each leg)\n\nDumbbell Shrug: 5 sets of 6 reps\n\nRear Delt Machine: 4 sets of 15 reps\n\n1 Leg Hip Lift : 3 sets of 8 reps for each side (hold for 2 seconds)\n\nTricep Pushdown: 4 sets of 10 heavy reps, then 10 lighter reps\n\nBlock 3 (36 minutes): Strength\n\nDumbbell Deadlift: 4 sets of 6 reps\n\nDumbbell Bench Press: 4 sets of 10 reps (count 3 seconds from up to down position)\n\nPec Fly: 4 sets of 12 reps\n\nBall Leg Curl: 4 sets of 6 reps (hold for 2 seconds)\n\nBatman v Superman is in theaters March 25, 2016.\n\nhttps://youtube.com/watch?v=fis-9Zqu2Ro%3Frel%3D0%26controls%3D0%26showinfo%3D0\n\nFor access to exclusive gear videos, celebrity interviews, and more, subscribe on YouTube!", "images": ["https://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/themes/mens-journal/assets/img/placeholders/default-mensjournal-square.svg", "http://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/batman-f4fc5109-b885-4cb9-b585-23d9a32fecbe.jpg?w=900&h=506&crop=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/themes/mens-journal/assets/img/placeholders/default-mensjournal.svg", "http://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/themes/mens-journal/assets/img/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/batman-f4fc5109-b885-4cb9-b585-23d9a32fecbe.jpg?crop=0px%2C142px%2C1536px%2C807px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=74&strip=all", "http://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/themes/mens-journal/assets/img/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mensjournal.com/wp-content/uploads/batman-f4fc5109-b885-4cb9-b585-23d9a32fecbe.jpg?crop=0px%2C142px%2C1536px%2C807px&resize=1200%2C630&quality=74&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Men'S Journal"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mensjournal.com/health-fitness/how-ben-affleck-got-big-for-batman-v-superman-w199882/", "title": "How Ben Affleck Got Big for Batman", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": 1588896957, "theme-color": "#eb212e", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Batman,Celebrity workouts", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "In 'Batman v.
