Jay Z is on top of the world after wife Beyonce gave birth to their twins. We\u2019ve got EXCLUSIVE details on how he was especially moved to tears when he held his newborn son for the first time.\n\nDaddy\u2019s boy! Jay Z finally has the son he\u2019s longed for after wife Beyonce, 35, gave birth to their twins, a boy and a girl. \u201cJay was brought to tears when he held his new son for the first time. He is already making plans for all the things he wants to teach the boy, places he wants to take the twins and all the wonderful things they will do,\u201d a source close to the rapper tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. Jay, 47, grew up without a father, so it must be so emotional to know his son will never have that same fate. His boy will always have the guidance of a loving and caring dad at all times.\n\n\u201cEveryone who has met the babies are already saying both kids look just like their father! Despite being stuck in the hospital, it was still the best Father\u2019s day ever for the couple,\u201d our insider continues. Now Jay has a mini-me that he can one day play hoops with, teach him how to rap, and follow in his dad\u2019s footsteps. Not that Jay doesn\u2019t completely adore his daughters, including five-year-old Blue Ivy, but there\u2019s something about the bond between a father and son that will be so special for him.\n\n\u201cBeyonce is eager to get her new babies home. She has been stuck inside the hospital for a week now and Jay has been by her side daily as they follow all of the doctor\u2019s conservative orders to ensure the newborns are healthy and strong before going home,\u201d our source adds. Unlike her smooth and \u201cpeaceful\u201d birth with Blue Ivy, the twins have been a whole different story as both mom and the babies have remained in UCLA Medical Center for the past week since June 12.\n\nJay has stayed by her bedside since the kiddos arrived, even skipping his prestigious induction into the Songwriters Hall of Fame on June 15 because it took place in NYC. In what appears to be a good sign that his wife and new babies are doing well, he was spotted leaving a Soul Cycle class on June 19 after working up a good sweat.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think Jay and Beyonce will name their new son and daughter? Will the boy be Sean Carter Jr.?
