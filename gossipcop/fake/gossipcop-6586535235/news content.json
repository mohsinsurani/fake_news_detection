However, the tabloid\u2019s story has now been debunked as false and proven to be a product of fabrications made by unreliable sources.\n\nOn Monday, Gossip Cop called out the magazine for publishing a baseless story in its latest issue. According to the fact-checking celebrity reporting site, the tabloid fabricated the story by citing an unknown source who is claiming that Pitt is planning to file court documents to subpoena a person named Anna Kowalski to prove the \u201cMaleficent\u201d actress\u2019 infidelity in court.\n\nKowalski is the woman identified by another tabloid, named Star, who can corroborate Jolie\u2019s alleged affair with her dialect coach while she was filming her spy film \u201cSalt\u201d in 2009. Kowalski was allegedly a housekeeper at New York\u2019s Waldorf Astoria at the time and she allegedly witnessed the clandestine romance between the actress and the teacher.\n\n\u201cBrad couldn\u2019t believe it when he heard Anna\u2019s claims,\u201d NW quoted its source as saying. \u201cYou can bet that he\u2019s going to have his lawyers use her anyway they can to get him equal custody of his kids.\u201d The source\u2019s claim, however, contradicts The Blast\u2019s recent report that says the custody talks between the \u201cMr. & Mrs. Smith\u201d co-stars have been amicable and going on \u201cpeacefully.\u201d\n\nFurthermore, it doesn\u2019t make sense for NW\u2019s source to claim that Pitt\u2019s camp is seeking to subpoena Kowalski because the person does not exist. A Waldorf Astoria spokesperson clarified to E! News in 2010 that they never had an employee named Anna Kowalski.\n\nIn addition, the teacher that was linked to Jolie, identified as Howard Samuelsohn, has also denied the tryst. \u201cI\u2019ve had eight different reporters call me, and one was even outside my home. I said, \u2018Yes, I know her professionally. She\u2019s very nice.\u2019 And then I immediately became the guy who slept with Angelina Jolie,\u201d he said before revealing that he\u2019s been \u201cwith the same woman for 33 years.\u201d\n\nGossip Cop slammed NW for digging up an old and proven to be false story and putting a new spin on it to increase its readership. The site also pointed out how the tabloid is notoriously known for churning unreliable narratives about Pitt and Jolie.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Toru Yamanaka", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/07/michelle-manning-barish.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/06/crime-scene.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/08/melania.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/07/us-south-korea.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/08/volcano.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2018/05/07/brad-pitt.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/07/brain.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/07/air-force.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/07/wendell-carter-jr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/07/stephen-curry.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/05/05/gettyimages-867208782.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/07/brad-pitt.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/07/brad-pitt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545/http://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-not-using-ex-wife-angelina-jolies-alleged-infidelity-court-2678740", "title": "Brad Pitt Not Using Ex-Wife Angelina Jolie\u2019s Alleged Infidelity In Court", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "brad pitt, brad pitt divorce, brad pitt dating, brad pitt girlfriend, brad pitt mit professor, neri oxman, angelina jolie, jennifer aniston, celebrity couple, celebrity dating, celebrity divorce", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545/http://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-not-using-ex-wife-angelina-jolies-alleged-infidelity-court-2678740", "title": "Brad Pitt Not Using Ex-Wife Angelina Jolie\u2019s Alleged Infidelity In Court", "description": "The story that Brad Pitt is trying to prove Angelina Jolie\u2019s infidelity in court has been debunked.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/07/brad-pitt.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "modified_time": "2018-05-08T01:12:47-04:00", "published_time": "2018-05-08T01:12:47-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brad Pitt Not Using Ex-Wife Angelina Jolie\u2019s Alleged Infidelity In Court", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-not-using-ex-wife-angelina-jolies-alleged-infidelity-court-2678740", "description": "The story that Brad Pitt is trying to prove Angelina Jolie\u2019s infidelity in court has been debunked.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180508101545im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/05/07/brad-pitt.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "The story that Brad Pitt is trying to prove Angelina Jolie\u2019s infidelity in court has been debunked."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525756367.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
