Enough is enough. Act like a humanitarian act like a woman! If our father dies I\u2019m holding you responsible, Meg!,\u201d she wrote, according to screenshots obtained by TMZ.\n\n\u201cMy father is not an embarrassment for loving his daughter! The Royals are an embarrassment for being so cold. You should be ashamed of yourselves @Kensington Royal\u2026 Glad you have so much time to gallivant around paying tribute to others while ignoring your own father! How cold can you be and look in the mirror? Harry? I guess I was right.\u201d\n\nThomas, 73, has taken to the British press multiple times begging his daughter to contact him, as he claims they have not spoken since he did an interview with \u201cGood Morning Britain\u201d in June.\n\nHe did not attend her May wedding, as he underwent emergency heart surgery days before and was unable to fly.\n\nLast week, he said he felt his daughter was \u201cterrified\u201d in her new role, and slammed the royal family as \u201coutdated.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy in 2018 are we dressing like the 1930s? Why do they have to cover their knees?\u201d he told The Sun on Sunday. \u201cI\u2019m not blaming Harry or anyone else but they are following rules that don\u2019t make sense to me.\u201d", "images":
