George, 56, and Amal Clooney\u2018s, 39, friends reportedly believe the star couple are expecting once again, according to Life & Style magazine. And although Amal gave birth to baby twins Ella and Alexander back in June, the two would reportedly be \u201cthrilled\u201d if they were to expand their family once again. \u201c[Amal] has the same symptoms she had when she learned she was pregnant the first time,\u201d an alleged close friend told the magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s eating like crazy and is more emotional than normal.\u201d Click here to see pics of Amal\u2019s stunning maternity style.\n\nHer friends apparently believe the human rights lawyer is still in the very early stages of pregnancy, but even weeks from now, there may still be no sign of a bump. \u201cDuring her first pregnancy, Amal barely showed for the first several months, and was active and working right up until a few weeks before the birth,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut she was tired a lot and had trouble getting to a healthy baby weight.\u201d At the same time however, if Amal truly is pregnant, her weight may not be an issue this time around. \u201cAmal\u2019s been loving going out to dinner while the family has been in Italy over the summer,\u201d the insider added. \u201cShe\u2019s craving pasta, risotto, and margherita pizza. At times it seems like she could be eating for three!\u201d\n\nAnd as it turns out, she actually COULD be! \u201cHaving twins once does increase your chance of having them again,\u201d Dr. Pari Ghodsi, ob-gyn, shared with the publication. \u201cOlder moms are also more likely to have twins.\u201d What\u2019s more, Amal\u2019s sister, Tala, has twins as well, and they tend to run in families. Having three \u2014 or four \u2014 kids under the age of two would definitely have its challenges, but apparently George \u201cwould be thrilled if Amal is indeed pregnant,\u201d the source revealed. \u201cHe loves being a dad, and really has a more-the-merrier attitude toward enlarging the family.\u201d\n\nOn the other hand though, Amal said in a Sept. 6 interview with The Hollywood Reporter, that she is definitely finished having kids. \u201cI\u2019m 39,\u201d the new mom said with a head shake when asked if she wanted more kids. \u201cI already had them quite late.\u201d\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do YOU think Amal is pregnant again? Do you think she and George will end up having another kid?", "images": ["https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jen-aniston-loved-wet-brush-now-kid-friendly-disney.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/george-cloomney-amal-clooney.jpg?w=293", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/Amal-Clooney-Yellow-Mini-Dress-George-splash-gal.jpg?w=293", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/howtosupportiran.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/george-clooney-amal-possibly-pregnant-again-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/George-Amal-Clooney-Hold-Hands-Dinner-BG.jpg?w=352", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/george-clooney-amal-possibly-pregnant-again-ftr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/george-clooney-amal-possibly-pregnant-again-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Taylor Jeffries", "Roya Backlund", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/13/george-amal-clooney-pregnant-again-baby-3rd-child-twins-birth/", "title": "Are George & Amal Clooney Pregnant With Baby #3 Less Than A Year After Twins\u2019 Birth?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "George &amp; Amal Clooney welcomed twins Ella &amp; Alexander just 3 months ago, but a new report claims the stars could ALREADY be expecting baby #3!
