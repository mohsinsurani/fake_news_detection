According to the industry insider, she is desperately looking forward to starting a family with him.\n\n\"She is really happy with Hassan though, and she is crazy in love. She can definitely see herself marrying him and having his babies, he is her soulmate,\" the source told Celebrity Insider.\n\nAlso read Rihanna's Fenty vs Kylie Cosmetics: Who is taking over the beauty aisle?\n\nThe insider also said the Barbadian singer has \"totally moved on\" from the time she spent with Breezy and knows that they can never get back together.\n\n\"Rihanna knows she cannot ever get back with Chris, and she has totally moved on from that time in her life \u2014 but she cannot just close off those feelings she had for him,\" the source said.\n\nThe insider even claimed Jameel is not a fan of Brown as he thinks Brown is a \"woman beater\" and a \"thug\".\n\n\"Hassan's not a fan of Chris Brown \u2014 at all \u2014 he thinks he is a thug and a woman beater. Rihanna knows there is a whole other side to Chris though, and she'll always love him, even though they're not in contact anymore,\" the source added.\n\nHowever, the Loyal singer also believes the Saudi billionaire is not good enough for his ex-girlfriend, say reports.\n\n\"Chris thinks Hassan is not good enough for Rihanna \u2014 but then, nobody would be good enough for her in his eyes,\" an insider told Hollywood Life.\n\n\"Chris just can't believe all the engagement rumours, he thinks there's no way Rihanna would marry this dude, which is kinda funny really as he doesn't know Hassan at all. Chris just can't help it though, even after all these years, and all the water that's passed under the bridge, he still loves Rihanna to pieces and he still thinks of her as being his girl. It's totally crazy, but Chris still holds out this belief that one day, somehow, he and Rihanna will get back together and live happily ever after,\" the source added.", "images": ["https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/674043/rihanna.jpg", "https://graphic1.ibtimes.co.in/www/img/jul2020/logo-sm.png", "https://graphic1.ibtimes.co.in/www/img/jul2020/logo-md.png", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/774708/laal-singh-chaddha.jpg?w=10&h=6", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/776490/crime-thriller-ajinomoto-based-concept-flavourful-slow-poison.jpg?w=10&h=6", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/771389/ranbir-nita-akash.jpg?w=10&h=6", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/674043/rihanna.jpg?w=10&h=6", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/776497/fact-check-xiaomi-operations-continue-india-slams-baseless-reports-truth-here.png?w=10&h=6", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/776492/bigg-boss-16.jpg?w=10&h=6", "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/774287/school-children.jpg?w=10&h=6"], "top_img": "https://data1.ibtimes.co.in/en/full/674043/rihanna.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ilin Mathew"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ibtimes.co.in/will-rihanna-break-hassan-jameel-reunion-chris-brown-756793", "title": "Will Rihanna break up with Hassan Jameel for a reunion with Chris Brown?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "author": "Ilin Mathew", "copyright": "2022 IBTimes", "subject": "Will Rihanna break up with Hassan Jameel for a reunion with Chris Brown?", "description": "The Barbadian singer has once described herself has the guardian angel of the Loyal singer.
