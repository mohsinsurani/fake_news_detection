But that wasn\u2019t always the case.\n\nLike most reality television, Keeping Up With The Kardashians airs months after its filmed. So we\u2019re just now seeing Scott\u2019s 2017 meltdown drama.\n\nWhich means that, as you\u2019ll see in the video below, viewers are now treated to Scott freaking out over Kourtney\u2019s young, hot boyfriend.\n\nPhoto via instagram\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that Scott Disick doesn\u2019t like Kourtney Kardashian dating Younges Bendjima. He has made that very, very clear on various Keeping Up With The Kardashians clips.\n\nBut now we\u2019re gaining more insight into exactly how Scott uses his own bad behavior to act out for attention.\n\nFor Kourtney\u2019s attention.\n\nKhloe summarizes the pattern at play pretty darn well:\n\n\"So you told him you have a boyfriend, now he\u2019s doing this \u2018cause he knows that every time he does that you come over there running.\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nThat\u2019s a very unhealthy pattern of behavior.\n\nKourtney says that it\u2019s really draining her: \"I just honestly don\u2019t have the energy.\"\n\nShe continues her story, speaking to Khloe and to Kim.\n\n\"So yeah I went to Scott\u2019s house because he called me and was really out of it.\"\n\nSo \u2026 is that code for \"drunk,\" or are we just guessing that because of how he spent so much of 2017?\n\nPhoto via E!\n\nAlarmingly, it sounds like Scott\u2019s freakout was enough to drive Kourtney away.\n\n\"He was just very aggressive. And then I was like, \u2018I\u2019m leaving!\u2019\"\n\nWeird that Scott had no problem banging his way through a bunch of hot models born in 1998, but the moment that he finds out that Kourtney\u2019s enjoying a model of a 1993 vintage, he starts to freak out.\n\nKourtney didn\u2019t appreciate that one bit.\n\n\"And then I just started crying and I was like, \u2018I do not need to even be here.\u2019\"\n\nShe\u2019s right. You do not need to babysit your ex just because his man feelings are hurt.\n\nPhoto via E!\n\nIt sounds like Scott worried her enough that she had to instruct him.\n\n\"And then I was like, \u2018Just sit down!\u2019 Literally, you have talk to him like crazy, otherwise he won\u2019t listen.\"\n\nLike \u2026 like a dog?\n\n\"So I\u2019m like, \u2018Sit down across the room from me.\"\n\nShe had some serious questions for him.\n\n\"What the f\u2013k is wrong with you? When is it going to be enough?\"\n\nPhoto via E!\n\nKourtney summarizes exactly why she doesn\u2019t need to be holding the hand of a man-child.\n\n\"I have three kids to take care of.\u2019\"\n\nExactly. Her nurturing instincts don\u2019t need to be wasted on Scott.\n\nOf course, like we said, this is from months ago. We know that this has a \"happy\" ending, since \u2026 well, Scott ends up with Sofia Richie and we guess that the relationship serves as a balm for his insecurities.\n\nHere\u2019s the video:", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/scott-disick-shares-break-in-news.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/jason-mesnick-dumps-melissa-rycroft-for-molly-malaney-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/farrah-abraham-gets-fired-see-the-special-moment-in-all-its-glor-320x240.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20611%20610'%3E%3Crect%20width='611'%20height='610'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/scott-disick-freaks-out-at-kourtney-over-younes-bendjima-480x360.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/scott-disick-in-glasses-on-kuwtk.png", "https://the-hollywood-gossip-res.cloudinary.com/iu/v1509989785/scott-disick-calls-kourtney-kardashian-fake", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/05/kourtney-and-scott-disick-throwback.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20480%20360'%3E%3Crect%20width='480'%20height='360'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/scott-disick-freaks-out-at-kourtney-over-younes-bendjima.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20618%20722'%3E%3Crect%20width='618'%20height='722'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20718%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='718'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20710%20788'%3E%3Crect%20width='710'%20height='788'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20526%20657'%3E%3Crect%20width='526'%20height='657'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/scott-disick-looks-smooth-718x1024.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/scott-disick-freaks-out-at-kourtney-over-younes-bendjima.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/videos/scott-disick-freaks-out-at-kourtney-over-younes-bendjima/", "title": "Scott Disick Freaks Out at Kourtney Kardashian Over Younes Bendjima!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scott Disick Freaks Out at Kourtney Kardashian Over Younes Bendjima!", "description": "These days,\u00a0Scott\u00a0Disick\u00a0is enjoying his \"nympho\" girlfriend Sofia Richie\u00a0and seems almost\u00a0stable.
