Yet, we\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY the Queen\u2019s helping her out!\n\nWho knew being a member of the British monarchy would be so hard? Meghan Markle, 36, is learning firsthand. After saying \u201cyes\u201d to Prince Harry, 33, the Suits star\u2019s world has been turned upside down! Thankfully, she has Harry and Queen Elizabeth, 91, to help her learn the ropes. \u201cMeghan has been on this crazy fairy tale romance rollercoaster, and it\u2019s only just starting to sink in quite how different her life will be from now on,\u201d a palace insider EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com.\u201d Being an actress, she\u2019s used to being in the public eye, but nothing really can prepare somebody to suddenly become a member of the British royal family. It\u2019s not just the fact that as a royal her every move will be scrutinized and analyzed, she\u2019s also got to learn a ludicrous amount of etiquette, and rules that are specific to the royal family\u2014many of which seemingly make no sense or serve any real purpose.\u201d\n\nThe British monarchy being governed by antiquated and obsolete decrees? Heavens, no! \u201cThe lunch that Meghan attended during the week was her first real taste of what life will be like, and it was pretty overwhelming,\u201d the source tells HollywoodLife.com. \u201cIt\u2019s stressful enough meeting your fianc\u00e9\u2019s extended family when he\u2019s just a regular guy, so imagine what it\u2019s like when they are titled royalty. Harry is right there by her side obviously, and Kate [Middleton, 35] has been an amazing source of support and knowledge, but it\u2019s still pretty daunting.\u201d\n\nSo, what are the rules that Meghan needs to learn? Well, the insider says she has to learn how to address different people with the correct title, how to interact since she\u2019s becoming a member of the British crown, how to eat, to hold a cup, which subjects of conversation \u201care acceptable and which are taboo.\u201d It\u2019s all pretty hard to get. Even Princess Michael Of Kent, 74, seemingly forgot her manners. She wore a blackamoor broach to that lunch with Meghan and the royals, a jewelry that looked pretty dang racist. Princess Michael has been accused of racist statements in the past, per The Root, so it seems she might need a refresher on how to behave.\n\nBeing a royal comes \u201ceasy for Harry, as he was born into the family,\u201d the source says,\u201d and doesn\u2019t know any different, it\u2019s second nature to him, but for Meghan, it\u2019s like she has to relearn everything she knows in life from scratch. The Queen has actually been amazing though, she has totally embraced Meghan and welcomed her to the family, and Harry has reassured Meghan that it\u2019s Ok if she gets some things wrong from time to time\u2014but, it\u2019s still pretty challenging.\u201d\n\nAre you excited to see Meghan and Harry get married, HollywoodLifers?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F12%2F23%2Fmeghan-markle-royal-etiquette-rules-prince-harry-queen%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2923066", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kim-kardashian-kanye-west-how-sex-a-new-diet-their-third-baby-could-save-them-from-divorce-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/meghan-markle-nervous-prince-harry-queen-rex-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/meghan-markle-nervous-prince-harry-queen-rex-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/jonah-hill-brother-dies-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/matt-damon-dad-passes-away-rex-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efcdfea9db6d2663af1d2c3f29228bfc?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/meghan-markle-nervous-prince-harry-queen-rex-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/23/meghan-markle-royal-etiquette-rules-prince-harry-queen/", "title": "Meghan Markle \u2018Overwhelmed\u2019 By Royal Etiquette \u2014 How Harry & The Queen Are Helping", "meta_data": {"description": "Meghan Markle's struggling with all the rules of being a royal, but Prince Harry and Queen Elizabeth are helping her out.", "news_keywords": "Meghan Markle, Prince Harry", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle \u2018Overwhelmed\u2019 By Royal Etiquette \u2014 How Harry & The Queen Are Helping", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171224050300/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/23/meghan-markle-royal-etiquette-rules-prince-harry-queen/", "description": "As she gets ready to marry Prince Harry, Meghan Markle is struggling to learn all the rules of being a Royal.
