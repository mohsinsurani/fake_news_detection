Part of a small club of actors turned race car drivers, from Paul Newman and Steve McQueen to Patrick Dempsey, Fassbender \u2014 who spent his childhood in Ireland glued to the TV watching Michael Schumacher win one F1 title after another \u2014 is the real deal.\n\nThe 41-year-old star, who picked up the sport in 2016, possesses an encyclopedic, arcane knowledge of 1980s Group B rally racing and has logged more than 120 hours behind the wheel of his 488 Ferrari Challenge car \u2014 valued at $330,000, featuring a 670-horsepower, 3.9-liter turbocharged V-8 engine. It\u2019s numbered 133, because, as he says, \u201cthree is my lucky number.\u201d\n\nLuck, though, had little to do with Fassbender winning the first of six series (his next race is in Montreal on June 9) in the Ferrari Challenge 2018 season, which opened at Florida\u2019s Daytona Speedway in January, where speeds exceed 190 miles per hour. Says Ferrari Challenge head instructor Didier Theys: \u201cFrom the start, Michael has shown a great deal of dedication and talent as a competitor.\u201d\n\nRacing is the reward that rounds out a career marked (so far) by two Oscar nominations, for his work in 2013\u2019s 12 Years a Slave and 2015\u2019s Steve Jobs.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the things about the job that I do that\u2019s a huge perk, just an absolute dream come true,\u201d says Fassbender, who lives in Lisbon, Portugal, with Alicia Vikander, whom he married in October. \u201cIt was always a goal to do some sort of racing at 40, but I didn\u2019t imagine that I\u2019d be in a series like this with very powerful, very fast 660-odd horsepower machines.\u201d Fassbender adds with a laugh, \u201cIt\u2019s a lot more fun prepping for this than learning lines at home,\u201d the downside being, \u201cif you miss an apex or mess up a corner, you don\u2019t get a \u2018take two.'\u201d\n\nHe points out the other contrast between his two chosen vocations \u2014 the type of risk involved: \u201cIt\u2019s a different kind of butterflies. For a film, I\u2019ve usually been putting together this character, but haven\u2019t really shown it to anybody. That first day of shooting, it\u2019s like, \u2018God, I hope this works.\u2019 But racing, once you start doing it, focusing on what you have to do, you can\u2019t think of anything else. When you\u2019re driving, literally, if your mind wanders, you\u2019re going to go off the track.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s a process to maintaining composure while white-knuckling it for four 30-minute races over weekends that begin with Thursday practice laps and end Sunday. Says Fassbender, \u201cWhen it comes to the first practice day, your brain and body have to assimilate to these high speeds. You get into the car and think, \u2018Oh, God, I can\u2019t do this,\u2019 but it\u2019s incredible how the body and mind adapt \u2014 it\u2019s just about focusing and trying to get in a rhythm. Racing is something that really does bring that level of forced meditation \u2014 it\u2019s very rare in life.\u201d\n\nOver time, the actor, who plays Magneto in February\u2019s X-Men: Dark Phoenix, has reached an understanding about anxiety: \u201cBefore my first race here last year, I literally thought I was going to vomit. I was in the toilet beforehand, breathing. I was nervous, but that feeling is pretty special, that first race feeling.\u201d\n\nWith Fassbender, winning really does seem to matter. \u201cLike many of his fellow drivers, he\u2019s something of a perfectionist and determined to win,\u201d says Theys.\n\nNotes the star, making a nod to a perspective that many a fellow Oscar nominee might share: \u201cYou race to win, for sure, that\u2019s the goal. Either you\u2019re fastest or you\u2019re not \u2014 that\u2019s the allure for me. It\u2019s always great to be on the podium.\u201d\n\nThis story first appeared in the June 6 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
