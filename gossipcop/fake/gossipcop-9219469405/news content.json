Pitt\u2019s attorney also calls Jolie\u2019s filing a \u201cthinly-veiled effort to manipulate media coverage.\u201d\n\nThis latest public row in their divorce proceedings comes after Jolie\u2019s claim in court documents on Tuesday that Pitt has not paid adequate child support.\n\n\u201c[Pitt] has a statutory duty to pay child support. As of present, [Pitt] has paid no meaningful child support since separation,\u201d Jolie\u2019s attorney, Samantha Bley DeJean, wrote in Tuesday\u2019s filing.\n\nRelated: Angelina Jolie says Brad Pitt not paying \u2018meaningful\u2019 child support in new court docs\n\nDeJean goes on to state that Jolie would like the court to have Pitt pay her the money she is owed.\n\n\u201cGiven that the informal arrangements around the payment of the children\u2019s expenses have not been regularly sustained by [Pitt] for over a year and a half, [Jolie] intends to file an RFO [request for a court order] for the establishment of a retroactive child support order,\u201d the documents state.\n\nA source close to Pitt told CNN, \u201cIt is sad that someone would deliberately misrepresent the situation, especially after Brad has continued to fulfill his commitments.\u201d\n\nThe couple separated in September 2016 after two years of marriage and filed for divorce shortly after.\n\nPitt and Jolie have three sons and three daughters, ages 17 and under. Jolie has sought sole custody of the children.\n\nIn June, Pitt and Jolie\u2019s custody battle hit a fever pitch and a judge required Jolie tell their children that the \u201ccourt has determined that not having a relationship with their father is harmful to them,\u201d that they are \u201csafe with their father,\u201d and that having a healthy relationship with both parents is \u201ccritical.\u201d\n\nThe order outlined a shared custody schedule for the summer in which the children would split their time between Los Angeles and London, with Jolie maintaining primary physical custody.\n\nCNN has reached out to both Pitt and Jolie\u2019s representatives for comment.\n\nCNN\u2019s Cheri Mossburg and Stella Chan contributed to this report.", "images":
