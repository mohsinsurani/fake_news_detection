She was speaking with Victoria Derbyshire of BBC Two, promoting the based-on-a-true-story film \u201cLion,\u201d which she described as a \u201clove letter \u2026 to mothers and children.\u201d In it, she portrays an Australian woman who, with her husband, adopts a lost Indian boy named Saroo.\n\nDuring the interview, Derbyshire brought up Kidman\u2019s dual Australian and American citizenship and noted the actress voted in the U.S. election.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always reticent to start sort of commenting politically,\u201d Kidman began. \u201cI\u2019ve never done it in terms of America, or Australia. I\u2019m issue-based.\u201d\n\nThen she continued, \u201cI just say he\u2019s now elected and we as a country need to support whoever\u2019s the president because that\u2019s what the country\u2019s based on. However that happened, he\u2019s there, and let\u2019s go. \u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAfter these remarks, she quickly discussed two topics \u2014 same-sex marriage and women\u2019s health care and equality.\n\nShe said the former should be legal in Australia. On the latter, she said, \u201cI\u2019m very, very committed to women\u2019s issues in terms of I do a lot of fundraising for U.N. Women and I do a lot of traveling for them. I also do an enormous amount of fundraising for breast and ovarian cancer, because that\u2019s something that\u2019s affected my family deeply. So they\u2019re my issues that I\u2019m very attached to.\u201d\n\nKidman quickly came under fire on social media.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s time for Nicole Kidman to move to Russia,\u201d tweeted one user. \u201cNicole Kidman married Tom Cruise who is a Scientologist. Her advice is the last thing America needs!\u201d tweeted another. \u201cWould you follow Hitler, just because he has a title?\u201d asked one user.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nhttps://twitter.com/BumbleBUnicorn/status/819820861913964544\n\nHer comments are a sharp departure from the rhetoric most celebrities have used since Trump\u2019s surprise victory over Hillary Clinton.\n\nMost recently, Meryl Streep used her acceptance speech at the Golden Globes as a semi-political vehicle, espousing the virtues of a \u201cprincipled press\u201d and condemning the powerful who use bullying as a means of control. She never once mentioned Trump\u2019s name while clearly speaking about him, bringing up \u201cthe person asking to sit in the most respected seat in our country imitat[ing] a disabled reporter.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd this instinct to humiliate, when it\u2019s modeled by someone in the public platform, by someone powerful, it filters down into everybody\u2019s life, because it kind of gives permission for other people to do the same thing,\u201d Streep said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor her efforts, Trump employed his favorite insult, tweeting that Streep \u2014 winner of three Oscars and nominated for 19 \u2014 was \u201coverrated\u201d and was a \u201cHillary flunky who lost big.\u201d\n\nBruce Springsteen, who in reference to Trump had previously told Rolling Stone \u201cThe republic is under siege by a moron,\u201d recently gave a far-reaching interview on the popular podcast \u201cWTF with Marc Maron.\u201d In it, he wondered aloud if Trump \u201cis simply competent enough to do this particular job.\u201d\n\nSpeaking about Trump\u2019s election, Springsteen warned, \u201cWhen you let that genie out of the bottle \u2014 bigotry, racism, intolerance \u2026 they don\u2019t go back in the bottle that easily if they go back in at all. Whether it\u2019s a rise in hate crimes, people feeling they have license to speak and behave in ways that previously were considered un-American and are un-American. That\u2019s what he\u2019s appealing to. My fears are that those things find a place in ordinary, civil society.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome celebrities didn\u2019t wait quite so long to attack the president-elect. \u201cWest Wing\u201d and \u201cSocial Network\u201d screenwriter Aaron Sorkin published a letter in Vanity Fair addressed to his ex-wife Julia and his 15-year-old daughter Roxy the day after the election. In it, he called Trump \u201can incompetent pig with dangerous ideas, a serious psychiatric disorder, no knowledge of the world and no curiosity to learn,\u201d then wrote simply, \u201cThis is truly horrible.\u201d\n\nAs The Washington Post reported:\n\nIt was full of sharp language and vitriol (at one point, he called the president-elect a certain type of \u201cnozzle\u201d that can\u2019t be printed here; at another, he stated Trump will be impeached within the year), despite the magazine labeling it as \u201cmoving.\u201d\n\nThat said, there have been a few celebrities who have urged Americans to give Trump a chance, even if he wasn\u2019t their first pick for the presidency.\n\nWe all need to give President-Elect Trump a chance. Support the good. Lobby against what we disagree on. No one is bigger than us all \u2014 Mark Cuban (@mcuban) November 9, 2016\n\nWhile accepting the Trevor Hero Honoree Award at the annual fundraiser for the Trevor Project, a nonprofit organization focused on suicide prevention among LGBTQ youth, Kelly Osbourne said to the audience, \u201cWe have to give him a chance. And we do it by spreading love, not hate.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nMirroring this, BET founder Bob Johnson said, \u201cLet\u2019s give him a shot. Let\u2019s give him the benefit of the doubt and see if we can find common ground. That is what\u2019s best for African Americans.\u201d\n\nFinally, some have outright supported Trump, such as former NBA star Dennis Rodman, who told Black Press USA, \u201cWe don\u2019t need another politician, we need a businessman like Trump.\u201d\n\nMore from Morning Mix:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-01-08/Getty/631245928.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-01-08/Getty/631245928.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travis M.
