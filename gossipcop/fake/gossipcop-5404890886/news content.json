Laura Packard\n\nPackard, a small business owner from Las Vegas who is currently battling stage four Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, was blocked by Trump after tweeting at him about health care and concerns over the repeal of Obamacare. The tweets that seemed to push Trump over the edge are from Sept. 19 of last year, in which she accused him of putting \u201cAmerica last,\u201d and questioned him over the Graham-Cassidy healthcare bill.\n\nThe morning of Sept. 20, she woke up and discovered that Trump had blocked her. Now, she has one request for Trump, she told ThinkProgress \u2014 and it isn\u2019t that he\u2019ll lift the block: \u201cI just wish that he would listen.\u201d\n\nBut Packard addressed Wednesday\u2019s ruling, helpfully explaining how Trump can unblock users en masse.\n\n2. Rosie O\u2019Donnell\n\nTrump and O\u2019Donnell have been feuding for years, but it took until July 23, 2017, for him to finally block her on Twitter. It was a tweet that mentioned the instantly infamous unsubstantiated Russian dossier, which alleged that Russian spies had explicit information about Trump, which finally prompted him to block the former talk show host\n\nJust a few hours after sending the tweet, O\u2019Donnell found herself blocked.\n\nShe\u2019s still tweeting about him, though \u2014 and has asked others to forward along her messages.\n\n3. Anne Rice\n\nThe president denied the Interview With the Vampire author one of her favorite pastimes \u2014 personally responding to Trump\u2019s many tweets. She frequently tweeted about the president, his policy decisions, and yes, his tweets. In fact, it\u2019s almost all she tweets about even now, after she\u2019s been blocked. It was a now-deleted tweet about the Republican health care plan that finally got her banned from his account on June 26.\n\nJeff Vespa/WireImage; Alex Wong/Getty\n\nThe tweet read:\n\n\u201cThe Trump-GOP health care plan is a tax cut for the rich. Millions will lose coverage. A complete rip off.\u201d\n\nNow, like O\u2019Donnell, Rice hopes that her messages will still find their way to Trump through her followers.\n\n4. Chrissy Teigen\n\nThe latest addition to the \u201cblocked by Trump\u201d club, Teigen is an outspoken critic of the president, and has been, in her own words, for \u201cnine years\u201d \u2014 long before he ever ran for the White House. What was the insult though, that pushed Trump to hit the block button? According to Teigen, it was her most recent attack, on Sunday:\n\nTeigen shared a screenshot of the notification that Trump had blocked her, writing: \u201cAfter 9 years of hating Donald J Trump, telling him \u2018lol no one likes you\u2019 was the straw.\u201d\n\nFrancois Mori/AP\n\n5. Stephen King\n\nHe\u2019s an expert on twists and turns, but not even King could have predicted that the president would block him on Twitter. Before the block, in mid-June, King had frequently tweeted criticisms of Trump, but rarely tagged the president\u2019s twitter accounts (@realDonaldTrump or @POTUS). However, there were some pretty tough-worded tweets, so it\u2019s possible they ended up on Trump\u2019s radar.\n\n6. Marina Sirtis\n\nThe actress and Star Trek: The Next Generation star can pinpoint her blockage to a single tweet. The whole thing happened pretty quickly. First, she tweeted this on May 8:\n\nSix minutes later, she tweeted that she had been blocked. Sometimes, these things happen fast.\n\n7. Bess Kalb\n\nA writer for Jimmy Kimmel Live! and The New Yorker, Kelb found herself blocked by the president after a posting a number of tweets about him, as well as regular responses to many of his tweets. She said she was blocked because she \u201churt his feelings.\u201d There\u2019s no telling which of Kelb\u2019s tweets was the final straw for Trump, but here are a number of guesses:\n\n8. Andy Signore\n\nSignore is the mastermind behind the YouTube channel Honest Trailers. What\u2019s surprising is that Signore wasn\u2019t a habitual tweet-at-Trump-er. Instead, he wrote one critical tweet, about Trump misconstruing a quote by London Mayor Sadiq Khan on the terror attack at London Bridge.\n\nBy the next night, he was blocked.\n\n9. Angelo Carusone\n\nTrump\u2019s blocking of Carusone, the president of the progressive watchdog group Media Matters for America, left him at a loss.\n\nCarusone said he hadn\u2019t tweeted at Trump in four months by the time the president blocked him on June 15.\n\n\u201cSigh. The last time I @ mentioned him on Twitter was back in February. So what gives? Does he really not have better things to do right now?\u201d Carusone wrote.\n\n10. Holly Figueroa O\u2019Reilly\n\nSongwriter O\u2019Reilly, who was also one of the organizers of the #MarchForTruthcalling for an independent probe into the Trump administration\u2019s possible ties to the Russian government, found herself blocked by Trump at the end of May. She\u2019s tweeted a number of insults at Trump, including the following:\n\nO\u2019Reilly, however, isn\u2019t taking Trump\u2019s blockage lightly. She, along with six other blocked-by-Trump Twitter users, as well as the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University, have sued Trump, saying that the blocking is \u201cunconstitutional\u201d and seeking to remove it, according to court documents.", "images":
