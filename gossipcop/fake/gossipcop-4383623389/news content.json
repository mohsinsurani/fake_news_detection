A source close to the Kardashians EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com Ye\u2019s ultimatum.\n\nYou know things are tense between Travis Scott, 25, and Kylie Jenner, 20, when Kanye West, 40, has to step in to talk some sense into the rapper about spending time with Kylie and their soon-to-be-born child. A source close to the Kardashian brood EXCLUSIVELY told us how Kanye tried to make Travis understand the importance of family, especially with Kylie expecting. \u201cKanye had a serious man to man talk with Travis about becoming a father at the Christmas party this week,\u201d our source said. \u201cIt was an emotional conversation as Kanye explained to Travis how wonderful it is becoming a father for the first time, how his whole life is about to change for the better. It was a beautiful, sweet moment between the two guys, but there was also an important point Kanye wanted to make to the younger rapper.\u201d\n\nSo, what were the wise words of advice and warning Kanye imparted to his younger protege? Man up. \u201cKanye made it clear to Travis that he needs to step it up big time,\u201d our source added. \u201cKanye is protective of all of his family and wanted Travis to know that he better not let Kylie down in anyway once the baby arrives, \u2019cause Kanye will be watching.\u201d And Travis certainly does not want to let Kanye down \u2014 especially considering the fact Kanye is his idol.\n\nWe reported earlier how Kim Kardashian, 37, had asked Kanye to talk some sense into Travis, and while he was apparently reluctant to do so, it seems that Yeezy pulled through in a big way. Time will tell whether or not Kanye\u2019s words had an effect on Travis and if the 25-year-old rapper quits hitting up the strip club for good.
