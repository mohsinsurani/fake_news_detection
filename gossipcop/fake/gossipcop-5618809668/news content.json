Page Six reports that Beverly Hills landowners have banded together to reject Bieber from renting a house in the neighborhood.\n\nAn unnamed real estate agent told Page Six that Bieber \u201cwants to rent a big estate, but many of the owners of the big Beverly Hills properties, which are for rent, have clubbed together to agree that nobody should rent to Justin.\u201d\n\nThe Canadian pop star is better known for upsetting his neighbors with dangerous driving and random eggings than for his house-destroying parties, but whatever the reason, Beverly Hills residents really don\u2019t want him in their \u2018hood. Bieber is reportedly offering well over the asking rent\u2014up to $100,000 a month\u2014and still no one has rented him any of the places he\u2019s interested in.\n\nCast out of the Bev Hills rental market, poor Bieber has been forced to move into an unidentified posh hotel in the neighborhood. He\u2019s rented quarters in the hotel \u201cfor up to a year,\u201d says Page Six.\n\nBieber has rented in Beverly Hills before, taking up residence in a $59,000-a-month glass house that looks a bit like a glamorous salad spinner. (It was a short-term lease.)", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/kn_hVkwteeofnfGdriS09iJjPao=/0x0:3000x2000/1200x800/filters:focal(1260x760:1740x1240)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57001735/shutterstock_157044512.0.jpg", "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9l8BZkkA5FBygU6agYaG-AuQ2ns=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9391799/shutterstock_157044512.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9l8BZkkA5FBygU6agYaG-AuQ2ns=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9391799/shutterstock_157044512.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bianca Barragan", "Oct"], "canonical_link": "https://la.curbed.com/2017/10/4/16423484/beverly-hills-homeowners-ban-justin-bieber", "title": "Justin Bieber can\u2019t get a Beverly Hills rental", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Curbed LA", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/curbedla", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/curbedla", "published_time": "2017-10-04T11:45:03-07:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-04T11:45:03-07:00"}, "author": "Bianca Barragan", "style-tools": "https://archive.curbed.com/style/community/593/d47f60fb6b5e4340febbd64f0b5ca68e/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "Beverly Hills homeowners band together to deny Bieber a rental house.", "og": {"description": "He\u2019s living in a posh hotel for up to a year because no one will rent him a mansion.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9l8BZkkA5FBygU6agYaG-AuQ2ns=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9391799/shutterstock_157044512.jpg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Curbed LA", "title": "Beverly Hills homeowners don\u2019t want to rent to Justin Bieber", "type": "article", "url": "https://la.curbed.com/2017/10/4/16423484/beverly-hills-homeowners-ban-justin-bieber"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://la.curbed.com/2017/10/4/16423484/beverly-hills-homeowners-ban-justin-bieber", "title": "Beverly Hills homeowners don\u2019t want to rent to Justin Bieber", "description": "He\u2019s living in a posh hotel for up to a year because no one will rent him a mansion.", "image": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/9l8BZkkA5FBygU6agYaG-AuQ2ns=/0x215:3000x1786/fit-in/1200x630/cdn1.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9391799/shutterstock_157044512.jpg", "site": "CurbedLA"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6071835/144x144.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FF604A", "outbrainsection": "celebrity-houses-real-estate"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507071600.0, "source": "http://la.curbed.com", "summary": ""}
