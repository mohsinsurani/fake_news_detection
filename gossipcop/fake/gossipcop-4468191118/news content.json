That\u2019s it. That\u2019s literally all we want. The guessing game has exhausted us. Thankfully, according to several sources, we might get our wish via the Kardashian Christmas card (or Kardashian Kristmas Kard, as we like to call it).\n\nWe\u2019ve been sitting tight since September when news broke that both sisters are expecting their first babies. But months later, the rumors have yet to be confirmed or denied. Now that we\u2019ve crept into December, it\u2019s beginning to look a lot like the Kardashian\u2019s annual Christmas card may give the confirmation fans have been waiting for.\n\nWriter and Kardashian \u201cexpert\u201d Mariah Smith (who helms a column for The Cut called Keeping Up With the Kontinuity Errors), tweeted on Sunday, December 3rd, that the Christmas card \u201cwill most likely serve as our Khloe/Kylie pregnancy announcement.\u201d false\n\nPlus, Kim Kardashian has been teasing bits and pieces of the family\u2019s Christmas card on social media. She announced that she would be sharing a section of the photo shoot each of the 25 days leading up to Christmas \u2014 kind of like a digital Kardashian jigsaw puzzle.\n\nIs it crazy to think that day 24 or 25 might act as the pregnancy reveal? We think not.\n\nA source told Us Weekly at the end of November that Khlo\u00e9 would be announcing her pregnancy with beau Tristan Thompson soon. And another source told Hollywood Life back in October that the sisters and their mother, Kris Jenner, were planning to announce the news during the holiday season. The source said:\n\n\"The Kardashian Christmas card is something that is very important for Kris Jenner. Kris wants to take everyone\u2019s excitement and use this year\u2019s card to be the reveal of all the pregnancies in the family.\"\n\nOkay, we\u2019re sold. This has to happen!\n\nWhat\u2019s more \u2014 the Kardashians skipped out on last year\u2019s card and fans were devastated. If we were Kris Jenner, we\u2019d want to make a glorious and memorable comeback after taking a year off from an annual tradition, right? Right?\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/_ejga7jjmB\n\nOf course, this is just one of many theories circulating the internet regarding the rumors. But it seems to hold the most water. Unfortunately, we\u2019re just going to have to wait patiently to know the truth. Christmas can\u2019t come fast enough.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/12/05/khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-e1512491997731.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/12/05/khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-e1512491997731.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/12/05/khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-e1512491997731.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Harvey"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/theres-new-theory-khloe-kylie-will-reveal-pregnancies-kardashian-christmas-card/", "title": "Will Khlo\u00e9 and Kylie reveal their pregnancies in the family Christmas card?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "A new theory claims that Khlo\u00e9 and Kylie Jenner will announce their rumored pregnancies through the Kardashian family Christmas card.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Will Khlo\u00e9 and Kylie reveal their pregnancies in the family Christmas card?", "description": "A new theory claims that Khlo\u00e9 and Kylie Jenner will announce their rumored pregnancies through the Kardashian family Christmas card.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/theres-new-theory-khloe-kylie-will-reveal-pregnancies-kardashian-christmas-card/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/12/05/khloe-kardashian-kylie-jenner-e1512491997731.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 900, "height": 643, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-05T13:57:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T18:03:24+00:00"}, "author": "olivia harvey", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "olivia harvey", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512482266.0, "source": "http://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
