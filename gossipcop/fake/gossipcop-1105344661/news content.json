Magazine published an article titled, \u201cJen & Ben Back Together!\u201d In the article, the publication quoted an anonymous source saying Garner has \u201cagreed to give their marriage another shot\u201d after \u201cconvincing\u201d her estranged husband to go back to rehab to treat his alcohol addiction.\n\nThe source further said \u201cshe promised him if he gets sober they\u2019ll renew their vows in a private, yet romantic, ceremony and become a family again.\u201d This was because Garner reportedly \u201ccan\u2019t let go,\u201d and has \u201calways wanted to stick it out\u201d because she \u201cloves him and feels she owes it to her kids to make things work with their dad.\u201d\n\nAnd, this was not all. The tipster went onto say the romantic promise from the \u201cElektra\u201d actress acted as the much-needed motivation Affleck was looking for to get sober again.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/ Jason Merritt\n\n\u201cBen realized that he\u2019s no good on his own and that he wants his old life back. He wants to be with Jen,\u201d the source said, adding, \u201cBen wants to be a family again and is thrilled that Jen agrees. He\u2019s telling friends he finally got his wife back.\u201d\n\nLastly, to drive the rumor home, the publication claimed Garner was already preparing to get back together with her estranged husband as she was seen \u201cbringing some of Ben\u2019s belongings back over to her house.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gossip Cop pointed out the scenario, as reported by OK! could not be more further from the truth. Garner and Affleck have finalized their divorce settlement recently and the latter, who told E! Online earlier this week \u201cthey both want to move on,\u201d will be signing the papers once he gets out of rehab.\n\nAs for moving trucks photographed near Affleck\u2019s house a day before the actor checked into rehab, they were believed to have been there to help remove his ex-girlfriend Lindsay Shookus\u2019 stuff out of his house, following their split. Garner was not involved in any way as no moving truck was noticed near her residence.\n\nMoreover, a confidante close to Garner told Gossip Cop any claim of the couple getting back together was \u201ctotal lies.\u201d\n\nBesides, Affleck was spotted with Playboy model Shauna Sexton several times over the past weeks, leaving restaurants together. She was even photographed entering the actor\u2019s house, further confirming Affleck was not getting back together with his ex-wife.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/31/trump-warns-fbi.JPG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/31/donald-trump.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/31/blackrock.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2018/08/30/ben-affleck.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/30/gettyimages-877158138.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/30/hatch.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/08/30/ben-affleck.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/30/gettyimages-869668888_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/31/aramco1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/sm/public/2018/08/31/trump-doesnt-fear-impeachment.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/08/30/ben-affleck.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206/https://www.ibtimes.com/truth-about-jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-planning-renew-wedding-vows-2712787", "title": "Truth About Jennifer Garner, Ben Affleck Planning To Renew Wedding Vows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "jennifer garner, ben affleck, rehab, wedding vows, reconciliation, remarry", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206/https://www.ibtimes.com/truth-about-jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-planning-renew-wedding-vows-2712787", "title": "Truth About Jennifer Garner, Ben Affleck Planning To Renew Wedding Vows", "description": "The fraudulent article claimed Garner has \u201cagreed to give their marriage another shot\u201d after \u201cconvincing\u201d her estranged husband to go back to rehab to treat his alcohol addiction.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/08/30/ben-affleck.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/prithz.paul", "modified_time": "2018-08-30T08:19:27-04:00", "published_time": "2018-08-30T08:19:27-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Truth About Jennifer Garner, Ben Affleck Planning To Renew Wedding Vows", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://www.ibtimes.com/truth-about-jennifer-garner-ben-affleck-planning-renew-wedding-vows-2712787", "description": "The fraudulent article claimed Garner has \u201cagreed to give their marriage another shot\u201d after \u201cconvincing\u201d her estranged husband to go back to rehab to treat his alcohol addiction.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180831115206im_/https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/08/30/ben-affleck.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "The fraudulent article claimed Garner has \u201cagreed to give their marriage another shot\u201d after \u201cconvincing\u201d her estranged husband to go back to rehab to treat his alcohol addiction."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535631567.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
