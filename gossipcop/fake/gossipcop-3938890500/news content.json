She still holds a little animosity and doesn\u2019t really want to spend time with an ex, even when it is only on screen.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Vanessa, 28, isn\u2019t big on the idea of heading to the movies to munch on some popcorn while watching Zac, 29, flaunt his rock hard abs in front of a bunch of swooning members of the audience. Even though the pair split over six years ago, your ex will always be your ex and it is especially hard dealing with your feelings toward that person when they were your first love.\n\nWhether or not Vanessa will be buying a ticket to see Baywatch, we aren\u2019t too worried it\u2019s going to affect its box office performance. The hype surrounding the film has been insane and the powerhouse cast \u2014 who recently all came together for the film\u2019s Miami premiere \u2014 is already reason enough to run to the theater. Along with Zac, Alexandra Daddario, Dwayne Johnson, Priyanka Chopra, Kelly Rohrbach, Ilfenesh Hadera, Jon Bass, Hannibal Buress, David Hasselhoff, Pamela Anderson, Charlotte McKinney, Belinda, and Izabel Goulart are bringing the fun to the flick.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Vanessa\u2019s decision not to go see Baywatch because of Zac\u2019s lack of clothing in the film? Is she being too sensitive, or would you refuse to go too?
