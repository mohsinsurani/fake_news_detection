She\u2019s enjoying the summer in L.A. and doing great.\u201d\n\nKardashian and Bendjima, 25, were going strong as recently as last month, when they took a romantic European vacation joined in part by her three kids. But on Tuesday, a source told PEOPLE the sudden split wasn\u2019t all that amicable \u2014 not to mention the fact that the news broke as photos surfaced of Bendjima getting cozy with another woman in Mexico.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t end well,\u201d the source said.\n\nA second source told PEOPLE that the reality star and model had been having issues since returning from the trip.\n\n\u201cAs soon as their long European vacation was over, they started having problems,\u201d the source said. \u201cYounes was in L.A. recently, and things were not great. He and Kourtney didn\u2019t get along. They decided to take a break, but were not officially over. Now with the pictures of Younes in Mexico, they are definitely not getting back together.\u201d\n\n\u201cKourtney doesn\u2019t play games. She seems okay with [the breakup],\u201d the source added. \u201cYounes was always supposed to be a rebound.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kourtney Kardashian \u2018Trusts\u2019 Sofia Richie with Her and Scott Disick\u2019s Kids: Source\n\nDisick, meanwhile, has been dating 19-year-old Sofia Richie since last fall and briefly opened up about the relationship on Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with Kardashians.\n\n\u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve ever been with anybody other than Kourtney, so it\u2019s definitely different, but it\u2019s been a really good thing for me,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit different for me to talk about what\u2019s going on now. Sometimes I feel guilty that I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne part of me is really happy that I\u2019m able to care about somebody again, but there always is some feeling in the back of me that feels guilty because I\u2019m moving on from Kourtney,\u201d he added.\n\nNevertheless, Disick said he was doing \u201camazing, for like, the first time in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that Kourtney and I have been through a lot. It\u2019s an ongoing struggle, but I think she\u2019s doing well now and I\u2019m happy for her,\u201d he said. \u201cI feel that I\u2019m able to now live my life the way I should.\u201d", "images":
