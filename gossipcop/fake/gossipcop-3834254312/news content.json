If Selena Gomez\u2019s mom was hospitalized over Selena getting back together with Justin Bieber, we can only imagine how she\u2019ll respond to this news.\n\nHonestly, this could leave a lot of fans divided. Or disappointed.\n\nA new report claims that Selena Gomez is pregnant and that Justin Bieber is the baby daddy.\n\nPhoto via Getty\n\nSo, Justin and Selena took a trip to Laguna Beach earlier in February. NW claims that this is when the couple bonded over some big news.\n\n\"The word is that Selena is pregnant and told Justin as much during their trip.\"\n\nThat would be some major news to break.\n\n\"Justin wasn\u2019t expecting it, but he\u2019s ecstatic about it. It\u2019s a dream come true.\"\n\nif he wanted Selena back for good, getting her pregnant sure might work.\n\n\"Pals say they\u2019ve been casual with contraception because they are both keen to make this happen at some point.\"\n\nPhoto via Coach/Instagram\n\nThe report goes on to claim that this is more or less an act of providence.\n\n\"They know there\u2019s never going to be a perfect time, so they\u2019ve been putting their faith in God\u2019s hands.\"\n\nThat claim ties in to Selena\u2019s idea that God blesses her reunion with the Biebs and with Justin recently ending his tour to spend more time at church.\n\nThe report suggests that this accident was a happy one.\n\n\"This is something they both want.\"\n\nThey\u2019re both at odd places in their lives to have a kid, so that\u2019s \u2026 an interesting claim.\n\n\"Selena has always liked the idea of being a young mum and Justin is desperate to settle down.\"\n\nPhoto via instagram\n\nThere were even claims that Selena is following a safe pregnancy checklist, \"steering clear of alcohol, sushi, and soft cheeses to be safe.\"\n\n(Those would be pretty standard precautions for a pregnant woman, and match up with Kim Kardashian\u2019s surrogate\u2019s dietary restrictions)\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Bieber\u2019s side, with claims that he\u2019s \"started following pregnancy accounts on Instagram and posed for photos with a fan\u2019s baby while out in L.A.\"\n\nJustin Bieber follows all kinds of accounts, folks. Also, he\u2019s been posing with babies for years.\n\nBabies are cute. They\u2019re not, um, evidence of more babies.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nIn real life, Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez have been in Jamaica for Justin\u2019s dad\u2019s wedding.\n\nAnd Gossip Cop reports that, also in real life, Selena is not pregnant with Justin\u2019s baby. And probably not with anyone\u2019s.\n\nThe timing for this wouldn\u2019t be great, right?\n\nJustin only recently managed to get out of what was reportedly a life-threatening substance abuse issue.\n\nHis own manager feared that he would die, just a few years ago, if he went on tour.\n\nIn the mean time, Selena Gomez received a kidney transplant just last year. It saved her life but did not cure her Lupus.\n\nUntil very recently, doctors discouraged women with Lupus from getting pregnant, due to risks to their lives and their baby\u2019s. Now, those risks are lower.\n\nBut given the severity of Selena\u2019s health battle, some wonder if a pregnancy would be a fatal mistake.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nNow whatever you may think of Selena falling back into bad habits by dating a man some might characterize as an inked trash gremlin who\u2019s not even hot anymore, we should remember:\n\nThat\u2019s her choice.\n\nFans don\u2019t have to agree with her love life.\n\nBut everyone can breathe a sigh of relief with the report that Selena is not pregnant. Those who admire her music, her acting, and her as a person want her to be around and healthy for a long, long time.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/selena-gomez-at-her-childhood-home.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/08/justin-beiber-a-timeline-of-poontang.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/justin-bieber-shirtless-tattoos.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/selena-gomez-for-coach-760x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-blond-e.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20760%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='760'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20640%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='640'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/justin-bieber-and-selena-gomez-in-2011-640x1024.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20702'%3E%3Crect%20width='600'%20height='702'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/justin-bieber-on-the-beach-720x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-blond-e-320x240.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20568%20699'%3E%3Crect%20width='568'%20height='699'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/wendy-williams-looks-on-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20620%20413'%3E%3Crect%20width='620'%20height='413'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-together-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/selena-gomez-justin-bieber-split-blond-e.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/02/selena-gomez-pregnant-with-justin-biebers-baby/", "title": "Selena Gomez: PREGNANT With Justin Bieber's Baby?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez: PREGNANT With Justin Bieber's Baby?", "description": "Poor Mandy Teefey.
