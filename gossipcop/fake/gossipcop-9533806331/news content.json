It was this beautiful woman just sort of literally tripped and fell into my life.\u201d\n\nMarkle said Harry proposed during a \u201ccozy\u201d night in at his Kensington Palace apartment, where the two were roasting a chicken.\n\n\u201cA standard typical night for us,\u201d Harry added.\n\n\u201cIt was just an amazing surprise. It was so sweet and natural and very romantic. He got on one knee,\u201d said Markle, who immediately accepted.\n\n\u201cAs a matter of fact, I could barely let you finish proposing. I said, \u2018Can I say yes now?\u2019\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cIt was a really nice moment. It was just the two of us,\u201d he said, looking at Markle. \u201cAnd I think I managed to catch you by surprise as well.\u201d\n\nHarry, 33, and Markle, 36, met in early July 2016 on a blind date set up by a mutual friend. The prince had never heard of the actress, who in turn knew only superficially about the royal.\n\nThe two hit it off during two back-to-back dates in London before the royal convinced Markle, who lived and worked in Toronto, to come with him on a trip to Botswana several weeks later.\n\n\u201cWe camped out with each other under the stars,\u201d Harry said of their five days together, which he described as \u201cabsolutely fantastic.\u201d\n\nThe prince proposed to his girlfriend earlier this month with a ring he designed himself that features a pair of diamonds from the personal collection of his late mother, Princess Diana, \u201cto make sure that she\u2019s with us on this crazy journey together.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry designed the engagement ring using two diamonds from Princess Diana's jewelry collection. The center stone is from Botswana, which the prince has visited numerous times since childhood.

AFP - Getty Images\n\nHarry said his mother\u2019s absence is especially striking during this joyous occasion.\n\n\u201cIt is days like today when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news,\u201d he said.\n\nThe happy couple posed during their public debut Monday as an engaged couple at Kensington Palace. Chris Jackson / Getty Images\n\nMarkle said she has met with all of Harry\u2019s immediate family, including several meetings with his grandmother Queen Elizabeth.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s an incredible woman,\u201d Markle said.\n\nThe California native, who moved to Toronto to film the television series \"Suits,\" said she\u2019s gotten to know the royal family quite well during their time together and said she also has met the relatives from his mother's side, too.\n\n\u201cThe family has been great and over the past year and a half, we\u2019ve just had a really nice time getting to know them and progressively helping making me feel a part of, not just the institution, but also part of the family,\u201d she said.\n\nThe pair plan to get married next spring and will live in Nottingham Cottage inside Kensington Palace.\n\nAsked about having children, Harry joked, \"not currently, no,\" before saying the couple hoped to one day.\n\n\"One step at a time,\" he said. \"And hopefully we\u2019ll start a family in the near future.\"", "images":
