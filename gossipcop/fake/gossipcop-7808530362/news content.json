Gossip Cop can handle this story exclusively. A representative confirms that the allegations are both wrong and fabricated.\n\nHollywood Life allegedly claims to have \"exclusive details\" about how Stefani and Shelton \"could renounce an engagement and make the covenant.\" A so-called \"source close to Gwen\" is quoted as saying: \"They talk about it all the time and that's how they live together [sic] as if they were already married.\" This alleged snitch goes on to say, \"With her busy deadline, Gwen even talked to Blake about skipping the engagement and instead just one Beach or somewhere in the country to loft, if the romantic mood is right. \"\n\nObviously, the site is unaware that a couple can be engaged and still run away, so these claims make no sense. In the sense of Dictionary.com \"elope\" means \"secretly run away to be married\". It does not exclude an engagement. It rather means marriage, which is held without knowledge or participation of other people. Of course, this is more than just terminology.\n\nWhile the blog claims that the performers could \"skip\" an engagement, she has already spread several stories about her becoming engaged. If you look at just the last year, there are at least four stories that contradict this current narrative (see screengrabs of the headlines below). For example, in May 2017, the website claimed that Stefani wanted Shelton to suggest that she use her \"The Voice\" downtime to plan a wedding. By October, the store speculated that the country superstar had \"secretly suggested\" and they were engaged after Stefani was seen in a \"giant diamond ring\".\n\nThen in December, there was an article by HollywoodLies, as he's called \"They'll never marry if they're not engaged in 2018\" and continue to say, \"If there's no ring on Gwen's finger by the end of the new year, the couple can take the marriage forever off the table. \" This latest piece, the \"source\" mentioned, calls the marriage between Shelton and Stefani \"inevitable.\" That's not all. In February, the site claimed Shelton was shopping for a diamond ring, which was to be used in a \"Valentine's Day Proposal\".\n\nValentine's Day has clearly come and gone without any suggestion, so HollywoodLies is now pretending it has never made such an assertion or any of the others, so it may offer this new tale to \"skip\" an engagement. But journalism does not work in a vacuum. Consistency shows credibility. And the blog's own story shows that it's not believable. It is also noteworthy that HollywoodLies first alleged Shelton and Stefani broke through in 2015. A similar claim was made last November, and they still did. This also shows that the website is untrustworthy.\n\nAnd that's not all. A few days ago, the outlet uncovered a false cover story Life & Style about Stefani, who is not just pregnant, but is also planning a wedding in Mexico that will feature celebrities such as Jennifer Aniston. This new \"Exclusive\" does not mention pregnancy and does not explain what happened to the supposed plans for a star wedding. Regardless of whether the publication claims there will be a wedding or a secret ceremony, HollywoodLies is still wrong. Less than a month ago, it was reported that Stefani and Shelton are unwilling to marry and are so happy with their relationship.\n\nSo, both scenarios are wrong: They're not planning a big wedding or talking about Eloping. Stefani's representative already said Gossip Cop earlier this week that the wedding (and pregnancy) allegations were \"untrue\" and now the spokesman confirmed to us that this new story is fake and fake. On the basis of all the evidence sketched here by Gossip Cop that should be very clear.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220816023119im_/https://s4.gossipcop.com/up/2018/04/Stefani-Shelton-Elope-HL-Headlines.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220816023119im_/https://www.gossipcop.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Gwen-Stefani-Blake-Shelton-Engagement-Eloping.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220816023119im_/https://s1.gossipcop.com/up/2018/04/Gwen-Stefani-Blake-Shelton-Engagement-Eloping-544x395.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220816023119im_/https://s2.gossipcop.com/up/2018/04/Stefani-Shelton-Engaged-Proposal-HL-Headlines-331x395.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220816023119im_/https://newsbeezer.com/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220816023119im_/https://newsbeezer.com/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton does not skip the engagement to Elope, despite the report \u2013 NewsBeezer", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.9.1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
