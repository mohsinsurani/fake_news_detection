Because that\u2019s the icon and queen she is.\n\nStewart, who serves as a member of the festival\u2019s jury this year, walked the red carpet on the way to a screening of Spike Lee\u2019s new film BlacKkKlansman.\n\nWearing a pair of Christian Louboutin stilettos, she promptly took them off after posing for photos and walked the rest of the red carpet barefoot.\n\nIt\u2019s a great moment in and of itself. However, it gets even better when you remember Cannes has a heels-only rule for red carpet screenings.\n\nIt\u2019s no joke \u2014 women were turned away from a screening of Carol in 2015 because their shoes\u2019 heels weren\u2019t tall enough.\n\nBut when Stewart decided it was time for the shows to come off, that\u2019s exactly what she did.\n\n\u2018Things need to change\u2019\n\nStewart has talked about Cannes\u2019 antiquated rules before.\n\nShe told Vanity Fair in 2016: \u2018Things have to change immediately.\n\n\u2018It has become really obvious that if [a man and I] were walking the red carpet together and someone stopped me and said, \u201cExcuse me, young lady, you\u2019re not wearing heels. You cannot come in.\u201d Then [I\u2019m going to say], \u201cNeither is my friend. Does he have to wear heels?\u201d It can work both ways.\u2019\n\nThat same year, Julia Roberts also went barefoot.\n\nMany people love Stewart\u2019s move \u2014 and how could they not?\n\nKristen

can\u2019t ask me either.\" \u2013 Kristen Stewart, via @glamourmag #AskHerMore #Cannes2018 pic.twitter.com/OCnhzggoTk \u2014 Miss Representation (@RepresentPledge) May 14, 2018\n\nNot to mention all the wonderful photos of Stewart and Cate Blanchett that people are dying over.\n\nWhat gay goddess did y\u2019all pray to make these pictures of Cate Blanchett and Kristen Stewart happen
