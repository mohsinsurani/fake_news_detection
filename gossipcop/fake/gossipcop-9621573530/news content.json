Underwood also injured her face badly and needed roughly 40 stitches. As if that weren\u2019t enough, the singer and her husband, Mike Fisher, have been fighting nasty family and breakup rumors for years, which only intensified after her fall. People began questioning if she and Fisher were headed for splitsville.\n\nHere are some of the outrageous rumors \u2014 including a nasty one about Mike Fisher (on Page 4!) \u2014 you should stop believing about this celebrity couple.\n\nUnderwood locked her son and dogs in a hot car\n\nThis rumor came about in 2015, when Underwood made news for breaking the window of her locked car to get her son, Isaiah, and dogs out of the hot vehicle. Underwood tweeted that her dogs somehow locked the doors. But not everyone was buying her explanation and started saying maybe she pushed the button accidentally and locked everyone in as she was stepping out.\n\nAccidents obviously do happen, and there is no evidence of anything else occurring other than what she said. So there\u2019s no reason to believe she was lying about it.\n\nNext: Did a daytime talk show host start this rumor?\n\n\n\nUnderwood had a face lift, and her injury is a cover-up\n\nIn January 2018, after Underwood\u2019s admission that she may not look the same since her fall, talk show host Wendy Williams suggested that the country star didn\u2019t injure her face but instead had a face lift.\n\n\u201cShe [Carrie] released on Twitter that we may not recognize her when it\u2019s all said and done. I don\u2019t know what that means \u2026 an excuse for a face lift,\u201d Williams said during her Hot Topics segment.\n\nShe then backed off after the harsh comment saying, \u201cNo \u2026 We\u2019re cynical! She was already cute, so I don\u2019t know what she\u2019s doing or what happened.\u201d\n\nNext: She looks completely different.\n\nShe\u2019s unrecognizable since her fall\n\nSo how different will the star look next time we see her? Well, at least one person took a photo with her and didn\u2019t notice any change.\n\nIn fact, Below Deck alum Adrienne Gang thought Underwood looked \u201cgreat\u201d when she saw her working out in a gym at a resort. The Bravo star spoke to Us Weekly about their encounter on Dec. 12.\n\nI had no idea she got hurt prior to meeting her. She had a wrist brace on, but I didn\u2019t think much of it until I saw the headlines after I posted our picture together. She looked great and seemed to be in great spirits. I didn\u2019t notice anything amiss on her face. Simply, she looked lovely.\n\nNext: Ugly accusations against Mike Fisher\n\n\n\nFisher caused Underwood\u2019s fall\n\nAnother vicious rumor that swirled about the couple after the songbird\u2019s fall is that Fisher pushed her down, causing her injury.\n\nBut those who are accusing her husband of domestic violence are ignoring the fact that he wasn\u2019t even home when Underwood fell. Therefore, he obviously didn\u2019t push her.\n\nFisher did fly home as soon as he heard about her accident and thanked all their fans for the well wishes and support while she recovered.\n\nNext: Is their marriage on the rocks?\n\n\n\nTheir marriage is in trouble, and they\u2019re living separate lives\n\nThere comes a time in almost every celebrity couple\u2019s relationship when, unfortunately, they have to deal with made up rumors that their marriage is in trouble.\n\nIn 2017, an unnamed source told a not-so-reliable site that the \u201cJesus Take the Wheel\u201d artist and hockey player\u2019s marriage was in \u201cperil.\u201d The source said they had grown apart and were having problems, even living separate lives. \u201cBetween their careers, Carrie and Mike are so busy that they\u2019re barely together \u2014 and unfortunately, their problems run much deeper than that,\u201d the source claimed.\n\nThere has never been any proof that this story was true or that this source knew what they were talking about. So we\u2019ll just call it what it is: a rumor.\n\nNext: Did Underwood force Fisher to retire?\n\nUnderwood wanted another baby and forced Fisher to retire\n\nIn 2017, Fisher retired from the NHL after spending 17 seasons in the league with Ottawa Senators and Nashville Predators. Soon after his decision was announced, reports claimed Underwood forced him to retire because she wanted to work on their marriage and try for baby No. 2.\n\nGossip Cop busted this rumor, pointing out the so-called source only had second-hand knowledge of this.:\u201dI heard that she had become really unhappy with the situation. Having Mike home will be one solution, and I believe she hopes that having another baby together will bring them even closer than when they first fell in love.\u201d\n\nThis story had no truth to it, especially because Fisher didn\u2019t stay retired long.\n\nNext: Is Underwood upset that Fisher came out of retirement?\n\n\n\nThe singer is unhappy with her husband\u2019s decision to return to ice\n\nIn 2018, Fisher came out of retirement and rejoined the Predators. So a tabloid used that story and spun it, claiming Underwood was upset about his decision to return to the league.\n\nHowever, the posts she put on Instagram when he decided to go back point to the contrary. The \u201cBefore He Cheats\u201d singer posted an image of a T-shirt with her hubby\u2019s face on it that reads, \u201cThe Fish is back!\u201d She also posted about how \u201cproud\u201d she is of him and hopes he can bring home the Stanley Cup.\n\nESPN even reported that it was Underwood who encouraged her man to return to the ice.\n\nNext: Are they splitting up?\n\n\n\nThe couple is getting a divorce\n\nDivorce rumors popped up again in February 2018, and this time, Fisher set the record straight. After In Touch magazine reported they were going to end their marriage, the story gained legs when Fisher posted something to social media.\n\nThe NHL star posted a quote from Psalm 139:23-24 which read, \u201cSearch me, God, and know my heart; test me and know my anxious thoughts. See if there is any offensive way in me, and lead me in the way of everlasting.\u201d\n\nA fan then posted they would be \u201cpraying\u201d for the couple and hoped they could get past their troubles. Fisher shut down the rumor right then and there by responding, writing, \u201cWe\u2019ve never been better. Thanks.\u201d\n\nFollow Michelle Kapusta on Twitter @philamichelle.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-804329930.jpg?w=640&h=450", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Untitled.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mike-Fisher-and-Carrie-Underwood.jpg?w=640&h=437", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mike-Fisher.jpg?w=640&h=426", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mike-FIsher-and-Carrie-Underwood-in-Tennessee.jpg?w=640&h=426", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/25017737_347318129076114_2909506714275414016_n.jpg?w=650&h=507", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-804329930-640x450.jpg?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mike-Fisher-and-Carrie-Underwood-2.jpg?w=640&h=438", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mike-Fisher-and-Carrie-Underwood-1.jpg?w=640&h=425", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-804329930-640x450.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Kapusta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/rumors-about-carrie-underwood-and-mike-fisher-you-should-stop-believing.html/", "title": "Rumors About Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher You Should Stop Believing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "After Carrie Underwood was badly injured in a fall outside her home, she and her hubby Mike Fisher's personal lives have become the target of nasty rumors.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rumors About Carrie Underwood and Mike Fisher You Should Stop Believing", "description": "After Carrie Underwood was badly injured in a fall outside her home, she and her hubby Mike Fisher's personal lives have become the target of nasty rumors.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/rumors-about-carrie-underwood-and-mike-fisher-you-should-stop-believing.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/GettyImages-804329930-640x450.jpg?w=1200"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "published_time": "2018-06-07T17:42:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-03T18:57:25+00:00"}, "author": "Michelle Kapusta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilaMichelle", "site": "@cheatsheet", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Michelle Kapusta", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "6 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528393320.0, "source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
