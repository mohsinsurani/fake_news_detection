Multiple sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly that Tom Cruise has had essentially \u201cno contact\u201d with the 10-year-old daughter he shares with ex-wife Katie Holmes.\n\n\u201cTom hasn\u2019t seen or even called Suri in about three years,\u201d claims a family source. Alleges another insider, \u201cTom has no relationship with Suri.\u201d\n\nIn fact, the last time Cruise, 54, and his youngest daughter were photographed publicly was in August 2012, when he took her to Disney\u2019s Typhoon Lagoon Water Park in Lake Buena Vista, Florida. (Cruise has two older children, Connor, 21, and Isabella, 23, with his second ex-wife, Nicole Kidman.)\n\nHolmes, 37, and Cruise, a devout Scientologist, began dating in the spring of 2005 and announced their engagement that June. They welcomed Suri the following April, and tied the knot in front of more than 150 guests at a lavish wedding at the 15th-century Odescalchi Castle in Bracciano, Italy, on November 18, 2006.\n\nSix years later, in June 2012, Holmes filed for divorce. At the time, an insider told Us Holmes didn\u2019t want her daughter raised in Scientology and homeschooled by church teachers: \u201cShe wanted Suri to go to a normal school with regular kids.\u201d In the years since, NYC-based Holmes and Suri have since been \u201cexcommunicated\u201d from Cruise\u2019s life because of his religion, according to the family source. (The insider adds that Cruise \u201cstill sees\u201d Connor and Isabella, who are both church members.)\n\nMany ex-Scientologists have claimed leaders force members to shun anyone who leaves the church. But a rep for the Church of Scientology tells Us, \u201cWe never comment on individual parishioners\u2019 lives. On the issue of Church religious practices, we do not know who your anonymous sources are, but they got it all wrong. The answer to your question is no. Scientologists respect the faith of others, associate with and befriend members of every religion. Scientologists do not cut ties with non-Scientologist friends or family members because they have chosen another religion. Given that Scientology is a new religion, Scientologists often have family members and friends who are not Scientologists and who may practice another faith or no faith at all. This causes no conflict for Scientologists.\u201d\n\nCruise\u2019s rep had no comment.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/867976b3a25_suri-cruise-tom-cruise-zoom-b960c464-9692-44c5-a489-cc7db5b53f2f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/867976b3a25_suri-cruise-tom-cruise-zoom-b960c464-9692-44c5-a489-cc7db5b53f2f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Eric Andersson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tom-cruise-reportedly-hasnt-seen-daughter-suri-in-years-w434605/", "title": "Tom Cruise Reportedly Hasn\u2019t Seen Daughter Suri in \u2018About Three Years\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Tom Cruise has not seen 10-year-old daughter Suri in 'about three years,' a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tom Cruise Reportedly Hasn't Seen Daughter Suri in 'About Three Years'", "description": "Tom Cruise has not seen 10-year-old daughter Suri in 'about three years,' a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details!", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/tom-cruise-reportedly-hasnt-seen-daughter-suri-in-years-w434605/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:32:22+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/867976b3a25_suri-cruise-tom-cruise-zoom-b960c464-9692-44c5-a489-cc7db5b53f2f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/867976b3a25_suri-cruise-tom-cruise-zoom-b960c464-9692-44c5-a489-cc7db5b53f2f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2016-08-17T12:07:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:32:22+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tom Cruise Reportedly Hasn't Seen Daughter Suri in 'About Three Years'", "description": "Tom Cruise has not seen 10-year-old daughter Suri in 'about three years,' a source reveals in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/867976b3a25_suri-cruise-tom-cruise-zoom-b960c464-9692-44c5-a489-cc7db5b53f2f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1471435620.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
