While the source said the friendship is not romantic in nature, Pitt is \u201cinterested in spending more time\u201d with Oxman.\n\nA rep for the actor declined to comment to PageSix, but a friend of Pitt\u2019s told the outlet that the two are \u201cjust friends.\u201d\n\nThe duo reportedly met through an MIT architecture project. While the nature of the project is unknown, Pitt is a noted architecture enthusiast and founded the Make It Right Foundation, which builds affordable and environmentally friendly homes in New Orleans for people in need.\n\nTim P. Whitby/Getty; Jacopo Raule/Getty\n\nBrad Pitt and Neri Oxman.\n\nOxman is an award-winning architect of American-Israeli decent. She was previously married to Argentine composer Osvaldo Golijov. According to her MIT profile, Oxman \u201ccoined the term, and pioneered the field of, Material Ecology, which considers computation, fabrication, and the material itself as inseparable dimensions of design. In this approach, products and buildings are biologically informed and digitally engineered by, with and for, nature.\u201d\n\nPitt has been mostly keeping a low profile since his September 2016 split from Angelina Jolie. The duo have been negotiating over the terms of their divorce and custody of their six kids \u2014 Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 9.\n\nLately, the actor \u201cseems to be in a better place,\u201d a source told PEOPLE in March. \u201cThe separation was very dark for him, but lately he looks healthier and happier. He seems excited about life.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Brad Pitt Is \u2018in a Better Place\u2019 Amid Divorce Proceedings with Angelina Jolie: Source\n\nLast year, a source told PEOPLE that Pitt has been \u201ccasually dating,\u201d adding, \u201cHe has been going out but there is nothing serious in the dating area at all, nothing to speak of at this point.\n\nPitt is also revving up his acting career: He signed on alongside Leonardo DiCaprio for Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming (and controversial) film Once Upon a Time in Hollywood, about the 1969 Manson Family murders.\n\nThe production will feature DiCaprio as Rick Dalton, the former star of a western TV series, and Pitt as his longtime stunt double Cliff Booth.
