I hadn\u2019t yet gotten my period and was happily running around a state fair with my best friend, mouth full of cotton candy, when it hit me: a steady drum of pain beneath my pubic bone, a throbbing in my back that made its way down both my legs. I fell to the muddy ground. Suddenly the Ferris wheel was a nightmare, the carnival games distorted and unpleasant. I blacked out.\n\nAt the E.R. they told me it could\u2019ve been a reaction to bad chicken (sure) and sent me home with Pepto-Bismol. Thus began a 15-year routine of pain, questions and nonanswers that would continue until I was found to have endometriosis at age 27. (This delay is not unusual, and the average woman suffers for years before she is given a diagnosis.) My only savior during much of that time? Oral contraception.\n\nImage Lena Dunham in New York City earlier this year. Credit... Hilary Swift for The New York Times\n\nBirth control pills are many women\u2019s method of choice for preventing unintended pregnancy and should be covered by all insurance policies for that reason alone. But for millions of women living with endometriosis, polycystic ovarian syndrome, cystic acne, migraines, uterine abnormalities and a history of ectopic pregnancies, birth control can be a crucial, even lifesaving, medical treatment. While there is no cure for endometriosis, hormonal contraception can control pain and bleeding by stopping or significantly shortening the length of a woman\u2019s period. It helps keep women with the disease happy, healthy and able to work. Considering how little money the government puts into endometriosis research (last year, the National Institutes of Health allocated around $10 million of its $32 billion budget to it), it\u2019s clear that our country already has a dangerous disregard for women with this common condition. But imagine if this disease that affects about one in 10 women of reproductive age were allowed to progress unhindered. Imagine losing these women\u2019s essential contributions to our world because of a treatable illness.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/10/opinion/10dunham/10dunham-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/10/opinion/10dunhamWeb/10dunhamWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=de5a03739c4c43167b23b17603aedd7dba8af2a2355ca5849715e5519c26136c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/10/opinion/10dunhamWeb/10dunhamWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=de5a03739c4c43167b23b17603aedd7dba8af2a2355ca5849715e5519c26136c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lena Dunham"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/09/opinion/lena-dunham-losing-birth-control-could-mean-a-life-of-pain.html", "title": "Lena Dunham: Losing Birth Control Could Mean a Life of Pain - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "As I deal with endometriosis, oral contraception has been my savior.
