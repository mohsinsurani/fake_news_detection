When Kris Jenner is exhausted in bed with too much on her plate, Kim Kardashian proves that she can take over her mom\u2019s job in a pinch, as seen in a preview for Keeping Up With the Kardashians\u2018 season 12 finale on Sunday, November 20.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve joked a lot that I could be my sisters\u2019 manager better than my mom could be,\u201d Kardashian reveals. \u201cI think I do give a lot of good creative input, and I know they, like, listen.\u201d\n\nHer big talk is put to the test when she volunteers to help out her mom with scheduling an Australia event for Kylie Jenner. However, Kris isn\u2019t so sure Kardashian can handle the workload. \u201cIt\u2019s a lot of details,\u201d Kris warns her daughter. \u201cYou\u2019d probably lose focus in five minutes.\u201d\n\nStill, Kardashian is unfazed by Kris\u2019 doubts. \u201cWhy don\u2019t you just chill? I\u2019ll help you,\u201d she tells her mom, adding that Kylie will need security and one person to do hair and makeup. \u201cHave them pay for hotel, flights and a fee,\u201d she instructs, showing off her knowledge of management.\n\nKris, 61, assures the Selfish author, 36, that the job isn\u2019t as easy as it seems: \u201cIt\u2019s \u2018take care of your own travel,\u2019 so I would need you to get on the phone with a travel agent,\u201d she explains.\n\nDoes this scare Kardashian? Absolutely not, as she fires back without hesitation, \u201cLet me get her on the phone,\u201d already dialing the number for the travel agent.\n\n\u201cI feel like I could totally handle this,\u201d Kardashian quips about Kris\u2019 position as momager. Clearly she knows what she\u2019s talking about.\n\nSee the clip above, and watch the Keeping Up With the Kardashians season 12 finale on E!
