Well, turns out it's all a load of nonsense.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAccording to New Idea magazine, sources said the 53-year-old supermodel was spotted with the actor, also 53, at a nightclub in Hollywood.\n\n\"They definitely seemed cosy together, like a couple on an intimate date,\" the source claimed. \"She was touching his arm a lot and flicking her hair over her shoulder - there was a lot of flirting going on.'\n\n\"He was laughing at everything she said and leaning in really close,\" they added.\n\nBrad Pitt\u2019s rep has said that the report is \u201cnot true,\u201d and that the actor and Macpherson are not dating.\n\nIt could have been a dreamy coupling; Macpherson and Pitt first met on the set of Friends in 1999, when Brad guest starred on his then-wife Jennifer Aniston's hit show.\n\nSince his split with Angelina Jolie, Brad has also been linked to Sienna Miller.\n\nApparently that's untrue, too. Perhaps he's just a single guy.\n\nBrad, call us.", "images": ["http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-header.b4cc6108dd2e242eb0e486e2c46c586c606e48ac.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138c58a8cb9467036e1082e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/BradPitt-elle-gl-27jun17_getty_.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633d4f71c9c24f196eabe2ab/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/631fc469129fb59251ad57d5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138c58a54a5dc97887ea41d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brad-pitt-elle-macpherson--26jun17-getty-bb.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/613898115ebdbf876576b0f0/16:9/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jesy-nelson_glamour_4oct17_p.jpg", "http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.3f0191bfffefe68806346fb250bf5976c111a9de.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6321a081d60e59460f596eb4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.b4cc6108dd2e242eb0e486e2c46c586c606e48ac.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633d4dd9c9c24f196eabe2a8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138c58a8cb9467036e1082e/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/BradPitt-elle-gl-27jun17_getty_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6138c58a8cb9467036e1082e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/BradPitt-elle-gl-27jun17_getty_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/article/brad-pitt-elle-macpherson-dating-relationship-news", "title": "Are Brad Pitt & Elle Macpherson dating?
