Well, according to our source, the bombshell is taking some time to heal. Here\u2019s the EXCLUSIVE details!\n\nAlthough it\u2019s been nearly a month since Chris Pratt, 38, and Anna Faris, 40, announced that they had decided to end their marriage, the wound is still very fresh! These two seemed perfect for each other! Now, as we attempt to move forward, we\u2019re learning new details on how the actress is managing the painful change. And according to our insider, dating is the last thing on her mind! Take a look back at the adorable former couple right here!\n\n\u201cAnna and Chris\u2019 decision to separate was a long-time coming, it wasn\u2019t a rash decision,\u201d a source close to Anna tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThey tried to make it work for a long time, but it just wasn\u2019t doable. They grew apart, and Chris changed a lot as his career became more and more successful; they just found themselves in completely different places and in the end they fell out of love. It\u2019s highly unlikely they will ever get back together again. It was a tough decision to break up, and it took a lot of soul-searching on both sides. But it really was for the best, for them and for their son [Jack Pratt, 5].\u201d Absolutely gut-wrenching.\n\nOur insider went on to add that the Scary Movie star is focusing on taking care of herself and being a good mother during this difficult period. \u201cThey really want to keep things as amicable as possible, and hope that once the drama of the divorce is over, they will be able to maybe forge some kind of friendship, but as far as romance is involved, that\u2019s really not in the cards. Right now, Anna has no desire to start dating, she\u2019s totally focused on her son and on healing her heart. She would like to stay single for at least a year so she can regroup and get her head together. Meeting somebody else is really not on the agenda for her, she just needs some \u2018me time\u2019 right now.\u201d Totally understandable considering the jarring circumstances.\n\nHollywoodLifers, is Anna making the right choice by pressing pause on new relationships?
