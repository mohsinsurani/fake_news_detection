(seen in her latest new Instagram post)\n\n'It opened doors for me to experience spiritually, to find another true meaning. This is who I am.'\n\nShe said however that she was attacked after that picture was released in the media.\n\n'They crucified me for it in America. They made me seem like Satan. I was a bad person for holding that Quran,' said Lohan.\n\nShe said that she was then happy to leave and return to London because she felt unsafe in [her] country.\n\nLohan spent time in October of last year visiting child refugees who had fled Syria and crossed over into Turkey.\n\nShe told Page Six last month that she was hoping to return to Turkey again either before of after the start of the new year.\n\n'The dates are not set yet. It depends on how Turkey feels after the recent terrorist attack in Istanbul,' said Lohan,\n\n'Not that any attack has or will ever stop me from helping those suffering, those who need our help the most.'\n\nShe then added: 'I miss my family a lot, but they are very supportive and understanding of the fact that my main focus is business, writing and soon to start another film. More so, my work with refugees.'\n\nJust a few days before her account was wiped clean in January 2017, Lindsay had shared a poem in which she said she wanted to 'fix ISIS minds'.\n\n'Sometimes I hear the voice of the one I loved the most. But in this world we live in on terror,' the poem went.\n\n'Who i am to be the girl who is scared and hurt, when most things that happen i cannot explain.\n\n'I try to understand, when i'm sitting in bed alone at 3am. So i can't sleep, i roll over. I can't think and my body becomes cold. I immediately feel older.....\n\n'Than [sic] i realize, at least I am in a bed. I am still alive. So what can really be said? Just go to bed and close the blinds.\n\n'Still and son on, i cannot help but want to fix all of these idle isis minds because, there has to be something i can figure out.\n\n'Rather than living in a world of fear and doubt, they now shoot, we used to shout\n\n'If only i can keep trying to fix it all, i would keep the world living loving and small. 'I would share my smiles and give too Many kisses.'", "images": ["http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/d08_standard/public/im/InstagramLindsay.jpg?itok=00yHbSJY", "http://www.albawaba.com/themes/custom/abn/logo-print.png", "http://www.albawaba.com/themes/custom/abn/logo-new.png", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/d02_traditional/public/2022-08/Dimona.png?h=10d202d3&itok=hdLasNPT", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/d02_traditional/public/2022-08/Vienna.png?h=3309c922&itok=X98G4xau", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/im/Linsday_Instagram1.jpg", "https://images.dmca.com/Badges/_dmca_premi_badge_4.png?ID=10df430b-fab6-4076-a8d3-f7f8b6c4abed", "https://logo.albawaba.com/logos/small/1742.png", "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/im/InstagramLindsay.jpg?itok=DlDbZoX3", "http://www.albawaba.com/themes/custom/abn/images/footer-logo.png", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/d02_traditional/public/2022-08/afp.com-20220629-PH-GTY-1241599143-preview.jpg?h=69f2b9d0&itok=3wryhBbN", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/d02_traditional/public/2022-08/Capture.JPG?h=7ab39456&itok=NZ-q-fh3", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/d02_traditional/public/2022-08/lebanon_45.jpg?h=6d2f9379&itok=0ER4XxTC", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/im/Laura.jpg", "http://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/im/Lindsay1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.albawaba.com/sites/default/files/styles/default/public/im/InstagramLindsay.jpg?itok=DlDbZoX3", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.albawaba.com/entertainment/did-lindsay-lohan-convert-to-islam%3F-1091090", "title": "Did Lindsay Lohan Convert to Islam?", "meta_data": {"mrf": {"canonical": "CanonicalURL"}, "referrer": "origin", "rights": "\u00a92022 Al Bawaba.
