But even though the 43-year-old radio personality and producer says he believes in marriage thanks to his parent's long-lasting union, he still has some hesitations, he told co-host Kelly Ripa.\n\n\"I've never been engaged, I do believe I would,\" he told Kelly Ripa on their morning show earlier this year. \"I did get close, and I didn't do it and it was the right move, but I love the idea of marriage because my parents have been married for 47 years.\"\n\nBut despite his admiration of his parents' relationship, he admits he's still reluctant to settle down. \"The truth is, I don't want to screw it up,\" he said. \"And a lot of times, [marriages] get screwed up, so I figured the longer I wait, the older I'll be, the closer to death I am, so I can get it in and not screw it up.\"\n\nThe talk show host has dated quite a few famous women before\u2014most notably Julianne Hough, Adriana Lima, and Teri Hatcher. But earlier this year, he got back together and moved in with ex-girlfriend Shayna\u2014and he hasn't been shy about gushing over her on Live. Shayna even appeared on the talk show this past fall to share her healthy banana bread recipe with viewers. \"[I'm] proud and excited to have her here,\" Ryan said while introducing her.\n\nWe're betting we'll see these two back together on our TV screens on Sunday ringing in the new year, when Ryan hosts Dick Clark's New Year's Rockin' Eve with Ryan Seacrest.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/52/1024x1024/square-1514402586-ryan-seacrest-shayna-taylor.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/self-help-books-for-women-sbs-1639073529.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2022-10-04-at-6-56-18-am-1664880997.png?crop=0.468xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/52/2048x1024/landscape-1514402586-ryan-seacrest-shayna-taylor.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2022-10-03-at-9-50-30-am-1664805087.png?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.308xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/5d1519db-faa6-41ec-8472-cb38226b737d_1516809727.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/today-show-jenna-bush-hager-orange-dress-instagram-1661459888.jpg?crop=0.465xw:0.310xh;0.313xw,0.175xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/5903b988d5593031ace8d661/thumb_1493416333.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/christmas-riddles-1663695421.jpg?crop=0.671xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/andie-macdowell-walks-the-runway-during-the-le-defile-walk-news-photo-1664898915.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rob-lowe-career-news-1650899322.jpg?crop=0.548xw:0.820xh;0.234xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-andrew-duke-of-york-and-prince-charles-prince-of-news-photo-1663937056.jpg?crop=0.750xw:1.00xh;0.126xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-duchess-of-sussex-and-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-news-photo-1664193518.jpg?crop=0.675xw:1.00xh;0.173xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/britains-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-his-wife-meghan-news-photo-1664196431.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kelly-ripa-leaves-live-ryan-seacrest-news-update-1664392866.jpg?crop=0.502xw:0.334xh;0.231xw,0.100xh&resize=180:*", "http://www.womansday.com/_assets/design-tokens/womansday/static/images/logos/network-logo.77e98e3.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/new-royal-family-portrait-10-1-1664658555.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.881xh;0,0.0901xh&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/wdy.h-cdn.co/assets/17/52/2048x1024/landscape-1514402586-ryan-seacrest-shayna-taylor.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.womansday.com/life/entertainment/news/a60990/who-does-ryan-seacrest-date/", "title": "Ryan Seacrest Opens Up About Why He's Never Been Engaged", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Who Does Ryan Seacrest Date?
