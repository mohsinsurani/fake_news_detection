But are they ready to live together!?\n\nMaybe it just took loads of trial and error, but it looks like Selena Gomez, 25, and Justin Bieber, 23, have finally arrived at a mature relationship that actually works for them! The \u201cWhat Do You Mean?\u201d singer appears willing to do whatever it takes to make it work this time! But are they ready to take the next step? You know, living together? Now, thanks to our sources, we\u2019ve got some clues on what to expect from this pair! Take a look back at their relationship over the years right here!\n\n\u201cSelena and Justin know better than to pay any attention to rumors about them and their relationship, they\u2019re used to people constantly speculating and they just ignore it,\u201d an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cTheir relation is very important to them, and they share very traditional values when it comes to family and children, so they want to make sure they have a stable and committed home life together. It is something they are committed to in the future, though.\u201d OMG! Because they\u2019re waiting to take this step, we are totally starting to believe they might actually last this time!\n\nAs we previously reported, Sel is really getting attached this time around. \u201cJustin has grown, matured, and become a better person and as a result, things are better than ever between them,\u201d a source previously told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe [Selena] loves how Justin supports her and goes to her Pilates classes and other things she is into. And in return, she is totally down to support him at his hockey games, his dad\u2019s wedding, and everything else important in his life. They are doing everything together and things are really working this time around.\u201d So cute!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you loving these juicy details as much as us?!
