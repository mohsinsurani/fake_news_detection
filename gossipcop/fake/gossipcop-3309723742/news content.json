And while Harry has chosen big brother Prince William as his best man, Meghan has decided not to have a maid of honor.\n\n\u201cShe has a very close-knit circle of friends and she didn\u2019t want to choose one over another,\u201d a palace spokesman said on Friday. \u201cAll have been actively involved in helping her prepare for the day and will be there in the days beforehand. She\u2019s very happy to have their support.\u201d\n\nMeghan will not have a traditional American-style bridal party \u2014 royal weddings usually have younger attendants who serve as page boys and bridesmaids. The palace revealed that Meghan will be joined by her little bridal party members (Prince George and Princess Charlotte are expected to have roles!) before she walks into the chapel. The names of her page boys and bridesmaids will be released in the days before the wedding.\n\nMatt Dunham/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWhile it was speculated that she might have a maid of honor \u2014 as sister-in-law-to-be Kate Middleton did with her own sister, Pippa Middleton \u2014 Meghan has chosen to have her closest friends by her side on her big day in an unofficial capacity. So, who is a member of that inner circle?\n\nMeghan Markle and Jessica Mulroney. George Pimentel/WireImage\n\nJessica Mulroney, who is among Meghan\u2019s closest friends from Toronto, is a stylist who is married to the son of former Canadian Prime Minister Brian Mulroney. She has become Meghan\u2019s go-to gal for all things fashion, coordinating her pre and post-Harry looks. We also know she already has Harry\u2019s stamp of approval: The trio hung out in a private box (along with pal Markus Anderson and Meghan\u2019s mom Doria Ragland) at the 2017 Invictus Games in Toronto.\n\nCasey Kelbaugh\n\nMeghan and Lindsay Roth met as students at Northwestern University and have been friends for over a decade. \u201cWe\u2019re the kind of friends who can be 3,000 miles away and still be talking about or thinking the same thing, and even texting each other the same thing at the same time miles away,\u201d Roth told PEOPLE of her friendship with Markle in March 2017. Meghan was also Roth\u2019s own maid of honor a few years back.\n\nAndrew Toth/Getty Images\n\nFashion designer Misha Nonoo, who was previously married to Alexander Gilkes, a friend of Harry\u2019s, is rumored to have been the mystery matchmaker who set up Meghan and Harry on a blind date in July 2016. (The other woman who reportedly might have introduced the pair is mutual friend Violet von Westenholz.) She first met Meghan at a lunch in Miami, and they quickly became fast friends. \u201cI love her to death,\u201d Nonoo told the Evening Standard. \u201cShe is the coolest girl in the world.\u201d\n\nMeghan\u2019s good friend, actress Priyanka Chopra, had already confirmed she wasn\u2019t a bridesmaid, but she is attending the wedding \u2014 and even admitted she hasn\u2019t found a dress yet! \u201cI\u2019m more stressed out about those little hats! How do those things stay [on]?\u201d she admitted on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen on Thursday.", "images":
