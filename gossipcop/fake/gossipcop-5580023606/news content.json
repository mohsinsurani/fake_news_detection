This decision was mutual and lovingly made at the end of last year. We are two best friends who have decided to part ways as a couple, but look forward to continuing our cherished friendship.\u201d\n\nBefore the announcement, Aniston, 48, and Theroux, 46, seemed to thrive despite their frequent time on separate coasts. Both have been busy professionally this past year, with Aniston signing on for a new Apple TV series alongside Reese Witherspoon, and Theroux filming the comedy The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest.\n\nThe couple seemed happy celebrating the start of 2018 together with their annual vacation to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico. \u201cJen and Justin rang in the new year with friends. For the past few days, they have enjoyed the sunny Cabo weather,\u201d a source said of their trip, where they were joined by a handful of close pals including Jason Bateman and his family.\n\n\u201cThey have hosted friends by the pool and for dinner,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey both seem great and very happy.\u201d\n\nBut in the following months, Aniston and Theroux\u2019s marriage began to fall apart. Below, a timeline of the actors\u2019 split:\n\nFeb. 7: Aniston Shows Off Their Bel Air Estate\n\nAniston took Architectural Digest readers on a tour of the $21 million mansion she and Theroux purchased together in 2011.\n\nArchDigest/Francois Dischinger\n\n\u201cThere was a time when I thought there was something romantic about picking up and trotting off somewhere different every three months,\u201d Aniston recently told the outlet.\n\nRELATED GALLERY: The Sweetest Things Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux Said About Each Other\n\n\u201cI look around at my husband and my dogs and our home, and there\u2019s nowhere else I want to be.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jennifer Aniston \u2018Has Seemed Fine\u2019 Since Split from Justin Theroux, Will \u2018Continue to Be Friends\u2019\n\nFeb. 10: Aniston Attends Ellen DeGeneres Party\n\nThe actress mingled with the A-list crowd at DeGeneres\u2019 60th birthday party. She attended the event solo but appeared to be in good spirits throughout the night. Aniston was even seen laughing and chatting with Pharell outside of the party.\n\nFeb. 11: Aniston\u2019s Birthday\n\nThe couple\u2019s decision to split comes just days after the actress\u2019s 49th birthday, which she and Theroux spent apart. Aniston celebrated in Malibu, California with a gathering alongside pals Courteney Cox, Andrea Bendewald, Leigh Kilton-Smith and Kristin Hahn on Sunday.\n\nAleen Keshishian/Instagram\n\nTheroux, meanwhile, was spotted out in New York City on Friday walking his dog. Last year, the duo vacationed together in Los Cabos, Mexico with friends.\n\nFeb. 13: Aniston Attends Amy Schumer\u2019s Wedding Solo\n\nThe actress was among the star-studded guest list at Schumer\u2019s surprise wedding to boyfriend Chris Fischer.

Theroux was once again spotted walking his dog alone on the romantic holiday.\n\nThe couple spent Feb. 14 together the last two years. In 2016, the couple\u2019s first Valentine\u2019s Day as husband and wife \u2013 Aniston and Theroux vacationed together in Paris, France, posting sweet photos of a romantic dinner inside the Eiffel Tower.\n\nLast year, Theroux shared a photo of the white roses he bought for Aniston on Feb. 15. By that point, the bouquet had been torn to shreds by the couple\u2019s dog, Sophie. \u201c\u2018Happy day-after-Valentine\u2019s Day, a\u2014\u2014\u2018 \u2014 Sophie,\u201d he jokingly captioned.\n\nAnthony Harvey/Getty\n\nFeb. 15: Split Announcement\n\nAlong with their promise to remain, friends, Aniston and Theroux used their split announcement to shoot down any tabloid rumors as to what led to their separation.\n\n\u201cNormally we would do this privately, but given that the gossip industry cannot resist an opportunity to speculate and invent, we wanted to convey the truth directly,\u201d the announcement continued. \u201cWhatever else is printed about us that is not directly from us, is someone else\u2019s fictional narrative. Above all, we are determined to maintain the deep respect and love that we have for one another.\u201d\n\nFollowing the news, a source told PEOPLE Aniston is in positive spirits and has been spending time with friends.\n\n\u201cJen and Justin have been apart for several weeks,\u201d a source close to the actress tells PEOPLE. \u201cJen has continued her life as usual. She has seemed fine. There has been no indication that she is upset.\u201d", "images":
