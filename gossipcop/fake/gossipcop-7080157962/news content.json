Here\u2019s all the EXCLUSIVE details!\n\nMandy Teefey, Selena Gomez\u2018s mother, finally came forward on Saturday, Jan. 13, to address the rumors of a serious falling out between her and her daughter due to her relationship with Justin Bieber, 23, \u2014 confirming that she doesn\u2019t approve. Now, thanks to our insiders, we\u2019re learning how the hitmaker is responding to her mother\u2019s public comments.\u201cSelena and her mom are still not talking as of right now, but it\u2019s getting to the point where Selena\u2019s calmed down, and she feels that enough time has passed to let bygones be bygones,\u201d an insider tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. How great would it be for Sel and her mother to bury the hatchet!? Head here for more pics of Selena with her mother!\n\n\u201cSelena and Mandy have always been super tight, and over the years they\u2019ve had a number of blow-ups, but they\u2019ve always managed to resolve everything after some time apart. Selena is definitely ready to build bridges with her mom again, but she\u2019s waiting for her to make the first move.\u201d The source went on to add that it all comes down to Sel\u2019s mother accepting that the singer is giving Justin another shot, which is a tall order! \u201cThey fell out over Selena allowing Justin back into her life again, and as far as Selena is concerned, her relationship with Justin is not up for debate, so either her mom needs to accept it, or butt out. Selena made that crystal clear, and told Mandy in no uncertain terms that unless she can accept Justin, Selena has nothing to say to her\u2014so the ball\u2019s firmly in Mandy\u2019s court.\u201d That\u2019s pretty serious language!\n\nAs we previously reported, Mandy told Gossip Cop that she\u2019s \u201cnot happy\u201d that Selena is once again dating the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d crooner. However, she added: \u201cSelena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do YOU think?
