The Fuller House star took to Instagram on Tuesday to upload a new pic with her professional dancer pal.\n\n\"Went to #dwts last night to go cheer on my family, my brother, one of my best friends @keo-motsepe,\" Sweetin wrote in the caption.\n\n\"I'm so proud of how hard he works and even though his journey this season was short, I know he'll be ready to come back for more (and hopefully longer!) again next season. Love you, Keo!! #friendsarefamily #pineapple #teammosweet.\"\n\nSweetin made the appearance on the DWTS set amid the reports that she has reportedly relapsed. The Blast reported earlier this week her ex-husband, Morty Coyle, had \"serious concerns\" about the 35-year-old actress' sobriety.\n\nThe two were married from 2012-2015. While on the phone with Sweetin, he says he became worried due to the way she sounded.\n\nCoyle says that Sweetin was not stable after her recent break-up with ex-fiance Justin Hodak. He started to \"suspect she is resorting to substance use as the means to cope with these traumatic events.\"\n\nOne of Sweetin's representatives told multiple outlets that the relapse claims are \"completely baseless\" and \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"This is not the first time Mr. Coyle has made ridiculous accusations about Jodie which were utterly untrue,\" Sweetin's rep said.", "images": ["https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"], "top_img": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/jodie-sweetin-dancing-with-the-stars-relapse/", "title": "Jodie Sweetin Attended 'DWTS' Amid Relapse Reports", "meta_data": {"description": "Despite the reports that she has relapsed, Jodie Sweetin made an appearance backstage at Dancing [...]", "keywords": "Dancing With the Stars,Instagram,Jodie Sweetin", "news_keywords": "Dancing With the Stars,Instagram,Jodie Sweetin", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "PopCulture", "creator": "PopCulture", "title": "Jodie Sweetin Attended 'DWTS' Amid Relapse Reports", "description": "Despite the reports that she has relapsed, Jodie Sweetin made an appearance backstage at Dancing [...]", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"}, "og": {"title": "Jodie Sweetin Attended 'DWTS' Amid Relapse Reports", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/jodie-sweetin-dancing-with-the-stars-relapse/", "image": {"identifier": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "Despite the reports that she has relapsed, Jodie Sweetin made an appearance backstage at Dancing [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#263240", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506466800.0, "source": "http://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
