So, it's time to set the record straight: Are Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton engaged? It's far from the first time such reports have circulated, and when the couple has shut down gossip in the past, they've made clear they're in no rush to tie the knot.\n\n\"Everything's crazy right now so no, absolutely not,\" Stefani said in June 2016 during 94.7 Fresh FM's The Tommy Show last summer when asked if she was engaged. \"Can you imagine the amount of gossipy, weird stories people make up? To me, it makes me laugh every day. I actually do Google my name just so I can see the next one that's gonna happen, because it's gotten so out of control.\" That may have been a while ago, but there's been no comment to the contrary from the couple in regards to engagement and marriage.\n\nBoth Shelton and Stefani have been married before. Shelton to his high school sweetheart, Kaynette Gern, from 2003 to 2006, and then to fellow country star Miranda Lambert from 2011 to 2015, and Stefani to Bush frontman Gavin Rossdale from 2002 to 2016. In fact, falling out of love is what helped them fall into it. Shelton went through his second divorce around the same time as Stefani. By that point, they'd become friends from their time on The Voice, and they started leaning on each other for support.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nEventually, that blossomed into a romance. As Shelton told Billboard in 2016:\n\n\u201cIt went from [relating to one another], to checking in on each other once a week through email \u2013 \u2018This sh*t happened to me, what happened to you?\u2019 \u2013 to maybe three times a week, then every day, to \u2018Hey, here\u2019s my phone number if you ever want to text.\u2019 Next thing I know, I wake up and she\u2019s all I care about, and I\u2019m wondering if she feels the same about me. Gwen saved my life.\"\n\nSince confirming that they were dating in November 2015, Stefani and Shelton haven't been shy about their relationship. They had noticeable chemistry when they reunited for The Voice Season 12, and they often share sweet posts of each other on social media. \"Got my Christmas present already gx #youmakeitfeellikechristmas @blakeshelton #yum,\" Stefani captioned a recent photo tied to the Christmas duet they wrote together.\n\nThey haven't said much about marriage plans, but considering how open they've been about their relationship, it doesn't seem like an engagement is something they'd hide. \"It's really been smooth sailing for them,\" an anonymous source claimed to Entertainment Tonight in August. \"They don't talk about getting married, but they talk like they are going to be together forever. They are very committed to one another and their life together.\"\n\nOf course, there are hints to be found in their music, and it sounds like marriage has been on Shelton's mind. \u201cI\u2019m talkin\u2019 you and me with the same street name. Same last name, same everything. It\u2019s a real thing, how I feel thin, so I\u2019mma go on and take a swing,\u201d he sings on his September single \"I'll Name The Dogs\" \u2014 a message only emphasized by the track's wedding-themed video.\n\nFor now, though, it seems like he and Stefani are content to take things slow.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2021/6/25/c1b4bd17-eddf-4561-9919-71969dd51feb-getty-510718430.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/12/11/efc7221f-207b-45c8-a253-4c689cc63ea5-getty-533609742.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/12/11/efc7221f-207b-45c8-a253-4c689cc63ea5-getty-533609742.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/12/11/1676976c-f8ac-4126-bd7d-62f47c8096a8-getty-531294500.jpg?w=414&h=320&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/5/11/98d51af3-762a-4bad-9813-1df69e893334-blingempire_unit_01818rc.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.452&fp-y=0.288", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/28/b4c59b8f-eedc-4fe0-8f83-daac697db4c9-ekin.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/5/18a81ecc-5972-4e59-ac9c-5b93b6d92ebf-getty-1238712243.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2017/12/11/efc7221f-207b-45c8-a253-4c689cc63ea5-getty-533609742.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/are-gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-engaged-in-2017-the-couple-has-been-going-strong-for-years-7531161", "title": "Are Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton Engaged In 2017?
