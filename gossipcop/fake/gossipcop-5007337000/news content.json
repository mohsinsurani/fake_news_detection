It\u2019s understandable: Bush has been a divisive figure at best since that infamous Access Hollywood tape, on which Donald Trump boasted about groping women while Bush laughed along.\n\nOn Sunday, Bush published a New York Times op-ed about the tape, emphasizing its veracity\u2014and saying that he believes the women who have accused Trump of sexual misconduct, women the White House has broadly branded as liars. Since then, a debate has raged regarding whether Bush should have a second chance in the public eye.\n\nHis Late Show audience, at least, didn\u2019t seem fully on board with Bush\u2019s apology tour, remaining largely somber during his appearance\u2014even as Bush once more affirmed the truth of the tape, despite Trump recently suggesting the opposite.\n\n\u201cI would also like to say that\u2019s not me on the bus,\u201d Bush joked to Colbert, before addressing Trump: \u201cYou don\u2019t get to say that, because I was there, and the last 14 months of my life I have been dealing with it. You dealt with it for 14 minutes and went on to be the president.\u201d\n\nAs powerful men across several industries continue to face allegations of sexual abuse, the idea of a Bush redemption tour might seem unnecessary and, perhaps, even counter-productive. No, Bush\u2019s actions were not criminal; he did not sexually harass or mistreat any women himself. But his laughter on the tape represents, to some, the very culture of abuse that allowed Trump to ascend to the presidency. Why should he be welcomed back to the spotlight?\n\nWhile Colbert was careful to avoid lobbing too many softballs, he also stopped short of frankly posing that question. He did play a recording of the tape for Bush, who said that it\u2019s still a \u201cgut punch\u201d now to hear himself react the way he did to Trump\u2019s words in 2005. Notably, neither man dared utter the words \u201clocker-room talk\u201d throughout the interview. Still, it was hard not to remember Trump\u2019s dismissive label as Bush said, \u201cI sort of equated what he was saying to some kind of crass stand-up act. Like, you know, an Andrew Dice Clay performance. You figure, well that\u2019s not Dice when he\u2019s home. He doesn\u2019t actually do those things.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut the camera wasn\u2019t on him,\u201d Colbert pressed. \u201cWhy did it seem like a performance to you?\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause he was just regaling the seven guys on there and doing his bit,\u201d Bush said, adding later, \u201cIf I had thought there was a man detailing a sexual assault strategy to me, I would have called the F.B.I., not just reported it to my executive producer.\u201d\n\nBush added that in those days\u2014the early Apprentice era\u2014a lot of people at NBC hung around with Trump, because he was bringing in huge ratings and profits for the network. As Bush put it, \u201ceverybody had to sort of kiss the ring, a little bit, of the Donald.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62990e66f0746bf707feb29a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a0f00dc70fe0563a1ebbfa7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/ben-affleck-stephen-colbert-sexual-misconduct.jpg", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633d9bec72fe11ef3849c3ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a01b6e1ebb54658258f661f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/mass-shooting-texas-sutherland-springs-stephen-colbert-late-show.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62a298c185e5658b05ff85cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fd072bc2af15b93e26e3ee/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5f3166c4476de5b2fc5e5654/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599f4be10ba28d197bf76893/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62c4a6139e2d1df68a9dd4a1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a215561d7f48f5f0e9cf914/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/melania-trump-holiday-decoration-colbert-late-show.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/618c4898ee5359a0267590ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26a645623f3f4927e2e4cb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26a645623f3f4927e2e4cb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Laura Bradley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/billy-bush-donald-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert", "title": "Stephen Colbert Doesn\u2019t Let Billy Bush Off the Hook", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The former Access Hollywood host stops by Late Show to discuss that infamous tape\u2014and why he didn\u2019t stand up to Trump in the moment.", "id": "5a2695286a281c2f0d02b196", "keywords": "billy bush,stephen colbert", "news_keywords": "billy bush,stephen colbert", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a2695286a281c2f0d02b196", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The former Access Hollywood host stops by Late Show to discuss that infamous tape\u2014and why he didn\u2019t stand up to Trump in the moment.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26a645623f3f4927e2e4cb/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26a645623f3f4927e2e4cb/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The former Access Hollywood host stops by Late Show to discuss that infamous tape\u2014and why he didn\u2019t stand up to Trump in the moment.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26a645623f3f4927e2e4cb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Stephen Colbert Doesn\u2019t Let Billy Bush Off the Hook", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/12/billy-bush-donald-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-12-05T14:16:04.241Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-05T14:16:04.241Z", "author": "Laura Bradley"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The former Access Hollywood host stops by Late Show to discuss that infamous tape\u2014and why he didn\u2019t stand up to Trump in the moment.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a26a645623f3f4927e2e4cb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/billy-bush-trump-access-hollywood-op-ed-colbert.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Stephen Colbert Doesn\u2019t Let Billy Bush Off the Hook"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512483364.241, "source": "http://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
