There are a lot of things we can do about it. But we don\u2019t. Which is interesting, because when someone with a beard attacks us, we tap phones, we invoke travel bans, we build walls. We take every possible precaution to make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again. But when an American buys a gun and kills other Americans, then there\u2019s nothing we can do about that. Because [of] the Second Amendment. Our forefathers wanted us to have AK47s, is the argument.\u201d\n\nAnd before showing the faces of the 56 senators who voted against new and tighter gun laws just days after the shooting in Orlando last year, Kimmel said, \u201cThey should be praying. They should be praying for God to forgive them for letting the gun lobby run this country. Because it is, it is so crazy.\u201d\n\nAmong those commenting on the late night host\u2019s powerful and emotional monologue is Rosie O\u2019Donnell, who said, \u201cJimmy Kimmel is an American hero \u2013 [watch] his Emotional Monologue About The Mass Shooting In Las Vegas #useURvoice.\u201d Olivia Wilde similarly wrote, \u201cA powerful call to action. Thank you, @jimmykimmel.\u201d Will Arnett tweeted, \u201c@jimmykimmel says what needs to be said.\u201d And Alyssa Milano, who shared the link to Kimmel\u2019s monologue on her Twitter account, expressed, \u201cGood morning! Please watch. Please share.\u201d Gossip Cop will continue to update as more celebrities react to Kimmel\u2019s comments on the Las Vegas shooting.
