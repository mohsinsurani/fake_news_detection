The concert had just ended, and the blast occurred in an area where parents were waiting for their children to exit the arena. Grande's crowd is known to skew younger, and is particularly attractive to young women.\n\nRead the whole text of her letter below.\n\nManchester explosion in pictures Show all 37 1 /37 Manchester explosion in pictures Manchester explosion in pictures People running down stairs as they attempt to exit the Manchester Arena after a blast, where U.S. singer Ariana Grande had been performing, in Manchester Twitter/@ZACH_BRUCE/ via REUTERS Manchester explosion in pictures Helpers attend to people inside the Manchester Arena after a suspected suicide bomber detonated an explosive device at the end of an Ariana Grande concert, killing 22 people PA wire Manchester explosion in pictures Armed officers guard outside a hotel near the Manchester Arena following reports of an explosion, in Manchester, Britain EPA Manchester explosion in pictures Police officers are seen outside the Manchester Arena, where U.S. singer Ariana Grande had been performing, in Manchester, northern England Reuters Manchester explosion in pictures Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures AFP/Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures Police and fans close to the Manchester Arena, after reports of an explosion Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures There have been reports of explosions at Manchester Arena where Ariana Grande had performed Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures Police deploy at scene of explosion in Manchester, England, at a concert in Manchester Arena AFP/Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures Police stand by a cordoned off street close to the Manchester Arena Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures Police deploy at scene of explosion in Manchester, England AFP/Getty Images Manchester explosion in pictures Police deploy at scene of a reported explosion during a concert in Manchester, England, on May 23, 2017.

The way you have handled all of this has been more inspiring and made me more proud than you\u2019ll ever know.\n\nThe compassion, kindness, love, strength and oneness that you\u2019ve shown one another this past week is the exact opposite of the heinous intentions it must take to pull off something as evil as what happened Monday.\n\nEnjoy unlimited access to 70 million ad-free songs and podcasts with Amazon Music Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nYOU are the opposite.\n\nI am sorry for the pain and fear that you must be feeling and for the trauma that you, too, must be experiencing.\n\nWe will never be able to understand why events like this take place because it is not in our nature, which is why we shouldn\u2019t recoil.\n\nWe will not quit or operate in fear.\n\nWe won\u2019t let this divide us.\n\nWe won\u2019t let hate win.\n\nI don\u2019t want to go the rest of the year without being able to see and hold and uplift my fans, the same way they continue to uplift me.\n\nOur response to this violence must be to come closer together, to help each other, to love more, to sing louder and to live more kindly and generously than we did before.\n\nI\u2019ll be returning to the incredibly brave city of Manchester to spend time with my fans and to have a benefit concert in honor of and to raise money for the victims and their families. I want to than my fellow musicians and friends for reaching out to be a part of our expression of love for Manchester. I will have details to share with you as soon as everything is confirmed.\n\nFrom the day we started putting the Dangerous Woman Tour together, I said that this show, more than anything else, was intended to be a safe space for my fans. A place for them to escape, to celebrate, to heal, to feel safe and to be themselves. To meet their friends they\u2019ve made online. To express themselves.\n\nThis will not change that.\n\nWhen you look into the audience at my shows, you see a beautiful, diverse, pure, happy crowd.\n\nThousands of people, incredibly different, all there for the same reason, music.\n\nMusic is something that everyone on Earth can share.\n\nMusic is meant to heal us, to bring us together, to make us happy.\n\nSo that is what it will continue to do for us. We will continue in honor of the ones we lost, their loved ones, my fans and all affected by this tragedy. They will be on my mind and in my heart everyday and I will think of them with everything I do for the rest of my life.\n\nAri", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "http://www.independent.co.uk/img/third-party/Amazon_Music.png"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clark Mindock", "New York"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/manchester-attack-read-ariana-grande-s-full-statement-benefit-concert-a7758621.html", "title": "Manchester attack: Read Ariana Grande's statement in full as she announces benefit concert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Ariana Grande has penned a heartfelt letter to her fans urging bravery and compassion just days after the tragic attack in Manchester that left 22 people dead and scores more injured.", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Music", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-05-26T20:20:09.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Read Ariana Grande's fresh statement about the Manchester attack in full", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/manchester-attack-read-ariana-grande-s-full-statement-benefit-concert-a7758621.html", "type": "article", "description": "Ariana Grande has penned a heartfelt letter to her fans urging bravery and compassion just days after the tragic attack in Manchester that left 22 people dead and scores more injured.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-26T20:20:09.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-26T20:20:09.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Clark Mindock", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 816, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2017-05-26T20:20:09.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Read Ariana Grande's fresh statement about the Manchester attack in full", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Ariana Grande has penned a heartfelt letter to her fans urging bravery and compassion just days after the tragic attack in Manchester that left 22 people dead and scores more injured.", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/26/14/an122729873flowers-and-mess.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Ariana Grande,Manchester,Manchester attack,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495830009.0, "source": "http://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
