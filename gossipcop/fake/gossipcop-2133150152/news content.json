At the Golden\n\nGlobe Awards on Jan. 7, the former Friends star spent much of the night trying to hide from archnemesis Angelina Jolie in the ballroom of LA\u2019s Beverly Hilton hotel. \u201cJen was frazzled,\u201d says an insider. \u201cShe was overheard saying, \u2018This is so awkward.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe one person who could\u2019ve comforted her, husband Justin Theroux, decided to skip the festivities, so Jen clung to pal and frequent co-star Jason Bateman instead. But when he left her alone at an afterparty at Sunset Tower, Jen took off and headed home. \u201cJen was absolutely lost without Justin,\u201d says a friend, \u201cand just when she needed him the most. He knew Angie would be there, and he picked the worst time to not support his wife.\u201d\n\nJustin\u2019s unexplained absence is the latest in a series of signs that his two-and-a-half-year marriage to Jen is hanging by a thread. But even though the pair have a laundry list of issues between them \u2014 as Life & Style previously reported, they spend long stretches apart, have different lifestyles and can\u2019t agree on where to live or whether to start a family \u2014 \u201cJen just can\u2019t let go of Justin,\u201d says the friend. After 13 years, she\u2019s still haunted by her 2005 split from Brad Pitt and his affair with Angelina. \u201cHer divorce from Brad was the ultimate heartbreak for her, and she couldn\u2019t take all that pain again,\u201d says the friend. If Jen, 48, and Justin, 46, split, \u201cIt would be the worst kind of public humiliation,\u201d the friend notes, \u201cbecause she and Justin have put on such a united front about being one of the happiest couples in Hollywood.\u201d\n\nBut they\u2019re not. Jen, the ultimate California girl, and Justin, a consummate New Yorker, spent much of the past several months apart, as he filmed The Spy Who Dumped Me in Budapest, Hungary; the Ruth Bader Ginsburg biopic On the Basis of Sex in Montreal; and the Netflix dark comedy Maniac in NYC. Jen, meanwhile, shot Dumplin\u2019 in Atlanta and then headed back to LA to prep her upcoming Apple TV series. It is, says the friend, \u201ca long-distance marriage.\u201d\n\nStill, Jen remains intent on salvaging it. She planned to fix things during her annual post-Christmas trip to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, when she and Justin \u2014 who fell in love on the set of 2012\u2019s Wanderlust \u2014 finally had some downtime together. \u201cJen was hoping they could smooth over all of their problems,\u201d says the friend. But she invited Jason, and his wife, Amanda Anka, both 49, on the trip, along with other friends. In the end, \u201cJen and Justin didn\u2019t have one-on-one time to work through their dysfunction,\u201d says the friend. \u201cAs a result, they\u2019ve gone right back to their separate lives and marital discord.\u201d\n\nYet Jen remains optimistic. \u201cShe\u2019s always hoping that they can work out their differences \u2014 she sees a glimmer of hope every time Justin returns to LA,\u201d says the friend, who isn\u2019t even sure they chat regularly on the phone. \u201cBut everyone worries she\u2019s fooling herself. Unless there is a miraculous turnaround on both of their parts and they can actually live together in the same home in the same city, Jen and Justin could be history.\u201d\n\nFor more on Jen and Justin\u2019s drama, pick up the new issue of Life & Style, on stands now!", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-marriage.jpg?resize=750%2C422&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-newlyweds.jpg?fit=400%2C511&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C511"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-marriage.jpg?resize=750%2C422&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Heintz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/jennifer-aniston-justin-theroux-marriage-152778/", "title": "Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux\u2019s Marriage Is \u201cHanging by a Thread\u201d (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jennifer Aniston desperately wanted a wingman.
