We\u2019ve EXCLUSIVELY learned that she\u2019s flattered by his childhood crush comment, but there\u2019s one BIG reason why they\u2019ll never get together.\n\nIt\u2019s every guy\u2019s worst nightmare to be put inside the friend zone. Unfortunately, that\u2019s the case for Niall Horan, 23, who recently admitted in a radio interview with SiriusXM that Selena Gomez, 24, was his childhood crush. As much as we\u2019d love to see these two start a romance, it\u2019s not going to happen any time soon. \u201cSelena really likes Niall but she feels a more brotherly connection towards him as opposed to a romantic one,\u201d a source tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThat\u2019s why nothing has happened between them. She thinks he\u2019s cute and all for what he said, but it\u2019s not going any further than the comments.\u201d\n\nPlus, she\u2019s happily taken with The Weeknd. After attending David Henrie, her Wizards Of Waverly Place co-star\u2019s wedding, she\u2019s starting to have ideas of her own about marrying the \u201cStarboy\u201d crooner. \u201cIt was a completely magical moment for her because she saw what true love was all about and realized that is what she has with The Weeknd,\u201d a different insider EXCLUSIVELY told us. \u201cSeeing David so happy made her think of what she has with Abel and how happy she is and is fully devoted to everything he has brought to her life. It just proved that The Weeknd is her dream man.\u201d See, there\u2019s barely any room for Niall in this picture.\n\nAs for the former One Direction singer\u2019s dating life, we\u2019re still waiting for a girlfriend to emerge from the shadows. Niall has been very secretive about his recent affairs and won\u2019t even drop the name of the girl that \u201cThis Town\u201d is based on. Instead of chasing after girls, he\u2019s actually been spending more time with his band mates, like Liam Payne, who recently performed at the Wango Tango music festival. Their brief reunion was the cutest thing we\u2019ve ever seen!\n\nHollywoodLifers, are you bummed out that Selena and Niall won\u2019t be dating any time soon?\n\nJavaScript is required to load the comments.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/zac-efron-alexandra-daddario-ftr1.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/selena-gomez-bad-liar-promo-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/selena-gomez-flattered-by-niall-horan-lead.jpg?w=600", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://i2.wp.com/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/dynasty.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/http://i1.wp.com/pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/sag-aftra-amptp-logo-2-shot.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/http://i1.wp.com/pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/lisa-robertson-qvc-vh1-rupaul-drag-race.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/nicole-scherzinger-casper-smart-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/http://i0.wp.com/pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/the-originals-recap2.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F05%2F19%2Fwhy-wont-selena-gomez-date-niall-horan-childhood-crush%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2597146&comment_count=4", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/niall-horan-ellen-slow-hands-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/kourtney-kardashian-creeped-out-bella-thorne-scott-disick-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/selena-gomez-flattered-by-niall-horan-ftr.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/selena-gomez-and-brad-pitt-talking-at-golden-globes-after-party-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/gwen-blake-highs-lows-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/taylor-swift-joe-alwynn-secret-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/http://i0.wp.com/pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/pantone-iphone-case.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2016/01/selena-gomez-orlando-bloom-cuddles-up-birthday-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/12/selena-gomez-hands-on-myself-video-justin-loves-to-watch-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/05/selena-gomez-flattered-by-niall-horan-ftr.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sophie Radvan"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170520021906/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/05/19/why-wont-selena-gomez-date-niall-horan-childhood-crush/", "title": "Selena Gomez Flattered By Niall Horan\u2019s Crush Reveal But Here\u2019s Why They\u2019ll Never Date", "meta_data": {"fb": {"page_id": 126281330722826, "pages": 94724837471}, "google-site-verification": "pTG9cbyClySmWh0Z5uEBdmvKV8FzydO-TOwHPNrr8GA", "description": "If you're obsessed with the idea of Selena Gomez dating Niall Horan, then we're here to burst your bubble.
