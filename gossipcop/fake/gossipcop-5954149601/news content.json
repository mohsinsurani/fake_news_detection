The next step? Finding Leto a leading lady\u2014or several, since Hefner was married three times, and had plenty of girlfriends in between.\n\nOne name that\u2019s been thrown in the mix is Margot Robbie, who Hefner himself would have approved of, since Robbie was one star he couldn\u2019t get to pose for his magazine. Back in 2014, after seeing Robbie\u2019s performance in The Wolf of Wall Street, Hefner told Us Weekly, \u201cShe should be in Playboy! Send her a message. We\u2019re ready for her. She would be great.\u201d\n\nHe particularly enjoyed Robbie\u2019s nude scenes, adding, \u201cI was very aware of that! The girl that plays [Jordan Belfort\u2019s] wife in [the movie] is very, very pretty.\u201d\n\nWhile Robbie declined Hefner\u2019s offer to pose in his magazine, The Mirror reports she\u2019s considering the upcoming film opportunity. \u201cMargot turned down the offer before but this is different. She\u2019s considering,\u201d said a source.\n\nLeto\u2019s casting could also be one of the factors that gets Robbie involved, since the two actors have worked together before (playing the Joker and Harley Quinn in Suicide Squad), and have great chemistry.\n\n\u201cJared is working on the movie with his buddy Brett [Ratner] and they\u2019re really pushing for Margot to have a major role,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe\u2019s perfect for a part and he\u2019s not going to give up until she accepts.\u201d", "images":
