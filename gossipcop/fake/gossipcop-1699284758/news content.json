(Charles Sykes/Invision)\n\nIf we learn just one thing from \"Megyn Kelly Today,\" the former Fox host's new NBC project, let it be that a woman's appearance is rarely the most interesting thing she has to talk about.\n\nOn Wednesday (day three of the new show), Kelly hosted Jane Fonda and Robert Redford to talk about \"Our Souls at Night,\" a new movie in which they play neighbors who fall in love.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(Count me in, by the way, for a movie in which the 81-year-old actor's love interest is played by a 79-year-old actress.)\n\nKelly decided to talk about plastic surgery.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\"You've been an example to everyone in how to age beautifully and with strength and unapologetically,\" she said to Fonda. (As opposed to apologizing, I guess, for living past 43?)\n\n\"You admit you've had work done, which I think is to your credit,\" Kelly continued, as Fonda's face begins to register slight shock. \"But you look amazing. Why did you say, I read that you said you felt \u2014 you're not proud to admit you've had work done. Why not?\"\n\nFonda stared at Kelly the way you stare at people who start telling you what they dreamed last night.\n\n\"We really want to talk about that now?\"\n\n(Pivot, I wanted to scream at the screen. Pivot, Megyn, Pivot!)\n\nBut she forged ahead: \"Well, one of the things people think about when they look at you is how amazing you look.\"\n\nBut here she is on your show, Meg. With words to say. And a voice to say them. We don't have to focus on how she looks \u2014 she's not a picture. We can focus on what she's created, what she's accomplished, what she's thinking.\n\nFonda took it upon herself to pivot: \"Well, thanks,\" she replied. \"Good attitude, good posture, take care of myself. But let me tell you why I love this movie that we did, 'Our Souls at Night.' Rather than plastic surgery.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKelly is going for a whole new audience and a whole new feel on NBC.\n\n\"The truth is, I am kind of done with politics for now,\" she told the audience Monday.\n\n\"If my producers and I do our jobs,\" she said that first day, \"you will find out what you need to know today, to get yourself through the day \u2014 to have a laugh with us, a smile, sometimes a tear. And maybe a little hope to start your day.\"\n\nLighter stuff. I can see how she got the impression that she should chat with the gals about their appearance. The New York Times profiled Cindi Leive when she stepped down from Glamour early this month and managed to work this into the fifth paragraph:\n\n\"Her toenails were painted a bluish gray. They looked perfectly nice but still ready for a fresh pedicure.\"\n\nAnd, a few paragraphs later, \"Ms. Leive's stomach growled beneath her flouncy Tanya Taylor dress, with its cutout shoulders. She drank water.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\n(I checked twice to make sure I wasn't reading The Onion.)\n\nHopefully, Wednesday's awkward on-air exchange keeps Kelly from going down a similarly narrow path.\n\nAsk about her work. Ask about her life. Ask her what she's reading. Just don't reduce her to a pretty face.\n\nhstevens@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @heidistevens13\n\n[ Related: For better or worse, we'll never see another Hef \u00bb ]\n\n[ Jane Fonda's frank sex toy talk opens the door for a generation \u00bb ]\n\n[ The perfect response to Hurricane Harvey 'gender studies professor' tweet \u00bb ]\n\n\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/rrat484IXoFO09XCwDyFBTZtA9c=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GJUYORJL5BG5JPXI6RSQRZERQ.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/KBd1qqKYq4u86RXE3O8Uu8yEa_o=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/ZMOXO6D2ZFHHZJEVJM5JIIN2HA.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/f_yRcolP-F6QeDKJRzJp5lQ3JWs=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4DY4GIBLHZEQDBPFWYJGKL7FWU.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/MNrg6ScvfR72szwS1jvEIx8Kij4=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CKUSM4AI5VGMBEY3AUJAOXKTRI.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/ayv6XWJ_3V4P78CBQcZP9dPxnXg=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/DEOLPLMYERHN5OA2INQEZJVHGQ.jpg", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/pf/resources/icons/Menu_Icon.svg?d=87", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/XhnV9907ykWoQyzqPnPN04af11k=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/KFPVADRQARB5TIFK7ZW7UG3HXE.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/C2W2N2CfaYS4jxarLv8UF5BcZqE=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GJUYORJL5BG5JPXI6RSQRZERQ.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/VoNNGWAaa_gjOBpKdZyrA2UfvWo=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CWKQLYZVOVH5XDLF5EMZI3G3I4.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/8mONB-PA03t_qSHlx_wsmreWJ7E=/1440x1080/filters:format(png):quality(70)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/ERKVMG563JCDXKVLFKJ2SIMYEE.png", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/FVfVKnrsKjc4CacWhhvHs6q_66g=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/SM5CPFBWI5GPBJOT775QTYOF4A.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/g25YEOW4f0zy202-zgXbIl4z21Y=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/BZ7SB42Y6NHVHOIY2VJ4DX25NY.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/IHcJwU98K2Idn4faNTv4RRTJQEM=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/7SYXIF3OZJH5HNIORUB6EG76PQ.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/p7aOJSBVnNEaz8IE5-vbgYM9B00=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/B5CHH2PN4NCVHMVBQV5YMNHKXU.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/9bdkSxtiKFL5M4Nqyy6W9M_yq3I=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/F4MJWDMP4FBN7JUKFDIMOLV23I.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/4KrqW3HWlkWaB5ioMTvMGoNIXPU=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/Q6M6JNIROZGO5DSTCZ43APXUGQ.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/7MCg3i7M1MhRguHVKZ8YZ1OxNI4=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/PKOPKG6DYZBDHIBFKNS2KIETFI.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/SH4Y9YPZX0PK9YwZOPl0mlkwB4o=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/O7MZWGVQSJHUTF6FPUFM6VNEJI.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/a-uEGq0Jj70GFGna89Bj1q--u0U=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/UOT5S3P5XFEWJC7MVDRUZFHEGI.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/UcfSotzJiV0bHuGZfktjLN0zhvY=/800x0/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/W6FZGVTP3ZALDBMVXVQGBRFMBM.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/eznMeXAVux367fMa_tyNIl5ZsJo=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(1081x1455:1091x1465)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/3RDLQXJST2QSWIMVTFGUNFRAXI.jpg", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/tronc/1657752787005.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/C2W2N2CfaYS4jxarLv8UF5BcZqE=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-tronc.s3.amazonaws.com/public/4GJUYORJL5BG5JPXI6RSQRZERQ.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/columns/heidi-stevens/ct-life-stevens-thursday-megyn-kelly-jane-fonda-0928-story.html", "title": "Megyn Kelly asks Jane Fonda about plastic surgery;
