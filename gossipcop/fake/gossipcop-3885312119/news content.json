She said, \"this year I started to use a lot more gloss because I realized it makes your lips look bigger without having to do any injections.\" Some fans think this is a direct shot at Kylie Jenner. Do you agree? Let us know in the comments below.\n\nKATY Perry and Orlando Bloom are back together 11 months after they split, claim friends.\n\nThe A-list couple broke up in March 2017, but insiders say they\u2019re officially dating again after a romantic holiday to the Maldives, reports The Sun.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re back on,\u201d a source reportedly told The Sun. \u201cKaty wants to make things work this time around. She tried, but she couldn\u2019t cut him off. She cares too much about him. This time, they\u2019re keeping things low key \u2014 but they\u2019re back together.\u201d\n\nRumours that the pair had reunited started last month when both Bloom and Perry were spotted on holiday in the Maldives.\n\nThe singer flew in after her Dubai tour date, and Bloom posted that he was enjoying a break at the luxury Amilla Fushi resort.\n\nFans spotted the pair separately, then a friend\u2019s tagged Instagram post revealed they were both at the same resort.\n\nSince then, Perry and Bloom have been very public about their relationship \u2014 liking almost every one of each other\u2019s Instagram posts and commenting on the photos.\n\nWhen Bloom posted a video of himself driving, and crashing, an F1 car, Perry wrote \u201cExhibit A: why I\u2019m scared of your driving\u201d and also tagged him in a post about McDonalds.\n\nShe also commented on a photo of his dog Mighty and one of him modelling, telling the actor he looked so hot \u201cyou\u2019re making yourself drool\u201d.\n\nPerry also posted an Instagram Story of her and her dog Butters hanging out at home \u2014 and Perry was wearing a special customised onsie with Bloom\u2019s face on it, that she had made especially for Bloom\u2019s 40th birthday last year.\n\nFans also spotted that the actor had been wearing a mustard Supreme hat on his Instagram Stories \u2014 which matches one that Perry wore on a trip to Japan with Bloom last year.\n\nThe two first got together after they were spotted partying together at a Golden Globes afterparty in 2016.\n\nThey issued a statement saying they were taking \u201crespectful, loving space\u201d from each other in March last year, and Orlando said he\u2019d remain friends with Perry as they are \u201call grown up\u201d.\n\nLate last year they were spotted at an Ed Sheeran concert and paddleboarding on the beach in California, but sources say they\u2019ve only officially started dating again this year.\n\nThe pop singer has a history of taking back her exes \u2014 she reportedly got back together with John Mayer five times before ending it in January 2016.\n\nThis story was originally published in The Sun and is reprinted with
