He said, \"That's Kevin Hart in his dumbest moment. That's not the finest hour of my life. With that being said, you make your bed, you lay in it.\"\n\nHart, 38, said he wasn't thinking and had gone to Vegas on a whim while his family was out of town.\n\n\"I'm guilty, regardless of how it happened and what was involved and (expletive) I can't talk about,\" he told The Breakfast Club.\n\nThe woman involved, Montia Sabbag, said publicly she was not suing or extorting the actor after their \"intimate relationship.\"\n\nHart said afterwards that he decided to face the music. He shut down the production of his film and made his then-pregnant wife aware of the situation, \"hoping that she has the heart to where she can forgive me and understand that this is not going to be a recurring thing.\"\n\n\"We talked,\" he said. \"That's when the bond of your union will be questioned. No one is perfect.\"\n\nMore: Kevin Hart shares first photos of 'my little man,' newborn son Kenzo\n\nHart and Parrish married last year and welcomed their first child, a son named Kenzo, on Nov. 21.\n\nHe also has two other children from his previous marriage to actress Torrei Hart: Son Hendrix, 10, and daughter Heaven, 12.\n\nHart called the infidelity \"a reality check and a gut-punch from God.\"", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef08b28cf28c07603bf264f7cf9770ceba24ffd1/c=0-40-3219-1859/local/-/media/2017/12/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636489482060571311-GTY-890642778-95968135.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5680579338001_5680559437001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef08b28cf28c07603bf264f7cf9770ceba24ffd1/c=0-40-3219-1859/local/-/media/2017/12/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636489482060571311-GTY-890642778-95968135.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Mandell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/15/kevin-hart-confesses-cheating-his-pregnant-wife/956472001/", "title": "Kevin Hart confesses to cheating on his pregnant wife", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/15/kevin-hart-confesses-cheating-his-pregnant-wife/956472001/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kevin Hart confesses to cheating on his pregnant wife", "description": "\\", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ef08b28cf28c07603bf264f7cf9770ceba24ffd1/c=0-40-3219-1859/local/-/media/2017/12/15/USATODAY/USATODAY/636489482060571311-GTY-890642778-95968135.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "\\", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513296000.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
