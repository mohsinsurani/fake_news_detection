Now that Selena Gomez, 25, is back together with her on-again, off-again ex, a source EXCLUSIVELY tells HollywoodLife.com that she\u2019s hoping he and Taylor can mend those bridges. Our source admitted, \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that Taylor and Justin aren\u2019t friends but there was a time when they actually did get along and Selena would love to see them get back to that good place.\u201d\n\nAs we reported earlier, an insider said Taylor won\u2019t judge Selena for rekindling a friendship with Justin, but there\u2019s no insight yet as to how she would react to the return of Jelena. Even so, Selena is hoping that a time may come when Justin and Taylor are on good enough terms and they can all go out together, with Taylor\u2019s beau Joe Alwyn, 26, included, of course. \u201cIn a perfect world she and Justin could double date with Taylor and Joe,\u201d the source went on to say. \u201cShe\u2019s hoping that one day that will happen.\u201d\n\nTaylor isn\u2019t the only person Justin will have to reconcile with. A source told us that Selena is hoping that Justin can prove to her family that he\u2019s matured since the last time they split.
