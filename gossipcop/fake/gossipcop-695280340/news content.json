HollywoodLife.com has the EXCLUSIVE scoop!\n\nSelena Gomez, 25, was honored at Billboard\u2018s Women In Music event on Nov. 30, and her touching speech about her friend and kidney donor Francia Raisa, 29, brought us all to tears. But while the \u201cWolves\u201d singer attended the annual dinner and awards ceremony with a close loved one, another important person in her life was noticeably absent from the special event. Justin Bieber, 23, didn\u2019t attend the big night where Selena was awarded Woman Of The Year, but that choice to stay home was a deliberate one.\n\nHollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the time or place to reintroduce themselves as a couple. He is clearly proud of her but he didn\u2019t want to take away any light shed on her from the night. People needed to focus on Selena and he didn\u2019t want to ruin that by attending because he knows then he would have been the story.\u201d Honestly, that\u2019s a pretty fair point \u2014 and actually a very sweet reason to skip out on the night. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t their night, it was her night and she wanted to share it with Francia and leave Justin out of it and he totally understood,\u201d a source close to the couple toldEXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t the time or place to reintroduce themselves as a couple.

The \u201cBad Liar\u201d singer has proven herself to be an incredibly strong role model this year, having had a kidney transplant due to her Lupus while still managing to produce art that touched her fans. Her exchange with Francia at last night\u2019s event was a beautiful example of how resilient these women truly are. \u201cShe should be getting this award, because she saved my life,\u201d Selena said in tears, after her close friend presented her with the immense honor. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt this proud to be a woman in the music industry as I do today,\u201d she continued. \u201cVoices are being heard for the first time [and] it\u2019s so great. Thank you to all of you who have inspired so many girls who feel like they don\u2019t have a voice.
