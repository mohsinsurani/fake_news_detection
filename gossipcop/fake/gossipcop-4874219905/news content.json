Not surprisingly, the photo gained a ton of traffic with over 121,000 likes. A few days later, the mother of two shared yet another photo in a skimpy string bikini on the same trip, according to the Inquisitr. The photo trifecta was complete with the last picture, one of Johnson and Simpson, both in their swimsuits.\n\nHowever, even after posting a ton of body positive images, an NW tabloid cover claims that Simpson feels \"fat and alone\" while they also shared a less than flattering bikini picture from Jessica's vacation. But Gossip Cop reports that the tabloid cover couldn't be any further from the truth and neither could the accompanying article, which claims Simpson gained over 50 lbs and is down in the dumps because of her \"weight gain.\"\n\nThe article also claims that Simpson feels as though she has hit a \"low point\" at her acting and singing careers and since her professional life no longer puts her on the stage, she doesn't have \"motivation\" to work out. But the publication fails to mention the fact that the 37-year-old is head of a billion dollar fashion brand and appears to be doing just fine career wise.\n\nA post shared by Jessica Simpson (@jessicasimpson) on Apr 28, 2018 at 11:29am PDT\n\nJessica has also been posting a ton of family photos on her Instagram, including one from her daughter Maxwell's Greatest-Showman-themed birthday. In the photos, the family is all smiles and definitely appears to be a happy \u2014 further solidifying the fact that the rumors are just silly rumors.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jessica-Simpson-Bikini-Rumors-Debunked.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ashley-Benson.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/54254827fab5e9de95f128cf1f4d78a5?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jessica-Simpson-Bikini-Rumors-Debunked.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4893529/jessica-simpsons-bikini-body-pics-lead-to-bogus-depression-weight-gain-claims/", "title": "Jessica Simpson's Bikini Body Pics Lead To Bogus Depression, Weight Gain Claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jessica Simpson's Bikini Body Pics Lead To Bogus Depression, Weight Gain Claims", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4893529/jessica-simpsons-bikini-body-pics-lead-to-bogus-depression-weight-gain-claims/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Jessica Simpson's Bikini Body Pics Lead To Bogus Depression, Weight Gain Claims", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jessica-Simpson-Bikini-Rumors-Debunked.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-05-08 18:13:57Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Jessica Simpson's Bikini Body Pics Lead To Bogus Depression, Weight Gain Claims", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525803237.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
