But it\u2019s now between Brad, his kids, and the court. The court will determine things.\u201d\n\nThe children spent much of the summer with Jolie in London as she filmed Maleficent 2, but they normally reside in Los Angeles, where Pitt also lives.\n\nPitt, meanwhile, has spent his court-ordered time with the kids in London and Los Angeles as he films Quentin Tarantino\u2019s new movie, Once Upon a Time in Hollywood.\n\nJolie and Pitt first met on the 2003 set of their 2005 thriller Mr. & Mrs. Smith and began publicly dating a few years later. They married in 2014, but split in September 2016, citing irreconcilable differences.", "images":
