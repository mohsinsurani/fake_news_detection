Jamie Foxx and Katie Holmes were first spotted dancing together in the Hamptons in 2013 \u2014 just one year after she split from Tom Cruise. Although Jamie and Katie have never confirmed their romance, they have been spotted on date nights and canoodling plenty of times over the past several years. But recently, tension has been high between them as Jamie is getting a bit jealous of Katie\u2019s friendship with former flame Joshua Jackson.\n\nThe 50-year-old Sleepless star was overheard venting about his tumultuous relationship with Katie while hanging out at Coachella. \u201cHe didn\u2019t seem to care who heard him,\u201d the source exclusively told In Touch. Jamie admitted that not only was Katie talking to Joshua again, but he was also \u201churt\u201d by it.\n\nIt\u2019s imprtant to note that Katie and Joshua go way back, which is why Jamie probably \u201cseemed pretty cut up by everything.\u201d The former Dawson\u2019s Creek co-stars dated in the \u201990s and Katie admitted during an interview with Rolling Stone in 1998 that Joshua was her first love.\n\nWhen asked about their relationship, a then 19-year-old Katie said, \u201cI\u2019m just going to say that I met somebody last year, I fell in love, I had my first love, and it was something so incredible and indescribable.\u201d She added, \u201cI feel so fortunate because he\u2019s now one of my best friends. It\u2019s weird, it\u2019s almost like a Dawson-and-Joey type thing now.\u201d\n\nThe pair broke things off before Katie went on to date Chris Klein for five years before marrying Tom in 2006. However, Katie and Joshua have always kept in touch despite other relationships. Surprisingly, she reached out to Joshua following her split from Tom in 2012.\n\n\u201cLike any old friend, it was like, \u2018Oh, hi, how are ya? What\u2019s going on?\u2019; \u2018I had a kid,'\u201d Joshua told a Canadian talk show host about the phone call with Katie. \u201cIt was very nice, actually.\u201d\n\nSo, does Jamie have a reason to be worried? That\u2019s a tricky question, but Jamie isn\u2019t as innocent as he seems \u2014 because he\u2019s been texting his ex, too! At the beginning of March, sources exclusively told In Touch that Katie is starting to suspect that Jamie and his baby mama Kristin Grannis are more than just friends. \u201cShe recently found out about a string of texts Jamie sent to Kristin that included details of secret meetings \u2014 and him admitting he still loved her,\u201d the insider said. And Jamie\u2019s latest act of betrayal is him showing \u201ca blatant lack of respect.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jamie-katie-grammys-love.png?fit=400%2C342&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C342", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jamie-katie-joshua-triangle.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jamie-katie-joshua-triangle.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Riccardi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifeandstylemag.com/posts/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-joshua-jackson-friendship-158804/", "title": "Jamie Foxx Upset Over Katie Holmes and Joshua Jackson's Friendship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Trouble in paradise?
