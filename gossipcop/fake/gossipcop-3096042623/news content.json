However, an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY Angie also doesn\u2019t want to see him with someone new.\n\n\u201cEven though [Angelina Jolie] wanted the split, she\u2019s terrified Brad [Pitt] will move on and find love with someone new,\u201d an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIt\u2019s one of those she can\u2019t live with him, and she can\u2019t live without him, things. Brad and Angie had scorching chemistry and she just can\u2019t handle seeing him with another woman. She definitely gets very jealous.\u201d\n\nOh, we are totally aware of the kind of chemistry that Brad, 53, and Angelina, 41, had when they were still together. Their 10-year romance was fiery from the very beginning \u2014 back when they were filming Mr. & Mrs. Smith while Brad was still married to Jennifer Aniston, 48.\n\nThe kind of passion they had on screen had fans wondering if they had a thing for each other. Those suspicions were confirmed when Brad left Jen for Angie and they embarked on a new life together in which they would have several children (both adopted and biological) and eventually get married.\n\nBut Angie decided to end that marriage in September 2016 and the two have since been stuck in the middle of a complex divorce and custody battle. With everything that is going on we can see why Angie has complicated feelings when it comes to Brad dating again.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s definitely keeps an eye on him and what he\u2019s up to,\u201d the source added. \u201cBesides just not wanting to see him with someone else, Angie really doesn\u2019t want to see another woman come into the kids lives. That would really freak her out.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor now she doesn\u2019t really have much to worry about, as Brad is focused on the kids, his health, art and his career,\u201d the insider said. \u201cOther than that he just doesn\u2019t have interest in another relationship.\u201d Well, at least we know that she has some time to get used to the idea before he starts bringing women home to meet the kids!\n\nHollywoodLifers, when do you think that Brad will find someone new?
