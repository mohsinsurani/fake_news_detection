Angelina Jolie has been struggling since her split with Brad Pitt, HollywoodLife.com has EXCLUSIVELY learned. The star reportedly became \u2018incredibly lonely\u2019 \u2014 and you\u2019ll never guess what she \u2018misses\u2019 most about her ex!\n\nAngelina Jolie, 41, reportedly has been having a really rough time on her own. \u201cAngelina is incredibly lonely. She acted in anger and frustration, and really didn\u2019t think her actions through,\u201d a source told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cI don\u2019t think she was prepared for what life would be like on her own.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s a mother to six adorable children, which has to be a tough job all by herself. Now we have to wonder, was the Salt actress simply putting on a brave face when she took Shiloh and Knox to the Renaissance Pleasure Faire of Southern California in Irwindale on May 6?\n\nThe movie star reportedly hasn\u2019t felt like there\u2019s anyone she can really open up to about how she has been feeling. \u201cAside from the kids, bodyguards, and her staff, she has no one \u2014 not even a close friend,\u201d the source continues. \u201cThere\u2019s no one that she fully trusts or can confide in. That\u2019s what she misses most about Brad [Pitt], their conversations and closeness.\u201d\n\nAngelina has started to remember how much she loved Brad and how well they worked together as parents. \u201cWhen things were good, they were a team, it was them against the world,\u201d the insider told us. \u201cI would not be surprised if she decides to give Brad another chance. It certainly seems to be what she wants deep down\u2014but then, she has an incredibly stubborn and self-destructive streak, and that may ultimately prevent her from following her heart.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Angelina will find love again?
