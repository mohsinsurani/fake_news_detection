They couple announced their engagement in July 2016 when she shared a photo of her diamond ring alongside a custom \u201cMarry Me\u201d Snapchat filter. \u201cI said yes!!!\u201d wrote the former Victoria\u2019s Secret Angel on Instagram.\n\nDespite the age difference between the spouses, Kerr has gushed about Spiegel\u2019s maturity. \u201cHe\u2019s not out partying. He goes to work in [L.A.\u2019s] Venice,\u201d she told The Edit in 2016. \u201cHe comes home early. We don\u2019t go out. We\u2019d rather be at home and have dinner, go to bed early.\u201d\n\nKerr once said that parenting Flynn is \u201cthe most rewarding thing\u201d she\u2019s ever done. \u201cIt has taught me so much about patience and unconditional love,\u201d she told Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cBeing a working mother is challenging because . . .
