But we obviously can\u2019t all be close with the 36-year-old goddess \u2014 not even high-profile celebrities like Kim Kardashian, 37, can get into her inner circle. In fact, even though their husbands JAY-Z, 47, and Kanye West, 40, have a feud going on between them, Kim apparently still feels pretty upset that the singer won\u2019t give her the time of day.\n\n\u201cKim would love to be friends with Beyonc\u00e9, she\u2019s never had a problem with her, in fact she\u2019s always looked up to her and thinks she is amazing,\u201d a source close to the Keeping Up With The Kardashians star EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cKim\u2019s really hurt by the way Beyonc\u00e9 has treated her, even before Kanye and Jay fell out Beyonc\u00e9 was always cold towards her, and Kim can\u2019t work out why. She went out of her way to be nice to Beyonc\u00e9 and she really wanted to be friends, but it was clear that Beyonc\u00e9 didn\u2019t feel the same way.\u201d Ouch?!\n\nIt\u2019s not just Kim\u2019s lack of relationship with Bey that upsets her though \u2014 it\u2019s also the missed opportunity of bringing together their young daughters North West, 4, and Blue Ivy, 5. \u201cNorth and Blue Ivy are similar ages and Kim always hoped that they could be playmates, but Beyonc\u00e9 had no intention of that happening, and has always held both Kim and her daughter at arms length,\u201d the source continued. TBH, a friendship between the two girls would be super cute, but we\u2019re not going to question Bey\u2019s judgement on who her child should hang out with.\n\nOne of the \u201ccold\u201d exchanges between Beyonc\u00e9 and the reality TV star was at their mutual friend Serena Williams\u2018 wedding on Nov. 16. It was the first time these two came face-to-face since Kanye called out the Lemonade star and her husband during a concert in Nov. 2016. Even if Beyonc\u00e9 didn\u2019t vibe with Kim before, she most certainly hasn\u2019t since Kim\u2019s husband dissed her and upset her husband. Sorry Kim, but friendship might be permanently off the table.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Beyonc\u00e9 and Kim should bury the hatchet and be friends?", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kim-kardashian-hurt-by-beyonce-awk-exchange-ftr1.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kim-kardashian-hurt-by-beyonce-awk-exchange-ftr1.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/TSDGIGI_VW013.jpg?w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kim-kardashian-hurt-by-beyonce-awk-exchange-ftr1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca", "Katherine Speller", "Roya Backlund", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/20/kim-kardashian-beyonce-hurt-awkward-exchange/", "title": "Kim Kardashian \u2018Hurt\u2019 By Awkward Exchange With Beyonce \u2014 She Wants \u2018To Be Friends\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Kim Kardashian wants to be 'friends' with Beyonc\u00e9, but it doesn't look good for them after their awkward run-in at Serena Williams' wedding.", "news_keywords": "Beyonc\u00e9, Kim Kardashian", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "author": "Courteney Larocca", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian \u2018Hurt\u2019 By Awkward Exchange With Beyonce \u2014 She Wants \u2018To Be Friends\u2019", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/11/20/kim-kardashian-beyonce-hurt-awkward-exchange/", "description": "Kim Kardashian would \u201clove to be friends\u201d with Beyonce (who wouldn\u2019t?!) but it seems the feeling is one-sided.
