Stepping out of her chaufeured SUV onto a sidewalk in freezing midtown Manhattan, Angelina Jolie accompanied four of her six kids to a National Geographic exhibit in Times Square on Dec. 14.\n\n\u201cAngelina started Christmas vacation early,\u201d says an insider, explaining that the NYC visit was part of a holiday shopping trip. \u201cThe Pitt-Jolie family has always loved New York at Christmastime \u2014 the ice-skating rink in Central Park, the amazing store window displays along Fifth Avenue. And she\u2019s planning more trips with the kids in late December and early January.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, their dad, Brad Pitt, is doing everything he can to squeeze in some time with his brood, too. Last year, he got just a few hours with his younger kids on Dec. 25, and this year he\u2019s hoping things will be different for the holiday season and beyond.\n\n(Photo Credit: Getty Images)\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s champing at the bit to get more custody [of Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9]. His Christmas wish is to have equal custody,\u201d the insider exclusively tells In Touch. \u201cBut at this point, the divorce is still stonewalled, and Angie has been talking about taking the kids away to a foreign country for Christmas.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been 15 months since their shocking split, and \u201cAngie and Brad are still playing tug-of-war with their kids,\u201d a source tells In Touch. \u201cBecause they\u2019re not officially divorced yet, Angie\u2019s in the driver\u2019s seat when it comes to getting the children for the holidays, and she\u2019s taking full advantage of that.\u201d\n\nHe misses them so much. \u201cThe holidays are Brad\u2019s favorite time to be with the kids,\u201d says the insider. \u201cHe\u2019s out to try to get as many days as possible with the children over the Christmas week, having dinners and fun times at his LA home, which is not even a mile from where Angie and the kids are living.\u201d\n\nBut Angelina, 42, continues to keep him at arm\u2019s length. \u201cShe\u2019s still bitter and angry,\u201d says the source, noting that they were arguing constantly in the days leading up to Dec. 25 last year. Brad, 54, \u201cis trying to play nice, but every time he asks Angie for something concerning the kids, she shoots him down. It\u2019s contentious, to say the least.\u201d He\u2019s tried to move things forward legally as well. But, \u201cShe\u2019s fought him every step of the way on the divorce he so desperately wants,\u201d adds the insider.\n\nBrad is desperate. \u201cHe\u2019s doing whatever it takes, whether it be begging, pleading or cajoling Angelina to make it happen,\u201d says the insider. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy. But he feels if he\u2019s earnest, caring and demonstrates how the children need their father, Angelina will allow him some quality time alone with the kids and maybe even entertain negotiations on the divorce. That\u2019s what he\u2019s hoping for.\u201d\n\nFor more exclusive celebrity news, pick up the latest issue of In Touch, on newsstands now!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-5-31-49-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-5-31-49-pm.png?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/angelina-jolie-kids.jpg?fit=400%2C309&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C309"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/screen-shot-2017-12-19-at-5-31-49-pm.png?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/brad-pitt-kids-christmas-149506/", "title": "Brad Pitt Begs Angelina Jolie to Let Him Spend Christmas With Their Kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "They were all bundled up with big smiles on their faces.
