The couple, who have been dating for over two and a half years, have not yet tied the knot.\n\nBack in November, a pal of Bullock\u2019s talked to Us about her relationship with the Los Angeles-based photog and described him as \u201cone of the nicest guys ever.\u201d The friend added: \u201cBryan has fully stepped up and embraced the dad role. He is 100 percent there for Louis and Laila and wonderful with them in every way. Sandy feels incredibly fortunate and blessed that she is sharing the parenting journey with Bryan.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s relationship comes after Bullock\u2019s turbulent marriage to West Coast Choppers owner Jesse James. The two divorced in 2010 after James admitted to cheating on her with multiple women throughout their five-year union.\n\nThe Proposal star opened up to Vogue in October 2013 about her divorce: \u201cWe\u2019re all where we\u2019re supposed to be,\u201d she told the mag at the time. \u201cI am exactly where I want to be now. You can\u2019t go backward. I\u2019m not going backward. I\u2019m grateful that I\u2019m here, blessed to have what I have. Nobody can be prepared for anything.\u201d\n\nBullock has two adopted children \u2014 a son, Louis, now 8, and daughter, Laila, now 6.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sandra-bullock.jpg?crop=189px%2C76px%2C1629px%2C920px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sandra-bullock.jpg?crop=178px%2C113px%2C1619px%2C850px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sandra-bullock.jpg?crop=178px%2C113px%2C1619px%2C850px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/is-sandra-bullock-married-to-boyfriend-bryan-randall/", "title": "Sandra Bullock Is Not Married to Boyfriend Bryan Randall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Sanda Bullock is not married to boyfriend Bryan Randall, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sandra Bullock Is Not Married to Boyfriend Bryan Randall", "description": "Sanda Bullock is not married to boyfriend Bryan Randall, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/is-sandra-bullock-married-to-boyfriend-bryan-randall/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-02T18:27:42+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sandra-bullock.jpg?crop=178px%2C113px%2C1619px%2C850px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sandra-bullock.jpg?crop=178px%2C113px%2C1619px%2C850px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-02T18:27:42+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sandra Bullock Is Not Married to Boyfriend Bryan Randall", "description": "Sanda Bullock is not married to boyfriend Bryan Randall, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sandra-bullock.jpg?crop=178px%2C113px%2C1619px%2C850px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520015262.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
