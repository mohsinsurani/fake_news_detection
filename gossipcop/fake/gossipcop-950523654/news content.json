Closer magazine (US)\n\nThe Hollywood couple are famously unmarried and have an \u201celasticity\u201d to their relationship, but that doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t still argue and things have got bad enough for them to call their whole relationship off.\n\nAn insider told American Closer magazine: \u201cTheir open relationship got complicated. It led to a separation which was a real game changer in their relationship. The day she left Kurt was their greatest test.\u201d\n\nGoldie and Kurt met on the set of 1983 movie Swing Shift and they quickly established an unconventional set of boundaries for their relationship. They never married but they had a son, Wyatt, 31, in 1986, and both had children from previous relationships.\n\nOne of the hiccups in their relationship came in 2004 when Goldie flew to India where she met the dashing former Pakistani cricketer Imran Khan, making Kurt jealous.\n\nThe insider added: \u201cKurt was in a mood yelling at his co-stars. They were both acting out a little, and he was on a jealousy kick that hadn\u2019t really shown itself. They called an adult time out to get some space so tempers would cool.\u201d\n\nKurt told Goldie he didn\u2019t want to see her for a while, and the source explained: \u201cShe was really worried and she headed to their house in Malibu while Kurt stayed at their home in the Pacific Palisades. It was rough.\u201d\n\nThe insider told Closer that ultimately the couple made up again and decided their relationship was for the long haul, and their children were a big part of that decision.\n\nThe source added: \u201cThey move forward and don\u2019t dwell on the past. They forgive themselves and each other for their failings and they preach to their kids to be forgiving too.\u201d\n\nGoldie and Kurt have yet to comment on Closer's allegations.", "images": ["http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "http://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2693548590922384&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "http://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "http://www.newidea.com.au/media/111517/ni42_magshop_edm.jpg?height=158"], "top_img": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Patricia Smails"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newidea.com.au/goldie-hawn-why-she-left-kurt", "title": "Goldie Hawn: Why she left longtime partner Kurt Russell", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "Movie icon Goldie Hawn once sensationally left longtime lover Kurt Russell and they almost split for good, according to a shock new report out of the US today.", "news_keywords": "Goldie Hawn, Kurt Russell, Goldie Hawn Kurt Russell split, Goldie Hawn Why I left Kurt", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/goldie-hawn-why-she-left-kurt", "title": "Goldie Hawn: Why she left longtime partner Kurt Russell", "description": "Movie icon Goldie Hawn once sensationally left longtime lover Kurt Russell and they almost split for good, according to a shock new report out of the US today.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@NewIdeamagazine", "title": "Goldie Hawn: Why she left longtime partner Kurt Russell", "description": "Movie icon Goldie Hawn once sensationally left longtime lover Kurt Russell and they almost split for good, according to a shock new report out of the US today.", "image": "http://www.newidea.com.au/", "url": "https://www.newidea.com.au/goldie-hawn-why-she-left-kurt"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "sailthru.title": "Goldie Hawn shock split: Why she left Kurt Russell", "sailthru.date": "2017-11-24 00:00:00", "sailthru.author": "Patricia Smails", "sailthru.description": "The movie favourite's relationship hit an awful snag", "sailthru.tags": "Goldie Hawn,Kurt Russell,Goldie Hawn Kurt Russell split,Goldie Hawn Why I left Kurt", "sailthru.section": "Celebrity", "sailthru.doctype": "ArticlePage"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508378261.854, "source": "http://www.newidea.com.au", "summary": ""}
