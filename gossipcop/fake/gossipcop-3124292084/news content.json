Brad Pitt\u2019s finally met the Clooney twins, & we learned exclusively that he came baring special gifts \u2014 including the same type of African doll his daughter Zahara had as a kid. How cute!\n\nElla and Alexander Clooney may only be three weeks old, but they sure have some famous faces in their corner \u2014 including one of dad George Clooney\u2018s, 56, BFFs Brad Pitt, 53! And in meeting the baby twins for the first time, of course \u201cUncle Brad\u201d brought gifts, AND fatherly advice. While George and his wife Amal Clooney, 39, are currently residing in England and, as of right now, are planning on raising their children there too, Brad was recently in London and got to pay his old friends a visit. \u201cUncle Brad swung through London to see George and Amal and to meet their new babies during his time in Europe,\u201d a Brad insider revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cBrad even brought gifts for the little ones.\u201d We can imagine it\u2019d be hard to pick out gifts for the kids who most likely have everything, but we think the War Machine actor did an amazing job of selecting a super thoughtful and sentimental present. \u201cBrad bought the kids new matching toy dolls from Africa,\u201d our source continued. \u201cZahara [Jolie-Pitt, 12] fell in love with the same type of toy doll when she was a baby, and Brad wanted to help recreate the same fond memories with George and his new children.\u201d It doesn\u2019t get much cuter than that!\n\nBrad didn\u2019t JUST bring tangible items though, he also came with pearls of wisdom \u2014 specifically for George. \u201cBrad even shared some fatherly advice with George on how to prevent diaper rash, which Amal thought was hilarious,\u201d our insider added. LOL. But although George isn\u2019t an experienced father, as Ella and Alexander are his first kids, he\u2019s already LOVING his new role as dad.\n\n\u201cGeorge says the biggest thing he\u2019s learned since becoming a father is the absolute joy and wonder of unconditional love. Obviously, he\u2019s loved, and continues to love, many people in his life \u2014 with Amal being his greatest love, and his soulmate. But the twins\u2019 birth has taken it to a whole new level,\u201d a different source told us EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cGeorge would seriously lay down his life in a heartbeat for Alexander and Ella, and even now, when he looks at them snuggled up, he is overcome with emotion and brought to the verge of tears.\u201d Brad has twins himself \u2014 Knox and Vivienne, 8 \u2014 which means he TOTALLY gets what George is experiencing right now!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you love how close Brad and George are? Are you excited for their kids to meet?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/beyonce-jay-z-never-been-happier-twins-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=420&crop=0,0,420px,420px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/brad-pitt-george-clooney-african-doll-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/peta-maks-vs-julianne-dwts-weddings-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/brad-pitt-george-clooney-african-doll-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/rihanna-focusing-on-new-relationship-not-chris-brown-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F06%2F28%2Fbrad-pitt-george-clooney-twins-babies-meeting-gifts-doll-advice%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2665423&comment_count=2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/brad-pitt-george-clooney-african-doll-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629004356/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/06/28/brad-pitt-george-clooney-twins-babies-meeting-gifts-doll-advice/", "title": "Brad Pitt Gives George & Amal Clooney African Doll & Advice During 1st Meeting With Twins", "meta_data": {"description": "Brad Pitt has finally met the Clooney twins, and we learned EXCLUSIVELY that he came baring super special gifts -- including the same type of African doll his daughter Zahara had as a child.
