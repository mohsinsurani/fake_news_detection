Let\u2019s put it that way,\u201d Brown said of initial reports that she is seeking treatment for alcohol and sex addiction. \u201cNow, I\u2019ve been in therapy since my father got diagnosed with cancer nine years ago.\u201d\n\nThe America\u2019s Got Talent judge went on to say she has PTSD but refuted that she is an alcoholic and a sex addict.\n\n\u201cMy therapy changed a little bit because I was in a very intense relationship, which you can all read about in my book,\u201d she said of her unreleased memoir, Brutally Honest, due in November. \u201cI do address a lot of those issues. But no, I\u2019m not an alcoholic; no, I\u2019m not a sex addict.\u201d\n\nBrown added: \u201cYou know, I was with the same person for 10 years, and that was quite a turmoil, very intense. That\u2019s all I can say about it. I\u2019d like to say a lot more, but on this show, let\u2019s keep it PC. But \u2026 I did kind of have to ease my pain. I suffer a lot from PTSD.\u201d\n\nOver the weekend, Brown told The Sun that she is planning to seek treatment and that she is \u201cfully aware I have been at a crisis point.\u201d At the time, her friend Rusty Updegraff told the outlet that she is \u201csex-crazed\u201d \u2014 sleeping with as many as three men in a day \u2014 and abuses alcohol.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mel B Granted Restraining Order Against Ex After \u2018Hostile\u2019 Confrontation and Panic Attack\n\nHer friend Gary Madatyan slammed the reports of sex and alcohol addiction on Monday, telling PEOPLE exclusively: \u201cYes, she has some issues she\u2019s working on, but it\u2019s emotional issues stemming from everything she\u2019s been through with her divorce.\u201d\n\nMadatyan added: \u201cShe has some stress, but she\u2019s getting help and she\u2019s a fighter \u2014 she\u2019s Scary Spice.\u201d\n\nBrown recently settled her ugly divorce with Stephen Belafonte, 43, and all abuse allegations she made against her estranged husband were reportedly dropped.
