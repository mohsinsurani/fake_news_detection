They had never made a movie together when they were a couple but now reports claim the previously married stars are: \"bringing their love to the big screen.\" The sensational news adds: \"Jen and Brad love the idea of them finally starring together in a movie.\u201d An Australian magazine cites sources who say the couple had wanted to work together when they were married and have now reopened several abandoned projects following their separations from Angelina Jolie and Justin Theroux.\n\nNW Magazine (via Yahoo Australia) added: \"Back when they were married they used to pick each other\u2019s scripts and give each other pointers. \"(They) have a bunch of old scripts in the archives that they\u2019d planned to work on together, which they\u2019re now dusting off and looking at.\u201d It is a tantalising prospect sure to thrill fans who had been devastated when the pair separated way back in 2005. But is it true?

She would highly consider it, so much so that she thinks it\u2019s more likely than a Friends reunion.\u201d Hollywood site Gossip Cop spoke to Aniston's representatives at the time, who categorically denied the reports: \"There are no projects that Jennifer is considering with Brad.\u201d What about 12 months later?", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/590x/Brad-Pitt-and-Jennifer-Aniston-film-plans-944173.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/750x445/944173.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/750x445/944173.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stefan Kyriazis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/944173/Brad-Pitt-Jennifer-Aniston-movie-film-together-divorce", "title": "Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston film plans: Are they really 'REUNITING on screen'?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "BRAD PITT and Jennifer Aniston reports claim the stars are planning to get back together on screen in a new film.", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 823607694325129, "pages": 129617873765147}, "og": {"title": "Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston film plans: Are they really REUNITING?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/entertainment/films/944173/Brad-Pitt-Jennifer-Aniston-movie-film-together-divorce", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/750x445/944173.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "entertainment,arts,books,celebrities,movies,lifestyle,culture,Brad Pitt,Jennifer Aniston,movie,film,together,divorce,Angelina Jolie,Justin theroux", "section": "Films", "description": "BRAD PITT and Jennifer Aniston reports claim the stars are planning to get back together on screen in a new film."}, "news_keywords": "entertainment,arts,books,celebrities,movies,lifestyle,culture,Brad Pitt,Jennifer Aniston,movie,film,together,divorce,Angelina Jolie,Justin theroux", "article": {"tag": "Justin theroux", "published_time": "2018-04-10T17:50:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-10T19:31:43+01:00", "expiration_time": "2018-05-10", "section": "Films", "image_count": 3, "video_count": 0, "word_count": 446, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0, "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "Stefan Kyriazis", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/750x445/944173.jpg", "title": "Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston film plans: Are they really REUNITING?", "description": "BRAD PITT and Jennifer Aniston reports claim the stars are planning to get back together on screen in a new film."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston film plans: Are they really 'REUNITING on screen'?", "vf": {"image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/36/237x141/944173_1.jpg", "container_id": "express-prod-944173", "site_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0ed77b31aaaf"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all", "dataLayer": "{\"page\":{\"attributes\":{\"publicationName\":\"express\",\"ownerSite\":\"express\",\"ownerSiteDomain\":\"www.express.co.uk\",\"platformType\":\"responsive\",\"cmsPlatform\":\"Daily Express CMS\",\"pageType\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"36\"}},\"article\":{\"articleId\":\"944173\",\"articleTitle\":\"Brad Pitt and Jennifer Aniston film plans: Are they really 'REUNITING on screen'? \",\"articleAuthor\":\"Stefan Kyriazis\",\"firstPublishDate\":\"2018-04-10\",\"firstPublishTime\":\"17:50:00\",\"attributes\":{\"primaryTag\":\"brad pitt\",\"allTags\":\"brad pitt|jennifer aniston|movie|film|together|divorce|angelina jolie|justin theroux\",\"isAdvertorial\":false,\"isNative\":false,\"affiliateLinks\":false,\"activeLegalProceedings\":false,\"nudity\":false,\"isSensitive\":false}}}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523379000.0, "source": "http://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
