It's something you do every. Single. Day,\" Lee said.\n\nOver the past few months, fitness gurus and nutrition professionals have been raving about the benefits of the eight hour diet.

They don't call it break-fast for nothing because essentially you're breaking the fast when you eat your first meal in the morning.\"\n\nLee said the easiest way to begin fasting is to increase the time after your last meal in the evening and your breakfast in the morning.\n\n\"By practicing fasting, you allow your body and gut time to digest, rest and heal. Fasting lightens the load on the gut, allowing it to work at its optimum. It also improves the cleansing process,\" Lee said.\n\n\"New research is beginning to demonstrate that intermittent fasting can increase the speed of cell recycling and regeneration, which reduces inflammation in the body. This means we can get sick less, experience less pain and become less susceptible to diseases.\"\n\nFasting can also help kick-start weight loss and repair the body, while reducing blood pressure and increasing energy.\n\n\"But don't be fooled! Just because you're fasting, it doesn't mean you'll go hungry! If you eat satiating, delicious whole foods, you won't be hungry throughout the day - think good fats and protein sources instead of low-calorie junk food,\" Lee said.\n\nAcknowledging that the diet may not be for everyone, as it can be tough to stick too, she also added that those who have suffered from an eating disorder in the past should not try it.", "images": ["https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/eZ8NapZ5UU6qwrz6ldmNJKxnNJs=/16x11/smart/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/3XPEBJZDDUHGVA6ZCSF5RDSIBY.jpg", "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/nEvj_5BX0ZLscvc4VOLHEO2g8xk=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/AJLS46SUXYZ7264EOQBZDKEAPM.jpg", "https://media2.nzherald.co.nz/image.jpg", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pf/resources/images/brands/voyager-logo.svg?d=418", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pf/resources/images/placeholders/placeholder_l.png?d=418", "http://www.nzherald.co.nz/pf/resources/images/placeholders/placeholder_p.png?d=418"], "top_img": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/nEvj_5BX0ZLscvc4VOLHEO2g8xk=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/AJLS46SUXYZ7264EOQBZDKEAPM.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/the-eight-hour-diet-nicole-kidman-swears-by/YD66DPEZI7QP4W6UL366ONQGIE/", "title": "The eight-hour diet Nicole Kidman swears by", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of simple-sounding diet.", "keywords": "eighthour,diet,nicole,kidman,swears,latest,health,craze,hollywood,fitness,gurus,raving,about,benefits", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "language": "en_NZ", "robots": "index, follow, NOODP, noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 34497296301, "pages": "34497296301,315272855536,258352383931,105027142875212,229844183693622,168610521552"}, "og": {"title": "The eight-hour diet Nicole Kidman swears by", "url": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/the-eight-hour-diet-nicole-kidman-swears-by/YD66DPEZI7QP4W6UL366ONQGIE/", "description": "Nicole Kidman and Hugh Jackman are said to be fans of simple-sounding diet.", "type": "article", "site_name": "NZ Herald", "locale": "en_NZ", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nzherald.co.nz/resizer/nEvj_5BX0ZLscvc4VOLHEO2g8xk=/1200x675/filters:quality(70)/cloudfront-ap-southeast-2.images.arcpublishing.com/nzme/AJLS46SUXYZ7264EOQBZDKEAPM.jpg", "alt": "Always cutting a svelte figure on the red carpet, actress Nicole Kidman is said to be a fan of this diet.
