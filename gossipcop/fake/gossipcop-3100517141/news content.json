Younes Bendjima and Scott Disick reportedly met at the Kardashian Christmas Party & let\u2019s just say, they prob won\u2019t sit next to each other at XMas dinner.\n\nKourtney Kardashian\u2018s ex and current boyfriend finally came face-to-face at Kris Jenner\u2018s annual Christmas Eve party and according to sources, it was NOT all merry and bright! Younes Bendjima, 24, attended his first ever Kardashian Christmas party with Kourt, 38, and was inevitably introduced to his GF\u2019s baby-daddy and ex, Scott Disick. A source close to the Kardashian gamily told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY, \u201cScott was under strict orders to be on his best behavior at the party, and to not cause any trouble with Younes\u2014and he managed to walk the line, just. There was a definite tension in the air when Kourtney introduced them to each other, but Scott and Younes shook hands and exchanged some pretty awkward pleasantries, and that was that.\u201d Sounds civil, but there\u2019s no way Scott was pleased when Kourtney started planting kisses on Younes in the infamous Kardashian photobooth and documenting them on her Snap!\n\nThe insider added, \u201cEverybody thinks Scott still loves Kourtney, but he\u2019s no good for her and she\u2019s moved on\u2014and there\u2019s no doubting that Scott isn\u2019t happy about it. Regardless of how badly he\u2019s treated her in the past, Scott always had this fantasy in his head that he could click his fingers and Kourtney would come running.\u201d However, they said there\u2019s no chance Kourtney is coming back to Scott while things are going so well with Younes. \u201cYounes makes Kourtney happier than she ever was with Scott, there\u2019s no game playing or drama, and he truly loves and respects her. Scott certainly isn\u2019t happy about it, but he better get used to Younes being around, because he isn\u2019t going anywhere anytime soon.\u201d That was definitely clear at last night\u2019s party! Even if Scott does want Kourt back, he\u2019s still hot and heavy with his much-younger girlfriend, Sofia Richie, 19, but she was forced to stay home, as she didn\u2019t make Kris Jenner\u2019s guest list!\n\nHollywoodLife.com heard from an industry insider that said Kourtney was \u201cruining his holidays with her jealous, petty ban of Sofia,\u201d but that she has several issues with Scott dating Sofia and does not like it at all.\u201d While Kourtney won\u2019t allow Scott to introduce their three children to Sofia, Younes has already met them and Scott was furious. Hopefully this trio can keep it together for the holidays!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Scott & Younes meeting?
