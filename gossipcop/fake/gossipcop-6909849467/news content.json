Abrams sought to put concerns about potential CGI resurrections to rest, saying that the new movie will use \u201cunseen footage we shot together in Episode VII\u201d and assuring fans that \u201cwe were never going to recast, or use a CG character.\u201d While this is, undoubtedly, comforting, it would also appear to offer particular clues about the role Fisher \u2014 or, more specifically, her character, Leia Organa \u2014 will play in the movie.\n\nFirstly: Purely for practical purposes, Leia\u2019s presence in the movie will be small. If nothing else, there can\u2019t be that much extraneous, unseen footage from 2015\u2019s Star Wars: The Force Awakens; she was barely in that movie, so unless large swaths of scenes were shot but never even hinted at by anyone involved in the production, there\u2019s limited material to draw from in the first place, and surely not everything available will be used.\n\nConsidering the context of the footage, it also limits the potential use for Episode IX. Leia appeared in few scenes and locations in The Force Awakens. Leia was on Takodana, rescuing Han, Chewbacca, Rey and Finn, and then at the Resistance base on D\u2019Qar, where she takes part in planning, and later monitoring, the attack on Starkiller Base. Aside from brief interludes with Han and, later, Rey, she\u2019s very much in \u201charried leader\u201d mode throughout the movie. Does this mean that this is the Leia we\u2019ll see in Episode IX, even after losing her ex-husband, and then her brother, in the previous two movies?\n\n(It\u2019s possible that the Fisher footage will end up being just a minor flashback, used to punctuate a contemporary moment; memories during her funeral, as some on social media have already suggested. If so, then the above problem is side-stepped, to a degree.)\n\nAbrams\u2019 comments leave space for some level of postproduction trickery to be applied to the Fisher footage. Presumably, Fisher will be intercut with new footage of actors shot specifically for Episode IX. Will digital trickery be used to make sure that Fisher shares a location with the other cast members? If so, will that be all that\u2019s altered? What about costuming choices? For that matter, what about the potential for posthumous dubbing or soundalikes used for dialogue where Leia is off-camera or not in close-up? Abrams said that the movie would never use a CG character, but what about a performance augmented or altered by CG?\n\nOf course, if any such edits or alterations are made, they\u2019ll have to be done with subtlety and sensitivity. This is key to the entire enterprise of including footage of Fisher posthumously. For as much as fans want to be able to say goodbye to the actress, and also to Leia, they want to do so in a manner that feels appropriate and respectful to both. While Abrams and Lucasfilm \u2014 and Fisher\u2019s family, especially daughter Billie Lourd, named in Abrams\u2019 statement \u2014 want to provide both closure and tribute to Leia and Fisher alike with this move, they\u2019re courting backlash if this isn\u2019t done perfectly.\n\nThat the footage will come from The Force Awakens feels particularly fitting, then; that, after all, was a project that already came with expectations and looming accusations from fandom expecting the worst. It\u2019s also perhaps a reminder that those involved with this move love the mythology \u2014 and loved Fisher as a person \u2014 as much as anyone else, if not more so, and will be approaching it with the utmost care.\n\nEveryone will, inevitably, remain worried until the final product appears onscreen, but perhaps we can rest just slightly in the meantime.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ep8-194880_r-h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ep8-194880_r-h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ep8-194880_r-h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Graeme Mcmillan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/star-wars-episode-ix-takes-a-big-risk-carrie-fishers-leia-1130505/", "title": "The Promise of Carrie Fisher\u2019s Final \u2018Star Wars\u2019 Appearance", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "What does it mean to resurrect Carrie Fisher's Leia onscreen in the next 'Star Wars' movie?", "news_keywords": "Carrie Fisher, Star Wars: Episode IX", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Graeme McMillan", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1130505, "title": "The Promise of Carrie Fisher's Final 'Star Wars' Appearance", "published_at": "2018-07-27 17:16:21", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/ep8-194880_r-h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Star Wars: Episode IX", "topics": "Movies", "body": "Now, it\u2019s official: Star Wars fans will have one final chance to say goodbye to Carrie Fisher, with Lucasfilm announcing that the actress, who died in December 2016, will appear in next year\u2019s Star Wars: Episode IX.\r\nIn a statement, director J.J.
