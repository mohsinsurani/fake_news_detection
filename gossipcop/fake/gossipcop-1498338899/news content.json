They\u2019ve been leading separate lives for months.\u201d\n\nThe magazine\u2019s tipster added, \u201cIt\u2019s terrible timing, because everyone\u2019s convinced Eva\u2019s expecting another baby. But even that doesn\u2019t look like it can save them at this point.\u201d\n\nTurning to the actor\u2019s purported closeness to Stone, the Enquirer reported: \u201cIt\u2019s no secret Ryan and Emma are extremely close, and Eva was totally threatened by their red-hot chemistry.\n\n\u201cNow Emma\u2019s openly admitting she\u2019s single, and people are wondering if that\u2019s the reason Ryan\u2019s distancing himself from Eva.\u201d\n\nGosling, Mendes and Stone have yet to comment on the Enquirer's sensational report.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/13580/eva-ryan.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-gray.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/17071/ni_issue41_os05oct_cd12oct2017.png?format=png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-nav.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/Branding/NewIdea/images/brand-logo-mobile-menu-colored.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/13580/eva-ryan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225/https://www.newidea.com.au/ryan-gosling-dumps-pregnant-eva-mendes", "title": "Ryan Gosling and pregnant love Eva Mendes 'have broken up'", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "According to reports today Oscar winner Ryan Gosling, 36, has grown tired of his actress partner Eva Mendes' allegedly  ways.", "news_keywords": "Ryan Gosling, Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling Eva Mendes, Ryan Gosling Eva Mendes split, Ryan Gosling Eva Mendes break up, Ryan Gosling Eva Mendes broken up, Eva Mendes pregnant", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "New Idea Magazine", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225/https://www.newidea.com.au/ryan-gosling-dumps-pregnant-eva-mendes", "title": "Ryan Gosling and pregnant love Eva Mendes 'have broken up'", "description": "According to reports today Oscar winner Ryan Gosling, 36, has grown tired of his actress partner Eva Mendes' allegedly \"controlling and insecure\" ways.", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/13580/eva-ryan.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 640}}, "twitter": {"title": "Ryan Gosling and pregnant love Eva Mendes 'have broken up'", "description": "According to reports today Oscar winner Ryan Gosling, 36, has grown tired of his actress partner Eva Mendes' allegedly \"controlling and insecure\" ways.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/media/13580/eva-ryan.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171005082225im_/https://www.newidea.com.au/ryan-gosling-dumps-pregnant-eva-mendes"}, "fb": {"admins": 863618607005758, "pages": 140279489324860}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507169503.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
