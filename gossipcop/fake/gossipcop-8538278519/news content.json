In the released song, the lyric is \"I've got a boyfriend/He's older than us/He's in the club doing I don't know what,\" which led some to believe the line was about Calvin Harris (DJ, who's 33) or Tom Hiddleston (British actor, 36, the last boyfriend Swift was with before getting with Alwyn; she dated Hiddleston immediately after Harris.)\n\nBut in a new behind-the-scenes, making of the song video that AT&T released today, Swift sings her original lyrics for the song. She toys with the \"I've got a boyfriend\" line for a bit, and, during one song-writing session, seems keen on this lyric, which leads into the \"You're so gorgeous\" chorus:\n\nI\u2019ve got a boyfriend/he\u2019s older than us/I haven\u2019t seen him in a couple of months/I go through phases when it comes to love/I\u2019m nothing that you want, but I must say you're so gorgeous...\n\nWatch it at the 3:00 mark:\n\nAt first glance, this could suggest the ex Swift is singing about is Harris; the two spent a lot of their relationship apart because of Swift touring for 1989 and Harris playing DJ gigs around the world. Swift went to the Met Gala, the night she and Hiddleston hit it off, alone.\n\nBut Swift dated Hiddleston right before being seen for the first time with Alwyn in October 2016. Hiddleswift first got together in June and lasted until September.\n\nA lot of the time during their relationship, Hiddleston was in Australia shooting Thor: Ragnarok\u2014Swift even visited him over there and was spotted with the Thor cast at the movies\u2014after they had a pretty intense start.\n\nHiddleston and Swift arriving in Australia together in July 2017. Getty Images\n\nAt the time of the Hiddleswift split, a source told E! that Swift \"felt he wanted to take the relationship to be too public, and she was not happy about it and thought it was too much publicity.\" If this original \"Gorgeous\" lyric really is inspired by Hiddleston, it may have been that the flame the two had also burned out (perhaps Hiddleston's alleged thirst for publicity extinguished it), and Swift moved on.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-social-comp-1509113466.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/main-press-1663301221.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.152xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/a271d41f-0669-4ca5-bf60-6114136b2002/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1664902339_24192.jpg?crop=0.5625xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/musician-ed-sheeran-and-fiance-cherry-seaborn-look-on-news-photo-1579811778.jpg?crop=0.444xw:0.703xh;0.325xw,0.297xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blackpink-perform-at-the-sahara-tent-during-the-2019-news-photo-1659361964.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.162xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-tom-calvin-1509568962.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.0750xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/performs-onstage-at-the-2022-mtv-vmas-at-prudential-center-news-photo-1661746382.jpg?crop=0.628xw:0.940xh;0.181xw,0.0384xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-joe-1504134628.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bjork-dscf7056-1663779710.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0141xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/ell.h-cdn.co/assets/16/36/1473199220-gettyimages-545409760.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dardan-krasniqi-1661524579.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0844xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joe-taylor-1504449056.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1661744455.jpg?crop=0.631xw:0.947xh;0.204xw,0.0529xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-tom-calvin-1509568962.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/recording-artist-britney-spears-and-sir-elton-john-attend-news-photo-1661443812.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.946xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "http://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blackpink-pink-venom-1660847180.png?crop=0.611xw:1.00xh;0.195xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/2b0407e3-6b5b-43f0-9741-3a9276c2439f/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1659628914_22845.jpg?crop=0.5625xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm090122fobcover-001a-1660154505.jpg?crop=0.769xw:1.00xh;0.163xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/599f7659e694aa7d67bd1e59/thumb_1503622748_204x124.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-tom-calvin-1509568962.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/music/a13135850/taylor-swift-original-ex-boyfriend-lyric-in-gorgeous-tom-hiddleston-calvin-harris-reference/", "title": "Taylor Swift's Original Ex-Boyfriend Lyric in \"Gorgeous\" Is Telling", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Taylor Swift's Original Ex-Boyfriend Lyric in \"Gorgeous\" - Tom Hiddleston/Calvin Harris Song Reference", "description": "In a new behind-the-scenes, making of the song video that AT&T released today for \"Gorgeous\", Swift sings her original lyrics for the song\u2014and makes a telling tweak to the ex-boyfriend line.
