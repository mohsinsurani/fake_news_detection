Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott have had their fair share of ups and downs throughout their relationship, but they always seem to find their way back to each other.\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and the rapper went public with their romance at Coachella in April 2017, just weeks after she split from her boyfriend of four years, Tyga. The pair welcomed their daughter, Stormi, in February 2018.\n\nAfter more than two years together, Us Weekly confirmed that the couple was taking a break from their romance. \u201cKylie and Travis have been on and off at various times throughout their relationship,\u201d a source explained in October 2019, shortly after news broke of their split. \u201cKylie still loves Travis and this isn\u2019t considered a full breakup to either of them.\u201d\n\nA second insider told Us at the time that the pair had never had a \u201ctraditional relationship\u201d but were \u201cvery much in love\u201d before deciding to take a break.\n\nEven during their time apart, the Kylie Cosmetics founder and Grammy nominee remained close and were committed to working together to raise their daughter. The couple made such a great team that even their close friends were rallying for them to reconcile and could \u201csee them getting back together at some point in the future.\u201d\n\nJenner gushed over the strong coparenting relationship she had with the \u201cButterfly Effect\u201d rapper during an interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar in March 2020. \u201cWe\u2019re, like, best friends,\u201d she said of Scott at the time. \u201cWe both love [our daughter] Stormi and want what\u2019s best for her. We stay connected and coordinated. I think about [my parents, Kris Jenner and Caitlyn Jenner], in situations with Stormi, what they would do. They were very hands-on with me, and I want the same for Stormi.\u201d\n\nLater that month, multiple outlets confirmed that the pair were back together. Entertainment Tonight reported that the reality TV personality and her former flame had been seeing each other for about a month, while a source told In Touch that they were taking things slow due to Jenner\u2019s trust issues.\n\nKylie\u2019s nephew Mason Disick denied the rumors, however. \u201cNo, Kylie and Travis are not back together, he said in a March 2020 Instagram live.\n\nIn the year that followed, the duo focused on coparenting their daughter amid the COVID-19 pandemic. In May 2021, they were spotted looking cozy when Kylie attended one of Travis\u2019 concerts at Liv Nightclub in Miami.\n\n\u201cThey were visibly together and definitely seemed to be enjoying themselves and each other\u2019s company,\u201d an eyewitness told Us exclusively.\n\nUs confirmed in August 2021 that the on-again, off-again couple are expecting baby No. 2. \u201cShe has been trying for almost two years to get pregnant,\u201d a source exclusively told Us at the time.\n\nScroll down to see the complete timeline of Jenner and Scott\u2019s relationship.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/673161686_travis-scott-kylie-jenner-zoom-ee8ed029-a575-4f12-add9-23ebbd66407f.jpg?w=1600&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-relationship-timeline-august-2022-roses-promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-relationship-timeline-august-2022-roses-promo.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez", "Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kylie-jenner-and-travis-scott-relationship-timeline-w505074/", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott: Relationship Timeline", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "gallery", "post-tags": "celebrity news,News,The Kardashians", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "See a timeline of Kylie Jenner's relationship with Travis Scott, with whom she shares daughter Stormi Webster \u2014 photo gallery", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "So Spoiled!
