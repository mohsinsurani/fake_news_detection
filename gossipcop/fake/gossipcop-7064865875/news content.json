Details about and Pitt \u2013 also on board as a producer - and Negga\u2019s role are being kept under wraps for now.\n\nLast year Negga, 35, attracted international attention when she received an Academy Award nomination for her role in the historical drama Loving. Although she missed out on the Best Actress gong at the ceremony in February, she\u2019s clearly not stuck for work.\n\nIFTA winner Negga, who initially rose to fame on home shores in RTE\u2019s Love/Hate and E4 series Misfits, is currently starring in season two of AMC's comic book adaptation Preacher. The actress appears opposite her other half, British boyfriend Dominic Cooper, 39, in the drama.\n\n'It would be so lonely if he wasn't there,' she said about working with her leading man.\n\n'People say, \"Never go out with an actor.\" But if you were with someone with a normal job, and one of you had to go away, how would that work?'\n\nThe couple, who have been together since 2009, maintain a low-profile approach to their relationship.\n\nHowever, last month in an interview with Net-a-Porter\u2019s The Edit, Negga gave some insight into her romance with Cooper and spoke about the idea of having children. She revealed she is constantly thinking about 'when' and 'if' she would like children.\n\nNegga said: 'By the time you're in a great relationship, it's like, oh, I'm 35. S***. So there is part of your thinking that is: \"Do I want kids? When? If? How?\"\n\n'It's there, all the time, preoccupying me. And that's not being an actor, it's being a woman. I don't know what [job] really creates a safe space for a woman to have time out, prolong the human race, and return to work in a very supportive way.'", "images":
