More charges are expected as a grand jury continues to hear testimony in the state\u2019s case with at least four women expected to testify, a source familiar with the investigation told CNN.\n\nMore than 80 women have accused Weinstein of sexual harassment or assault in alleged incidents that span several decades.\n\nWeinstein has in the past denied all allegations of \u201cnon-consensual sex\u201d and continues to do so.\n\n\u201cMr. Weinstein has always maintained that he has never engaged in non-consensual sexual behavior with anyone. Nothing about today\u2019s proceedings changes Mr. Weinstein\u2019s position,\u201d attorney Benjamin Brafman said in a statement after the arraignment. \u201cHe has entered a plea of not guilty and fully expects to be exonerated.\u201d\n\nStill, news that Weinstein is facing criminal charges prompted strong reactions from Hollywood figures, including some of his accusers.\n\n\u201cSending love to all my sisters today who stood up against a monster\u2026 so many emotions\u2026 I am proud of and grateful to you all,\u201d actress Mira Sorvino tweeted.\n\nSorvino told The New Yorker in October that Weinstein made unwanted sexual advances toward her when they worked on a project together in 1995.\n\nActress Anne Hathaway shared on her Instagram a statement from Time\u2019s Up, the entertainment industry-backed advocacy group and legal defense fund that emerged in the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal to support women in the workplace.\n\n\u201cToday a man whose actions were so egregious that they spawned a global reckoning has been taken into custody,\u201d the statement from the group said. \u201cHarvey Weinstein shattered the lives of an untold number of women. We stand with them and remain in solidarity with women everywhere who have faced unsafe and abusive workplaces. We look forward to seeing justice prevail.\u201d\n\nAnother one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, Asia Argento, tweeted shortly after Weinstein turned himself in.\n\n\u201cThis is the only movie Harvey Weinstein will be remembered for #perpwalk,\u201d she wrote.\n\nActivist Tarana Burke, who started the #MeToo movement, released a statement to CNN on Friday.\n\n\u201cThis is not a moment to revel in how the mighty have fallen but instead in how the silenced have spoken up, stood together and survived,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWeinstein\u2019s arrest, for the women who have accused him and others like them around the world, I\u2019m sure feels like a moment of catharsis and it should serve as a cautionary tale for others like [Morgan] Freeman and every day people who toe the line between unacceptable and criminal behavior.\u201d\n\nComedian Kathy Griffin had a strongly worded reaction: \u201cRot in prison you piece of sh*t.\u201d\n\nActress Rosanna Arquette, who came forward with allegations of her own in a New York Times follow-up report, has not made an official statement, but replied to one internet commenter who told her in part, \u201cIf you gals would have spoke up their (sic) would not have been others.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow dare you,\u201d Arquette replied. \u201cWe all spoke up years ago and no one listened. Most were threatened to shut up.\u201d\n\nFormer actress Rose McGowan, one of the first women to publicly accuse Weinstein of assault, gave an interview to Megyn Kelly upon news of Weinstein\u2019s arrest, saying, \u201cI can say this, the man who pinned me down had handcuffs on him today.\u201d\n\nShe also tweeted, \u201cWe got you, Harvey Weinstein, we got you.\u201d", "images":
