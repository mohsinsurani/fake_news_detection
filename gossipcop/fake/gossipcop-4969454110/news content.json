Our doubts were confirmed after checking in with a rep for Carey, who exclusively tells us the outlet\u2019s report is entirely \u201cfalse.\u201d We\u2019re assured the singer wasn\u2019t flirting with her colleague, nor did the two go home together.\n\nNaturally, Life & Style isn\u2019t the best source when it comes to finding accurate news about the singer. Gossip Cop previously busted the tabloid for making up a story about Carey hiring a speech therapist to teach her to speak with a British accent. GC also corrected the magazine after it falsely claimed Carey gives money to boyfriend Bryan Tanaka so he can buy her gifts. The publication\u2019s latest article suggesting Carey and Montana are more than just collaborators is equally bogus.\n\nPhoto: AOL", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/60d9e1a560d82bb09b20f664?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(180,60)&quality=80", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Shuster"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "description": "Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d", "url": "https://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "type": "article", "site_name": "Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#5ba294", "twitter": {"title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "description": "Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d", "url": "https://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@QueensFeast", "creator": "@QueensFeast", "domain": "charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com", "tile": {"image": {"alt": "Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d"}, "template": {"testing": 1}}, "": {"tile": {"image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)"}}}, "parsely-title": "Mariah Carey & French Montana Did NOT Flirt In Recording Studio | Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "description": "Carey and Montana recently worked together on a remix of his hit single \u201cUnforgettable.\u201d", "keywords": "Mariah Carey (31885), French Montana (281545)", "parsely-tags": "Mariah Carey (31885), French Montana (281545)", "parsely-link": "https://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wOC8yNS81OWEwOTMzYjFkZTVhMTI5NzQ1YTRkMjYvNTlhMDkzM2IwYzJhZmYzMGZlZjFmYjMyX29fRl92MC5qcGc=?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "Queen's Feast: Charlotte Restaurant Week", "fb": {"pages": 106038777280}, "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-09-12-mariah-carey-french-montana-did-not-flirt-in-recording-studio/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-12T13:54:00Z", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "parsely-author": "Andrew Shuster", "parsely-section": "Trending"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505170800.0, "source": "http://charlotterestaurantweek.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
