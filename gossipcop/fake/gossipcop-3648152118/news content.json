Bi people like Nathalie just want publicity. Stay in the closet, don't stay in the closet... Who gives a shit. It's all the same if she's dating/is married to a man anyways. You should direct your anger at the closeted lesbos who beard and profit from maintaining a hetero facade\n\nGuest Jul 1 2017, 01:33 PM Post #3172\n\nUnregistered\n\n\n\nGuest Jul 1 2017, 03:15 AM Guest Jul 1 2017, 02:03 AM Guest Jun 30 2017, 10:53 PM\n\nQuoting limited to 3 levels deep[url=/p/-25xJekTT9/?taken-by=hollymiranda]instagram post[/url] and in their gossip Natalie Morales is married to Sean Mennie, but I can't find any proof or even gossip from other sources for it.

Yeah, but that woman is not following Natalie on fb now. I am thinking they are no longer together. I also see Holly unfollowed Sean on IG. Yeah, but that woman is not following Natalie on fb now.

She can keep a secret bf or even husband and everybody would say she just private. If she did that with a gf or wife, then all would yell closeted.\n\nGuest Jul 1 2017, 02:12 PM Post #3173\n\nUnregistered\n\n\n\nGuest Jun 30 2017, 10:20 PM Guest Jun 30 2017, 10:04 PM Guest Jun 30 2017, 09:43 PM\n\nQuoting limited to 3 levels deep Quoting limited to 3 levels deep http://s1.zetaboards.com/L_Anon/single/?p=18577533&t=4615003 Did you even read her article?
