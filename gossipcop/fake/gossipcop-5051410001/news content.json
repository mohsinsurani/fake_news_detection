Despite \u201cchatter\u201d on the police radio, the Los Angeles\n\nPolice Department says it did not respond to Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\u2018s L.A. house on Saturday, March 4.\n\nThe potentially dramatic scenario began earlier\n\non Saturday when the Southern California Monitoring Association\u2019s Twitter account posted about police receiving a call about a prowler who was allegedly shot at a house believed to belong to the reality star.\n\nThe scanner and radio monitoring club\u2019s account then claimed there was a home invasion and a maid was shot by an unnamed suspect at Kardashian\u2019s home.\n\nThe SCMA later tweeted that the caller disconnected as authorities entered the home. \u201cAppears Kim Kardashian home is victim of SWATTING call. Officers did breach door to enter,\u201d the account wrote, confirming that the call was a false alarm.\n\nThe LAPD told Us Weekly earlier on Saturday that \u201cthere was no crime,\u201d but the watch commander for the West LAPD later clarified to Us that \u201cthey did not respond to any call like this today.\u201d\n\nKardashian\u2019s rep tells Us Weekly that the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star was not swatted and any police calls made on Saturday have \u201cnothing to do with Kim.\u201d\n\nThe Selfish author\u2019s mom, Kris Jenner, was a victim of swatting back in 2013, when authorities were called to the home the momager shared with then-husband Bruce Jenner. Kardashian later tweeted, \u201cThese prank calls are NOT funny! People can get arrested for this! I hope they find out who is behind this. Its dangerous & not a joke!\u201d\n\nThese prank calls are NOT funny! People can get arrested for this! I hope they find out who is behind this. Its dangerous & not a joke! \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) January 19, 2013\n\nLil Wayne, Ashton Kutcher and Justin Bieber were also previous victims of swatting calls, which are hoaxes in which police are deceived and called to a location under false pretenses.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-b960abd6-b2b0-4c11-bd3b-b689f14adb26.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2397px%2C1348px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-b960abd6-b2b0-4c11-bd3b-b689f14adb26.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2397px%2C1258px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-b960abd6-b2b0-4c11-bd3b-b689f14adb26.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2397px%2C1258px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/police-respond-to-kim-kardashians-house-in-apparent-swatting-call-w470430/", "title": "Kim Kardashian and Kanye West Not Victims of Swatting, LAPD Clarifies", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Los Angeles Police Department clarified reports that it was called to Kim Kardashian's house on Saturday, March 4, after receiving an apparent swatting call \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim K. and Kanye Not Victims of Swatting, LAPD Clarifies", "description": "The Los Angeles Police Department clarified reports that it was called to Kim Kardashian's house on Saturday, March 4, after receiving an apparent swatting call \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/police-respond-to-kim-kardashians-house-in-apparent-swatting-call-w470430/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:32:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-b960abd6-b2b0-4c11-bd3b-b689f14adb26.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2397px%2C1258px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-b960abd6-b2b0-4c11-bd3b-b689f14adb26.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2397px%2C1258px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-03-04T20:42:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:32:19+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim K. and Kanye Not Victims of Swatting, LAPD Clarifies", "description": "The Los Angeles Police Department clarified reports that it was called to Kim Kardashian's house on Saturday, March 4, after receiving an apparent swatting call \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/kim-kardashian-b960abd6-b2b0-4c11-bd3b-b689f14adb26.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2397px%2C1258px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488660120.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
