The attacks \u2014 a hit-and-run of pedestrians and multiple stabbings \u2014 occurred at two locations near the Thames River and were deemed \u201cterrorist incidents\u201d by local law enforcement. As reported by the Associated Press, \u201cThe incidents occurred on [London Bridge] and at Borough Market, a popular area with bars and restaurants on the south side of the bridge.\u201d Police killed three suspects just eight minutes after the initial emergency call.\n\nGrande is scheduled to perform Sunday in Manchester, England, at a star-studded benefit concert for victims of the Manchester terror attack that occurred following her performance in that city last month.\n\nOther celebrities to send words of support included authors J.K. Rowling, Stephen King, and Neil Gaiman, Spider-Man: Homecoming star Tom Holland, singers Demi Lovato, Joe Jonas, and Liam Gallagher, and actors Gina Rodriguez, Cara Delevingne, Kumail Nanjiani, and Gregg Sulkin.\n\nIn the wake of Saturday\u2019s attack, President Donald Trump first retweeted a post from the Drudge Report about the incident. That retweet drew the ire of many online, including NBC News, which called out the president for passing along unconfirmed information.\n\n\u201cPres. Trump has used Twitter to share news report on London incident,\u201d the NBC News feed wrote. \u201cWe aren\u2019t relaying president\u2019s retweet, as the info is unconfirmed.\u201d\n\nLater, President Trump tweeted, \u201cWe need to be smart, vigilant and tough. We need the courts to give us back our rights. We need the Travel Ban as an extra level of safety!\u201d The reference to Trump\u2019s executive order \u2014 which Press Secretary Sean Spicer previously insisted is not a \u201cban\u201d despite Trump\u2019s words to the contrary \u2014 was criticized by many online, including MSNBC host Joe Scarborough. \u201cAttention Supreme Court \u2013>Now he\u2019s calling it a travel ban again and giving you reason to uphold the lower courts\u2019 rulings, \u201cScarborough wrote. \u201cWhat a dope.\u201d\n\nThe ACLU Twitter feed also took note of Trump\u2019s use of the term \u201cban.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-627683810-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-627683810-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F06%2Fgettyimages-627683810-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Rosen", "June", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/news/2017/06/03/london-terror-attack-ariana-grande-celebs-react/", "title": "Ariana Grande leads support for victims of London terror attack", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "J.K.
