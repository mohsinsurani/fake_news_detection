To get the look of an ex-Marine, Holmes\u2019 gym time consisted of lifting weights and personal training sessions that sometimes lasted two hours.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be authentic to a person who trained in the military,\u201d she said. \u201cWhich means someone who wasn\u2019t always paying attention to the mirror and who was in shape not for vanity, but because that\u2019s what her job called for.\u201d\n\nBen Wats\n\nBut her intense training had offscreen benefits as well, including stronger muscles and a newfound love of boxing.\n\n\u201cI was a five-pound weight person, and now I can do 15, 20,\u201d Holmes shared. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been doing a lot of boxing, which I had never done before. It\u2019s thrilling. You can get out the stress of the day. I just go in there and think of all the mundane things that bother me. Traffic! I put off all my calls till after boxing, because it puts me in a much calmer place.\u201d\n\nBen Wats\n\nBen Wats\n\nHolmes also gets real about staying fit \u2014 with her 11-year-old daughter Suri in mind.\n\n\u201cBeing a parent, every choice I make it with my child in mind. So part of getting in shape is to be an example,\u201d she told the magazine.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Katie Holmes Quietly Supports Long-Rumored Partner Jamie Foxx at Store Opening\n\nThe Dawson\u2019s Creek alum sticks to mainly plant-based foods but makes an exception for the occasional slice of pepperoni pizza.\n\n\u201cIt used to be about fitting into my jeans, and I\u2019m so sick of that,\u201d she said of her eating habits. \u201cNow I think of it more as a health decision.\u201d\n\nBen Wats\n\nHolmes also likes group workout classes like SoulCycle, sharing that she enjoys the \u201csense of community.\u201d\n\nShe explained, \u201cLike, if she can do it, I can do it too.\u201d", "images":
