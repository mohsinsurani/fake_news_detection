Bella Hadid has been enjoying her time with The Weeknd again but fears it\u2019s a rebound romance! Get the details!\n\nBella Hadid, 21, and The Weeknd, 27, have been hanging out again and may be getting ready to officially reignite the spark they once had, but it turns out Bella\u2019s worried she\u2019ll be nothing more than a rebound! \u201cBella was really touched that Abel took the time out to send her flowers and to let her know that he was thinking of her, she thinks it was super sweet of him,\u201d a source close to the model EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com. \u201cHe\u2019s saying and doing all the right things right now, but Bella is still really cautious of him. She wants to make sure that his intentions are good, and that he\u2019s not just trying to get with her as some kind of rebound romance. Bella has never stopped loving Abel, but he really, really hurt her before, and she doesn\u2019t want to ever feel like that again. She can\u2019t help questioning his timing, now he\u2019s single again he\u2019s suddenly declaring his love for her, but the whole time he was with Selena she didn\u2019t hear a thing from him.\u201d\n\nAs much as we\u2019d love to see these rekindle their romance, we don\u2019t blame her for being fearful that Abel is on the rebound! After all, his relationship with Selena Gomez, 25, was going strong last month! Besides, we can\u2019t imagine how hard it\u2019s got to be for Abel seeing Selena and Justin packing on the PDA so soon after leaving him! Poor guy! However, that doesn\u2019t make rebounding okay! Take a look back at Bella and Abel\u2019s relationship right here!\n\nAs we previously reported, the charismatic crooner gifting Bella a bouquet of flowers when she walked in the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show was one of the first signs that he was after her again! \u201cBella loved every minute of the show, and she looked absolutely stunning,\u201d an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cThe event went off without a hitch, and it was a raging success. Bella was on a high the whole night. Abel sent her a gorgeous, huge bouquet of flowers along with a super sweet note telling her how amazing she is and how proud of her he is.\u201d We\u2019ll just have to wait and see if this rekindled romance is going to last this time!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Bella would be a rebound romance for The Weeknd?
