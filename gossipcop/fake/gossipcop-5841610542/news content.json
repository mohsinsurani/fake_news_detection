The Philadelphia-based rapper was recently sentenced to four years of prison time for a probation violation stemming from a 2007 drug and weapon conviction but new evidence suggests that conviction could have some holes in it. The New York Post reports Reginald V. Graham, who arrested Meek ten years ago for allegedly selling drugs and then threatening to shoot police officers, is on a secret Philadelphia District Attorney's Office list of more than 20 cops with histories of \"lying, racial bias, brutality or abuse of power.\" The list was reportedly created as a means of preventing those officers from testifying in court, but testimony from the cop who arrested Meek still helped send him to jail. While the cop claimed to have seen Meek selling drugs then hiding behind a car with a gun, Meek was reportedly supporting a relative in court at the time of the alleged drug deal. After he was arrested, he has said he was dragged inside a house where all of the police involved britallu attacked him. \"I was getting beat by at least four cops. I was laying on my stomach, I was being kicked in my face, punched in my face,\" he recalled. \"I maybe got knocked out two or three times from getting kicked in my face. I had stitches. I had lumps. If you see my mug shot from the pictures I went out [unconscious] like three times \u2026 The handcuff prints on my hand from when you get thrown around with handcuffs, your hands are going to start bleeding \u2026 every last cop hit me.\" The officer who appears on the secret list was the only one to testify against Meek in court. Meek's legal team now plans to ask the Pennsylvania Supreme Court to the rapper's conviction aside and to grant him bail immediately.\n\nCardi B. staffer says Cardi is expecting In recent weeks, Cardi B has repeatedly denied rumors she's expecting her first child.
