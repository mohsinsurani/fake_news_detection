Kate was compared to Princess Diana, so comparisons among royal watchers are nothing new. Reports that Meghan Markle was having a hard time winning the queen's acceptance first surfaced when Prince Harry's new girlfriend was discovered by the media. Today, it doesn't look like the friction is coming from the royal brood, but rather from one of her very own family members.\n\nMeghan Markle did something refreshing and something a bit different than the usual royal protocol from decades past of keeping things under wraps. During a Vanity Fair interview, she had no qualms about making the revelation \"We're a couple. We're in love\" and offering up to the world just how happy she is with Harry, according to Fox News. She was so enthusiastic about her new love that the article was titled, \"Meghan Markle, Wild About Harry.\"\n\nIt has been seen in various reports on how the protocol that comes along with being royal dictates different aspects of a suitable spouse. In Meghan's case, it was because she was previously married that the headlines suggested that the \"Queen might not attend Prince Harry's wedding,\" like the one seen published in July from the U.K.'s Express.\n\nThen there were the \"jealousy\" headline rumors suggesting that Kate was \"jealous\" of Meghan. One such article was seen back in March from Celeb Dirty Laundry. They claimed that Kate may be jealous of Meghan's \"sexy confidence\" on the red carpet, which was a rumor going around at the time in the media. Meghan appears to be able to weather the rumors until they finally disappear from the headlines.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c4ca7c76-1956-4818-b67f-af1d1f0cfe0c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e494db4a-e9aa-4be6-a73c-2041f4691eb1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4663c9853f526626ef9a0979c644cf18?s=800", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4535920/meghan-markle-has-easier-ride-with-prince-harrys-royal-family-than-her-own-regarding-future/", "title": "Meghan Markle Has Easier Ride With Prince Harry's Royal Family Than Her Own Regarding Future?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Has Easier Ride With Prince Harry's Royal Family Than Her Own Regarding Future?", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4535920/meghan-markle-has-easier-ride-with-prince-harrys-royal-family-than-her-own-regarding-future/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Meghan Markle Has Easier Ride With Prince Harry's Royal Family Than Her Own Regarding Future?", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-10-04 21:30:29Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Meghan Markle Has Easier Ride With Prince Harry's Royal Family Than Her Own Regarding Future?", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507152629.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
