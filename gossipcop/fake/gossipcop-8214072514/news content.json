Britney has never been happier than she is now with Charlie! [Britney] wants something simple but memorable, nothing too over-the-top.\"\n\nThe insider further claimed that Britney Spears and Charlie Ebersol were \"mulling another quickie Las Vegas wedding,\" a decision that the \"Pieces of Me\" singer made back in 2004 when she married Jason Alexander.

Multiple reports confirmed that Spears decided to marry her childhood friend on a whim.\n\nAccording to Today, the filed annulment petition provided further explanation of the 55-hour marriage.\n\n\"Plaintiff Spears lacked understanding of her actions to the extent that she was incapable of agreeing to the marriage... Before entering into the marriage the plaintiff and defendant did not know each other's likes and dislikes, each other's desires to have or not have children, and each other's desires as to state of residency.\"\n\nIn an interview with Access Hollywood, Jason Alexander confirmed that the decision to get married was made on a whim.\n\n\"It was just crazy, man. And we were just looking at each other and said, 'Let's do something wild, crazy. Let's go get married, just for the hell of it.'\"\n\nBritney Spears' attorney, David Chesnoff, stated that she was not intoxicated when she decided to initially go through with the marriage.\n\nBritney got engaged to dancer Kevin Federline in July of the same year and became legally married in October.\n\n10 Years Later: Britney Spears and Kevin Federline's #wedding #planner Reflects http://t.co/AQwDXMzfic pic.twitter.com/4y5m5BaieN\n\n\u2014 FilmMyShaadi (@FilmMyShaadi) September 20, 2014\n\nIn November 2006, Britney Spears cited \"irreconcilable differences\" when she filed for divorce from the father of her two sons.
