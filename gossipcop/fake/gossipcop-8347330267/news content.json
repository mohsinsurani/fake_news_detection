The couple are reportedly splurging on $1.5 million in security for their surrogate.\n\nKim Kardashian, 36, and Kanye West, 40, are taking no chances when it comes to the safety of their unborn baby. As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, the power couple have hired round-the-clock security for their surrogate and according to The Sun, it\u2019s coming with a hefty price tag. Kimye is reportedly dropping close to a whopping $1.5 million to make sure that the woman carrying their third child (another daughter) is tucked away safe and sound, according to the outlet\u2019s source. No seriously, they have rented her a secret place and are making sure she\u2019s looked after at all hours!\n\n\u201cKim and Kanye have rented a place about an hour outside LA in a very nondescript suburb in a middle-class neighborhood for their surrogate,\u201d an insider told the Sun. \u201cI mean, this is the last place you would think to find the surrogate for one of the richest families in Hollywood.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a nice house, actually, split level, and Kanye has cameras put in everywhere in the house and outside too for safety and security \u2013 these are state of the art,\u201d the source continued. Now that sounds about as safe as you can get. But after the terrifying robbery Kim went through in Paris last October, we don\u2019t see why they would take any chances!

How much does all this cost, you ask? \u201cSo with the rent on the house, expenses for the security staff and their wages \u2013 that\u2019s around $1.5 million for the surrogate\u2019s safety,\u201d the insider said. \u201cBut of course, it\u2019s worth it \u2013 they want the best for her and their unborn baby.\u201d We totally agree!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Kimye\u2019s decision to splurge on security for their surrogate?
