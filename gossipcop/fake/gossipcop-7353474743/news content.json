The model wrote,\n\n\u201cHow did this get approved by an entire marketing team? Why is okay to tell young kids being fat = ugly?\u201d\n\nHolliday also tagged the film\u2019s star, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz, asking her to comment on the advertisement. Dozens of Twitter users did the same, understandably disgusted by the body-shaming poster.\n\nNow, Moretz has finally chimed in on the controversy. In a series of tweets, the 20-year-old actress said she was \u201cappalled\u201d by the ad, and it hadn\u2019t been approved by her or her team.\n\nThe actress wrote,\n\n\u201cI have now fully reviewed the [marketing] for Red Shoes, I am just as appalled and angry as everyone else, this wasn\u2019t approved by me or my team. Pls know I have let the producers of the film know. I lent my voice to a beautiful script that I hope you will all see in its entirety. The actual story is powerful for young women and resonated with me. I am sorry for the offense that was beyond my creative control.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633d9dc13a56bbe75a4ba3d2/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c41b42bebdf1fd177c06e/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/593030eb34dd9342700a83ea/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-632329528.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/63335f5e4bdd706ef007c8da/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c4a0360c6adbac3e921a3/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/632b1f5fbaa431f47d1aa0df/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/632093f38f5d704b2d45cd26/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/631b8f8e7babfd3e0f994043/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Gillian Fuller"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/chloe-grace-moretz-red-shoes-and-the-7-dwarfs-ad", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Speaks Out About Body-Shaming 'Red Shoes And The 7 Dwarfs' Ad", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz addressed the body-shaming 'Red Shoes and the 7 Dwarfs' advertisement in a series of Tweets on Wednesday.", "id": "59301f0b34dd9342700a83e7", "keywords": "chloe grace moretz,body shaming,tess holliday", "news_keywords": "chloe grace moretz,body shaming,tess holliday", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59301f0b34dd9342700a83e7", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz addressed the body-shaming 'Red Shoes and the 7 Dwarfs' advertisement in a series of Tweets on Wednesday.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/593030eb34dd9342700a83ea/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-632329528.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/593030eb34dd9342700a83ea/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-632329528.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The actress says the advertisement wasn't approved by her team.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Is \"Appalled\" At Her New Movie's Body-Shaming Ad", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/chloe-grace-moretz-red-shoes-and-the-7-dwarfs-ad"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-06-01T16:21:32.768Z", "modified_time": "2017-06-01T16:21:32.768Z", "author": "Gillian Fuller"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "The actress says the advertisement wasn't approved by her team.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5930312f8bcfb52ab5518d92/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/chloe.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz Is \"Appalled\" At Her New Movie's Body-Shaming Ad"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496334092.768, "source": "http://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
