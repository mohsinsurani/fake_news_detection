The Jenner-Kardashian matriarch is reportedly inviting British royalties Kate Middleton and Prince Charles to her crazy Christmas party.\n\nKris Jenner has been known to host outlandish Christmas parties and this year won't be an exception according to Celeb Dirty Laundry. In the past, the great matriarch of the Jenners and Kardashians bought nine Christmas trees and live reindeers for this very reason. On top of that, guests get to take home gift bags worth thousands of dollars. So, who are the lucky souls that get invited to her crazy party? The article claims that the invitation has been extended to the British royalties this year.\n\nAccording to the website, the guest list is one for the books, which allegedly includes Prince William and Kate Middleton. While the author of the article admits that this idea could be pure madness, it goes on to say that Kris Jenner wants the royal family to enjoy the Christmas celebrations with them too. However, Gossip Cop is quick to point out the false claims of this news.\n\nKris Jenner did mention the royalties in a recent interview with Glamour UK. However, this is to say that she wished to invite Prince William and Kate Middleton to one of her parties if given a chance. It should be emphasized that this is only wishful thinking on her part.\n\n\"If I could get any guests at our party, it would have to be Prince William and Duchess Kate. Oh, and they can bring Harry, too.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e1be0684bc30f8a328b5390ff51841a8?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4599312/kris-jenner-wishes-to-invite-kate-middleton-prince-william-to-her-crazy-christmas-party/", "title": "Kris Jenner Wishes To Invite Kate Middleton And Prince William To Her Crazy Christmas Party", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kris Jenner Wishes To Invite Kate Middleton And Prince William To Her Crazy Christmas Party", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4599312/kris-jenner-wishes-to-invite-kate-middleton-prince-william-to-her-crazy-christmas-party/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kris Jenner Wishes To Invite Kate Middleton And Prince William To Her Crazy Christmas Party", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-11-05 21:41:37Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Kris Jenner Wishes To Invite Kate Middleton And Prince William To Her Crazy Christmas Party", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509918097.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
