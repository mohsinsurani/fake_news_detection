Brad Pitt has a new woman in his life: Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor Neri Oxman.\n\n\u201cBrad\u2019s absolutely smitten by her,\u201d a Pitt source reveals exclusively in the new issue of Us Weekly. \u201cTheir chemistry is off the charts.\u201d\n\nSince last fall, Hollywood\u2019s most eligible bachelor, 54, has been quietly dating the award-winning architectural designer, 42, after admiring a line of her 3D-printed chaise lounges at MIT, where she teaches media arts and sciences at the Massachusetts school\u2019s Media Lab. Oxman is the first person to whom Pitt has been linked since his headline-making split from Angelina Jolie in September 2016.\n\n\u201cThey got romantically involved almost right away,\u201d the insider tells Us. \u201cHe\u2019s been going to great lengths to make sure he\u2019s not spotted by prying eyes.\u201d\n\nStill, that hasn\u2019t stopped Pitt and Oxman from taking secret trips. \u201cBrad and Neri have traveled together internationally on several occasions,\u201d the source reveals, noting that the new couple went to the Design Indaba conference in South Africa in February. (The professor was a featured speaker at the event.)\n\nThough a second Pitt source claims \u201cthis is solely a professional relationship [and] there\u2019s nothing more to it as of now,\u201d the first insider calls that story a cover-up: \u201cThey are very much a couple.\u201d Page Six was first to report news of their romance.\n\nMeanwhile, the actor-director and Jolie, 42, are still working out the details of their divorce settlement. A source told Us in February that the parents of Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9, are trying to keep the case \u201cprivate and they want things to be amicable.\u201d\n\nFor more on Pitt and Oxman\u2019s romance, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands Wednesday, April 11!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brad-pitt-smitten-with-neri-oxman.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brad-pitt-smitten-with-neri-oxman.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-absolutely-smitten-mit-professor-neri-oxman/", "title": "Brad Pitt Is \u2018Absolutely Smitten\u2019 With MIT Professor Neri Oxman", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Exclusive", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Brad Pitt is \u2018absolutely smitten\u2019 with his new love, MIT professor Neri Oxman, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brad Pitt Is \u2018Absolutely Smitten\u2019 With MIT Professor Neri Oxman", "description": "Brad Pitt is \u2018absolutely smitten\u2019 with his new love, MIT professor Neri Oxman, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/brad-pitt-absolutely-smitten-mit-professor-neri-oxman/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-13T16:13:58+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brad-pitt-smitten-with-neri-oxman.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brad-pitt-smitten-with-neri-oxman.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-04-10T20:30:32+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-13T16:13:58+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brad Pitt Is \u2018Absolutely Smitten\u2019 With MIT Professor Neri Oxman", "description": "Brad Pitt is \u2018absolutely smitten\u2019 with his new love, MIT professor Neri Oxman, a source tells Us Weekly exclusively \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/brad-pitt-smitten-with-neri-oxman.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523392232.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
