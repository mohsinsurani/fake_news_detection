The child would have been conceived in September 2013. At that time, the love life of the rapper was difficult to follow, once Rihanna, once Karrueche \u2026 But finally the singer of \u201cLoyal\u201d has his heart set on the 26 years old model\u2026\n\nIf ever since the couple leads a complicated relationship between the \u201cLove you, love you nots\u201d and Chris troubles with the justice, Karrueche has always supported her bad boy, saying she was ready to marry him even though he went to prison. But faced with this surprising news, the young woman decided to officially stop this tormented relationship through her Twitter account:\n\n\u201cListen. One can only take so much. The best of luck to Chris and his family. No baby drama for me.\u201d\n\nApparently unaware of the existence of this child, Karrueche was also taken for a fool. In fact, the child\u2019s mother is not a stranger to her.\n\nTMZ found a picture where we can see Karrueche posing with her arm around Nia\u2018s neck at a party in Las Vegas. One of her best friends, Christina Milian, was also here and so was Breezy who has not been a very good boy that day. The pictures were taken in May 2013 a few months before Nia was pregnant.\n\nIf the singer has still not commented on the topic, a source close to him declares that \u201che is happy to be a dad\u201d and that \u201che wants to be present in the life of his daughter!\u201d\n\nRihanna shocked by the news is convinced that he will fulfill his father\u2019s job. If she has read the article several times before digesting the news, she thinks \u201c Chris will be a good father and take care of his little girl. That\u2019s a big responsibility and something that requires a lot of work, energy and love. She wishes him all the best in this new and very important chapter in his life\u201d, said a source to Hollywood Life.\n\nDo you think Chris Brown will be a good father?", "images":
