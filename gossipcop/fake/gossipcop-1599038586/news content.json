However, considering his lack of motivation, as mentioned by the insider, it seems as if Harley is getting paid to do nothing other than watch Kanye stand around and refuse to take part in the exercises.\n\nThe outlet quotes its source as saying that the fitness studio in Woodland Hills has become one of Kanye West's favorites. And though he has the drive and dedication to get in the best shape possible, upon arriving at the facility, he ends up doing little to nothing, the source alleges.\n\n\"Harley shows Kanye how to do a certain exercise on a machine, Kanye nods in agreement and then they walk over to another machine and do the same thing,\" the insider explains.\n\nThe source adds that despite all the efforts the trainer makes to push West in the right direction, to get the fit body he wants, the father of three just doesn't seem to be interested.\n\nOf course, the rumor concerning Kanye West's laziness at the gym comes just weeks after it was claimed that the aging rapper is still recovering from his infamous meltdown in November.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/2146221c3bb32c670d1053a99949feba?s=800", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4313038/kanye-west-lazy-hires-personal-trainer-but-doesnt-work-out-amid-meltdown-recovery/", "title": "Kanye West Reportedly Lazy, Hires Personal Trainer But Doesn't Work Out Amid Meltdown Recovery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kanye West Reportedly Lazy, Hires Personal Trainer But Doesn't Work Out Amid Meltdown Recovery", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4313038/kanye-west-lazy-hires-personal-trainer-but-doesnt-work-out-amid-meltdown-recovery/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kanye West Reportedly Lazy, Hires Personal Trainer But Doesn't Work Out Amid Meltdown Recovery", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-06-21 17:31:27Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Kanye West Reportedly Lazy, Hires Personal Trainer But Doesn't Work Out Amid Meltdown Recovery", "keywords": "Fitness, Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498066287.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
