Blake Shelton left his girlfriend of two years Gwen Stefani high and dry when he dumped her before heading off on tour in February, In Touch has exclusively learned, and she\u2019s not taking it well. \u201cGwen doesn\u2019t know what hit her,\u201d said the insider. \u201cShe\u2019s heartbroken.\u201d\n\nBut wait, Gwen just posted a photo with Blake three days ago, so what gives? Apparently, it\u2019s a desperate attempt to ignore the truth. \u201cShe continues to send him loving social media support from LA while he\u2019s been out on the road,\u201d said another insider. \u201cBut Blake has drastically slowed regular communication with her.\u201d He certainly hasn\u2019t reciprocated her online affection.\n\n\u201cBlake\u2019s through with Gwen\u2019s neediness and all the drama: her demanding, critical ex-husband and her jealousy of him and other women,\u201d explained the source. Apparently, Gwen was jealous over his closeness with The Voice winner Chloe Kohanski, and Blake got sick of trying to make her trust him. \u201cShe told him she didn\u2019t want to spend her life in fear of her famous partner cheating on her.\u201d\n\n\u201cBlake told Gwen that he was going to be doing the latter part of the monthlong Country Freaks Tour without her,\u201d said the source. \u201cGwen was so used to accompanying him on tour, she was upended. After their nastiest argument ever, Blake took off without even saying goodbye. It was a real breaking point in the relationship.\u201d Watch the video below to look back at the couple in happier times.\n\nEven worse, Blake has been looking for solace with newly-single ex-wife Miranda Lambert! \u201cMiranda reached out to Blake via text,\u201d said the insider. \u201cUltimately, they buried the hatchet and have been supporting each other through their latest troubled relationships. They\u2019ve become close friends and allies over the past month or so. They have developed into close confidantes and are sharing intimate details of their lives.\u201d We can only imagine how Gwen would feel about that.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gwen-stefani.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gwen-stefani.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/gwen-stefani-dumped-156076/", "title": "Gwen Stefani Dumped by Blake Shelton Over Jealousy and Drama (EXCLUSIVE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Music's hottest couple is a couple no more.
