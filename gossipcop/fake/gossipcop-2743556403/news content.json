(Photo: Yahoo Entertainment)\n\nIt\u2019s a weird time in the world: Children are being killed in school, politicians are fighting over whether we actually need to do something about it, and yet \u2014 like clockwork \u2014 the new celebrity weeklies are dissecting Jennifer Aniston\u2019s love life.\n\nOf course, it wasn\u2019t your typical week for \u201cLonely Jen,\u201d the sort of fictional persona the tabloids have created with embellished details of the Friends alum\u2019s real life. She announced the end of her second marriage. And while the 49-year-old actress and Justin Theroux, 46, said in their joint statement that \u201cWhatever else is printed about us\u201d beyond their own comment \u201cis someone else\u2019s fictional narrative,\u201d the mags \u2014 from the gold standard People to kitty litter box liner OK! \u2014 had no problem crafting those narratives. And crafty they are. Here are the most ridiculous/sensational/silly stories of the lot\u2026\n\n1. Justin found Jen\u2019s Post-it notes collection from Brad Pitt, and the impact was \u201chuge.\u201d We feel dumber by the second even typing this, but Us Weekly reports that Justin \u201cstumbled upon old Post-it notes Brad had written\u201d back when they were together. (They divorced in 2005, after he left her for Angelina Jolie, thus giving birth to the whole \u201cLonely Jen\u201d tabloid storyline.) The mag described them as \u201csweet little Post-its that said things like, \u2018You looked nice tonight,\u2019 or, \u2018Miss you already.\u2019\u201d (Not exactly sonnets, but\u2026) While Jen assured Justin that the \u201clove notes\u201d really \u201cweren\u2019t a big deal,\u201d Theroux \u201cwasn\u2019t thrilled.\u201d The Leftovers actor \u201chad moments of insecurity like that\u201d in their relationship in which he was \u201cfrequently out of his element.\u201d\n\n2. Jen dumped Justin for Brad because it was \u201cpointless\u201d to fight their attraction \u201cany longer.\u201d OK! magazine just went for it, claiming \u201cJen dumped Justin for Brad,\u201d using italics and everything. Even though People magazine has said that Jen and Brad straight up \u201chaven\u2019t seen each other for ages\u201d and \u201cfor well over a decade now they have lived totally separate lives,\u201d OK! insists that Aniston ended her marriage to reunite with Pitt. \u201cThey never stopped loving each other, and realized it\u2019s pointless to fight it any longer. They\u2019re soul mates and \u2026 the stars are aligning for them to get back together,\u201d read the breathless copy.\n\nStory continues\n\n3. Justin dumped Jen after Brad texted her to congratulate her on the Architectural Digest cover. Jen and Brad have maintained that they text now and then, and In Touch used that factoid to push its narrative. The tab wrote that, despite Jen and Justin saying they split in December, it was really after Jen appeared on the February cover of AD. That is when Brad texted her to extend his \u201cbest wishes,\u201d as someone who has also covered the magazine. \u201cDesign is so important to them,\u201d a source said of exes Jen and Brad. Brad\u2019s text didn\u2019t go over well with Justin, according to In Touch. \u201cHe saw the message on Jen\u2019s phone and was annoyed his wife was texting with her ex over their love of design.\u201d And that caused their final split.\n\n4. Jen and Brad have been having \u201csecret sleepovers.\u201d Which brings us here. The same mag reports that after Justin got mad that Brad texted Jen, \u201cJen showed up at Brad\u2019s door.\u201d The exes know that they\u2019re \u201cmeant to be back together\u201d and \u201cthey\u2019ve been having \u2018secret sleepovers.\u2019\u201d The story went on to say that Angelina would \u201chit the roof\u201d if she heard about the secret trysts.\n\n5. Justin has a mistress. But don\u2019t worry, y\u2019all \u2014 Justin\u2019s got his own side piece. Life & Style said that it was Jen\u2019s jealousy that did them in and \u201cnow she believes he\u2019s dumped her for another woman.\u201d The story paints him as \u201ca classic ladies\u2019 man,\u201d adding that \u201cit has always driven her up the wall\u201d because \u201cJen\u2019s got a jealous streak a mile wide.\u201d In Touch also claims Justin has a mistress, but their evidence is an anonymous comment on one of Justin\u2019s Instagram photos featuring Jen and Justin that said, \u201cI know a few people who saw him with his mistress in N.Y.\u201d Solid reporting.\n\n6. Jen\u2019s been hanging out with Brad\u2019s kids. Yet another claim by In Touch is that \u2014 while Brad\u2019s custody agreement is vague and the kids mostly seem to be with Jolie \u2014 during one of Jen and Brad\u2019s \u201cmore intimate moments\u201d since they reconciled, he \u201cintroduced Jen to several of his children.\u201d\n\n7. Jen is now \u201cadopting.\u201d But Jen doesn\u2019t need Brad\u2019s kids in her life to feel like a whole woman, because she\u2019s adopting! Since her husband \u201cditched her to hobnob with models,\u201d Aniston is \u201cbuilding a new family,\u201d according to Star. Oh, and not just any kids. The mag claims that her estranged half-brother Alex \u201cAJ\u201d Aniston left his children behind, so Aniston wants to raise them as her own.\n\nPeople magazine\u2019s six-page spread on the breakup was the cover the magazine opted for, beating out the Florida school shooting that took place two days prior. Their story is much less sensational than the others, which is typical, and talked about how Jen and Justin met up on Valentine\u2019s Day for a final goodbye, but \u201cclashing lifestyles and personalities doomed their marriage.\u201d Even therapy didn\u2019t help. As has been reported all along, Jen was \u201cmiserable\u201d whenever they were living in NYC, which was his preference, and he was frustrated that she obsessed over paparazzi and wouldn\u2019t be more \u201cspontaneous.\u201d But, again, the magazine noted that \u2014 despite the hopes and dreams of Twitter \u2014 it\u2019s \u201cunlikely\u201d she\u2019d reunite with Brad, whom she hasn\u2019t seen. While they do text, \u201cThey broke up, and they did it because they have serious issues. They\u2019re not stupid \u2014 they remember why it didn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nBut the tabloids clearly know what does work: \u201cLonely Jennifer\u201d stories. Love triangles with Brad and Jen. And claims of cheating celebrities (sorry, Justin).\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:\n\n", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_w_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QRb0dB16TFI3qmntDiVGvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/704d5100eb70dd0245a7dde7454d984a", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7JOOHnw2N_SFubWRzMV56A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTM0MjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d7f38f00-340b-11eb-b7bf-540525a865da", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/UXXovDuaEGV0ZypFk.17mQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgwO2g9ODA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-images/GLB/2017-10-17/711f88c0-b37f-11e7-8353-c582c6383d28_oath_suzybyrne_03_7589.jpg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/JyneEHhxdk55uXjJ3_0P6w--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTcyMA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/9bHTF0Ayvn_uh8aNnPnIrw--~B/aD0xNTM2O3c9MjA0ODthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/704d5100eb70dd0245a7dde7454d984a", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197800334&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fentertainment%2Ffights-post-notes-secret-sleepovers-brad-jennifer-anistons-separation-leads-creative-tabloid-tales-194445753.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QRb0dB16TFI3qmntDiVGvg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD05MDA-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/704d5100eb70dd0245a7dde7454d984a", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/fights-post-notes-secret-sleepovers-brad-jennifer-anistons-separation-leads-creative-tabloid-tales-194445753.html", "title": "Fights over Post-it notes?
