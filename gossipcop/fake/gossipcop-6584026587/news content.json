{"url": "www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/george-clooney-afi", "text": "Perched on a director\u2019s chair in an off-the-shoulder pink Prada gown, as a man brushed her dark, flowing hair into a state of perfection, and a woman touched up her lipstick, Amal Clooney held up her phone to check her image in one hand, and clutched the notecards for an uncharacteristically personal speech in another. Amal, a woman accustomed to prosecuting war criminals at the Hague and speaking up for victims of ISIS at the United Nations, was about to talk to a ballroom full of celebrities about her husband, George Clooney. \u201cI\u2019m just going to remind you, because you\u2019re tall, that you don\u2019t have to lean into the microphone,\u201d a stage manager told Amal, who nodded knowingly.\n\nAmal\u2019s composure stood in contrast to the anxiety of the professional entertainers who came to f\u00eate George at the June 6 A.F.I. Life Achievement Award gala, which TNT will air on Thursday at 10 P.M., E.S.T, and TCM will rebroadcast in September during a night of programming dedicated to George\u2019s work.\n\nVanity Fair was allowed to linger in the wings of Hollywood\u2019s Dolby Theatre during the show, a perfect perch for watching stars like Jennifer Aniston, Courteney Cox, Bill Murray, Diane Keaton, Miley Cyrus, Shirley MacLaine, Julianna Margulies, Jimmy Kimmel, Laura Dern, Anna Kendrick, and Richard Kind pay tribute to and occasionally roast their friend.\n\nAs they projected poise onstage, behind the scenes the stars grappled with stage fright, speech planning, and microphone management. Kendrick, George\u2019s Up in the Air co-star, fidgeted with her rings and described herself to a stage manager as \u201cvery nervous but alright\u201d before taking the stage. Exiting and clearly relieved after finishing her remarks, Kendrick bumped into George\u2019s The Monuments Men and The Good German co-star Cate Blanchett, who looked up from a printout of her speech notes and declared, \u201cI\u2019m so bad at this.\u201d (For what it\u2019s worth, no, she\u2019s not, but isn\u2019t it sort of comforting to know that even the seemingly dauntless Blanchett feels anxious before giving a speech?)\n\n\u201cWhy do we do this? We could just say no,\u201d Kendrick said.\n\n\u201cI was just crying in the bathroom,\u201d Blanchett replied.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go have a whiskey, then I\u2019m gonna go laugh so hard and be like, \u2018This fucking bitch. She\u2019s great,\u2019\u201d Kendrick said as a way to assure Blanchett she would have a cheerleader in the crowd during her speech. \u201cNice to meet you, by the way.\u201d\n\nPresenters Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston onstage during the American Film Institute\u2019s 46th Life Achievement Award Gala Tribute to George Clooney; Bill Murray and Miley Cyrus enjoy a drink together; Cate Blanchett speaks onstage.

The ladies are swapping!\u201d a stage manager said into his headset, as Aniston and Cox decided to enter from the opposite sides of the stage to which they had been assigned (Aniston preferred to enter from stage left). A photographer asked Aniston if it was O.K. to snap a photo. \u201cDo it without me knowing,\u201d Aniston said.\n\n\u201cYou look gorgeous!\u201d Aniston said to Dern, as Dern exited the stage, after delivering a monologue in which she shouted out an early film credit she and George share, the never released Grizzly II: The Predator. \u201cSo funny, too,\u201d Aniston said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know any of that.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6164754905b659f20bfc0b89/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29abea6163e4725653cbe6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-AFI-Clooney-Celeb.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62100dc174854b6731411914/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633d9bec72fe11ef3849c3ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/618c0614fdf674f0522a9fb7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62eb6f666d94d11f641b1212/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5afff3d35ffad5416e1cbe22/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/amal-clooney-george.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/619c0f3188c1944bb3045d8a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "http://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/624135e75c979a86c628fa4c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b1a8434f47a36695449cb0e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Introduces-George.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29ac34c5251462a076a00b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Embed-AFI-Clooney.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62b3340bfa5c67611b2c46ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62411fd30d5203c826a6bf2e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29abea6163e4725653cbe6/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/t-AFI-Clooney-Celeb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b29abea6163e4725653cbe6/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-AFI-Clooney-Celeb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rebecca Keegan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/06/george-clooney-afi", "title": "Exclusive: Here\u2019s What It Was Like Backstage at George Clooney\u2019s A.F.I.
