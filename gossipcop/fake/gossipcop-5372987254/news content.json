The comedian began the movement on Twitter in protest of Trump not appointing a Latino to his cabinet, which every president has done since 1988. Lopez encouraged his followers to change their avatar to a brown square in support.\n\nChrissy Teigen, who has previously criticized Trump on Twitter, commented on the prayer portion of the inauguration. \"What a beautiful prayer. makes me wanna grab my p\u2014,\" she tweeted, alluding to Trump's infamous comment in his and Billy Bush's leaked tape.\n\nTeigen soon commented on the attention her prayer tweet was receiving. \"Oh. it's offensive when I say it though. hm,\" she wrote.\n\nMeanwhile, Shonda Rhimes praised Hillary Clinton and retweeted a list with 45 things to do other than watch the inauguration.\n\nKaty Perry, who was very vocal in her support of Clinton during the campaign, told her her 95 million Twitter followers that she'd be sleeping in instead of watching Trump's inauguration. She also made note that she'd be attending Saturday's Women's March on Washington, alongside other celebrities like Chelsea Handler, Cher, and America Ferrera.\n\nPatton Oswalt also offered up several suggestions via Facebook on Thursday as to what to do or watch instead of the inauguration, which included watching National Geographic, powering down your phone, and going to see an indie film. <iframe src=\"https://www.facebook.com/plugins/post.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fpattonoswalt%2Fposts%2F10154565362887655&width=500\" width=\"500\" height=\"268\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\" class=\"\" allowfullscreen=\"\" resize=\"0\" replace_attributes=\"1\" name=\"\"></iframe>\u00f5\u00b7\u00da\u00ed\u00c6\u00f5i\u00bf}\u00de\u00f4o\u00df\u00d9\u00fe;{\u20219\u00dd\u00de\u00db\u00f5\u00dd\u00dcov\u00f7", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Finauguration.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Finauguration.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Desantis", "Updated January", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/news/2017/01/20/trump-inauguration-celebrity-reactions/", "title": "Celebrities react to Trump inauguration on Twitter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Katy Perry, Shonda Rhimes, and George Lopez are among the stars tweeting about Donald Trump's inauguration.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Celebrities React to Trump Inauguration on Twitter", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/01/20/trump-inauguration-celebrity-reactions/", "description": "Katy Perry, Shonda Rhimes, and George Lopez are among the stars tweeting about Donald Trump's inauguration.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Finauguration.jpg", "width": 1800, "height": 900}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/01/20/trump-inauguration-celebrity-reactions/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Finauguration.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/01/20/trump-inauguration-celebrity-reactions/", "title": "Celebrities React to Trump Inauguration on Twitter", "description": "Katy Perry, Shonda Rhimes, and George Lopez are among the stars tweeting about Donald Trump's inauguration.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=1800&h=900&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F01%2Finauguration.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/news/2017/01/20/trump-inauguration-celebrity-reactions/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1484870400.0, "source": "http://ew.com", "summary": ""}
