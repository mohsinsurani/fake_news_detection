He was introduced to musical theater at a young age and decided to become an actor in 1987. He has credited his mother as the inspiration behind his career, saying that \"I saw her overcome stuff, and I thought if you worked hard at something you'd give yourself a chance\".[10]\n\nCareer\n\nVaughn in 2006\n\nIn 1988, Vaughn was cast in a Chevrolet television commercial and subsequently moved to Hollywood.

Two years later, he was cast in a lead role in a proposed revival of 77 Sunset Strip that was to air on the fledgling WB Television Network, but the project ceased development after initial testing.
