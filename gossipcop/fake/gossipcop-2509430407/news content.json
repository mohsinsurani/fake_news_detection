She wrote a song about how she wanted Bryan to be her husband and she performed it for him while wearing a sexy, glitzy gown. Then she explained that she\u2019s ready for them to make their relationship official.\u201d\n\nBryan gave a \u201chearty yes,\u201d as the insider says, \u201cHe couldn\u2019t believe his luck!\u201d It appears Bryan also thinks he and Mariah belong together, and he always wants to be her baby.
