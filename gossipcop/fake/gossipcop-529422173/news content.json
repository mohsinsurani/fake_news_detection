Hasselhoff, 63, who filed court documents last month to cut off the payments, has shelled out $2.3 million to his former spouse since their divorce in 2006.\n\nBach, 52, receives $252,000 per year from Hasselhoff, but the singer/actor only grosses $112,000 a month. Though Hasselhoff spends $66,000 of it, with living expenses, taxes and Bach\u2019s payments, he has minimal funds to save. And while a court hearing has been set for the end of May, Hasselhoff isn\u2019t sure if his current endeavors will be enough to salvage the payments.\n\nHasselhoff\u2019s European tour was cut short due to poor ticket sales, and he\u2019s reportedly unsure if his new reality show, \u201cHoff the Record,\u201d will find the same success as his previous small-screen endeavors.\n\nWhile the documents obtained by the website noted that Hasselhoff\u2019s assets, including real estate, cars, jewelry and retirement savings, among others, total $1.79 million, the cash flow is drying up.\n\nThough Bach\u2019s team alleges that Hasselhoff\u2019s net worth is more than $120 million, the newly engaged star has already nixed retirement plans to stay afloat.\n\n\u201cI am 63 years of age, and am at an age when I should be preparing for retirement and not having to continue working in order to pay [Bach\u2019s] support,\u201d Hasselhoff said in papers filed in April.\n\nThough he is set to make an appearance in next year\u2019s \u201cBaywatch\u201d reboot, it\u2019s unclear if that paycheck will ease his stress. In addition to Bach\u2019s payments, as well as his own expenses, Hasselhoff is responsible for daughters Hayley, 23, and TaylorAnn, 25, who live under his roof.\n\nA rep for Hasselhoff did not immediately return our request for comment.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/hasselhoff2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/hasselhoff2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=978&h=652&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/05/hasselhoff2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2016/05/20/david-hasselhoff-claims-hes-got-less-4k-in-the-bank/", "title": "David Hasselhoff\u2019s money situation is bleak", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
