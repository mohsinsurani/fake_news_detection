Scott Disick.\n\nIt\u2019s one of those relationships that\u2019s tough to wrap your head around, and not just because of the massive age gap.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nSure, Scott is 15 years Sofia\u2019s senior, but that wouldn\u2019t be so strange if they were 40 and 55.\n\nAt 20 and 35, however, it\u2019s a little odd.\n\nHere, we have a woman who can\u2019t even legally purchase a cocktail in a serious relationship with a man who has three kids by his baby mama \u2014 who\u2019s been famous since Sofia was in grade school.\n\nIt\u2019s an unusual situation, to put it mildly.\n\nPhoto via Getty\n\nAnd now that Kourtney Kardashian has dumped Younes Bendjima, the whole scenario might get even weirder.\n\nYou see, rumor has it that Sofia feels threatened by Kourtney.\n\nSources say she\u2019s constantly worried about Scott leaving her to try and make his family whole again.\n\nAnd now that Kourtney is back on the market, her concerns might be justified.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\n\u201cSofia is furious that Scott and Kourtney are hanging out again,\u201d one insider tells In Touch Weekly.\n\n\u201cShe understands that they have to remain civil for the kids but has become convinced that Kourtney is trying to steal back her man.\"\n\nSofia is reportedly so worried about the situation that she\u2019s taken steps to try and ensure that\n\n\"She recently reached out to her and told her to back off,\" says the source.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nAs for the Lord himself, it seems Scott feels that he\u2019s stuck between a rock and a hard place.\n\n\u201cScott\u2019s caught in the middle,\u201d the insider claims.\n\n\u201cHe loves Sofia but will always have a soft spot for Kourtney.\u201d\n\nThose who know Scott best say that as much as he\u2019s enamored with Sofia, those feelings will eventually go stale, and he\u2019ll come running back to Kourtney.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nIn fact, Scott recently revealed that he\u2019s considered reconciling with Kourtney.\n\n\"We always said we\u2019d try to get back together when we\u2019re 40,\" he said on an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nConsidering Kourtney is currently 39, Sofia may have real cause for concern.\n\nHopefully, if the relationship fizzles, she\u2019ll quickly realize she dodged a bullet by not ending up with Scott.", "images":
