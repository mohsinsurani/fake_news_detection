Within hours of each other on Jan. 24, the former Yankee slugger posted a photo of a cryptic quote: \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with making a mistake, what\u2019s wrong is not making the effort to make it right,\u201d and the Shades of Blue star shared a photo of a gigantic bouquet of flowers Alex had sent her. The next day, she uploaded a selfie and captioned the photo, \u201cIt\u2019s all in God\u2019s hands always,\u201d along with the hashtag #letgoandletgod. According to an insider, \u201cThat was aimed directly at Alex.\u201d\n\nHollywood\u2019s hottest duo is on the verge of flaming out. Jennifer, 48, is privately questioning her relationship with her boyfriend of nearly a year after learning he\u2019s still in touch with former fling Lauren Hunter, a fitness model, who last year claimed in an interview that Alex, 42, had been sexting her for months \u2014 including while he was dating J.Lo. Recently, \u201csomeone went to Jennifer with new details that Alex was still texting with Lauren, and that\u2019s what made Jennifer lose it,\u201d the insider tells In Touch. \u201cOf course, he said it wasn\u2019t physical, and maybe it wasn\u2019t, but in Jennifer\u2019s book, that\u2019s still cheating. They were head-over-heels in love and planning to get engaged. Now Alex\u2019s actions have jeopardized everything.\u201d\n\nThe damage runs deep. Jennifer, who\u2019s endured three failed marriages, \u201cwas heartbroken to hear that Alex was talking to Lauren,\u201d says the insider. \u201cEven though they didn\u2019t meet in person, Jennifer considered it a betrayal. Now she has friends and family watching out for her best interests, which means checking in and asking about Alex\u2019s antics.\u201d\n\nShe has good reason to worry. Last June, a month after Jennifer and Alex made their red carpet debut at the Met Gala in NYC, Lauren claimed in a bombshell interview that she was in frequent contact with the ex-athlete, whom she met at an Equinox gym in 2011. \u201cA week before his relationship with Jennifer was announced, he was asking me to go to Miami,\u201d she claimed. \u201cHe never even mentioned her.\u201d Lauren also alleged that Alex (who has kids Natasha, 13, and Ella, 9, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis) cheated on then-girlfriend Cameron Diaz with her in 2011. Jennifer \u201cwould be an idiot to believe he\u2019d be faithful,\u201d she said. She also called Jennifer too vanilla for him. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s sexually attracted to her,\u201d she dished. \u201cIn bed\u2026 he\u2019s probably picturing me.\u201d\n\nJennifer, mom to nine-year-old twins Max and Emme with ex Marc Anthony, turned a blind eye to the initial interview. Now, she\u2019s not sure what to believe. \u201cJennifer\u2019s still on the fence,\u201d says the insider. \u201cShe can either cut her losses and walk away from the relationship, or she can fight for it. I think she\u2019ll fight for it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jlo-arod.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jlo-arod.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/alex-rodriguez-cheated-on-jennifer-lopez-153623/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Questioning Future With A-Rod After Cheating Allegations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "If a picture speaks a thousand words, then the Instagram accounts of Jennifer Lopez and boyfriend Alex Rodriguez could tell one epic story.
