We exclusively learned the star is struggling with her diet.\n\nThe holidays are known for throwing people off their diets, and apparently, Kylie Jenner, 20, is no exception! But while the reality star is apparently desperate to avoid excess weight gain, she\u2019s finding herself craving all sorts of sugary desserts and unhealthy snacks. We don\u2019t blame her for indulging either \u2014 after all, during the holidays it\u2019s nearly impossible to completely refrain from satisfying your sweet tooth! Click here to see pics of Kylie\u2019s and Khloe Kardashian\u2019s pre-pregnancy bodies.\n\n\u201c Kylie is struggling with pregnancy food cravings. She is overwhelmed with nowhere to turn because there is yummy holiday food everywhere she looks,\u201d a source close to Kylie revealed to HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cShe feels like being pregnant during the holidays is the most challenging time because everywhere she goes there is great food, snacks, and yummy treats.\u201d Regardless, Kylie is at least TRYING to control her cravings. But apparently, it\u2019s easier said than done. \u201c Kylie wants to eat healthier, and she knows how important it is for her baby to get good nutrition, but spending time with her family is making things hard,\u201d our insider explained.\n\nMaking things even worse, Kylie\u2019s been specifically spending a lot of time with her mom, Kris Jenner , 62. And her house is always fully stocked with treats. \u201cShe is often at her mom\u2019s house where there are always muffins, cake, brownies, and other yummy, unhealthy things to eat that she simply can\u2019t say no too.\u201d And while Kylie hasn\u2019t been overly concerned about weight gain in the past, now that she\u2019s pregnant, it\u2019s apparently something she thinks about on a regular basis!\n\n\u201cShe has never worried about her weight, but now that she has a growing belly eating for two, she worries about gaining too much or gaining unhealthy weight,\u201d our source added. \u201cKylie desperately wants to try to have a stricter diet and is trying to eat healthier, but it is hard when dealing with such strong cravings.\u201d\n\nRecently, the makeup mogul appeared in a video playing \u201cNever Have I Ever\u201d with BFF Jordyn Woods, 20, and her assistant Victoria Villarroel. And it was pretty obvious Kylie was rocking some major pregnancy curves. She clearly tried to cover her body up in an oversized holiday sweater, but fans could not be fooled! Looks like Kylie will have to come clean about her pregnancy sooner rather than later!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 can you relate to Kylie wanting to eat yummy foods and treats during the holidays? Are you anxious for her to reveal her pregnancy at last?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/scott_sophia-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/selena-gomez-instagram-public-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F12%2F05%2Fkylie-jenner-pregnancy-cravings-food-during-holidays-why-struggling%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2899781&comment_count=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/hailey-baldwin-importance-of-being-an-influencer-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kylie-jenner-craving-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/12/kylie-jenner-craving-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171207002306/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/12/05/kylie-jenner-pregnancy-cravings-food-during-holidays-why-struggling/", "title": "Kylie Jenner \u2018Struggling With Pregnancy Food Cravings\u2019 During The Holidays: Why It\u2019s So \u2018Challenging\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Kylie Jenner's pregnancy cravings may be getting the best of her!
