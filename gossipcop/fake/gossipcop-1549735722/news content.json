The dramatic pauses, the tears \u2014 he told his friends that he thought she was acting.\u201d\n\nWhen asked by a BBC reporter while promoting her film First They Killed My Father if she would like to say something about her separation, Angelina didn\u2019t elaborate but did call it a \u201cdifficult time.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe are a family, and we will always be a family. We will get through this time and hopefully be a stronger family for it.\n\nMORE: The Biological Mother of Brad and Angelina\u2019s Daughter Zahara Wants to Connect With the 12-Year-Old\n\nShe continued, \u201cMany people find themselves in these situations \u2026 my focus is my children, our children, and my focus is finding this way through. As we said, we are and forever will be a family. That is how I\u2019m coping. I\u2019m coping with finding a way through that somehow this makes us stronger and closer.\u201d\n\nHowever, for Brad the seven-minute interview was telling, especially after she referred to Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8, as \u201cmy children\u201d before correcting herself and saying \u201cour children.\u201d\n\nAngelina in Cambodia in Feb. 2017.\n\n\u201cBrad agreed to let Angie take their kids to Cambodia,\u201d the insider adds, \u201cbecause he was promised the opportunity soon after to have some of them for two whole weeks.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Life & Style reported the Ocean\u2019s Eleven actor, who has lost a shocking amount of weight, is devastated by the split as he is only allowed to see his kids for short periods of time.\n\nMORE: Never Miss a Life & Style Exclusive by Signing up for Our Newsletter!\n\n\u201cBrad is like a broken man. He feels betrayed by a woman whom he says he still loves. He misses her despite everything that has happened between them,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe was blindsided by their divorce \u2014 he still believes Angelina made an impulsive decision and can\u2019t figure out how to reverse it and save face.\u201d\n\nSo sad.\n\nFor more on Brad and Angelina, be sure to pick up the latest issue of Life & Style magazine, on newsstands now.
