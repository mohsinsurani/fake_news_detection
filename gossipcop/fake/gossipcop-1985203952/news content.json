No name has been announced for the newest member of the family as of yet.\n\nThe couple kept their expectant parent status quiet for awhile, refusing to confirm a baby was on its way despite published reports.\n\nBut in September, Kardashian West confirmed the news in a clip from Season 14 of her family\u2019s E! series \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians.\u201d\n\nIn the promo, the reality star is seen on a video call with her sister, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\n\n\u201cWhat happens every time I say, \u2018Guess what?\u2019\u201d Kim says to her sister.\n\n\u201cThe person\u2019s pregnant?\u201d Khlo\u00e9 asks before Kim announces, \u201cWe\u2019re having a baby!\u201d\n\nRelated: Kim Kardashian West confirms baby on the way\n\nKardashian-West had a pink-themed baby shower in November and has been very open about the complications she suffered from her pregnancies.\n\nWhen she was pregnant with North, she had pre-eclampsia, a complication characterized by high blood pressure.
