That\u2019s a lot of years to not confront a friend,\u201d Apatow wrote on Twitter on Thursday night.\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times on Thursday, Tarantino admitted that he knew of Weinstein\u2019s alleged mistreatment of women years ago but did not do enough to stop it.\n\nIn the interview, the director, who worked with Weinstein on basically all his major film projects, said that he\u2019d known about Weinstein\u2019s action as far back as the \u201990s but didn\u2019t do anything to stop it, something he admits to regretting.\n\n\u201cI knew enough to do more than I did,\u201d Tarantino told the paper. \u201cThere was more to it than just the normal rumors, the normal gossip. It wasn\u2019t secondhand. I knew he did a couple of these things.\u201d\n\nTarantino owned up to hearing directly from his ex-girlfriend Mira Sirvino and another unnamed actres about their experiences with Weinstein. He also was aware that Rose McGowan, who last week tweeted that Weinstein had raped her, had allegedly reached a legal settlement with him. Despite this, he did not realize that the incidents were part of a larger pattern.\n\n\u201cWhat I did was marginalize the incidents,\u201d he said. \u201cAnything I say now will sound like a crappy excuse.\u201d\n\nInstead, Tarantino continued to work with Weinstein in the years since, including on Oscar-nominated films \u201cInglorious Basterds\u201d and \u201cDjango Unchained.\u201d\n\nA rep for Apatow declined a request for comment, while Tarantino\u2019s did not respond.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/jaqt.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/jaqt.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/jaqt.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/20/judd-apatow-slams-quentin-tarantion-for-harvey-silence/", "title": "Judd Apatow slams Quentin Tarantino for Harvey silence", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
