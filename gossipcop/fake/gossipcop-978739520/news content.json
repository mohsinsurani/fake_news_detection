HL learned exclusively she wants marriage AND a baby!\n\nIt\u2019s been over a year since Britney Spears, 36, and Sam Asghari, 23, were first romantically linked, and it\u2019s safe to say they\u2019re head-over-heels for each other! So much so in fact, that the pop princess apparently has marriage on the brain \u2014 AND babies!
