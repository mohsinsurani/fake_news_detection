I want us to always be cool and be friends.\u2019 He was like, \u2018Yeah, here\u2019s the thing: We\u2019re not going to be friends.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Oh. Is that so?\u2019 \u201d she explains. \u201cI think we were both a little unsure about what was going on in the very beginning. It was familiar territory, but when a lot of time goes by, it\u2019s like getting to know a new person.\u201d She adds, \u201cHe was somebody I\u2019d always cared about so deeply and loved very deeply. Obviously, it took work and getting past things between the two of us, but it was all very worth it. He\u2019s an incredible, amazing man and such a good partner to go through life with. There is no one else I would have ever wanted to spend my life with except him. So, I\u2019m lucky.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/haileyjustin-1531153172.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/dkhytv8voaa-dvd-1530290698.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/jb-new-york-daily-news-archive-1530220271.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Holly Rhue", "Savannah Walsh", "Elle.Com Contributor", "Holly Rhue Is A Writer", "Editor In New York City.", "Editorial Fellow", "Savannah Walsh Is An Editorial Fellow At Elle.Com."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g21991424/justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-relationship-timeline/", "title": "A Very Comprehensive 10-Year Timeline of Justin Bieber & Hailey Baldwin's Relationship", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "A Very Comprehensive 10-Year Timeline of Justin Bieber & Hailey Baldwin's Relationship", "description": "From their youthful meeting to \"Yummy.\"", "url": "https://www.elle.com/culture/celebrities/g21991424/timeline-justin-bieber-hailey-baldwin-relationship/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 364664413547847, "pages": 31911516300}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ellemagazine", "modified_time": "2021-04-20T10:35:19Z", "published_time": "2020-08-30T19:45:00Z", "section": "Celebrity News 2022", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEmagazine", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/spl5003415-001-1531140465.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.423xh;0,0.0905xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Justin Bieber and Hailey Baldwin's Complete Relationship Timeline", "description": "From his first cringe-worthy meet with Hailey Baldwin in 2009 to their present Grand Makeout Tour of the United States\u200b\u200b\u2122\u200b, it appears as if Justin Bieber has made Hailey Baldwin one less lonely girl by asking her to marry him.
