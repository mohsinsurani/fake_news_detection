It wasn't available!\n\nNo, this wasn\u2019t a case of Spotify snubbing Hazza, them not having the rights to stream the track, or even the fault of the One Direction singer's camp. Turns out a technical glitch on the streaming giant's side prevented fans from finding the song when they search for Harry\u2019s catalog, and from it even being a part of the streaming service\u2019s New Music Friday playlist for a couple of hours.\n\nRELATED: See the Best Fan Reactions to 'Sign of the Times'\n\nSpotify released an official statement to Variety regarding the issue once it had been resolved that reads, \u201cThere should be no further issue, though users unable to play this track need to reinstall the Spotify application to remove the cache.\u201d\n\nThere you have it! If any other fans out there are still having issues streaming \u201cSign of the Times\u201d deleting then reinstalling the Spotify app should be enough to resolve the issue.\n\nThe music service also sent out a tweet once the issue that had been resolved that said, \"Hey @Harry_Styles fans, sorry if you had trouble playing this, but here it is now,\" and linked fans directly to his artist page.\n\nHey @Harry_Styles fans, sorry if you had trouble playing this, but here it is now ==> #SignOfTheTimes https://t.co/HeGRx4d2aF \u2014 Spotify (@Spotify) April 8, 2017\n\nRELATED: See All the Hilarious Memes of Harry Styles\n\nThough of course fans were highly upset at the glitch, and took to social media to vent their frustrations.
