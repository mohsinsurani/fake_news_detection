The KUWTK star is allegedly pregnant after publicly being seen with \u201cwhat appeared to be a bump\u201d in L.A. on July 30, a new report by OK! magazine claims! \u201cIt was strange to see because she\u2019s usually so perfectly svelte,\u201d a source told the outlet, and a friend to Kourt added, \u201cEveryone is whispering that she\u2019s pregnant with her fourth child.\u201d If Kourtney is supposedly pregnant, then who on Earth is the father to baby number four? And by that, we mean, is it once again baby daddy Scott Disick, 35, or ex-boyfriend Younes Bendjima, 25? Naturally, one would assume it\u2019s the younger model, who to the world was Kourtney\u2019s boyfriend up until recently. But Kourtney\u2019s anonymous friend makes a shocking claim \u2014 it\u2019s more than likely Scott!\n\n\u201cThey\u2019ve been meeting up on the down-low for a while now,\u201d the friend said, going so far as to add that Kourtney and Scott hooked up in Mexico. Keep in mind, Scott has been dating model Sofia Richie, 19, since 2017 \u2013 but reportedly, that was not on Scott\u2019s mind when he allegedly hooked up with Kourtney in a \u201crecent\u201d trip to Mexico, the magazine claims! \u201cThey made it look like a family trip because their kids [Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3] were there, but they hooked up,\u201d the source said before adding, \u201cEveryone is buzzing that she\u2019s carrying Scott\u2019s baby.\u201d As far as we know, Kourtney and Scott, who broke up in 2015, haven\u2019t publicly taken a family vacay with the kids in Mexico since 2016. But they did go to Punta Mita, Mexico just days apart with their respective lovers in January. Scott then returned to Mexico for a Cabo San Lucas getaway with the kids, but it was Sofia who played mommy. Is the magazine insinuating that Kourtney was a secret stow-away? The friend went on to say that Kourtney wouldn\u2019t fret over Scott being her baby daddy again because \u201call of their kids came out beautifully.\u201d\n\nAnd apparently, Kourtney and Younes weren\u2019t together for as long as most assumed. News just broke on Aug. 8 that Kourtney actually ended her relationship with the 25-year-old model on the second week of July because he cheated on her. Still, if Kourtney\u2019s alleged baby bump wasn\u2019t just a mistaken case of bloating, then Younes could very well be the father. It takes between 12 to 16 weeks for a bump to show. Sixteen weeks ago, Kourt and Younes were still very much on! Despite all the speculations, everyone\u2019s stumped. Even Kourtney supposedly \u201cisn\u2019t sure how to handle this situation.\u201d The friend added that Kourtney \u201cisn\u2019t saying if the daddy is Scott, Younes or another mystery man she\u2019s been spending time with\u2026it may end up taking some of Kris [Jenner\u2019s] management skills to straighten out this mess!\u201d\n\nMaybe this report isn\u2019t so wild, after a source close to Sofia EXCLUSIVELY shared with HollywoodLife.com on Aug. 7 that Sofia gave her boyfriend an ultimatum \u2013 it\u2019s her or Kourtney! Is Sofia feeling threatened, which would only make the hookup rumors between Scott and Kourtney appear to be more than gossip? \u201c[Sofia] wants to live a life with Scott, have a future with Scott and have kids with Scott,\u201d our source told us. \u201cSo if he is thinking of getting back with Kourtney she wants none of it.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLife.com has reached out to Younes Bendjima\u2019s and Scott Disick\u2019s reps for a comment.", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kourtney-kardashian-younes-bendjima-backgrid-1.jpg?w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kourtney-kardashian-younes-intro.jpg?w=440", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Julia-Roberts.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/kourtney-kardashian-possibly-pregnant-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kourtney-kardashian-younes-bendjima-backgrid-7.jpg?w=293", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/kourtney-kardashian-possibly-pregnant-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/taylor-swift-joe-alwn.jpg?w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/kourtney-kardashian-possibly-pregnant-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jade Boren", "Alyssa K.
