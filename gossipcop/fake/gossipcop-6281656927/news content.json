Caitlyn Jenner is reportedly dating a 21-year-old college student and model named Sophia Hutchins. Cait brought the beauty as her date to the GLAAD Awards on April 12, but their alleged romance goes back to last year. According to Radar Online, the I Am Cait alum, 68, whisked her new blonde partner away to Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, in 2017 for a romantic vacation. Despite their drastic age difference \u2014 Sophia is the same age as Caitlyn\u2019s daughter Kendall Jenner! \u2014 the two looked happier than ever when they touched back down in the U.S. on Monday, Oct. 30. The proof of a relationship has been growing ever since.\n\nIt is now being reported that Caitlyn is ready to tie the knot with the blonde beauty. \u201cThey consider each other soulmates and freely admit they couldn\u2019t imagine a life with anyone else at this point,\u201d a source told Radar. However, don\u2019t expect the Kardashians, especially her daughters Kendall and Kylie Jenner, to be in attendance. \u201cThey\u2019ve heard from friends that Caitlyn\u2019s dating Sophia, and it upsets them like you wouldn\u2019t believe,\u201d another source told Life & Style. \u201cShe\u2019s their age! They feel a mix of jealousy and distrust about it.\u201d\n\nIn her memoir, The Secrets of My Life \u2014 which was released last year\u2014 the transgender rights advocate opened up about her future dating prospects after announcing her transition in 2015. \u201cA future female companion? I think about that. A future female sexual companion? Not happening, at least for now, and perhaps not ever,\u201d she wrote in her tome before she had gender reassignment surgery. \u201cA future male sexual companion? I have never had the inclination. But maybe that attitude might possibly change if I have the Final Surgery.\u201d\n\nMonths later, it seems as though the former Olympian (who was linked to gal pal Candis Cayne in 2016, one year after divorcing Kris Jenner) may have finally found her perfect life partner. So, who is Sophia Hutchins? In Touch has rounded up everything you need to know about Caitlyn\u2019s much younger rumored love.\n\nSophia is transgender also.\n\nSophia, who attends Pepperdine University near Caitlyn\u2019s home in Malibu, CA, revealed her decision to transition to her school newspaper in 2016. According to Radar, Sophia even mentioned that Caitlyn inspired her to publicly address her gender identity.\n\nSophia was formerly known as Scott.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BhjlUjnFCqR/\n\nRadar reports that Sophia\u2019s birth name is Scott. In her 2016 profile for Pepperdine\u2019s newspaper, she explained how moving away to college helped her discover her authentic self. \u201cI\u2019ve always had the question of, \u2018Do I want to transition from male to female?\u2019 I never thought a lot about doing it until I got into college because I was able to break away from my family and started to establish my own identity,\u201d she explained. \u201cCollege gave me the time to deal with a lot of issues that had always been there.\u201d\n\nSophia Hutchins\u2019 Instagram is proof she\u2019s model material.\n\nSophia, clad in nothing but tiny green underwear and a matching sports bra, posed for some sexy photos in Caitlyn\u2019s kitchen in September. Photographer Robert C. Bliss shared a behind-the-scenes pic from their shoot on Instagram. \u201cBreakfast?\u201d he jokingly captioned the sizzling snap of Sophia.\n\nSophia\u2019s selfie game is on fire.\n\nJust like Caitlyn\u2019s social media-loving daughters, Kendall and Kylie Jenner, Sophia is a pro when it comes to taking a thot-tastic mirror selfie. \u201cSkipped working out this morning so I\u2019ll share a selfie instead,\u201d the fitness enthusiast captioned a hot AF selfie on Oct. 11. \u201cGood morning \u2600\ufe0f ? #adidas #calvinklein\u201d\n\nSophia\u2019s got beauty \u2014 and brains.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BX_YTIejBPQ/\n\nAccording to her Instagram page, Sophia is studying finance at Pepperdine \u2014 so, obvi, homegirl is just as smart as she is stunning. Looks like Caitlyn\u2019s found herself quite the catch!\n\nShe spends A LOT of time at Cait\u2019s house.\n\nWhile we haven\u2019t seen much of Sophia on Cait\u2019s Instagram, Sophia can constantly be seen hanging out at Cait\u2019s house, snapping pics in her bed, and hanging out with her beloved yellow lab Bertha, and refers to the pooch as \u201cher baby.\u201d She\u2019s at the Malibu crib so often that it almost seems like she\u2019s moved in with Cait, though there\u2019s been no official announcement.", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlny-jenner.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlyn-jenner-sophia-hutchins.jpg?fit=400%2C499&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C499"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/caitlny-jenner.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["In Touch Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/caitlyn-jenner-girlfriend-sophia-hutchins-145848/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner's Rumored Girlfriend Sophia Hutchins Is 21 and Hot AF", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Okurr!
