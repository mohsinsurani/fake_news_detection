And though girlfriend Gwen Stefani wasn\u2019t able to make it out to the festivities, she\u2019s yet another reason he\u2019s pinching himself these days.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t change one thing about my life right now,\u201d he tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue, on newsstands Friday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy,\u201d he adds. \u201cSometimes happiness can seem like fleeting moments, but this one has been staying in the same lane for a long time. It\u2019s just amazing.\u201d\n\nOle Red Nashville\n\nWhen the Voice coach \u2014 who\u2019s packed six wins in the 14 seasons he\u2019s been on NBC\u2019s hit singing competition show \u2014 isn\u2019t guiding hopeful artists or selling out arenas with his Country Music Freaks tour, he spends his time being blissfully in love with former Voice coach Gwen Stefani, 48.\n\n\u201cI would just like to ride this wave till I die,\u201d he says. \u201cThe personal side of my life has been chaotic at times over the last few years, but it\u2019s kinda settled down now and just feels good.\u201d\n\nThough the \u201cGod Gave Me You\u201d singer is the first one to admit he and the glam pop singer are an \u201cinteresting\u201d couple, he says somehow they just \u201cmake sense.\u201d\n\nPatrick McMullan/Getty\n\n\u201cWhen we first started seeing each other, friends of mine would be like, \u2018What the hell is that all about?'\u201d he says. \u201cBut if you ever had a chance to be around us together, it does make sense.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople do like us together,\u201d Shelton, who supported his love Tuesday night at her Vegas residency kickoff, adds.\n\nThough the pair spends most of their time in Los Angeles, they make it a point to jet off to his waterfront home in Oklahoma with Stefani\u2019s three sons, Kingston, 12, Zuma, 9, and Apollo, 4.\n\n\u201cWe love to go out on the lake,\u201d says Shelton. \u201cMy family, Gwen and her family, we all get together and go out and float around. The kids swim and tube and all that stuff. We have a blast.\u201d\n\nAnd while Shelton and Stefani \u201cappreciate\u201d the support and the time that fans have invested in their relationship, wedding rumors that have been swirling from the start are laughable at this moment.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t you read the tabloids? Gwen and I already have a few kids,\u201d he jokes. \u201cWe\u2019ve been married and divorced and married again a couple of times. We were married before we ever even met each other!\u201d\n\nFor more on Blake Shelton\u2019s new restaurant chain and building a life with Gwen Stefani, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on
