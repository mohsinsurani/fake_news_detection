And this year, Hollywood upped their game \u2014 with shocking haircuts, major announcements and one scary on-set prank.\n\nStar Trek star George Takei kicked things off, announcing in the early minutes of Saturday that he was planning a run for Congress in 2018 \u2014 targeting California\u2019s 22nd District so he can take on Republican Devin Nunes.\n\nTakei told The Daily Buzz that he wanted to take a bigger stand in politics. \u201cWith what is going on now in the country, I couldn\u2019t stand by any longer merely as a citizen,\u201d Takei said. \u201cI knew I had to take a bigger stand. So that\u2019s why I\u2019m running for Congress. My hope is to challenge Devin Nunes for his seat in 2018.\u201d\n\nThe 79-year-old actor let the world wait over 8 hours before revealing the truth \u2014 tweeting a photo of him holding a sign that read, \u201cGotcha!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not running for Congress. Happy 4/1!,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut Jon Ossoff is on 4/18. Help him win at electjon.com. Let\u2019s flip Congress in \u201918.\u201d\n\nMinutes before Takei\u2019s reveal, swimming champion Michael Phelps took his own stab at an April\u2019s Fools Day prank \u2014 tweeting that he was ready to come out of retirement to compete at the 2020 Tokyo Olympics.\n\n\u201cSome dreams/goals you just can\u2019t get rid of,\u201d the 41-year-old athlete wrote. \u201cBeen doing a lot of thinking n I\u2019ve decided that I\u2019m going 2 make another comeback! #tokyo2020.\u201d\n\nSadly, for those hoping the 23-time gold medalist would be trying build on his historic success after his last Olympic Games wrapped in Rio, they\u2019re out of luck.\n\nTeam USA quickly screen-grabbed the tweet, posting it to Instagram with the caption \u201c#aprilfools.\u201d\n\nFROM COINAGE: These Athletes Are Only Getting Richer After Leaving the Field\n\nRebel Wilson\u2018s April Fools Day prank had everyone scrambling on the set of Pitch Perfect 3.\n\nThe 37-year-old comedian laid on the ground outside one of the film\u2019s trailers, as concerned cast members and crew came to her aid.\n\nBefore things got too serious, some of the folks who were in on the prank screamed \u201cApril Fools!\u201d \u2014 as seen in video of the prank Wilson posted to Instagram.\n\n\u201cTragic accident on the set of Pitch Perfect 3,\u201d she wrote. \u201cJust kidding! Happy April Fools Pitches! I got you!!!\u201d\n\nFor all the Bravoholics out there, Real Housewives of New York City star Bethenny Frankel had a surprise on Saturday \u2014 posting a shot of herself on Instagram with a new pixie haircut.\n\nShe captioned the shot, \u201c#shorthairdontcare\u201d and \u201c#newseasonnewlook\u201d (among others).\n\nOf course, anyone following Frankel on Snapchat would know the 46-year-old Skinnygirl mogul was just joking around \u2014 as her she\u2019s been showing off her bob on the social media site while skiing with her 6-year-old daughter, Bryn.\n\nGigi Hadid also pulled a hairdo prank, sharing a shot of herself with what appeared to be short hair and scissor emojis. However she later updated the caption to share that it was just a prank.", "images":
