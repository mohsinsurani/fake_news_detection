Which must, by default, mean that Kate Middleton is jealous of her rising star. Right?\n\nShort answer: no.\n\nBut, if the public speculation is anything to go by, you\u2019d be forgiven for thinking so.\n\nThe Hollywood Gossip recently ran an article titled \u2018Kate Middleton: Jealous of Meghan Markle?\u2018 in which they claimed that the Duchess\u2019 upcoming third baby and lack of involvement in the royal wedding could mean \u201cpotential for resentment\u201d.\n\nSimilarly, the Daily Beast wrote, \u2018Step Aside, Kate. Meghan Is the New People\u2019s Princess\u2019.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just the media. Millions of Twitter fan accounts are dedicated to Meghan, many of which seem to be focused on tearing down Kate Middleton in their wake.\n\nThe reality of royal life is very different.\n\n9Honey\u2019s royal correspondent Victoria Arbiter says there\u2019s no truth in the rumours that there\u2019s tension between the two.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s interesting isn\u2019t it? Society loves to pit women against women\u2026 so clearly because Meghan is suddenly so popular Kate must be cowering in the corner feeling sorry for herself,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cBut I simply don\u2019t think that\u2019s how Kate operates.\n\nRELATED: The biggest pressure Meghan Markle will face as a royal (post continues)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been in the royal fold since 2011, she\u2019s done an incredibly good job...and I think Kate is very content with her role. She loves being a mother.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s quite happy to let Harry and Meghan have the limelight at the moment, because it is a lot when you\u2019re front and centre all the time, when you\u2019re dealing with the press intrusion, public intrusion. And of course, in this day and age, when everyone has a camera phone, you really can\u2019t ever escape it.\u201d\n\nThe intrusion Victoria mentions was all new to Kate when she was introduced to the world as William\u2019s fiancee in 2010, but flashing cameras and screaming fans are rather more familiar to former Suits actress Meghan.\n\n(Getty)\n\nWhile Kate had a family-orientated upper middle class upbringing in the UK, Meghan\u2019s divorced - but loving - parents raised her in the USA. Kate went on to study at a prestigious British university, where she met William, while Meghan established her career in Hollywood. Kate married the man she met when she was a young woman, whereas Meghan is a divorcee.\n\n\n\nBut while their lives have been very different, the two women appear to be forming a close bond - one which, Victoria believes will be built on their unusual circumstances.\n\n\u201cI definitely think Kate will have been a tower of strength for Meghan,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think Kate will be offering Meghan everything which was perhaps lacking when she married into the royal family.\u201d\n\nVictoria believes that the public outpouring of love for Harry and Meghan might just be something of a welcome relief for the Duke and Duchess, who are about to become parents for the third time.\n\n\u201cI actually think William and Kate are going to be quite happy to take a bit of a step back, but also share the limelight with Meghan and Harry,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe \"Fab Four\" - as they have already been coined by some - may have a world of pressure on their shoulders, but it seems more than likely that both Meghan and Kate are simply happy to have a friend to understand their unusual life path.", "images": ["https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/-Qhry5lJsV3kGslzkcALejGfkKs=/0x2767:3137x4532/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Ffdd4da32-9a48-4e3a-a422-5df6ac1f0a30", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/NHVfQOd4p_FZ-3N0omQFyTViY40=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F05%2F29%2F08%2F34%2Ffooter-creative-146x82.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/4yUsnklKeDNWR0uiCz_Sv2u3Lmo=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F03%2Fninecouponsblue.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/Kv21uUOWJ_MqunV81k0gVJOZ2N8=/0x1734:3600x3759/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F04d59009-73e4-4e0f-b70d-a2c38e011118", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/gUeEeCavYaYPan0FlNkFqF7I65U=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F27e3d89d-8a28-4a03-99e2-12033f6af415", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/RdGC2-aySybwpA2slWTsajQnk6g=/0x463:3931x2674/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F829e37bc-a129-4cf8-8ea5-077c9afc0ea2", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/rGCwwoJxFIq81v9_WqdS-NXiD_s=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F24%2Fdomain_partner_module_lrg.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/m8gVRogNItHNEAXp7xnBU1H3mMw=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F09%2F01%2F10%2F23%2Fnational.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/E9RNc18C7X6vDY0hjdpf379Nx80=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F0a52b725-e1b8-400a-bfc4-6ce10a4254b2", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/4z840fl7_8Vi-1-_v8-nhF8dytU=/396x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FHome%2FStreams%2F2018%2F01%2F02%2F11%2F56%2Fkatemeghan.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/rztiZlY9ajkVdSfptQrL0zKZqPs=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2022%2F09%2F09%2F17%2F35%2Flast_light.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/gRcBXcLKMnDOyEB8s69LWe8-6fU=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2018%2F04%2F20%2F10%2F54%2F180420_katemeghan.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/hEitJ2CZf15Evea3K7jcX7UftXU=/396x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2018%2F04%2F04%2F10%2F43%2Fmeghansuits.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/BHdwVsBJuA6QtNgevwAb6FpmEQw=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fc3379a04-9b1e-4e8c-955f-0e2c6a4d5315"], "top_img": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/gRcBXcLKMnDOyEB8s69LWe8-6fU=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2018%2F04%2F20%2F10%2F54%2F180420_katemeghan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "//honey.nine.com.au/royals/kate-middleton-meghan-markle-jealous/ada73c4b-da26-49e7-93bd-beabce78ba83", "title": "Kate Middleton will never be jealous of Meghan Markle;
