Now, he can\u2019t stop laughing!\n\nWe must admit, we were a little surprised when we heard that Blac Chyna, 29, may have signed a record contract. However, her ex Rob Kardashian, 30, was a million times more shocked! But the more he thinks about it, the more hilarious he thinks it is. Click here to see pics of Rob and Blac\u2019s final blowout fight.\n\n\u201cRob has had some major laughs thinking about Blac Chyna trying to rap,\u201d an insider told HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cAnd even if she goes after Rob in her raps he thinks she will be so bad that it won\u2019t matter because she will just be embarrassing herself. He is actually kind of looking forward to see her fail and thinks she will be even worse than K-Fed.\u201d Yikes! We all remember the cringe-worthy song by Britney Spears\u2019 ex Kevin Federline, \u201cPopozao.\u201d The world doesn\u2019t need a repeat of THAT atrocity.\n\nThe reason rumors exploded that Blac would be trying her hand at the rap game is because she was spotted walking into Capital Records with her lawyer, and MTO reports that they offered her a $1 million recording deal. Perhaps she\u2019s become inspired by her pal Nicki Minaj, who recently rapped about her on the track \u201cRake It Up,\u201d and even invited her to be in the music video! We have no idea how good Blac would be at rapping, but we certainly would be interested to hear it, ESPECIALLY if she spills the tea on her split with Rob in a diss track!\n\nHollywoodLifers, what do you think of Rob\u2019s response to Blac trying to rap? Is he right, or just downright rude?
