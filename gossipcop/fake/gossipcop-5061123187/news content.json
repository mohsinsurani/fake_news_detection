He went to Sean Penn's annual Haiti benefit in January, where he was outbid to watch Game of Thrones with Emilia Clarke, and then he went to two parties earlier this month\u2014the Gersh Agency's pre-Oscars shindig at Chateau Marmont and a dinner for Penn's new book at Giorgio Baldi\u2014and that's about it as far as high-profile socializing has gone.\n\nWhich isn't to say he isn't socializing at all. He's just doing so in places where the cameras can't follow.\n\nHowever, not being a visible participant in the Hollywood game hasn't made him any less irresistible of a target when it comes to speculation as to what he's up to behind closed doors.", "images": ["https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018215/rs_600x600-180315181403-600-Brad-Pitt-JR-031518.jpg?fit=around%7C1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201822/rs_634x951-180302111317-634-brad-pitt-pre-oscars-party-030218.jpg?fit=around%7C634:951&output-quality=90&crop=634:951;center,top"], "top_img": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018215/rs_600x600-180315181403-600-Brad-Pitt-JR-031518.jpg?fit=around%7C1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/921007/brad-pitt-vs-the-rumor-mill-why-he-s-the-target-of-even-more-wild-stories-than-usual", "title": "Why Brad Pitt Is the Subject of So Many Rumors These Days", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "google-site-verification": "jOadQCDbZTkKw5sn27yXszjIb9c3PdMPHENN92uPWy8", "msvalidate.01": "564B986CE3CECCAE84779191BEC6B755", "fb": {"admins": 10101649, "pages": 1387539234854280, "app_id": 195662528604}, "og": {"title": "Brad Pitt vs. the Rumor Mill: Why He's the Target of Even More Wild Stories Than Usual - E!
