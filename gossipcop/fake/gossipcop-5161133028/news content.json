With the release of Taylor Swift\u2019s new single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d which blatantly disses Kanye West (and wife Kim Kardashian), the bad blood is at an all time high \u2014 at least, on the pop star\u2019s end. But rewind back to 2009, and you\u2019d get a very different story.\n\nWell, at least for Taylor and Kim. That was, of course, the year the drama between the Reputation songstress and Kanye started, when he interrupted her accepting the award for Video of the Year at the MTV VMAs.\n\nEventually, the two made up, but the feud was revived in 2016 when they fought over the rapper rapping \u201cI made that bitch famous\u201d in his song \u201cFamous.\u201d\n\nOf course, things only got worse after that, as Kim released a video of the phone call Taylor and Kanye had where she gave him permission to use that line.\n\nSo really, up until last year, there were no hard feelings between the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star and singer \u2014 and now there\u2019s video proof!\n\nIn a resurfaced interview from 2009, the now-36-year-old reality star gushes about Taylor, calling herself a big fan of her work.\n\n\u201cI love Taylor Swift, I\u2019m the biggest Taylor Swift fan,\u201d the mother of two tells a reporter on the red carpet.\n\nShe goes on to add that her \u201cnumber one song\u201d on her iPod \u2014 throwback alert! \u2014 is Tay\u2019s 2008 single, \u201cLove Story.\u201d\n\nBlast from the past! Back in 2009, Kim Kardashian proclaims she was Taylor Swift's \"biggest fan.\" pic.twitter.com/RyBgeiyWqj EntertainmentTonight (@etnow) August 30, 2017\n\nCue another dated reference: \u201cI\u2019m watching her on Twitter, I just signed up on Twitter. I\u2019m watching you, Taylor, following.\u201d\n\nOh how time flies, right? It should be noted that at the time, Kim wasn\u2019t even dating her now-husband yet. In fact, she wasn\u2019t even dating Kris Humphries \u2014 they didn\u2019t meet for another year after that!\n\nCredit: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nInterestingly, we hear Taylor\u2019s new music hasn\u2019t had the impact on the Wests she hoped it would have. Sources have said the couple \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d about her attacks, are focusing on their family, and even note that she\u2019s not \u201con their radar.\u201d\n\nStill, she\u2019s on Kim\u2019s radar when it comes to social media following, as the blonde recently surpassed the Instagram heavyweight in followers.\n\nThe two are neck-and-neck at 102.9 million IG fans, and with Taylor pulling ahead slightly, Kim seemingly retaliated with a risque post on Thursday.\n\nIn an apparent bid to gain more followers, she posted a sexy shot of her sunbathing in a nude string bikini.\n\nIt's really hot today A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Aug 30, 2017 at 4:48pm PDT", "images":
