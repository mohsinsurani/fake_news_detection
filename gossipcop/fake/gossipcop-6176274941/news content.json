Justin Bieber and Kourtney Kardashian are just friends!\n\nIn most cases, if your boyfriend is texting an ex, things aren\u2019t looking so good! As we reported earlier, Selena Gomez, 25, found herself in a weird situation after realizing Justin Bieber, 23, and former fling, Kourtney Kardashian, 38, are still communicating! Yikes! Luckily, for Selena, the situation is harmless! Thank God! \u201cKourtney and Justin are on great terms, they still talk every once in a while but there\u2019s nothing for Selena to worry about. Kourtney only has eyes for Younes Bendjima, she\u2019s totally into him and only him. She will always be fond of Justin, she thinks he\u2019s a great guy, but there\u2019s nothing romantic between them anymore, that ended when she got serious with Younes,\u201d a source close to Kourtney tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\nAlthough this is such a relief for Jelena fans everywhere, it\u2019s not a surprise. Kourtney and Younes have been going strong for quite some time now! They\u2019ve posted countless adorable photos to Instagram, and have taken romantic trips to Paris and Egypt! Younes was even invited to the Kardashian/Jenner annual Christmas party. Kourtney has also referred to him as her boyfriend on KUWTK. So official!\n\nHowever, this wouldn\u2019t be the first time Justin was \u201ccaught\u201d talking to an ex. We recently reported that he spent Thanksgiving with his childhood sweetheart, Caitlin Beadles. The news shocked everyone, leading many to question how serious Justin and Selena really are. Turns out, Justin and Caitlin stayed in touch throughout the years, and Justin is super close with Caitlin\u2019s brother, Christian Beadles. Maybe just like Kourtney, Caitlin is just a permanent fixture in his life! Nevertheless, all is well in the world of love!\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Selena Gomez has anything to worry about?
