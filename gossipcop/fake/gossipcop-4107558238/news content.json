At one point during the movie, Reynolds' character tells another character: \"In the words of Beyonce, please stop cheating on me.\"\n\nNW magazine reported that Beyonce, upset as she was with Reynolds for having made fun of her marital issues with Jay Z in the film, took an umbrage with Lively as well. This was reportedly because Beyonce felt that she had broken \"girl code by not telling Ryan to think twice about poking fun at another woman being cheated on.\"\n\nThe source quoted by NW magazine even went on to claim that Beyonce \"thinks it's cruel and certainly isn't laughing.\"\n\nBut if history is anything to go by, Beyonce has a great sense of humor and doesn't get unhappy with every joke made at her expense. For example, as Gossip Cop reports, in October 2016, Saturday Night Live spoofed the music video of her song \"Sorry\" which had an implicit implication about Jay Z cheating on her. But despite the spoof, Beyonce attended the SNL after-party the following year with Jay Z invited as the musical guest.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c3ead8875ffda193b78228399febdd4?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Beyonce.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Beyonce.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4910026/beyonce-is-not-uspet-with-ryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-about-deadpool-2-jab/", "title": "Beyonce Is Not Uspet With Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively About 'Deadpool 2' Jab", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Beyonce Is Not Uspet With Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively About 'Deadpool 2' Jab", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4910026/beyonce-is-not-uspet-with-ryan-reynolds-and-blake-lively-about-deadpool-2-jab/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Beyonce Is Not Uspet With Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively About 'Deadpool 2' Jab", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Beyonce.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-05-22 17:30:28Z", "section": "Fact Checking"}, "description": "Beyonce Is Not Uspet With Ryan Reynolds And Blake Lively About 'Deadpool 2' Jab", "keywords": "Fact Checking", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527010228.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
