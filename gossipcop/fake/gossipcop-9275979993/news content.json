The high-profile affair between Camilla and Prince Charles was hard for the boys to forget. Ever since the two have had a rocky relationship with Camilla. Some years have been better than others. Here are the details behind the relationship between Charles\u2019 wife and these two royals.\n\nDiana made her feelings about Camilla known to her sons\n\nIt was evident that Diana was not okay with the affair between Charles and Camilla. She quickly confronted Camilla about it and reportedly let her sons know, too. She referred to him as \u201cCharles\u2019 lady\u201d to her sons. The boys immediately got a bad taste in their mouths about Camilla, which likely led to a years-long, up-and-down relationship with their father\u2019s current wife.\n\nNext: One brother was more hesitant to meet Camilla than the other.\n\nWilliam was resistant to meet Camilla\n\nIn the summer of 1997, two months before Diana\u2019s death, Charles sat his kids down to talk to them about Camilla. He explained their relationship from his point of view, but Diana had already tainted the mere thought of Camilla for the boys. William was especially resistant to meet her. Charles did not push the relationship on the boys because he wanted them to warm up to her and knew they were aware of the trouble Camilla had caused Charles and Diana.\n\nNext: William finally took initiative.\n\nWilliam eventually set up a meeting with Camilla to clear the air\n\nAfter taking a break from pushing the boys to meet Camilla, Charles tried once more. In 1998, William finally agreed to set up a meeting with Camila so he could learn a little more about her. Afterward, both agreed that things went well. However, Camilla was not yet out of the woods with William. There was still a lot he wanted to know.\n\nNext: The brothers did not meet her at the same time.\n\nHarry let William get to know her first\n\nHarry did not attend the meet up with William. Instead, he met Camilla a few weeks later over tea. The two were at Highgrove, Charles\u2019 home. Camilla\u2019s children were present as well, and it was reportedly more casual than her meeting with William. Tensions were not as high, possibly since William had gotten to know Camilla a bit and filled Harry in.\n\nNext: Things did not improve too quickly.\n\nThe relationship was still rocky at Charles\u2019 50th birthday party\n\nThe boys organized a birthday party for Charles when he was turning 50. They made the nice gesture of inviting Camilla to sit with Charles. However, it\u2019s been reported that their relationship was still very tentative at the time. The boys wanted to make progress with Camilla but still felt shadowed by how she had split up their mother and father.\n\nNext: This person may have had an influence on the boys, too.\n\nThe queen may have delayed the brothers\u2019 acceptance of Camilla\n\nAt Charles\u2019 party, Camilla sat with him, and the whole family celebrated his milestone birthday. The one missing person? The queen. She refused to attend the event knowing Camilla would be present. The queen had still not accepted her son\u2019s infidelity. Her hesitation toward letting Camilla join the family may have fueled additional hesitation from William and Harry.\n\nNext: Charles took a big step with this invitation.\n\nCharles invited Camilla on their family vacation\n\nWilliam, Harry, and Charles were set to fly to Greece to spend a vacation together. Charles invited Camilla to attend. She accepted the invitation and flew to Greece with the family. While it is unclear exactly what happened there, it appeared that the boys enjoyed the time spent with their father and Camilla.\n\nNext: Things were looking up for Camilla and the boys.\n\nBy the time Camilla and Charles married, her relationship with the boys had greatly improved\n\nCamilla wed Charles in 2005. After the wedding, Harry had nothing but good things to say about his new stepmother. \u201c[Camilla is] a wonderful woman who makes my father very, very happy,\u201d Harry said in an interview with BBC. \u201cWilliam and I love her to bits.\u201d He also reinforced that they do not see her as a wicked stepmother.\n\nNext: William played a big role in his father\u2019s second wedding.\n\nWilliam served as his father\u2019s \u2018best man\u2019\n\nWhile William had fewer comments about Camilla than Harry, his brother did say that both of them loved Camilla very much. Although \u201cbest man\u201d is not a traditional wedding position in England \u2014 groomsmen are typically called \u201csupporters\u201d \u2014 William served as Charles\u2019 best man equivalent in the wedding. When Charles asked, William accepted without much hesitation.\n\nNext: This gift from Camilla symbolized a harmonious family.\n\nCamilla gave Kate Middleton a gift at William and Kate\u2019s wedding\n\nWhen William and Kate tied the knot in 2011, Camilla gave Kate a special wedding gift. It was a gold charm bracelet with each of their initials engraved on either side. Kate sported the bracelet on multiple occasions, as if to say that she was happy to have Camilla in the family. It seemed as though the feud between Charles\u2019 children and Camilla had finally ended.\n\nNext: \u2026 but things have not been perfect since.\n\nThe brothers were silent at Camilla\u2019s 70th birthday celebration\n\nThe Daily Mail recently reported that at Camilla\u2019s 70th birthday celebration, no words were said by the brothers. Most people expected the brothers to make a public statement about their stepmother, whom they had once seemed to fully patch things up with. Instead, they stayed silent, leading people to question whether or not things had changed between the three.\n\nNext: It appears the tides have turned.\n\nMore than a decade later, the relationship \u2018has changed\u2019\n\nA source later confirmed to the Daily Mail that things have not been the same between Camilla and the boys in recent years. \u201cThey are not close to Camilla anymore,\u201d said a friend of the royal family. \u201cThe relationship has changed.\u201d Other friends of the family have backed up those claims. One person, an old friend of Diana\u2019s, said, \u201cIt was pretty clear they don\u2019t have a good word for Camilla.\u201d\n\nNext: This statement from William hints at an unstable relationship.\n\nWilliam made it clear that his children only have two grandmothers\n\n2017 marked 20 years since the tragic death of William\u2019s mother, Princess Diana. In Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, William made it clear that Camilla was not a grandmother to his two children. \u201c\u2026 [I] just try and remind them that there are two grandmothers \u2014 there were two grandmothers \u2014 in their lives,\u201d he said. William did not mention Camilla when speaking about the childrens\u2019 grandmothers, even though she was their grandfather\u2019s wife and had known them since birth, just like Kate\u2019s mother.\n\nNext: The boys don\u2019t want Camilla gaining this role.\n\nThey likely do not want Camilla to be named queen\n\nThe public has made it clear that when Charles is passed the throne and becomes king, Camilla should not be queen. That was supposed to be Diana\u2019s role, and the public remains loyal to her. They have also declined to call Camilla \u201cPrincess of Wales\u201d because that was Diana\u2019s title. Since the boys have seemed to distance themselves from Camilla, it\u2019s likely that they do not want her to be queen, either. Rumors have swirled that the feud has heated up again since it was suggested that William and Kate take the role, but those rumors have not been confirmed.\n\nNext: This one thing could be a big reason for their resistance.\n\nThe boys never fully came to terms with their mother\u2019s death\n\nIn Diana, Our Mother, Harry and William went into detail about how little they actually cried over their mother. Harry made a comment that he still felt like there was much more he had to let out about her death. Since the boys seemed to never properly mourn their mother, they may have never had that closure that would allow them to let another mother into their lives. Plus, Camilla caused Diana so much pain that not having the closure of her death might make it even more difficult to let someone like that in.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images":
