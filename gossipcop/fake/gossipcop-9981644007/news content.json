Just found out that Obama had my \u2018wires tapped\u2019 in Trump Tower just before the victory. Nothing found. This is McCarthyism!\u201d\n\nHe followed up that initial tweet with a string of others in the following 30 minutes which claimed Obama had defied a court\u2019s rejection of a request to tap his office, and invited a \u201cgood lawyer\u201d to make a case against the alleged operation.\n\n\n\nIs it legal for a sitting President to be \"wire tapping\" a race for president prior to an election? Turned down by court earlier. A NEW LOW! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nI'd bet a good lawyer could make a great case out of the fact that President Obama was tapping my phones in October, just prior to Election! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nThe president then compared the alleged surveillance of his communications to Watergate \u2013 the scandal in the early 1970s that brought down Republican president Richard Nixon after he ordered a break-in of the Democrat party\u2019s Washington headquarters.\n\nHow low has President Obama gone to tapp my phones during the very sacred election process. This is Nixon/Watergate. Bad (or sick) guy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) March 4, 2017\n\nTrump also made efforts to defend Jeff Sessions, the US attorney general, who is facing questions over his meeting with the Russian ambassador to Washington during the 2016 presidential election campaign.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cThe first meeting Jeff Sessions had with the Russian Amb was set up by the Obama Administration under education program for 100 Ambs...\u201d .\n\nHe added: \u201cJust out: The same Russian Ambassador that met Jeff Sessions visited the Obama White House 22 times, and 4 times last year alone.\u201d\n\nThere was no additional information provided to substantiate the president\u2019s claims that Obama had \u201cwire tapped\u201d Trump Tower, and it was not clear on what information Trump was basing the allegations.\n\nThere has been no response to the tweets from Obama.\n\nThe Trump administration has been on the back foot over its contacts with Russian officials before the president took office in January.\n\nLast month Michael Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser over conversations with the Russian ambassador to Washington and misleading statements about them to the press and the vice-president, Mike Pence.\n\nThis week it was revealed that Sessions had two meetings with Sergey Kislyak, the Russian ambassador to the US, last year twhich he failed to disclose to senators during his confirmation hearing.\n\nSessions said on Friday that he would recuse himself from investigations into Russian interference in the 2016 election despite backing from Trump, who described the controversy as \u201ca total witch hunt\u201d.\n\nTrump\u2019s tweets follow claims made by the conservative radio host Mark Levin on his Thursday night show about the alleged steps taken by the Obama administration to undermine the Republican candidate\u2019s campaign to win the White House.\n\n\n\nThe presenter called the effort a \u201csilent coup\u201d by the Obama administration and called for a congressional investigation into the issue. That contrasts with demands from across the US political spectrum to examine Russian interference in the presidential election.\n\nLevin\u2019s comments were followed up by Breitbart News, the \u201calt-right\u201d website formerly run by Steve Bannon, who ran the Trump campaign and is now the president\u2019s chief strategist.\n\n\n\nThe article stated: \u201cThe Obama administration sought, and eventually obtained, authorisation to eavesdrop on the Trump campaign; continued monitoring the Trump team even when no evidence of wrongdoing was found; then relaxed the NSA [National Security Agency] rules to allow evidence to be shared widely within the government, virtually ensuring that the information, including the conversations of private citizens, would be leaked to the media.\u201d\n\n\n\nThe Breitbart story references recent claims that the FBI had asked the foreign intelligence surveillance court for a warrant last year to monitor members of the Trump team suspected of being in contact with Russian officials. The request for the warrant was initially rejected before being granted in October, the reports have said.\n\nLindsey Graham, the Republican senator from South Carolina, said: \u201cI am very worried that our president is suggesting that the former president has done something illegally. I would be very worried if, in fact, the Obama administration was able to obtain a warrant lawfully about the Trump campaign activity with foreign governments. It\u2019s my job as a United States senator to get to the bottom of this \u2013 I promise you I will.\u201d\n\nThe Democratic congressman Seth Moulton, a member of the House armed services and budget committees, told the MSNBC channel: \u201cThis is right out of Donald Trump\u2019s reality TV playbook. He\u2019s trying to distract attention from the real story here, which is his campaign, his administration\u2019s contact with Russian officials ... There\u2019s clearly a deeper story here and we the American people need to know how high this conspiracy goes.\u201d\n\nMoulton added: \u201cObviously contacts with Russian intelligence officials are monitored \u2013 that\u2019s part of maintaining our national security. So if under the Obama administration they were simply monitoring contacts with Russian officials \u2013 not trying to wiretap into the Trump campaign but simply looking at who Russian officials were talking with \u2013 and then Trump campaign officials got ensnared in that net, then it\u2019s a total mischaracterisation to say President Obama was wiretapping Trump.\u201d\n\nRep Eric Swalwell, a Democrat who is a member of the House intelligence committee, told Fox News that Trump \u201cis not credible when it comes to talking about Russia\u201d.\n\nSwalwell downplayed Trump\u2019s allegations. \u201cI think this is just the president up early doing his routine tweeting, he said. \u201cPresidents don\u2019t wiretap anyone. These are pursued by the Department of Justice in accordance with the FBI and signed off by a judge.\u201d", "images":
