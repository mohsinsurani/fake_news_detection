Brad Pitt, 54, and Margot Robbie, 28, have reportedly been flirting it up on the set of their forthcoming film, Once a Time in Hollywood. \u201cIt\u2019s obvious that Brad\u2019s completely smitten with Margot,\u201d a source tells Life & Style magazine. Their upcoming film also stars Leonardo DiCaprio, 43, who\u2019s even reportedly noticed the close camaraderie between Brad and Margot. Leo \u201chas called him out for layering it on so thick [with Margot],\u201d the insider adds. \u2014 While this is adorable and all, nothing about this alleged relationship has been confirmed.\n\nAnd, let\u2019s not forget that Margot is a married woman. She tied the knot with her longtime boyfriend, Tom Ackerley, a film director, back in December 2016. She and Ackerley had a low key, secretive wedding on a beach in Australia\u2019s Byron Bay, according to reports, where she wore an Oscar de la Renta gown. After much speculation, Margot finally confirmed she had said, \u201cI do,\u201d with an Instagram post (on December 19, 2016) from her wedding day. The actress posted a photo of her diamond ring as she and Ackerley shared a sweet kiss outdoors.\n\nSince Brad knows all of this, he\u2019s reportedly been nothing but professional and respectful of Margot\u2019s marriage. \u201cBrad insists he knows she\u2019s off limits,\u201d the insider tells the mag, adding that Brad is \u201cjust awed by Margot\u2019s talent.\u201d And, we can\u2019t blame him about that! The source also notes that Brad, who\u2019s always been a fan of Margot\u2019s work, helped the actress land her role in The Big Short.\n\nBrad\u2019s been a single man since late 2016, after he and actress Angelina Jolie, 43, called it quits in September of that year. The two went through a nasty and very public divorce and custody battle, until they decided to have the court docs sealed for the sake of their children\u2019s privacy. After many months of their lawyers going back and forth, a recent report claimed Brad and Angie reached a temporary custody agreement in early June 2018 that would allegedly last the summer. A judge reportedly ruled that five of their six children \u2014 Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 12, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 9, must have a good relationship and spend time with both parents. Maddox, 16, their oldest child, on the other hand, is allegedly able to go with either parent of his choosing because of his older age.\n\nNow, the exes are on better terms these days and getting along as they live their new normal of co-parenting their children. While there\u2019s been reports of Brad and Angie dating other people, nothing has been confirmed.", "images": ["https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/brad-pitt-reportedly-majorly-crushing-on-margot-robbie-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Julia-Roberts.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/brad-pitt-reportedly-majorly-crushing-on-margot-robbie-ftr.jpg", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/taylor-swift-joe-alwn.jpg?w=230&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/brad-pitt-reportedly-majorly-crushing-on-margot-robbie-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli", "Alyssa K.
