But he\u2019s not showing any signs of quitting Gwen Stefani.\n\nAnd it seems that the feeling is mutual.\n\nPhoto via Getty\n\nIn fact, some fans can\u2019t help but wonder if Gwen will have Blake\u2019s child. And some believe that there\u2019s one already on its way.\n\nIt\u2019s reported that Stefani, now 48 years young, recently got pregnant with a \"miracle baby\" thanks to IVF treatments.\n\nGwen and Blake\u2019s whirlwind romance began on The Voice, as fans of the show and celebrity gossip are well aware.\n\nAfter Gwen split with now-ex-husband Gavin Rossdale, she confided in her fellow judges what was happening in her life.\n\nIn some ways, she wanted to give her NBC co-stars a heads up before reporters started asking them questions.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nIn others, she probably just needed to talk to some people, which is understandable considering what she was living through\n\nAllegedly, Gavin was cheating on Gwen with the nanny.\n\nStefani is believed to have accidentally this discovered thanks to a tablet device that was linked to other devices.\n\nThat must have been a very rude awakening.\n\nAccording to Gwen, it was after she shared her personal pain with her fellow judges that Blake Shelton confided in her as well.\n\nHe had just been through a similar ordeal in his personal life, having gone through a painful split from Miranda Lambert.\n\nPhoto via Judy Eddy/WENN.com\n\nAfter that, one thing led to another, and Gwen and Blake became inseparable \u2013 and have stayed that way for several years now.\n\nSeriously, who could\u2019ve seen that coming?\n\nSince the inception of their relationship, given how intensely devoted they seem to be to each other, a lot of fans have been wondering:\n\nWill these two have a baby together?!\n\nWell, according to an article in OK, Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton secretly got married \"a few days\" before Christmas in 2017.\n\nIn that same report is a claim that the mother of three has, after months of IVF treatments, conceived Blake Shelton\u2019s child.\n\nPer the article, those few in whom they\u2019ve confided this news are thrilled for them and are over the moon that they\u2019re expecting.\n\nSome fans point to Gwen\u2019s recent look while (deliberately, above) sliding on a frozen pond as proof, since her outfit is decidedly puffy.\n\nLike, say, the sort of outfit that might hide a baby bump?\n\nCertainly, it\u2019s appeared for a while that Gwen and Blake are \"focused\" on getting pregnant, as there\u2019s not a moment to lose.\n\nAt their ages \u2013 Gwen, as we said earlier, is 48 and Blake is 41 \u2013 time is not necessarily on their side at this stage of their lives.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nAt one point, it seemed that Blake was trying to get Gwen pregnant, but it\u2019s not always clear when he\u2019s joking and when he\u2019s serious.\n\nSo \u2026 is the pop superstar really, after months or even years of speculation, finally pregnant with the country crooner\u2019s baby?\n\nWell, for one thing, Gossip Cop says it\u2019s false. We don\u2019t know for sure, of course, but here are some reasons to doubt it.\n\nFor starters, nobody seems to be able to find any record of the two of them having tied the knot, before Christmas or at any other time.\n\nWhich casts doubt on the rest of the report.\n\nPhoto via Getty\n\nEven the image to which some fans point as confirmation of the report \u2013 the sight of Gwen wearing a puffy jacket \u2013 is hardly evidence.\n\nShe\u2019s a tiny little 5-foot-6 woman from California, and it\u2019s cold enough outside that even Blake Shelton can walk on the ice.\n\nOf course she\u2019s wearing a huge, puffy jacket. If she didn\u2019t, she\u2019d freeze. This is winter. It\u2019s not a conspicuous fashion choice.\n\nNow, on the flip side, that does not by any means indicate that Blake and Gwen aren\u2019t trying to have a baby these days.\n\nSure, Blake might have been joking about hoping to knock up Gwen \u2013 or he might have been serious all along. Or both.\n\nAnd yes, Gwen is 48, but some women get pregnant and give birth at 50. It happens sometimes, more often than ever.\n\nEven though it\u2019s not necessarily something that doctors would recommend, she could very well be preganant again.\n\nBut let\u2019s not read too much into puffy outfits is all. Surely, Blake and Gwen will tell the world when they\u2019re ready.\n\nIf they\u2019re ever ready.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20576%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='576'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20672%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='672'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20717%20715'%3E%3Crect%20width='717'%20height='715'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/gwen-stefani-in-red-with-blake-shelton-576x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/07/blake-and-miranda-1024x774.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-in-a-normal-photo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20568%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='568'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/05/blake-shelton-and-gwen-stefani-get-ready-to-perform-on-the-voice.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/jenelle-and-kailyn-split-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-split.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20480%20360'%3E%3Crect%20width='480'%20height='360'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/gwen-stefani-and-blake-sheltons-41st-birthday.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/gwen-stefani-in-black-with-blake-shelton-672x1024.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-split-480x360.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20714%20690'%3E%3Crect%20width='714'%20height='690'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/the-bachelor-season-22-episode-6-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-on-ice.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20774'%3E%3Crect%20width='1024'%20height='774'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20483%20603'%3E%3Crect%20width='483'%20height='603'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/02/gwen-stefani-blake-shelton-split.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/02/gwen-stefani-and-blake-shelton-pregnant-with-miracle-baby-after/", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton: Pregnant with \"Miracle Baby\" After IVF Treatments?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Gwen Stefani & Blake Shelton: Pregnant with \"Miracle Baby\" After IVF Treatments?", "description": "Reports claim that Blake Shelton is high on fame and might quit The Voice.
