When Robbie was finally free to talk, Pitt grabbed the chance and made sure that they could be together for hours. The tabloid even claimed that Pitt is smitten over the actress.\n\nHowever, rumor debunking site Gossip Cop recently clarified that Pitt did not hover around Robbie until they could talk at the party. The actor did not also actively pursue the \u201cI, Tonya\u201d star.\n\nThe link between Pitt and Robbie started after it was revealed that the latter is in talks to star in Quentin Tarantino\u2019s upcoming movie, \u201cOnce Upon A Time in Hollywood.\u201d The film also stars Pitt and Leonardo DiCaprio.\n\nMeanwhile, the same tabloid also falsely claimed that Pitt and Jennifer Aniston have gotten back together recently. Aniston announced her split from Justin Theroux on Feb. 15, but the estranged couple have not been together since the end of last year.\n\nPitt, on the other hand, is still finalizing his divorce from Angelina Jolie. The \u201cMaleficent\u201d star filed a motion to end her marriage to Pitt in September 2016 following an incident that took place on a plane. Pitt allegedly had a brawl with his son, Maddox. The FBI investigated Jolie\u2019s complaints, but they did not find any evidence of abuse against the actor. Pitt was later on cleared.\n\nA source told US Weekly last month that Pitt and Jolie are amicable towards each other for the sake of their six children.\n\n\u201cThis was a request to extend the temporary judge. They want things to remain private and they want things to be amicable. They both have kept the focus on their family. It hasn\u2019t been easy but they are both committed to resolving it privately,\u201d the source said.\n\nPitt and Jolie are parents to Maddox, 16, Pax, 14, Zahara, 13, Shiloh, 11, and Vivienne and Knox, 9.\n\nPhoto: TORU YAMANAKA/AFP/Getty Images", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/14/brad-pitt.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/03/15/brain_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/03/15/staircase.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2018/03/14/brad-pitt.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/03/15/happiness.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/03/14/ford-fusion.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/14/brad-pitt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755/http://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-did-not-hit-margot-robbie-pre-oscar-party-2662821", "title": "Brad Pitt Did Not Hit On Margot Robbie At Pre-Oscar Party", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "brad pitt margot robbie pre-oscars party, brad pitt smitten over margot robbie, brad pitt jennifer aniston not back together, angelina jolie brad pitt finalizing divorce, brad pitt once upon a time in hollywood, brad pitt angelina jolie kids, brad pitt", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755/http://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-did-not-hit-margot-robbie-pre-oscar-party-2662821", "title": "Brad Pitt Did Not Hit On Margot Robbie At Pre-Oscar Party", "description": "Brad Pitt did not hover around Margot Robbie just so he could talk to her at the pre-Oscar party.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/14/brad-pitt.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "modified_time": "2018-03-15T07:05:52-04:00", "published_time": "2018-03-15T07:05:52-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brad Pitt Did Not Hit On Margot Robbie At Pre-Oscar Party", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://www.ibtimes.com/brad-pitt-did-not-hit-margot-robbie-pre-oscar-party-2662821", "description": "Brad Pitt did not hover around Margot Robbie just so he could talk to her at the pre-Oscar party.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180315140755im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/03/14/brad-pitt.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "Brad Pitt did not hover around Margot Robbie just so he could talk to her at the pre-Oscar party."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521111952.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
