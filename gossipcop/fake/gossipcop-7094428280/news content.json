John Kennedy (R-Louisiana) over the \u201cslanderous comments\u201d that he made about their daughter, actress Lindsay Lohan, on Wednesday during a congressional hearing on the Equifax data breach.\n\nThe comments occurred as Richard Smith, the former CEO of Equifax, the credit reporting company that was hacked last month, was being questioned about signing a $7.25 million IRS contract for identity verification services. The deal could reap profits for the company as a result of the hack.\n\n\u201cWhy in the world should you get a no-bid contract right now?\u201d Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Nebraska) asked Smith. Kennedy added, \u201cYou realize to many Americans right now, that looks like we\u2019re giving Lindsay Lohan the keys to the minibar.\u201d Smith paused for a moment before responding, \u201cI understand your point.\u201d The \u201cMean Girls\u201d star, originally of Cold Spring Harbor and Merrick, has spoken about her past struggles with drugs and alcohol.\n\nHer father told the celebrity website Gossip Cop that he and his ex-wife plan to take legal action against Kennedy. \u201cDina and I are seeking legal counsel for Lindsay regarding the slanderous comments and unprofessional behavior of Senator John Kennedy,\u201d Michael Lohan said. \u201cHis comment and analogy was inappropriate, slanderous and unwarranted. How dare he associate Lindsay with this case? Tell me, does he have a family member or friend with a former addiction problem? Wow, and he\u2019s a senator?\u201d\n\nKennedy did not respond to a request for comment from Gossip Cop.", "images": ["http://www.newsday.com/img/newsdayLogo.svg", "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:MDA2Mjc4MTgtZDYwMy00:ZjJkYWEz/landscape/1280", "http://www.newsday.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.newsday.com%2Fimage-service%2Fversion%2Fc%3AMDA2Mjc4MTgtZDYwMy00%3AZjJkYWEz%2Fetloha100717_xk6_web-cropped.jpg%3Ff%3DLandscape%2B16%253A9%26w%3D770%26q%3D1&w=3840&q=60"], "top_img": "https://cdn.newsday.com/ace/c:MDA2Mjc4MTgtZDYwMy00:ZjJkYWEz/landscape/1280", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Bubbeo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newsday.com/entertainment/celebrities/lindsay-lohan-s-parents-plan-to-sue-sen-john-kennedy-over-slanderous-comments-before-congress-report-says-q08252", "title": "Lindsay Lohan\u2019s parents plan to sue Sen.
