We hear details (aka money and exactly how much time she'd need to give to the flick) were never worked out, which is why Angelina is out, for now\u2014but she could possibly make a cameo if the film actually happens.\n\nSo can Kristen save the franchise?\n\nOur dishy source says the Stewart-McAvoy version of the project might not come to fruition, but it remains a slim possibility\u2014and wouldn't it be damn hot! (Sure would be a lot happier news than that horrible fake car accident stuff which had K.Stew fans in a tizzy yesterday.)\n\nKristen is set to start filming Breaking Dawn possibly as early as October, while the Wanted follow-up was originally slated to start shooting around the end of August.\n\nNo production date has been set in stone for the final Twilight flick(s), which is making it difficult, we're told, for many of the actors involved in the vampire franchise to figure out their schedule allowed for outside projects. Anyone remember Rachelle Lefevre?\n\nBe careful before you sign up for other projects, dearies!\n\nNeither Bekmambetov nor a rep for Stewart responded to E!'s request for comment. While no offer was officially given to Kristen, word is that Bekmambetov is\u2014for now\u2014looking at other projects for the fall, given the scheduling conflicts.\n\nBummer! Nobody kicks ass like K.Stew.", "images": ["https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010321/300.jolie.stewart.lc.042110.jpg?fit=around%7C1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010321/425.jolie.stewart.lc.042110.jpg?fit=around%7C425:315&output-quality=90&crop=425:315;center,top"], "top_img": "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2010321/300.jolie.stewart.lc.042110.jpg?fit=around%7C1080:1080&output-quality=90&crop=1080:1080;center,top", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.eonline.com/news/177532/is-kristen-stewart-replacing-angelina-jolie", "title": "Is Kristen Stewart Replacing Angelina Jolie?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "google-site-verification": "jOadQCDbZTkKw5sn27yXszjIb9c3PdMPHENN92uPWy8", "msvalidate.01": "564B986CE3CECCAE84779191BEC6B755", "fb": {"admins": 10101649, "pages": 1387539234854280, "app_id": 195662528604}, "og": {"title": "Is Kristen Stewart Replacing Angelina Jolie? - E!
