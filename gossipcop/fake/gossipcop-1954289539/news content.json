While technically a remake \u2014 of both the original series and the subsequent 2003 film based on it \u2014 CBS\u2019 upcoming cop drama \u201cS.W.A.T.\u201d is very plugged into the current moment, according to its cast and creators. In the series, former \u201cCriminal Minds\u201d star Shemar Moore plays a native Angeleno who runs a tactical unit for the LAPD and finds his loyalty torn between his fellow officers and the community in which he was raised. As co-creator Aaron Rahsaan Thomas told reporters Tuesday at the Television Critics Assn. press tour, the series was inspired by his experiences growing up in Kansas City, which have helped him understand both sides of the raging debate over police violence. \u201cI grew up in a neighborhood that had a very complicated view towards police officers,\u201d said Thomas, who created the series with veteran showrunner Shawn Ryan. \u201cOn one hand, a 12-year-old kid who was a neighbor of mine was shot and killed by a police officer. On the other hand, another neighbor of mine was an actual police officer.\u201d Moore, best known for his long run on the CBS procedural \u201cCriminal Minds,\u201d noted the diversity of the cast and creative team and added that, while the show is primarily designed to entertain, it will also resonate politically. \u201cWe\u2019re taking on the Trump years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t care who you voted for. It\u2019s just what\u2019s happening today. It\u2019s Black Lives Matter. As much as some people don\u2019t want to hear it, it\u2019s All Lives Matter. It\u2019s not just black versus blue or black versus white. It\u2019s every ethnicity. It\u2019s fear. It\u2019s racism. It\u2019s terrorism. It\u2019s subject matter of today.\u201d Ryan, who created the groundbreaking drama \u201cThe Shield,\u201d about corrupt Los Angeles police officers, said he was excited about the chance to examine the often charged relationship between law enforcement and the communities they serve. \u201cLos Angeles is such a diverse, amazing community, and seeing an officer who kind of lives in the city and sort of sees the people that are being policed as humans and as neighbors and as friends was really important to me.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nNetflix getting \u2018A Little Help\u2019 from Carol Burnett By Libby Hill What do you get when you pair up a living legend with a bunch of little kids? Comedy gold, if Netflix has its way. The online streaming service announced Monday that comedy icon Carol Burnett will be returning to television with \u201cA Little Help With Carol Burnett,\u201d an original unscripted series that pairs Burnett with children to tackle life\u2019s dilemmas. \u201cSomeone once asked me how old I am inside,\u201d Burnett said in a statement Monday. \u201cI thought about it and came up with, \u2018I\u2019m about 8.\u2019 So it\u2019s going to be a lot of fun playing with kids my age.\u201d Kids ages 4 to 8 will join Burnett as celebrities and everyday folks bring their real-life problems to the show to get advice in front of a live studio audience. \u201cWe\u2019re thrilled Carol is bringing her unique sensibilities to Netflix,\u201d Bela Bajaria, the service\u2019s vice president of content acquisition, said in Monday\u2019s announcement. \u201cCarol is truly a legend in the entertainment industry with unprecedented success and fandom across TV, film and the stage, and we are both honored and excited to work with her.\u201d \u201cA Little Help With Carol Burnett\u201d will be produced by Dick Clark Productions and is the company\u2019s first Netflix project. This is the second television project announced this year for Burnett, 84. In February, ABC ordered a pilot for the multi-camera comedy \u201cHousehold Name,\u201d starring Burnett, though the series has not been picked up in its current iteration. Debuting in 2018, \u201cA Little Help With Carol Burnett\u201d will feature 12 half-hour episodes.

(Richard Shotwell / Invision) \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself,\u201d Ken Burns told a room of journalists gathered Sunday at the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour in Beverly Hills \u201cWe\u2019re not condemned to repeat what we don\u2019t remember,\u201d Burns explained. \u201cIt\u2019s that human nature never changes.\u201d It\u2019s a curious statement from the storied documentarian, particularly given his latest project, the 18-hour, 10-part documentary series \u201cThe Vietnam War,\u201d directed with Lynn Novick. But just because humanity isn\u2019t trapped in a constantly repeating cycle doesn\u2019t mean that the echoes of modern strife aren\u2019t plentiful throughout the upcoming PBS series. \u201cThis is a story about mass demonstrations all across the country against the current administration,\u201d Burns said in response to a question about what the youth of America will find relevant in \u201cThe Vietnam War.\u201d \u201cAbout a White House obsessed with leaks and in disarray because of those leaks, about a president railing against you, the news media, for making up news. \u201cIt\u2019s about asymmetrical warfare, which even the mighty might of the United States Army can\u2019t figure out the correct strategy to take, and it\u2019s about big document drops of classified material that\u2019s been hacked, that suddenly is dumped into the public sphere, destabilizing the conventional wisdom about really important topics and accusations that a political campaign reached out to a foreign power at the time of a national election to influence that election. \u201cThis is the film we started in 2006, and every single one of those points are points about the Vietnam War having nothing to do with today,\u201d Burns concluded. By creating a fully-formed picture of Vietnam, Burns hopes to shed light on the rancor and alienation defining this present moment, he explained. For Novick, the thematic relevance only serves to help teachers who have long struggled in tackling the Vietnam War. \u201cWe\u2019ve had great response from teachers already that the Vietnam War is difficult to teach because it\u2019s controversial and unsettled history and they\u2019re looking forward to using the film in the classroom,\u201d Novick said. \u201cThose resonances that Ken is talking about, those will be assignments for students. We\u2019re not going to have to work very hard with teachers to come up with those themes, and students are curious about what\u2019s happening now.\u201d \u201cThe Vietnam War\u201d premieres Sept. 17 at 8 p.m. PDT Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGoodbye, MTV Moonman trophy. Hello, \u2018Moon Person\u2019 By Emily Mae Czachor MTV\u2019s token space cadet just scored an identity revamp \u2014 and gender didn\u2019t make the cut. In a recent interview with the New York Times, MTV President Chris McCarthy said the network\u2019s iconic Moonman trophy has been discontinued. From now on, the metallic figurine \u2014 whose impenetrably opaque helmet has become the unofficial \u201cface\u201d of MTV\u2019s Video Music Awards \u2014 will go by \u201cMoon Person\u201d instead. Because who knows what\u2019s really going on beneath that lacquered astronaut getup, anyway. \u201cWhy should it be a man?\u201d McCarthy told the Times. \u201cIt could be a man, it could be a woman, it could be transgender, it could be nonconformist.\u201d This new development is just the latest installment in MTV\u2019s string of efforts to do away with gender norms during its awards proceedings. The network eliminated gender-specific categories at its MTV Movie & TV Awards earlier this year, where all nominees were placed in neutral categories (i.e. best actor in a show, best actor in a movie). And the network isn\u2019t going to stop there. McCarthy also announced a new MTV reality series \u2014 still in development \u2014called \u201cWe Are They\u201d about a group of gender-nonconforming young adults coming of age. With Katy Perry hosting, the VMAs will broadcast from the Forum in Inglewood on Aug. 27. Here\u2019s the full list of nominees.

By Randall Roberts Sam Shepard in 2014. (Jay L. Clendenin / Los Angeles Times) Sam Shepard, whose death at 73 was announced on Monday, will be remembered for his cross-discipline versatility. As a Pulitzer Prize-winning playwright, he penned classic off-Broadway plays including \u201cTrue West,\u201d \u201cBuried Child\u201d and \u201cFool for Love.\u201d An Oscar-nominated actor, he starred in films including \u201cDays of Heaven,\u201d \u201cThe Right Stuff,\u201d \u201cCrimes of the Heart\u201d and \u201cThe Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford.\u201d To fans of underground music, however, Shepard served a lesser-known role as the drummer for seminal New York avant-garde folk band the Holy Modal Rounders, with whom he performed on the crucial late 1960s albums \u201cIndian War Whoop\u201d and \u201cThe Moray Eels Eat the Holy Modal Rounders.\u201d The band is best known for its song \u201cIf You Want to Be a Bird,\u201d which plays during the classic scene in \u201cEasy Rider\u201d in which Dennis Hopper, Peter Fonda and Jack Nicholson roar down the highway on their motorcycles. That\u2019s Shepard playing drums as Rounders founders Peter Stampfel and Steve Weber whoop and yowl. It was in his capacity as a percussionist, in fact, that he drew the attention of a young Patti Smith, who, in her 2010 memoir \u201cJust Kids,\u201d recounted their first early \u201870s meeting at seminal music club the Village Gate. Escorted to the club by Todd Rundgren, who had just issued his album \u201cRunt,\u201d Smith described the Holy Modal Rounders\u2019 set as \u201clike being at an Arabian hoedown with a band of psychedelic hillbillies. I was fixed on the drummer, who seemed as if he was on the lam and had slid behind the drums while cops looked elsewhere.\u201d Smith, who at the time was freelancing for Crawdaddy magazine, introduced herself to this drummer, who said his name was Slim Shadow. The two started hanging out, wrote Smith, describing his tales as being \u201ceven taller than mine. He had an infectious laugh and was rugged, smart, and intuitive. In my mind, he was the fellow with the cowboy mouth.\u201d Only later did she learn Slim\u2019s real identity when a friend pulled her aside after seeing them at a restaurant together. As recounted in \u201cJust Kids,\u201d Smith wrote that her friend asked, \u201cWhat are you doing with Sam Shepard?\u201d \u201cSam Shepard?\u201d I said. \u201cOh, no, this guy\u2019s name is Slim.\u201d \u201cHoney, don\u2019t you know who he is?\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s the drummer for the Holy Modal Rounders.\u201d No, corrected her friend, \u201cHe\u2019s the biggest playwright off-Broadway. He had a play at Lincoln Center. He won five Obies!\u201d Once she learned of his reputation and acclaim, Smith and Shepard continued to see each other -- despite his being married at the time -- and eventually collaborated on a play called \u201cCowboy Mouth.\u201d Smith described telling him of nervousness at writing for the stage, which she had never done. But Shepard urged her on, Smith wrote, telling her that \u201cyou can\u2019t make a mistake when you improvise.\u201d Replied Smith: \u201cWhat if I screw up the rhythm?\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t,\u201d Shepard explained. \u201cIt\u2019s like drumming. If you miss a beat, you create another.\u201d 7:15 a.m. Updated to correct the title of Smith\u2019s memoir, \u201cJust Kids,\u201d and to identify the Holy Modal Rounders\u2019 co-founders, Stampfel and Weber.

On Saturday, attorneys for Dr. Luke, whose real name is Lukasz Gottwald, issued a statement regarding their attempt to depose Lady Gaga about relevant conversations she may have had with Kesha. The artist, who was born Kesha Sebert, is the subject of a defamation suit filed in New York by Dr. Luke stemming from allegations of sexual misconduct, which the producer vigorously denies. The statement reads: \u201cDr. Luke\u2019s counsel served a subpoena on Lady Gaga because she has relevant information regarding, among other things, false statements about Dr. Luke made to her by Kesha. This motion has become necessary because Dr. Luke\u2019s counsel has not been able to obtain, despite repeated request [sic], a deposition date from Lady Gaga.\u201d The protracted legal battle between Dr. Luke, left, and Kesha has brought Lady Gaga into the fray. (Kevin Winter / Getty Images) Representatives for Gaga, whose real name is Stefani Germanotta, said in a statement issued to The Times on Monday morning: \u201cAs Lady Gaga\u2019s legal team will present to the court, she has provided all of the relevant information in her possession and is at most an ancillary witness in this process. Dr. Luke\u2019s team is attempting to manipulate the truth and draw press attention to their case by exaggerating Lady Gaga\u2019s role and falsely accusing her of dodging reasonable requests.\u201d Among the information Lady Gaga has provided are copies of text messages that were, according to a report on TMZ, heavily redacted. Lady Gaga has been a vocal Kesha supporter. Last year, Gaga wrote about her peer\u2019s plight in an Instagram post: \u201cThe very reason women don\u2019t speak up for years is the fear that no one will believe them or their abuser has threatened their life or life of their loved ones/livelihood in order to keep their victim quiet and under control. What happened to Kesha has happened to many female artists, including myself, and it will affect her for the rest of her life.\u201d The news comes at a particularly crucial moment for Kesha\u2019s career. On Aug. 11, she will release her highly anticipated new album, \u201cRainbow.\u201d The record, featuring songs such as \u201cLearn to Let Go,\u201d will arrive via Dr. Luke\u2019s imprint, Kemosabe, a situation Kesha sought to avoid in a 2014 lawsuit of her own, which she later dropped.

With more than 50 tattoos already under her belt, the 19-year-old daughter of late pop king Michael Jackson collects body art like postage stamps. According to E! News, the budding actress got her latest over the weekend: an understated sketch of a red spoon, just below the crook of her left arm. A new tattoo might be old-hat for Jackson, but it wasn\u2019t for Macaulay Culkin, Jackson\u2019s 36-year-old godfather -- and first-time tattoo patron -- who emerged from West Hollywood\u2019s Tattoo Mania with a matching spoon on his own forearm. Though neither Jackson nor Culkin spoke to the meaning of the double-inking, the design is supposedly meant to represent a kind of chronic struggle. And that\u2019s not the only news that Culkin made recently. The Internet nearly lost its collective mind last week when a new photo emerged of the \u201cHome Alone\u201d actor looking healthy and happy. E!

On Sunday\u2019s \u201cLast Week Tonight,\u201d John Oliver noted that Jones\u2019 status as a Sandy Hook \u201ctruther\u201d qualified him for an Easy Pass to \u201chell\u2019s version of the champagne room.\u201d But he spent most of his time on a relatively overlooked aspect of Jones\u2019 conspiracy empire -- the wide range of products that he sells in order to fund it. According to Oliver, Jones spends nearly a quarter of his airtime plugging InfoWars-branded merchandise, including Wake Up America Patriot coffee to Combat One Tactical Bath Wipes and a powder called Caveman True Paleo (made from \u201cchocolate and domesticated bird corpses,\u201d Oliver joked). As the comedian pointed out, it just so happens that many of the products Jones sells, often at a significant markup, purport to address the conspiracy theories with equally wild-eyed zeal. Think: water filters to remove chemicals that supposedly turn frogs gay or vitamins to boost your immunity and ward off germs from allegedly disease-ridden refugees. Jones even has his own in-house \u201cexpert,\u201d Dr. Edward Group, with dubious qualifications (and equally questionable hair) to back up his various outlandish claims. InfoWars is essentially a \u201cQVC for conspiracy,\u201d Oliver argued. So in the spirit of InfoWars, Oliver decided to introduce his own personal care product, John Oliver Moisture-Armored Tactical Assault Wipes, available via Infowipes.com. The price? A mere $1 million. Worth every penny, we\u2019re sure. You can watch the complete segment here.

Well, if that film is \u201cCasablanca,\u201d one person\u2019s answer is $478,000. That\u2019s how much a bidder coughed up Saturday for the only known surviving Italian-issue poster for the 1942 film starring Humphrey Bogart and Ingrid Bergman. The poster sold through Heritage Auctions of Dallas. \u201cThe buyer has just set a world record and acquired what we in the poster collecting world would equate to a masterpiece,\u201d said Grey Smith, Heritage\u2019s director of vintage posters. \u201cThe stunning artistry put into this poster makes it stand head and shoulders above any paper produced for the film.\u201d The poster, measuring 55.5 inches by 78.25 inches, was produced in 1946. The film opened in Italy on Nov. 21 that year, almost four years after its U.S. premiere. Featuring artwork by Luigi Martinati, the poster is considered the best of the picture\u2019s numerous advertisements, Smith said. Previous Italian-issue posters for the film have sold for as much as $203,000. A U.S.-issue of the poster has fetched $191,200. The auction featured other rare posters for the film, with a half-sheet going for $65,725, and a postwar Spanish-release poster selling for $35,850. ---------- For the Record An earlier version of this article misstated the purchase price of the \u201cCasablanca\u201d poster sold Saturday as $487,000.

Brown / Getty Images) PBS President and Chief Executive Paula Kerger wasn\u2019t pulling any punches Sunday at the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour in Beverly Hills. \u201cWhen people say, \u2018What is the Plan B for [loss of federal funding]?\u2019 There is no Plan B for that,\u201d Kerger said of the potential budget crisis public broadcasting faces under the Trump administration. The Corporation for Public Broadcasting has been under fire for months, with President Trump\u2019s proposed budget axing the institution\u2019s $450-million budget. Though it\u2019s easy to suggest that budget cuts would threaten Big Bird\u2019s livelihood, the true victims of defunding would be far more human. Kerger explained that of PBS\u2019 $450-million budget, one-third goes to radio. Of the television budget, most goes to community service grants that local stations use for up to 50% of their operating budgets. \u201cPBS itself will not go away. But a number of our stations will. If you are a station for whom 30 or 40 or 50% of your funding is suddenly pulled away, there\u2019s no way you can make up that money,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cYou will find big parts of the country that will suddenly be without public broadcasting.\u201d The fate of public broadcasting is currently in flux, waiting for the end of Congress\u2019 August recess for resolution. Currently, the House Appropriations Committee has approved the bulk of the PBS budget, while the House Budget Committee recommended doing away with funding altogether. Budget concerns aside, Kerger also addressed other unresolved PBS matters. The second seat of \u201cPBS NewsHour\u201d has been vacant since the untimely death of co-host Gwen Ifill in November 2016, leaving Judy Woodruff as the show\u2019s sole anchor. \u201cWe have encouraged [executive producer] Sara Just and Judy Woodruff and the team at \u2018NewsHour\u2019 to take their time and think very carefully about who that right person [to replace Ifill] is,\u201d Kerger said. \u201cI\u2019m hopeful that they will be making an announcement sometime over the next few months of a new anchor.\u201d Kerger also announced an upcoming project aimed at inspiring the country to come together in celebration of literature. \u201cThe Great American Read\u201d is an eight-part series launching in spring 2018 that explores the nation\u2019s 100 best-loved books, chosen by the American people and culminating in the first-ever national vote to choose \u201cAmerica\u2019s Best-Loved Book.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\n\u2018AMC Visionaries\u2019 adds Eli Roth, Roots, Gibney for new docu-series By Meredith Woerner Robert Kirkman, left, and Eli Roth at the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour in Beverly Hills.

The cable network also has three other installments in development: \u201cHistory of Video Games,\u201d \u201cOutlaws of the Internet,\u201d and \u201cHistory of Martial Arts.\u201d The new \u201cVisionaries\u201d members join the previously announced programs \u201cRobert Kirkman\u2019s Secret History of Comics\u201d and \u201cJames Cameron\u2019s Story of Science Fiction.\u201d Kirkman and Roth were present at the AMC panel with Cameron appearing via satellite to show sneak peeks from the comics and sci-fi iterations of the series. A sizzle reel for the \u201cSecret History of Comics\u201d utilized plenty of classic panel pages and a sort of motion comic-like animation to illustrate the early days of Marvel Comics, going all the way back to the Stan Lee and Jack Kirby days. But the real treat was a collection of cameos, famous faces opining about their love of the form including Lee himself, J.K. Simmons, Kevin Smith, and Method Man, who earnestly revealed, \u201cYou have to be born a comic book fan, I think.\u201d And there are plenty more talking heads to come, the AMC press release promised Patty Jenkins, Lynda Carter, Famke Janssen, Michelle Rodriguez, and Todd McFarlane. The second clip shared a look at Cameron\u2019s love letter to science fiction. \u201cToday, science fiction is mainstream but it didn\u2019t used to be that way,\u201d the director explained. \u201cWhen I was a kid science fiction wasn\u2019t cool, but I thought it was cool.\u201d Cameron wants to focus on closing the gap between current fans\u2019 knowledge of modern day sci-fi to the pioneering works of literature that inspired the blockbuster offerings of today. The \u201cTerminator\u201d and \u201cAvatar\u201d director noted that without Jules Verne and H.G. Wells there would be no Avengers, \u201cStar Wars\u201d or his own works. The series will be divided by theme -- space travel, time travel etc.-- and include appearances from Paul W. Anderson, Roland Emmerich, Paul Verhoeven, Bryan Singer, Keanu Reeves, Jonathan Nolan, David Gerrold and D.C. Fontana. When asked how their respective series would showcase diversity -- the footage screened was very male-centric -- Kirkman responded that \u201cHistory of Comics\u201d would have two episodes devoted to diversity. One will focus on the women who helped Wonder Woman creator William Moulton Marston steer the course of the hugely famous female superhero, and another highlighting people of color titled \u201cThe Color of Comics.\u201d The episode \u201cexplores the history of black characters, and the lack of black characters in the comic book industry,\u201d said Kirkman. \u201cwhich touches on the creation of Black Panther \u2014 the Marvel character \u2014 and does a really cool focus on this company called Milestone Comics that was founded by a group of African American comic book creators to create characters that appealed to them and represented them, because there was a huge lack of representation in comics even in the \u201890s.\u201d \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t have horror without Mary Shelley and \u2018Frankenstein,\u2019\u201d Roth added. He cited the late George Romero as an example of how he wants to break down the themes within the horror genre. \u201cAt the height of the civil rights movement [Romero] puts an African American as the lead of \u2018Night of the Living Dead\u2019 and at the end of the movie he\u2019s shot by a bunch of rednecks. Not because of the color of his skin, but because they think he\u2019s a zombie. But you can read into the implications of that. What [Romero] was doing with using genre to explore racism was so ahead of its time. it\u2019s just as potent today as it was 50 years ago. It\u2019s absolutely something we\u2019re going to be discussing.\u201d Roth\u2019s urgency to document the horror masters was apparent. It was the death of \u201cScream\u201d moviemaker Wes Craven that inspired Roth to get involved in \u201cVisionaries.\u201d The panel then took a turn for the analytical when the creators were asked how their series would reflect the world today. \u201cThe fact that dystopian science fiction has come back, especially in television and in movies, is very important,\u201d said Cameron. \u201cIt means that in the age that we live in right now the challenges that face us are technological. They\u2019re science challenges: climate change, genetics, artificial intelligence, things like that. These are really on our horizon as major, existential threats.\u201d \u201cThe best horror reflects what\u2019s going on in our times,\u201d said Roth. He used Jordan Peele\u2019s \u201cGet Out\u201d \u2014 which addressed modern day racial tensions\u2014 as a reference. \u201cIt\u2019s no accident that movie coming out right now is making over $200 million at the box office. You can tell it\u2019s really resonating with people.\u201d Bouncing off Cameron\u2019s dystopia revelation, Roth then turned his lens onto the current political climate, \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019ve ever seen a cast of characters like this in our White House that\u2019s straight out of WWF wrestling in the \u201880s. When [Anthony Scaramucci] is coming out with things that would make \u2018Rowdy\u2019 Roddy Piper in his heyday blush. This is a farce, is this actually happening?\u201d When will we start seeing this dystopian outlook on the current political climate in the movies? Possibly before Roth\u2019s series, which will air sometime in 2018, after \u201cHistory of Comics\u201d and the \u201cStory of Science Fiction\u201d in 2017.

The production came under fire this week following its move to replace Onaodowan, who was in the original cast of \u201cHamilton,\u201d with Tony Award winner Patinkin in a titular role. \u201cAs part of our sincere efforts to keep \u2018Comet\u2019 running for the benefit of its cast, creative team, crew, investors and everyone else involved, we arranged for Mandy Patinkin to play Pierre,\u201d co-producer Howard Kagan said in an official statement posted Friday on Twitter. Kagan said they had the wrong impression of how Onaodowan felt about Patinkin\u2019s casting and how it would be received by members of the theater community, \u201cwhich we appreciate is deeply invested in the success of actors of color \u2013 as are we \u2013 and to whom we are grateful for bringing this to our attention.\u201d \u201cWe regret our mistake deeply, and wish to express our apologies to everyone who felt hurt and betrayed by these actions,\u201d he said. The legendary Broadway star dropped out of the musical on Friday after the announcement that he would be replacing the African American star was met with disdain. Patinkin was to join the cast for a limited run from Aug. 15 through Sept. 3, but declined the part because he \u201cwould never accept a role knowing it would harm another actor.\u201d \u201cI hear what members of the community have said and I agree with them. I am a huge fan of Oak and I will, therefore, not be appearing in the show,\u201d the \u201cHomeland\u201d alum tweeted. Another tweet on the show\u2019s account included an apology to Patinkin \u201cfor any misunderstanding\u201d and said they understood his decision to withdraw from the show. Our deepest apologies. pic.twitter.com/Mks7XLGxbq \u2014 The Great Comet (@GreatCometBway) July 28, 2017 pic.twitter.com/vSZk6K2KOV \u2014 The Great Comet (@GreatCometBway) July 28, 2017 Onaodowan, who had replaced recording artist Josh Groban in the role of Pierre earlier this month, is scheduled to continue to perform through Aug. 13, after which, he stated Friday on Twitter, he will not return to the show. It is unclear if his decision to leave the production was his own or prompted by other factors. Show creator Dave Malloy, whose musical was inspired by a portion of Leo Tolstoy\u2019s \u201cWar and Peace,\u201d also apologized Friday on Twitter for \u201chow everything went down\u201d and missing the \u201cracial optics\u201d of their casting decision. They had previously asked actress Brittain Ashford to step aside for the casting of better-known singer-songwriter Ingrid Michaelson during the summer months and they didn\u2019t anticipate that Patinkin\u2019s casting would be viewed differently, Malloy said. Despite 12 Tony Award nominations, \u201cComet\u201d only received two wins -- for set and lighting -- at the June ceremony and ticket sales ebbed when Groban departed. Malloy said that sales for shows after Aug. 13, when Michaelson\u2019s run would also end, were \u201ccatastrophically low.\u201d So they decided to cast Patinkin, hoping that his star power would help boost sales, because the \u201cweird show\u201d was in \u201cdesperate shape\u201d and on the brink of closing.

(Kevin Mazur / Getty Images) The Eagles\u2019\u201cClassic\u201d music festival series will continue with at least one more stop, this time in Seattle. But unlike the inaugural Classic West bill July 15-16 at Dodger Stadium, which is having a Classic East encore this weekend in New York, the added Classic Northwest show on Sept. 30 will be just a single day and feature the Eagles and Doobie Brothers only. The Classic West and East shows teamed the Eagles, Steely Dan and Doobie Brothers on one day, with Fleetwood Mac, Journey and Earth, Wind & Fire on the second day of each. Tickets for the Classic Northwest bill go on sale Aug. 5 at 10 a.m. at Ticketmaster. At the outset of the Eagles\u2019 portion of Classic West on July 15, co-founder Don Henley indicated it was still uncertain how much of a future his long-running band might have absent co-founder Glenn Frey, who died last year at 67. To make the Classic West and East shows possible, the group tapped Frey\u2019s son, singer-guitarist Deacon Frey, and country music star Vince Gill to handle the lead vocals on the many Eagles songs that were originally sung by Glenn Frey. \u201cIn case this is our last dance,\u201d Henley told the crowd at Dodger Stadium, where he was joined by longtime bandmates Joe Walsh and Timothy B.

(Willy Sanjuan / Invision/Associated Press) From her stand-up act to her Comedy Central series to her Twitter account, comic-actress Sarah Silverman has a long history of courting laughs and controversy. Her outspokenness and sometimes absurd, sometimes acerbic views on everything from celebrity to culture to politics, particularly President Trump and his administration, have raised eyebrows. On her upcoming Hulu series, \u201cI Love You, America,\u201d Silverman is focused more on forming bonds than being provocative. In surveying the current political landscape and the comedy shows that skewer it, Silverman says she wants to reach out to all on the political spectrum. \u201cFor me, [those shows are] great, but they really connect with more like-minded people. They\u2019re brilliant. They\u2019re funny. But I\u2019m hoping to, with this show, connect with un-like-minded people,\u201d Silverman said Thursday during a panel at the Television Critics Assn.'s summer press tour in Beverly Hills. \u201cThe mission of the show is that we\u2019re all the same. But what\u2019s important is that it\u2019s funny.\u201d Although the exact format of the show is still being refined, Silverman did reveal some elements, including a monologue, a focus group in the studio and field pieces in which she travels around the country talking to people. For example, Silverman says she plans to go to Slidell, La., to meet a family that says they have never met a Jewish person. \u201cI can\u2019t help but have preconceived notions. They can\u2019t help but have preconceived notions,\u201d said Silverman. \u201cAll I can do is just try to be open and brave and go into the situation. And same for them.\u201d Although Silverman and executive producer Adam McKay didn\u2019t make any sharp criticisms about Trump at Thursday\u2019s session, they did take exception to his attacks against so-called entertainment liberals or \u201cthe Hollywood elite.\u201d \u201cWhat is he talking about?\u201d said Silverman. \u201cI\u2019m from ... New Hampshire. Everybody out here is from somewhere else.\u201d The goal of the show will be to seek common ground and understanding, she said: \u201cUltimately we\u2019re all the same.

The Comedy Central star once again landed on Forbes\u2019 list of highest-paid comedians, the financial magazine announced Thursday. She was the first woman comic to crack the top 10 last year and remains the only woman on the list this year. The \u201cTrainwreck\u201d and \u201cSnatched\u201d star made an estimated $37.5 million between June 2016 and June 2017 thanks to her Netflix show \u201cThe Leather Special,\u201d her memoir \u201cThe Girl With the Lower Back Tattoo\u201d and endorsement deals with Bud Light and Old Navy. That ranked the raunchy comic No. 5 on the list filled with veteran comedy heavyweights. Meanwhile, the \u201cSeinfeld\u201d and \u201cComedians in Cars Getting Coffee\u201d star shot back to the top of the list this year, earning an estimated $69 million. Seinfeld was eclipsed last year by Kevin Hart, who this year dropped to the No. 6 spot with $32.5 million. Chris Rock trailed Seinfeld for the second spot on Forbes\u2019 list, earning $57 million. His record-breaking $20 million-per-special contract with Netflix paved the way for several comics, including Seinfeld, to cut lucrative deals with the streaming service, which is poised to become the go-to-destination for comedy specials. In addition to touring, those deals significantly padded the incomes of several stars on Forbes\u2019 list. In the third and fourth spots, funnymen Louis C.K. and Dave Chappelle, who earned $52 million and $47 million, respectively, also made expensive deals with the streaming service to make their millions.

Bees, apparently. The seventh season of FX\u2019s hit horror anthology series is slowly revealing itself via its official Twitter account. On Thursday, the series shared the official poster for the series, and it is super messed up. The poster features a deathly pale woman who happens to be missing the top of her head and, for that matter, her brain. Instead, the inside of her head is a honeycomb, replete with bees and, of course, honey. This is creepy for so many reasons. Here are a few: This poor woman has had the top of her skull removed, bringing to mind that particularly gruesome dinner scene featuring Anthony Hopkins and Ray Liotta in the 2001 film \u201cHannibal.\u201d Even more horrifying is that this poor, sweet woman is definitely dressed like a clown. The white makeup, lines through the eyes and exaggerated ruby red lips suggest that \u201cAHS: Cult\u201d is drawing inspiration from traditional grotesque whiteface clown makeup. Think more Pennywise, less juggalo. (And if none of that is enough to scare you, please enjoy this clown dating site I stumbled across while researching all of this.)

He was, of course, referring to Scaramucci\u2019s disapproving -- and often vulgar -- comments about White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus and chief strategist Steve Bannon in a New Yorker article that sent social media tongues wagging Thursday. But to even discuss the matter, Colbert had to issue a warning to CBS censors: \u201cYou\u2019re going to want to break out the extra bleeps for this one,\u201d he said before diving in. (If only we could get our ellipses to put in some overtime!) In his colorful conversation with New Yorker correspondent Ryan Lizza, which took place Wednesday night,Scaramucci was trying to get to the bottom of who leaked that he had dinner at the White House with President Trump, the first lady, Sean Hannity and the former Fox News executive Bill Shine. Scaramucci described Priebus as a \u201c ... paranoid schizophrenic\u201d who had blocked him from the White House for six months -- prompting Colbert to break out an impression of Scaramucci. \u201cYes, the guy\u2019s paranoid, OK? He thinks his own communications director is gonna stab him in the back again,\u201d Colbert said with an exaggerated Italian accent. \u201cFront stab!\u201d he added with a knifing gesture. The New Yorker article also detailed how Scaramucci accused Bannon of seeking to \u201cbuild [his] own brand off the \u2026 strength of the president\u201d and made some other inflammatory remarks that we can\u2019t fully detail.

He was 83. During his 54 years at Disney, Sklar worked closely with Walt Disney and led the creative development of the Burbank company\u2019s theme parks, attractions and resorts around the world, including the company\u2019s ventures in the cruise business, housing development and the redesign of Times Square in New York. \u201cEverything about Marty was legendary \u2013 his achievements, his spirit, his career,\u201d Disney Chief Executive Robert Iger said in a statement. \u201cHe embodied the very best of Disney, from his bold originality to his joyful optimism and relentless drive for excellence.

By Yvonne Villarreal \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d creator/executive producer/star Mindy Kaling with executive producers Matt Warburton, left, and Ike Barinholtz at the show\u2019s Television Critics Assn. press tour panel. (Willy Sanjuan/Invision/AP) Is there a happily ever after written in the stars for the final season of \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d? Series creator Mindy Kaling, who also plays the titular heroine at the center of the Hulu comedy, took the stage Thursday at the Television Critics Assn. press tour in Beverly Hills to discuss the show\u2019s swan song season. And when asked if Kaling\u2019s rom-com-obsessed character, Mindy Lahiri, would get her storybook ending, the 38-year-old actress suggested it wouldn\u2019t necessarily be in the way viewers expect. \u201cI think that all of us would agree that we do have \u2018happily ever after,\u2019 the connotations of it,\u201d said Kaling, who was joined onstage by executive producer and showrunner, Matt Warburton, and producer and star Ike Barinholtz (sporting a neck brace from a recent stunt gone wrong). But \u201chappily ever after\u201d isn\u2019t the same as no loose ends, she said. \u201cThat everything is tied up neatly in a bow is something we aren\u2019t super interested in.\u201d \u201cThat side of it I think we\u2019re trying to avoid,\u201d Kaling added, \u201cwhile also leaving the audience with the sense of feeling that it was about something and that it really was a \u2018project\u2019 and that she had some growth in the end.\u201d And for fans wondering whether or how Danny Castellano (played by Chris Messina) would factor into all that, the season promises to shed some light on that. For the unitiated, Messina\u2019s Danny is Mindy\u2019s former fiance and the father of her child. Messina, who hasn\u2019t been a series regular since Season 4, is set to return for multiple episodes. And while the Season 5 finale ended with Mindy marrying boyfriend Ben (Bryan Greenberg), hints were thrown that the new episodes would bring some clarity to the Mindy-Danny relationship. \u201cThe one thing we can promise the audience is a little bit of clarity about where they stand,\u201d Warburton said. \u201cIt\u2019s so great to see him back because we\u2019ve always known they\u2019re always going to be in each other\u2019s lives \u2026 but it\u2019s great to actually see what that means this season.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s complicated,\u201d added Kaling. \u201cThey\u2019re both married to other people, so we went into that season with all of that, which makes things sort of fun and delicious.\u201d Other familiar faces set to return for the final season are Mark and Jay Duplass, Adam Pally and Glenn Howerton. Kaling, in discussing the decision to end the series, promised a good finale. \u201cThe decision to end the show was our decision, and I think that\u2019s always very hard,\u201d Kaling said. \u201cIt was like, God, should this be the end? ... I think right now the idea of doing a prequel or something like that just felt \u2014 we just have such a good finale. We have such a good finale that we\u2019ve known about for awhile.\u201d The final season of \u201cThe Mindy Project\u201d will start its rollout on Hulu in September.

Brown / Getty Images) \u201cThank God.\u201d That\u2019s what Tracy Morgan had to say about what it means for the \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum to be returning to TV three years after the devastating accident that put him in a coma and resulted in the death of his friend James \u201cJimmy Mack\u201d McNair. The stand-up comic and actor, whose new TBS comedy, \u201cThe Last O.G.\u201d premieres Oct. 24, was full of gratitude and thoughts on starting over during the presentation for the show at the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour Thursday in Beverly Hills. Executive produced by Morgan, Jordan Peele and John Carcieri, \u201cThe Last O.G.\u201d chronicles the adventures of Tray (Morgan). Newly sprung from prison after serving 15 years, he has to acclimate to the changed times, his gentrified Brooklyn neighborhood and his former girlfriend (Tiffany Haddish of \u201cGirls Trip\u201d) raising the children he didn\u2019t know existed with another man. \u201cThis is a show about humanity, this is a show about second chances, this is a show about redemption,\u201d said Morgan, answering a question about whether it would explicitly explore African American issues. \u201cI wanted to transcend that... I wanted to deal with humanity.\u201d Haddish, naturally, fielded several questions about \u201cGirls Trip,\u201d the new comedy film that has minted her as a star. \u201cI feel like a foster kid who\u2019s been in the system for a long time and then turned 16 and somebody adopted them and said, \u2018You can go to college and you ain\u2019t got to pay no school loans or nothing,\u2019 \u201d she said of how she\u2019s been feeling in the wake of the film\u2019s superb box office. \u201cI\u2019m happy! I\u2019ve been accepted finally after all these years of hard work, blood, sweat and tears.\u201d Haddish said she was looking forward to her role in \u201cThe Last O.G.\u201d since it\u2019s a character who has gone through a transition in her life, just as she herself has. Her fellow cast mates, including Cedric the Entertainer, good-naturedly ribbed her about becoming a diva since she\u2019s now a movie star. But Morgan noted seriously that Haddish has been nothing but a pro: \u201cShe comes to work.\u201d Haddish joked: \u201cMy bank account, it don\u2019t show movie star yet. I\u2019m waiting on it. They say nine months; it\u2019s like a baby. I\u2019m waiting for the delivery.\u201d Morgan said it was important to surround himself with scene stealers such as Haddish and Cedric and was clearly earnest in his appreciation of his collaborators and their sensitivity to his physical needs. \u201cThey make sure I sit down... they don\u2019t ask me, they [say] sit down for a little while. So I\u2019m good. I\u2019m taken care of by my people, and I love them with my heart.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nIt can be TGIF every day on Hulu: The service lands popular ABC programming block in SVOD deal By Yvonne Villarreal Every day can be Friday in the \u201890s with help from Hulu. The streaming service announced Thursday it has signed a deal with Warner Bros. Domestic Television Distribution for the exclusive streaming rights to programs that were part of the popular ABC programming block known as TGIF. The announcement was made during the streaming service\u2019s day of panels at the Television Critics Assn. press tour in Beverly Hills. The shows under the deal include \u201cFull House,\u201d \u201cFamily Matters,\u201d \u201cPerfect Strangers,\u201d \u201cStep by Step\u201d and \u201cHangin\u2019 With Mr. Cooper.\u201d Nabbing the rights to \u201cFull House\u201d is particularly noteworthy considering Hulu\u2019s rival Netflix\u2019s success with reviving the comedy, which is returning for a third season in September. With the Hulu deal, more than 800 episodes of the five sitcoms from the bygone family friendly lineup will be available beginning Friday, Sept. 29. \u201cThese shows are more than just beloved hits, they were part of a cultural tradition to tune in every Friday night,\u201d said Craig Erwich, Hulu\u2019s senior vice president of content in a statement.

Prizes will be awarded to comedy and drama series, limited series, reality competition, variety talk and sketch, television movie, acting, directing, and writing during the live telecast on CBS. HBO\u2019s \u201cWestworld\u201d and NBC\u2019s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d lead the nominees with 22 nods apiece, a total that includes several below-the-line categories to be doled out at the two Creative Arts Emmys ceremonies the week before. Honoring artistic and technical achievements that could make or break your play-at-home ballot, the Creative Arts Emmys will be held in the same venue on two consecutive nights on Sept. 9 and 10.

(This is her new M.O., it would seem.) \u201cLearn to Let Go,\u201d which Kesha co-wrote alongside her mother, Pebe Sebert, is a heartrending chronicle of redemption. \u201cHad a boogeyman under my bed/ Putting crazy thoughts inside my head,\u201d she sings, while real home-video footage of a whimsical young Kesha cuts between clips of a grown Kesha frolicking through the forest. The chorus rings like a self-empowered anthem: \u201cThe past can\u2019t haunt me if I don\u2019t let it.\u201d \u201cMy mom is always telling me how you have to learn to accept that you can\u2019t try to control everything,\u201d she wrote in the letter. \u201cWhen you realize that you are not the one in control and you stop holding onto regrets \u2015 it\u2019s liberating. \u201cYour past only has as much effect on your future as you want it to,\u201d Kesha continued. \u201cIt\u2019s about embracing your past, but not letting it define you.\u201d Her new album, \u201cRainbow,\u201d will be released Aug. 11.

Now he\u2019s riding it all the way to premium cable. On Thursday, Showtime announced it had ordered 10 episodes of an as-yet-untitled animated series featuring cartoon renderings of the president, his family and inner circle. The satirical half-hour series, executive produced by Colbert and \u201cThe Late Show\u2019s\u201d show runner Chris Licht, will debut on Showtime this fall. According to the network, turnaround on the series will be quick in order to incorporate current events. \u201cStephen and Chris have an uncanny genius for deconstructing the world of President Trump, and this series opens a new realm for them,\u201d Showtime President David Nevins said in a press statement. Tim Luecke, who co-created the animated version of Trump who frequently appears in \u201cLate Show\u201d bits \u2014 including a recent segment from the notorious presidential suite of the Moscow Ritz-Carlton \u2014 will serve as lead animator. The announcement caps off a period of good news for Colbert, who racked up six Emmy nominations this month and will be hosting the awards in September. The recently concluded \u201cRussia Week,\u201d in which the comedian traveled to Moscow and St. Petersburg, brought \u201cThe Late Show\u201d its biggest margin over \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d since its premiere in 2015. While \u201cThe Late Show\u201d airs on CBS, Colbert has also developed ties with his corporate cousins at Showtime. Many point to his riveting election night special \u201cStephen Colbert\u2019s Live Election Night Democracy\u2019s Series Finale,\u201d which aired on the premium network, as a turning point after an uneven transition from \u201cThe Colbert Report.\u201d For its part, Showtime has invested heavily in political content over the last 18 months, most notably the documentary series \u201cThe Circus,\u201d from journalists Mark Halperin and John Heilemann.

And Matt Damon\u2019s Gardner Lodge gets stuck in the thick of it -- defending his young son, making death threats, killing mobsters and getting popped square in his bespectacled face at the office -- as seen in the first trailer that Paramount unveiled Thursday. Did we mention this is a comedy? The dark, screwball kind from the minds of screenwriters Clooney and frequent collaborators Ethan and Joel Coen and Grant Heslov? Well, it is, in case that wasn\u2019t clear from the previous description. \u201cThese animals took everything from us,\u201d a blood-splattered Gardner tells his son Nicky (Noah Jupe) at the dinner table. \u201cI have to make decisions like what\u2019s best for the family.\u201d After Gardner\u2019s wife is murdered, he invites \u201cAuntie Margaret\u201d (Julianne Moore) to come live in the manicured suburban community to help with his son. Meanwhile, he gets mixed up with a loan shark that sets him on the warpath of a formidable, coffee-swilling collector named Roger (Oscar Isaac). The film is based on a script that the Coen brothers wrote years ago that Clooney found, and they agreed to have him direct it, according to Moore. Paramount acquired the U.S. rights to the film, billed as a comedy, crime and mystery, at the Berlin Film Festival last year. It will be shown at the Toronto International Film Festival in September and hits theaters on Oct. 27.

(Christopher Polk / Getty Images for Turner) Thursday it was announced that Woody Allen\u2019s latest film, \u201cWonder Wheel,\u201d will have its world premiere as the closing-night film at this year\u2019s New York Film Festival. The film stars Kate Winslet, Justin Timberlake, Juno Temple and James Belushi in a story set around Coney Island in the 1950s. But that wasn\u2019t the only Allen item of the day. Variety reported that \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d will also be the first film fully distributed by Amazon when it opens in theaters on Dec. 1. The company has already made fast inroads to the movie business, winning Academy Awards this year for \u201cManchester by the Sea\u201d and \u201cThe Salesman,\u201d but has up to now worked with established distribution partners such as Roadside Attractions or Bleecker Street to help get those movies into theaters. Amazon released Allen\u2019s 2016 film, \u201cCafe Society,\u201d starring Jesse Eisenberg, Kristen Stewart and Steve Carell, in partnership with Lionsgate. The online giant also released Allen\u2019s six-part \u201cCrisis in Six Scenes,\u201d in which he starred alongside Elaine May and Miley Cyrus, late last year via the Amazon Prime Video streaming service. The move by Amazon is yet another way the company is distinguishing itself in relation to streaming rival Netflix. Where Netflix has been seen as pulling back from theatrical distribution, opting for either extremely limited or no theatrical release at all of its titles to drive viewers to its own platform, this latest push by Amazon renews its commitment to traditional theatrical releases. The New York Film Festival slot for \u201cWonder Wheel\u201d gives Amazon the three marquee spots at the showcase. Previously announced, Richard Linklater\u2019s \u201cLast Flag Flying\u201d will open the festival, and Todd Haynes\u2019 \u201cWonderstruck,\u201d which premiered at this year\u2019s Cannes Film Festival, will show in the centerpiece slot. Other upcoming Amazon titles include Mike White\u2019s \u201cBrad\u2019s Status,\u201d starring Ben Stiller, and Luca Guadagnino\u2019s remake of \u201cSuspiria,\u201d starring Dakota Johnson.

But a pair of urgent new singles are firmly set in the present. On Thursday, the Rolling Stones frontman released two tracks, \u201cGotta Get A Grip\u201d and \u201cEngland Lost,\u201d that describe, as he put it in a statement, the \u201canxiety, unknowability of the changing political situation\u201d in a post-Brexit U.K. The production is resolutely modern, built on programmed drums and clanging guitar noise. The London grime artist Skepta even joins him for a verse on \u201cEngland Lost.\u201d \u201cOstensibly, it\u2019s about seeing an England football team lose, but when I wrote the title I knew it would be about more than just that. It\u2019s about a feeling that we are in a difficult moment in our history. It\u2019s about the unknowability about where you are and the feeling of insecurity,\u201d Jagger said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously got a fair amount of humour because I don\u2019t like anything too on the nose but it\u2019s also got a sense of vulnerability of where we are as a country.\u201d The \u201cGirls\u201d actress Jemima Kirke also stars in a new clip for \u201cGotta Get A Grip.\u201d The songs are Jagger\u2019s first new solo material since 2001\u2019s \u201cGoddess In the Doorway.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nAdvertisement\n\nKaty Perry to host 2017 MTV Video Music Awards By Libby Hill The MTV Video Music Awards are returning to California and getting a certified \u201cCalifornia Gurl\u201d to host.

Wednesday began with President Trump announcing a ban on transgender individuals serving in the United States military and ended with late-night hosts uniformly blasting the policy decision in hilarious fashion. On \u201cThe Late Show,\u201d Stephen Colbert had plenty to say about Trump\u2019s tweets, which ended with an uncharacteristic \u201cthank you.\u201d \u201cThank you?\u201d Colbert responded, shocked, before offering his own profane two-word response to the president. Colbert went on to discuss what he saw as the greatest fallacy of the president\u2019s reasons for banning transgender soldiers: increased medical costs. Though a 2016 study funded by the Pentagon found that military medical spending on transgender soldiers would increase anywhere from $2.4 million to $8.4 million, Colbert wanted to reframe those figures. \u201cTo put that number in perspective, the military spends five times as much on Viagra,\u201d Colbert explained, \u201cAnd if your erection lasts for more than four hours, that\u2019s too bad, because you\u2019re stuck on a submarine for the next six months.\u201d On \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d Trevor Noah had similar concerns about the president\u2019s cost-related excuse, pointing out that taxpayers are paying $60 million for Trump to travel to his various properties throughout his presidency. Noah also pondered which of Trump\u2019s generals he\u2019d consulted with, given that the Pentagon was unaware of his proclamation, suggesting that perhaps he\u2019d spoken with The General Online. \u201cLate Night With Seth Meyers\u201d also invoked the cartoon general from the car insurance commercials, when Meyers opted to turn discussion of Trump\u2019s tweets over to four of his female writers. \u201cToday it might be trans people, but tomorrow it\u2019s gay people, and then the next day it\u2019s black people, and after that it\u2019s women, and then it\u2019s immigrants,\u201d the writers pointed out, all of those groups represented between them. On \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d Jimmy Fallon had the good sense to turn over a portion of his monologue to transgender comedian Patti Harrison, who had plenty to say about Trump\u2019s Wednesday announcement. \u201cWhen I saw the headline this morning, at first I just read, \u2018Donald Trump bans transgender people,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018Yeah, that sounds like him,\u2019\u201d Harrison deadpanned. \u201cBut then I realized it was just in the military and I was shocked, because I assumed he already did that.\u201d But it was James Corden who took a completely different take on the transgender military ban, opting for a stylish and heartfelt song and dance, expressing his love and appreciation for the LGBT community.

Starr\u2019s new song \u201cWe\u2019re on the Road Again\u201d is one of several collaborations with his former bandmate on his new LP, \u201cGive More Love.\u201d The song also has guest appearances from Joe Walsh, Edgar Winter and Steve Lukather. It\u2019s a slightly goofy ode to life on the road, as Starr boasts that, \u201cWe play really tight; we play really loud\u201d and cheekily references his own song \u201cPhotograph.\u201d The two Beatles last recorded together on Starr\u2019s 2010 album, \u201cY Not,\u201d and performed McCartney\u2019s \u201cQueenie Eye\u201d at the 2014 Grammys.

By Yvonne Villarreal Actor-creator-executive producer Larry David speaks at the \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d panel during the Television Critics Assn. summer press tour at the Beverly Hilton. (Chris Pizzello / Invision/AP) Larry David revealed the real reason \u201cCurb Your Enthusiasm\u201d is at last returning after a six-year hiatus: People wouldn\u2019t stop bugging him about it. The \u201cSeinfeld\u201d co-creator took the stage Wednesday at the Television Critics Assn. press tour in Beverly Hills -- joined by his \u201cCurb\u201d cohorts Susie Essman, Jeff Garlin and J.B. Smoove and executive producer Jeff Schaffer -- to discuss the show\u2019s coming ninth season. So, why bring back the show now after all these years? \u201cI\u2019m not a misser,\u201d David told reporters. \u201cI don\u2019t really miss things, people that much, but I was missing it. I thought, yeah, what the hell. And I got tired of people asking me if the show was coming back. I couldn\u2019t get asked that question anymore and I wasn\u2019t ready to say, \u2018No, never.\u2019\u201d The often madcap and sometimes hilariously perplexing 30-minute panel -- led by David\u2019s gruff wit and deadpans -- kicked off with a teaser for the season.

(Chris Pizzello / Invision / Associated Press) HBO, which has the hottest show on television with \u201cGame of Thrones,\u201d recently came under fire with the announcement of a new series called \u201cConfederate\u201d from a team that includes \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d producers D.B. Weiss and David Benioff. The series revolves around events that lead to the \u201cThird American Civil War\u201d and examines an alternate reality in which the South seceded from the Union and thus, slavery is still legal. Casey Bloys, president of HBO programming, defended the project Wednesday during the premium network\u2019s session at the summer edition of the Television Critics Assn. gathering at the Beverly Hilton. Bloys said that, in hindsight, the announcement was mishandled because it lacked the context and the vision that he received from Benioff and Weiss in discussing the series. He admitted it was \u201cmisguided\u201d to believe they could simply announce a series with such a sensitive and volatile subject matter. \u201cWe could have done a better job with the press release,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was no benefit of context.\u201d \u201cMy hope is people will judge the actual material instead of what it could be or should be or might be,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ll rise or fall based on that material.\u201d He added that he felt the series, rather than being divisive, would be able to advance \u201cthe racial discussion.\u201d Although the topic is controversial, he said he and the producers of the show \u201call feel this is a risk worth taking.\u201d Bloys also stressed that the depiction of slavery would not echo \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d and would not include whips and plantations. In other major HBO news, former \u201cDaily Show\u201d host Jon Stewart will perform a stand-up special at a date and time to be announced, and host the latest \u201cNight of Too Many Stars,\u201d an all-star benefit for autism. Also, a movie reboot of HBO\u2019s western \u201cDeadwood\u201d is closer to reality. Bloys said the show\u2019s creator, David Milch, has completed a script that will please fans of the series while also being accessible to those less familiar with the show. But, he said, reuniting the large cast, which included Timothy Olyphant and Ian McShane, may prove challenging.

I just can\u2019t do the other. It\u2019s the same as I can\u2019t make a casserole. I cannot sit still,\u201d she said in a sprawling new interview with Vanity Fair, in which she discussed her high-profile split from actor Brad Pitt. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I\u2019m getting better at all three. But now I need to get my boots on and go hang, take a trip,\u201d the humanitarian said of her plans to head to Africa for a mission with the preventing Sexual Violence Initiative. Angelina Jolie opens up about putting her family first, life after Brad, health issues & her most personal film yet https://t.co/nKyf4dO8ls pic.twitter.com/WkXCgWR1PV \u2014 VANITY FAIR (@VanityFair) July 26, 2017 The Oscar-winning actress explained how and when her marriage devolved, though she didn\u2019t go into great detail about the breakup for the sake of their six kids. The marriage began suffering in the summer of 2016 while she was in post-production on her fifth directorial effort, \u201cFirst They Killed My Father,\u201d a film about Cambodia\u2019s Khmer Rouge genocide, which hits Netflix in September. \u201cThings got bad,\u201d Jolie said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want to use that word. ... Things became \u2018difficult.\u2019\u201d The director became slightly defensive at the mention of the family\u2019s globe-trotting lifestyle, which reportedly had been grating on Pitt. \"[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,\u201d she asserted. \u201cThat was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children. ... They\u2019re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I\u2019m very proud of them.\u201d After 12 years together and a few years of marriage, Jolie filed for divorce from Pitt in September 2016. While her ex was couch-surfing, she and the kids spent nine months in a rental property before settling into a six-bedroom, 10-bathroom Los Feliz manse once owned by film legend Cecil B. DeMille. \u201cIt\u2019s just been the hardest time, and we\u2019re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we\u2019re all trying to do our best to heal our family.\u201d The divorce filing came suddenly \u201cfor the health of the family\u201d on the heels of a spat Pitt had with their 15-year-old son, Maddox. They reached a divorce settlement privately in January after battling publicly for months over custody of the kids. The Oscar-winning producer had been vilified with accusations of child abuse and having an affair with his \u201cAllied\u201d costar Marion Cotillard. But he arguably won over public opinion with his introspective GQ Style interview in May in which he admitted to sobering up after \u201cboozing too much.\u201d Last year, Jolie was diagnosed with hypertension and developed Bell\u2019s palsy when nerve damage caused one side of her face to droop. She took up acupuncture to treat it. \u201cSometimes women in families put themselves last,\u201d she said, \u201cuntil it manifests itself in their own health.\u201d That\u2019s just the latest in her medical history. Following a preventative double mastectomy in 2013, she had her ovaries and fallopian tubes removed in 2015, which sent her into menopause. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s menopause or if it\u2019s just been the year I\u2019ve had,\u201d she said, quipping about her dry skin and the idea that she could still be considered a sex symbol. \u201cI actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I\u2019m being smart about my choices, and I\u2019m putting my family first, and I\u2019m in charge of my life and my health. I think that\u2019s what makes a woman complete.\u201d For the record, Aug. 4, 12:55 p.m.: A previous version of this story said that \u201cFirst They Killed My Father\u201d would hit Netflix this month. It debuts in September.

The actor addressed the engagement rumors Tuesday in a direct response to shock jock Howard Stern\u2019s questioning on Sirius XM\u2019s \u201cThe Howard Stern Show.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re engaged, right?\u201d Stern said after calling the edgy English songstress his fianc\u00e9e. \u201cYeah, kind of,\u201d Pattinson, 31, responded uneasily. The \u201cGood Time\u201d star, whose relationships have been intensely scrutinized since he dated \u201cTwilight\u201d co-star Kristen Stewart at the height of the teen vampire frenzy, agreed that he\u2019s been a bit protective of his romances. He\u2019s been dating the \u201cWater Me\u201d singer, real name Tahlia Barnett, since 2014 and they\u2019ve been rumored to be engaged since April 2015. Save for public appearances together, Pattinson has kept pretty mum about the relationship. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the most frustrating things in the world because you want to be able to\u201d show off a relationship, he told Stern. \u201cYou kind of get stuck in this position where you have to make decisions whether you want to let the kind of crazy people in.\u201d Pattinson was referring to the \u201cTwi-hards\u201d or, as he called them, a \u201ccrack troupe of crazies\u201d who believe every decision he makes is part of some big conspiracy. \u201cTo protect [the relationship] you kind of think, I want to create a big boundary between it. But then it makes it difficult for your actual relationship,\u201d he said. Additionally, Pattinson also discussed the racial disparagement his fianc\u00e9e faces on social media for dating him. He tries to tune out the hate when he can, but he isn\u2019t always successful. \u201cI think it\u2019s like professional trolls,\u201d he said of rude commenters. \u201cThey get so addicted to kind of just wanting to cause hurt and pain on someone and it\u2019s just one of the most difficult things to know how to confront. It\u2019s a faceless enemy. ... It might seem fake to them, but it\u2019s definitely real in your life.\u201d Pattinson said responding to hate can just be feeding into it. \u201cIt makes me feel less powerful if you\u2019re trying to attack\u201d and make it go away. \u201cIt\u2019s like trying to attack a reflection in the water or something.

Only this time, Letterman arrived as a guest. In an unusual turn of events, the former late-night host played interviewee on the season premiere of stand-up comedian Norm Macdonald\u2019s podcast, \u201cNorm Macdonald Live.\u201d The longtime pals discussed a number of matters, from Letterman\u2019s first-ever hosting gig (a game show called \u201cWordbusters\u201d) to the time he found himself face to face with Richard Nixon. The two also discussed late-night TV\u2019s changing landscape and how Letterman never felt comfortable thinking of himself as the star of his own show. \u201cI could not possibly, and still don\u2019t, consider myself a star, because I couldn\u2019t refer to myself as a star,\u201d Letterman said. \u201cJohnny Carson was a star, there\u2019s no question of that. So for me to adopt that -- \u2018Starring Dave Letterman\u2019 -- that was just ridiculous. \u201cIn the same way, I always cringe a little when people refer to the folks who watch their show as their \u2018fans,\u2019\u201d Letterman added. \u201cI just think that\u2019s a little too \u2026 you know, you kind of just stepped over the line of basic humility there.\u201d Macdonald commented on late-night\u2019s packed roster of big-name hosts -- none of whom he finds particularly unique, except Conan O\u2019Brien, who he thinks has \u201cchanged it up a little.\u201d On any plans for a late-night return to the host seat, Letterman told fans not to expect too much. \u201cI\u2019ve done it for 30 years,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to do it anymore.\u201d Watch the full episode above (warning: some profanity).

(Jean-Marc Giboux / Getty Images) Citing her advanced age, legendary actress Olivia de Havilland has filed a motion in her \u201cFeud\u201d lawsuit for a preferential trial date this fall. De Havilland\u2019s attorneys filed in Los Angeles Superior Court on Tuesday, requesting that the jury trial be set in November or no later than 120 days of her motion being granted. The 101-year-old is hoping that a judge will fast track the trial during her Sept. 13 hearing date, which is just days before \u201cFeud\u201d is expected to be a big winner at the Primetime Emmy Awards. (The miniseries is nominated for 18 awards.) The \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d star sued FX and \u201cFeud\u201d showrunner Ryan Murphy last month over her depiction in the miniseries about rival actresses Bette Davis and Joan Crawford. The two-time Oscar winner, who was played by actress Catherine Zeta-Jones on the show, makes legal claims about violations of her common law and statutory rights of publicity, her right to privacy and unjust enrichment. \u201cBased on her unusually advanced age, resulting particular susceptibility to disease, and recurring health issues, there is a substantial likelihood that she, as with anyone at this advanced age, may not survive for any extended period of time,\u201d the motion said. \u201cIt is likely that if a trial preference motion is not granted, Olivia de Havilland will be prejudiced, because on the normal schedule, trial would not be set within the next 120 days.\u201d Her team also argued that because she is the sole plaintiff, De Havilland is crucial to the trial. \u201cOlivia de Havilland has a substantial interest in the litigation as a whole here as her personal statutory right of publicity cause of action does not survive her death. ... Further, should Olivia de Havilland die before her trial date, she will not be able to enjoy the benefits which she would receive in damages,\u201d the motion said. De Havilland\u2019s June 30 lawsuit said the show damaged her \u201cprofessional reputation for integrity, honesty, generosity, self-sacrifice and dignity.\u201d She claimed that FX, Murphy and Fox producers never sought or obtained her permission to be depicted in the series and that Zeta-Jones\u2019 portrayal of her in an episode about the 1963 Oscars cast her in a \u201cfalse, hurtful and damaging light.\u201d The defendants have not yet responded to de Havilland\u2019s initial filing. According to Deadline, the Paris-based actress will not be attending the September hearing but may return to Hollywood if the trial is expedited to November.

(Sergi Alexander / Getty Images) \u201cDespacito\u201d singers Luis Fonsi and Daddy Yankee and co-writer Erika Ender have condemned Venezuela\u2019s President Nicolas Maduro for appropriating their international hit song for political gain. The chart-topping Puerto Rican recording artists and Panamanian songwriter on Monday called out Maduro, currently the subject of violent and sometimes fatal nationwide protests over his policies, for reworking their lyrics to appeal to voters during his weekly television show on Sunday. The revision promoted the leader\u2019s plans for a controversial citizen\u2019s assembly to be elected on July 30 and tasked with rewriting Venezuela\u2019s 1999 constitution and bypassing the opposition-led legislature. \u201cOur call to the Constituent Assembly only seeks to unite the country ... despacito,\u201d Maduro\u2019s version said. The term \u201cdespacito\u201d means slowly in Spanish and in the original version of the song refers to the singer\u2019s wooing techniques. Maduro\u2019s supporters swayed to the remix dressed in matching T-shirts and baseball caps that brandished campaign slogans. the Associated Press said. The president was seen clapping along to the remix while the audience danced, according to the BBC. \u201cI DO NOT AGREE WITH THIS,\u201d Ender wrote in Spanish on Instagram, citing a news story about Maduro\u2019s use of the song. \u201cI cannot see so much pain in people I love so much. Warrior people, people with iron will. Good people, who are fighting for freedom of rights and expression. ... I love Venezuela, a land that has given me true brothers and sisters. Brothers who suffer because of the situation that exists.\u201d Ender also lamented seeing the song she co-wrote be used without permission \u201cto advertise campaigns linked to a regime that has sowed so much discontent and suffering.\u201d View Instagram post \u201cOn repeated occasions, I have said how much I enjoy the versions of \u2018Despacito\u2019 that have been released on a global level. However there has to be a limit,\u201d Fonsi also wrote in Spanish on Instagram. \u201cI have never been consulted, nor have I authorized the use of or the change of lyrics of \u2018Despacito\u2019 for political means, much less in the middle of the deplorable situation in a country I love so much, Venezuela.\u201d He added that his music is \u201cfor everyone who wants to listen to it and enjoy it, not to use as propaganda that tries to manipulate the will of the people who are crying out loud for their liberty and a better future.\u201d View Instagram post Daddy Yankee took a much more blunt approach in his post, sharing an image of a news article about Maduro with a large red X superimposed on it. \u201cWhat can you expect of a person who has stolen lives from young dreamers and people who are looking for a better future for their children?\u201d the reggaeton rapper wrote in Spanish. \u201cThat you illegally appropriated \u2018Despacito\u2019 does not compare to the crimes you commit and have committed in Venezuela. Your dictatorial regime is a mockery not only for my Venezuelan brothers, but for the whole world. With that nefarious marketing plan, you will only continue to highlight your fascist ideology, which has killed hundreds of heroes and injured more than 2,000.\u201d View Instagram post Millions of Venezuelans joined a general strike last week amid economic turmoil and a shortage of food and medicine in the country. Government opponents dealt a symbolic blow on Sunday to Maduro, casting votes in an unofficial referendum that rejected his plan for the constitutional overhaul. The government denounced the opposition balloting as illegal and seditious, according to The Times, but turnout appeared high at thousands of makeshift voting places set up throughout the country and abroad.
