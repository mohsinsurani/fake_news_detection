This was just one year after husband Ren\u00e9 Ang\u00e9lil passed away from a heart attack. Here\u2019s what we know about their relationship and Dion\u2019s alleged boyfriend.\n\nHer reps originally denied the reports, insisting that the two are just friends. About a year ago, the two were spotted together in Paris, where Mu\u00f1oz accompanied her to the Giambattista Valli fashion show.\n\nGET CELINE DION CONCERT TICKETS!\n\nMu\u00f1oz told Vogue about working with and getting to know Dion.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the kind of person [for whom] the day has no schedule, no time, no nothing, so whenever she feels the creativity coming, that\u2019s what happens,\u201d he said. \u201cShe makes you feel welcome, like you belong to the family, and like you\u2019re part of the group. She\u2019s absolutely fearless with her style, her dancing, her performing, and as a person in her clothes.\u201d\n\nHowever, in April 2017, Dion told The Sun she wasn\u2019t ready to enter the dating world again.\n\n\u201cNow it is definitely too soon for me\u2026 I am definitely in love with [Ren\u00e9], married to him,\u201d she said.\n\nGET CELINE DION CONCERT TICKETS!\n\nIn January of this year, the 34-year-old said he and Dion found the rumors to be funny.\n\n\u201cThese rumors really amused us,\u201d he told Gala. \u201cAnd we still laugh about them.\u201d\n\nMu\u00f1oz added, \u201cI can count on her when I need to talk, and I am ready to listen to her, too.\u201d\n\nDuring a January 2017 concert, the two shared a sensual number on-stage, fueling the dating rumors.\n\nThe dancer is from Malaga, Spain, and is also an illustrator. He attended the Royal Academy of Dancing and even performed in the Cirque du Soleil show Zumanity.\n\nHe was first asked to dance for Dion by her personal assistant and eagerly jumped at the opportunity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d always been a great fan, not like a psycho fan, but I\u2019ve always loved her music,\u201d Mu\u00f1oz said. \u201cI said \u2018yes,\u2019 of course, then rapidly went to the gym to start doing sit-ups.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, their insistence on being just friends has quelled the rumors since.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more about:", "images": ["https://cdn.uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/facebook_messenger_icon.png", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/themes/uinterview/img/google-play-new.png", "https://cdn.uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/usports-300x76.png", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/upolitics-bottom.png", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8064057&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://upolitics.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/Mike_Lindell.jpg", "http://uinterview.com/blank.gif", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/ugames-bottom-inverted.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=wA6vf1a8Md00iI", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/831b55c05879eb532f1949dd00b56532?s=200&d=mm&r=g", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/IMG_1801-150x150.jpg", "https://cdn.uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uinterview-logo.png", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/themes/uinterview/img/ui-mobile-icon.png", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/themes/uinterview/img/newsletter-img.jpg", "https://usports.org/wp-content/uploads/Jonathan_Taylor.jpg", "https://cdn.uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/uinterview-logo-white.png", "https://cdn.uinterview.com/wp-content/themes/uinterview/css/tiktok-icon.png", "http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-test123.gif", "https://cdn.uinterview.com/wp-content/themes/uinterview/css/feedly-follow-logo-black_2x.png", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/themes/uinterview/img/ui-mobile-apple.png", "https://cdn.uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/news-Celine-Dion.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d93a0b683ba0441c800ef11438b6f982?s=200&d=mm&r=g", "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/news-Celine-Dion.jpg"], "top_img": "https://uinterview.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/07/news-Celine-Dion.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gillian Kenah"], "canonical_link": "https://uinterview.com/news/who-is-pepe-munoz-details-on-celine-dions-alleged-news-boyfriend/", "title": "Who Is Pepe Mu\u00f1oz?
