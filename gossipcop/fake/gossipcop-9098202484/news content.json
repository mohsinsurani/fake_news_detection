Halle Berry just dropped word via Instagram that the actress will be joining the cast of the third John Wick flick. Penned by Derek Kolstad and directed by Chad Stahelski, the (presumably) final chapter in the Keanu Reeves action franchise is set to open on May 17, 2019. I have no idea if Berry is playing a villain or a fellow anti-hero, but A) it's cool that the (presumed) female lead will be about as old the male lead (she is 51 and he is 53, neither of them looks a day over 27) and B) I'm a huge fan of Berry's recent pulp fiction endeavors (The Call and Kidnap), so this is pretty cool casting.\n\nLionsgate also just announced that Angelica Houston, Asia Kate Dillon (TVs Billions and Orange is the New Black), Mark Dacascos (Lucky Day, Hawaii 5-0, Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.), and Jason Mantzoukas (The Long Dumb Road, The House) will join the cast of John Wick: Chapter 3. Yes, Laurence Fishburne, Ian McShane and Lance Reddick will return as well. I'm not sure if Ruby Rose survived her encounters with Mr. Wick in part two, but I kinda hope she comes back too. What this arguably means is that Lionsgate may end up emphasizing an ensemble cast this time out, as opposed to the first two films which were (understandably) the Keanu Reeves Show.\n\nThat's no shade on Mr. Wick or the actor who plays him, but as I noted in the last post about the Mission: Impossible franchise, there is perhaps a greater value, at least for overseas box office, in ensemble action flicks as opposed to solo/lone-wolf movies. Think Deadpool 2, xXx: Return of Xander Cage, Fate of the Furious and Avengers: Infinity War. Even Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle was sold as a four-person adventure, highlighting Dwayne Johnson, Kevin Hart, Jack Black and Karen Gillan.\n\nSo, if Lionsgate feels that they can get more overseas bucks the third-go around (John Wick: Chapter 2 made $92 million domestic and $79m overseas) by offering something resembling an ensemble cast, well, that's one option on the table. That doesn't mean that John Wick will go about recruit a super-assassin squad to deal with that pesky \"everyone wants to kill me now\" status quo from the end of the last John Wick, but I will be interested to see how these new cast members are integrated into the new movie. And yeah, bringing Halle Berry onboard is a nice touch.\n\nCome what may, John Wick: Chapter 3 opens next year. Even as someone who thought that John Wick: Chapter 2 ended on a pretty definitive note (not unlike The Dark Knight or The Last Jedi), I'm still curious to see what the Wick crew has up their sleeve for a threequel.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035915im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fscottmendelson%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2FMV5BMTUzNjg4NjA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI0OTcyMDI%40._V1_SY1000_SX1500_AL_-1200x675.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035915im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/400x0/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fimageserve%2F5ce9fce69736330008a9fb0f%2F960x0.jpg%3FcropX1%3D5%26cropX2%3D2336%26cropY1%3D99%26cropY2%3D2430"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035915im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fscottmendelson%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2FMV5BMTUzNjg4NjA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI0OTcyMDI%40._V1_SY1000_SX1500_AL_-1200x675.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Scott Mendelson"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035915/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/05/21/halle-berry-and-more-to-join-keanu-reeves-in-third-john-wick-flick/", "title": "Halle Berry (And More) To Join Keanu Reeves In Third 'John Wick' Flick", "meta_data": {"referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=5,minimum-scale=1,user-scalable=yes", "description": "Will Lionsgate sell 'John Wick: Chapter 3' as more of an ensemble movie in order to boost overseas box office?", "author": "Scott Mendelson", "article": {"section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/media/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/2595-50245", "published": "2018-05-21", "modified": "2018-05-21", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Scott Mendelson"}, "og": {"title": "Halle Berry (And More) To Join Keanu Reeves In Third 'John Wick' Flick", "site_name": "Forbes", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035915/https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2018/05/21/halle-berry-and-more-to-join-keanu-reeves-in-third-john-wick-flick/", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035915im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fscottmendelson%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2FMV5BMTUzNjg4NjA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI0OTcyMDI%40._V1_SY1000_SX1500_AL_-1200x675.jpg", "description": "Will Lionsgate sell 'John Wick: Chapter 3' as more of an ensemble movie in order to boost overseas box office?", "updated_time": "2018-05-21T13:26:15.390-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@forbes", "creator": "@ScottMendelson", "title": "Halle Berry (And More) To Join Keanu Reeves In Third 'John Wick' Flick", "description": "Will Lionsgate sell 'John Wick: Chapter 3' as more of an ensemble movie in order to boost overseas box office?", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201109035915im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/fit-in/1200x0/filters%3Aformat%28jpg%29/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fscottmendelson%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F05%2FMV5BMTUzNjg4NjA1M15BMl5BanBnXkFtZTgwMjI0OTcyMDI%40._V1_SY1000_SX1500_AL_-1200x675.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526857200.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
