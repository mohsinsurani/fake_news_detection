One local told Vanity Fair: \u201cIt\u2019s very clear they want to be left alone. \u201cThe property is in the middle of woodland and you wouldn\u2019t know it was there. \u201cIt is very remote which is why they like it. It\u2019s like a fortress.\n\n\u201cThey both expect a code of silence\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a huge security presence, you can\u2019t get close.\u201d A source close to the couple said: \u201cThey spend a lot of time in the Cotswolds, more than people realise. \u201cThey are in the country way more than they are in London and enjoying a low-key and very domesticated start to married life.\u201d The Duke and Duchess of Sussex are due to spend time with The Queen in Balmoral next month with the Duchess reportedly also keen to visit her mother in Los Angeles.\n\nThe couple are reportedly to be struggling with repeated outbursts from Thomas Markle, Meghan\u2019s father. Last month Mr Markle provocatively claimed that Princess Diana would have \u201cloathed\u201d the way he was being treated by the Royal Family. Royal editor Camilla Tominey commented: \u201cThey have both been extremely upset by Thomas Markle\u2019s behaviour and that of Meghan\u2019s half sister Samantha and other relatives.\n\n\u201cThey spend a lot of time in the Cotswolds, more than people realise\"", "images": ["https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1001017.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1001017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Bickerton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1001017/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-friends-loyalty-Princess-Diana-Thomas", "title": "Meghan Markle: Prince Harry demands friends loyalty after Princess Diana jibe from Thomas", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry have warned their friends they will be kicked out of their inner circle if they talk to the press.", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 823607694325129, "pages": 129617873765147}, "og": {"title": "\u201cTalk to the press you\u2019re out\u201d - Meghan Markle's warning to friends", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/1001017/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-friends-loyalty-Princess-Diana-Thomas", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1001017.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "headlines,nation,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Meghan Markle,Prince Harry,friends,loyalty,Princess Diana,Thomas,Royal Family,Cotswolds,Katie Nicholl,Balmoral", "section": "Royal", "description": "MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry have warned their friends they will be kicked out of their inner circle if they talk to the press."}, "news_keywords": "headlines,nation,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Meghan Markle,Prince Harry,friends,loyalty,Princess Diana,Thomas,Royal Family,Cotswolds,Katie Nicholl,Balmoral", "article": {"tag": "Balmoral", "published_time": "2018-08-10T03:56:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-10T07:50:23+01:00", "expiration_time": "2018-09-09", "section": "Royal", "image_count": 2, "video_count": 2, "word_count": 424, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0, "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "James Bickerton", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/1001017.jpg", "title": "\u201cTalk to the press you\u2019re out\u201d - Meghan Markle's warning to friends", "description": "MEGHAN Markle and Prince Harry have warned their friends they will be kicked out of their inner circle if they talk to the press."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "'Talk to the press you\u2019re out' - Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s SHOCK warning to friends", "vf": {"image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/237x141/1001017_1.jpg", "container_id": "express-prod-1001017", "site_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0ed77b31aaaf"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all", "dataLayer": "{\"page\":{\"attributes\":{\"publicationName\":\"express\",\"ownerSite\":\"express\",\"ownerSiteDomain\":\"www.express.co.uk\",\"platformType\":\"responsive\",\"cmsPlatform\":\"Daily Express CMS\",\"pageType\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"106\"}},\"article\":{\"articleId\":\"1001017\",\"articleTitle\":\"'Talk to the press you\\u2019re out' - Meghan Markle and Prince Harry\\u2019s SHOCK warning to friends\",\"articleAuthor\":\"James Bickerton \",\"firstPublishDate\":\"2018-08-10\",\"firstPublishTime\":\"03:56:00\",\"attributes\":{\"primaryTag\":\"meghan markle\",\"allTags\":\"meghan markle|prince harry|friends|loyalty|princess diana|thomas|royal family|cotswolds|katie nicholl|balmoral \",\"isAdvertorial\":false,\"isNative\":false,\"affiliateLinks\":false,\"activeLegalProceedings\":false,\"nudity\":false,\"isSensitive\":false}}}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533869760.0, "source": "http://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
