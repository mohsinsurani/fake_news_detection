Amazing GP win @hitshorseshows #thermal, mr KC \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc34 so proud of you! (And entire team !) \ud83d\udc97 A photo posted by @normancook on Mar 13, 2016 at 5:06pm PDT\n\nBut she hasn't forgotten her first love, Santos, her own show-jumping mount:\n\nFrom a distance, the choice of a barn-friendly boyfriend is a wise first step after her divorce from tennis pro Ryan Sweeting. Cuoco and Cook have a major passion in common. Plus, the horse people know it never hurts to have someone who can pitch in with stall duty when you're away.\n\nAnd who doesn't enjoy a man who looks good in riding breeches?", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e7aa0fcb690830a04feb58db46e9171cfa4e35a3/c=0-0-1992-1498/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958049097536702-GTY-516463762.jpg?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4bcd1c19a17ada8c24f31c667c52ec751f67212e/c=0-90-1992-1216/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958049097536702-GTY-516463762.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4bcd1c19a17ada8c24f31c667c52ec751f67212e/c=0-90-1992-1216/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958049097536702-GTY-516463762.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jayme Deerwester"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/09/kaley-cuoco-posts-pic-with-new-beau/82834518/", "title": "Meet the two men in Kaley Cuoco's life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2016/04/09/kaley-cuoco-posts-pic-with-new-beau/82834518/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Meet the two men in Kaley Cuoco's life", "description": "By which we mean her boyfriend, equestrian Karl Cook, and her horse.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4bcd1c19a17ada8c24f31c667c52ec751f67212e/c=0-90-1992-1216/local/-/media/2016/04/09/USATODAY/USATODAY/635958049097536702-GTY-516463762.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "news_keywords": "The Big Bang Theory,Kaley Cuoco", "description": "By which we mean her boyfriend, equestrian Karl Cook, and her horse.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1460156400.0, "source": "http://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
