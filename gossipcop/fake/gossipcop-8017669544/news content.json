She didn't say they were in a full on relationship, she didn't say they were engaged and she didn't say they were even involved.\n\nShe said they dated\u2014which indicates casual hooking up (or however you define dating these days).\n\nLeAnn Rimes Slams Brandi Glanville For Mentioning Eddie Cibrian\u2019s Giant Penis\n\nThey both moved on, Stiller married Christine Taylor in 2000 and Brandi married Eddie Cibrian in 2001 before he cheated on her and eventually left her for LeAnn Rimes. Brandi went on to star in Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and is now an outspoken author, radio host and reality star (so amusing to think about how Eddie must wake up every day pig sick that he backed the wrong horse).\n\nFast forward a couple of decades and on Wednesday night, Stiller appeared on Watch What Happen's Live to promote his new movie Zoolander 2. Cheeky little Andy Cohen, who clearly had an agenda, got him to play a game of 'Plead The Fifth'.\n\nAndy Cohen Hilariously Gets Gwyneth Paltrow To Admit Taking Hard Drugs\n\nHe could have pleaded...\n\nAndy cut straight to it and opened with; \"We love a Real Housewives tie in on WWHL...\"\n\nStiller knew what was coming and looked embarrassed and caught on the hop as he swiveled his chair uncomfortably.\n\nScroll down for the video\n\nHe eventually explained about Brandi;\n\n\"It was fun...I wouldn't call it a relationship...it was just a couple of dates.\"\n\nTalk about trying to play it down! Brandi said exactly the same thing\u2014she didn't say they were in a relationship, just dating and it's downright ungentlemanly of him to try to minimize it.\n\n3inder\u2014The Newest (and Kinkiest) Hookup App\n\nThe reason for his squirming may have had something to do with the fact that he then admitted that his wife doesn't even know he has history with the sexiest real housewife out there.\n\nWe find that kinda weird. You've been married to your wife for ever, so presumably she's pretty secure in the relationship (you would hope). When Brandi got famous and you maybe caught sight of her on TV or at an event or something, wouldn't you be like \"oh I dated that girl years ago\"? Given the nature of Hollywood gossip, it's not like it would remain a secret\u2014and neither should it, they were both single, so where's the harm?\n\nAs Andy said; \"It's going to be 'fun' watching real housewives together now!\"\n\nReal Housewives Craziest Fights, Insane Meltdowns And Brawls Ranked\n\nDouchebags...\n\nIn fact, his response was actually a pretty crappy move by Stiller\u2014Gerard Butler was the same when he tried to undermine the fact that he hooked up with Brandi. What, just because they are actors and she's a reality star they're embarrassed to be associated with her? They're too many rungs above her in the celebrity pecking order and shouldn't be seen to be mixing?\n\nWe can't think of any other reason why these guys feel they have to explain themselves for dating her. Seriously WTF is the problem? She's gorgeous, doesn't take herself too seriously and likes to have a good time.\n\nIf she was hot enough to date, fucking own it, douches.\n\nBen Stiller Dated Brandi Glanville\n\nBen Stiller Dated
