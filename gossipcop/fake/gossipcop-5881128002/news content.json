Hey, it isn\u2019t cake, but it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve actually appeared with one another in a pic.\n\nHowever, it also isn\u2019t proof that they\u2019re dating, despite what some reports have been touting.\n\nA rep for DiCaprio told the Los Angeles Times that the actor \u201cis single and has been for some time,\u201d adding that he\u2019s \u201cbeen focused shooting\u201d Oscar-winning director Alejandro G. Inarritu\u2019s adventure drama \u201cThe Revenant\u201d in Canada \u201cfor months.\u201d\n\nStill, the prospect of the power couple DiCaprio and Rihanna would comprise is pretty epic, and it has the gossips indulging in any and all are-they-or-aren\u2019t-they morsels.\n\nSources told E! that the two were seen \u201ckissing, touching and dancing with each other\u201d at the private bash, which counted singer Beyonce, rapper Jay Z, model Naomi Campbell and Def Jam mogul Russell Simmons among its attendees.\n\nPeople magazine chimed in with its own sources, who said that the two didn\u2019t act \u201ccouple-y\u201d but were \u201cdefinitely flirty and dancing.\u201d\n\nThe Grammy-winning songstress was most recently linked to recording artist Drake; DiCaprio, 40, reportedly split with model Toni Garrn late last year after more than a year of dating.\n\nRihanna\u2019s rep didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment.\n\nFollow me on Twitter @NardineSaad", "images": ["https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/a6/d6/eea0f1094fb281dbea09e0aa79cd/art-caltimes-trademark-3x.png", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/1681bd2/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1350x900+125+0/resize/840x560!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd4%2F82%2F1fc5a1d64786ba0e4faf15e4cd2a%2Fhlr-ff-302-0106122-cc1.jpg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/4449297/2147483647/strip/true/crop/1152x1152+448+0/resize/100x100!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fd7%2F77%2Fbd7acf762ccb8964281140346267%2Fimg-535dd4a4-turbine-la-bio-nardine-saad", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/2254646/2147483647/strip/true/crop/3993x2662+530+0/resize/840x560!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fc5%2F75%2F459c389540c9975c00728161614d%2F1-nothing-compares-still.png", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/341431c/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1365+0+0/resize/840x560!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.trbimg.com%2Fimg-59232a3f%2Fturbine%2Fla-et-st-beyonce-20170522", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/32ad6fd/2147483647/strip/true/crop/849x566+1+0/resize/840x560!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2Fa9%2F02%2F2f25e0074907870628d5679c8eee%2Fzach-kornfeld-eugene-lee-yang-ned-fulmer-keith-habersberger-from-no-recipe-road-trip-with-the-try-guys.jpeg", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04972d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F3e%2Fb021917766d33c14767a27b4ef0b%2Fla-et-mg-rihanna-leonardo-dicaprio-dating-rumo-002", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/f34c77d/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1152+0+0/resize/1200x675!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F3e%2Fb021917766d33c14767a27b4ef0b%2Fla-et-mg-rihanna-leonardo-dicaprio-dating-rumo-002", "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/0e/c6/b86a8b4b43a793259deb28a32a56/latlogoinverse.svg"], "top_img": "https://ca-times.brightspotcdn.com/dims4/default/04972d3/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2048x1075+0+38/resize/1200x630!/quality/80/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcalifornia-times-brightspot.s3.amazonaws.com%2F27%2F3e%2Fb021917766d33c14767a27b4ef0b%2Fla-et-mg-rihanna-leonardo-dicaprio-dating-rumo-002", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Writer", "Nardine Saad Covers Breaking Entertainment News", "Trending Culture Topics", "Celebrities", "Their Kin For The Los Angeles Times.
