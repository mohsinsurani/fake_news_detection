Brad\u2019s reportedly been secretly chatting with his ex, Jennifer Aniston, and Angie\u2019s allegedly \u2018enraged.\u2019 Will the kids be spending time with Jen?!..\n\nAlthough Angelina Jolie, 41, and Brad Pitt, 53, opted to make their legal docs involving their split completely private on Jan. 10, 2017, Angie\u2019s reportedly got a new demand to add to their split negotiations. She doesn\u2019t want Brad\u2019s reported new texting buddy, Jennifer Aniston, 48, anywhere near her kids, according to In Touch.\n\n\u201cAs Angie and Brad\u2019s divorce talks continue, she\u2019s demanding that Brad agree to never have their children around Jen,\u201d the mag reported. Brad and Angie share six children together \u2014 Maddox, 15, Pax, 12, Zahara, 11, Shiloh, 10, and twins Knox and Vivienne, 8.\n\nThe actor has reportedly been leaning on his ex-wife while he deals with his emotional split from Angie. He and Jen married in July 2000 and ended their courtship in Oct. 2005 after he met Angie on the set of their love, action flick, Mr & Mrs. Smith. However, he\u2019s reportedly reconciled with Jen via phone. The two have allegedly been exchanging sweet messages over various phone calls and text messages, according to the mag. To make matters worse, Angie apparently knows about Brad and Jen\u2019s alleged newfound relationship and she\u2019s not happy whatsoever.\n\nAs for Brad\u2019s take on Angie\u2019s reported request that he should keep Jen far away from their six children? \u2014 \u201cBrad thinks the request is off the wall and irrational,\u201d the mag reported. In fact, \u201cHe isn\u2019t going to cave in to Angie\u2019s ridiculous demand\u2026 Angie is the one who filed for divorce, not him. And she will have to live with the consequences.\u201d Harsh\u2026\n\nWhile Brad, Angie or Jennifer have not commented on this wild report, here\u2019s what HollywoodLife.com knows: \u201cAngelina was never able to get over her obsession with Brad and Jennifer\u2019s relationship,\u201d a source EXCLUSIVELY told us. As a matter of fact, Angie always feared that Brad would go back with Jen. Wow.\n\nThings haven\u2019t been going too well for Brad throughout his nasty split with Angie. When she filed for divorce on Sept. 19, 2016, she also requested sole physical custody of their six children. Brad and Angie reached a private, temporary custody agreement on Sept. 30, which granted her full physical custody, and him with visitation approved by a therapist.\n\nAfter multiple disputes between the couple in scathing court docs, they decided to release a joint statement on Jan. 10, 2017, which revealed that they agreed to keep their court docs private. Since then, the exes have remained tight-lipped on the status of their broken marriage.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Brad and Jennifer are really texting?\n\nJavaScript is required to load the comments.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://i1.wp.com/pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/brad-pitt-relieved-angelina-coming-home-with-kids-each-day-apart-has-been-difficult-ftr.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C600px%2C460px&resize=150%2C115&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-threatens-brad-pitt-dont-bring-the-kids-around-jennifer-aniston-ftr.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-threatens-brad-pitt-dont-bring-the-kids-around-jennifer-aniston-cfmp-lead.jpg?w=600", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=7&c2=6035310&c3=10001&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-why-she-was-terrified-brad-pitt-would-leave-her-for-ex-jennifer-aniston-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://i0.wp.com/pmcspy.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/alligator-ambra-ankle-boots.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F03%2F20%2Fangelina-jolie-threatens-brad-pitt-kids-jennifer-aniston-relationship%2F&post_id=2513270&title=Angelina+Jolie+Threatens+Brad+Pitt%3A+Don%E2%80%99t+Bring+The+Kids+Around+Jennifer+Aniston&author=Jenna+Lemoncelli&comment_count=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://i1.wp.com/pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/rob-lowe.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://i1.wp.com/pmcvariety.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/rob-lowe-matthew-lowe-john.jpg?resize=180%2C101", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-braless-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/jen-aniston.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/jennifer-aniston-talks-justin-theroux-december-marie-claire-cover-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/c9673a64e776066d542c0bc87ddf3530?s=30&d=http%3A%2F%2F0.gravatar.com%2Favatar%2Fad516503a11cd5ca435acc9bb6523536%3Fs%3D30&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2015/04/jennifer-aniston-marie-claire-december-issue-2016.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/brad-pitt-angelina-jolie-maddox-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/marion-cotillard-guillaume-canet-baby-congrats-ftr-1.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angleina-jolie-jennifer-aniston-quiz-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/http://i0.wp.com/pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/stuart-weitzman-02.jpg?resize=180%2C101&ssl=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-aid-worker-claims-to-be-the-father-of-her-son-maddox-ftr.jpg?w=150&h=115&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/angelina-jolie-threatens-brad-pitt-dont-bring-the-kids-around-jennifer-aniston-ftr.jpg?w=600&h=600&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jenna Lemoncelli"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170320211854/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/03/20/angelina-jolie-threatens-brad-pitt-kids-jennifer-aniston-relationship/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Threatens Brad Pitt: Don\u2019t Bring The Kids Around Jennifer Aniston", "meta_data": {"description": "While Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie are locked into a nasty divorce and custody battle, their six children are at the center of it all, once again.
