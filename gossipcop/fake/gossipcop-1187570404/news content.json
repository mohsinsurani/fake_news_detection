Now his defense team says the testing showed Soules had no alcohol or drugs in his system. As such, his lawyers want any purported evidence related to alcohol use declared inadmissible. In a motion filed on Friday, it\u2019s said:\n\n\u201cAccording to a report issued by the Iowa Department of Criminal Investigation\u2019s (DCI) Criminalistics Laboratory, Mr. Soules\u2019 specimens were negative for drugs and alcohol. The DCI conducted thorough toxicology testing on two separate samples \u2013 his urine and blood \u2013 and conclusively determined no detectable amounts of alcohol or drugs were in either specimen. Furthermore, Mr. Soules has not been charged with any alcohol related offense.\u201d\n\nConsequently, his camp wants to bar \u201cany evidence, testimony, reference, or argument that, on the night in question, Mr. Soules: 1) purchased alcohol, 2) consumed alcohol, 2) drove while impaired, or 3) had beer cans in or around his vehicle.\u201d It is possible the prosecutor will fight the request on the grounds that the samples were taken from Soules hours after the accident. In fact, it was previously claimed he initially refused to leave his house when officials arrived, allegedly leading to an hours-long standoff before he surrendered to custody.\n\nSoules also makes other requests in this new motion. His attorneys ask that Mosher not be referred to as the \u201cvictim\u201d because Soules is \u201cpresumed innocent.\u201d It\u2019s argued, \u201cThe State has not charged Mr. Soules with any crime asserting he is criminally responsible for the death of the decedent. Thus, it is wholly improper for the State or any witness to refer to the decedent as a \u2018victim.'\u201d\n\nAmong other demands, it is also argued \u201cany statement, questioning, or evidence about Mr. Soules\u2019 criminal history\u201d should also be inadmissible. As Gossip Cop reported, Soules\u2019 previous motion to dismiss the felony charge outright was denied last month. We will continue to have updates as appropriate.", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e7b5ddfbee47a8a2b39605d?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(180,60)&quality=80", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "http://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/57d1caf936ce620b3fa9e66f"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shari Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-19-chris-soules-had-no-alcohol-in-system-after-crash-negative-for-drugs/", "title": "Chris Soules Had No Alcohol In System After Crash, Negative For Drugs", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "title": "Chris Soules Had No Alcohol In System After Crash, Negative For Drugs | 103.5 KTU", "description": "Chris Soules had no alcohol in his system after his fatal crash, according to new court documents.", "url": "https://ktu.iheart.com/content/2017-06-19-chris-soules-had-no-alcohol-in-system-after-crash-negative-for-drugs/", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "type": "article", "site_name": "103.5 KTU"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#02abe2", "twitter": {"title": "Chris Soules Had No Alcohol In System After Crash, Negative For Drugs | 103.5 KTU", "description": "Chris Soules had no alcohol in his system after his fatal crash, according to new court documents.", "url": "https://ktu.iheart.com/content/2017-06-19-chris-soules-had-no-alcohol-in-system-after-crash-negative-for-drugs/", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@1035KTU", "creator": "@1035KTU", "domain": "ktu.iheart.com", "tile": {"image": {"alt": "Chris Soules had no alcohol in his system after his fatal crash, according to new court documents."}, "template": {"testing": 1}}, "": {"tile": {"image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)"}}}, "parsely-title": "Chris Soules Had No Alcohol In System After Crash, Negative For Drugs | 103.5 KTU", "description": "Chris Soules had no alcohol in his system after his fatal crash, according to new court documents.", "keywords": "new york, nyc, ktu, 103.5, 103", "parsely-tags": "new york, nyc, ktu, 103.5, 103", "parsely-link": "https://ktu.iheart.com/content/2017-06-19-chris-soules-had-no-alcohol-in-system-after-crash-negative-for-drugs/", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/url/aHR0cDovL2Nkbi52aWRpYmxlLnR2L3Byb2QvMjAxNy0wNS8wOS81OTEyNTAyOWI5MGFmYjFlZWE4Y2Y2OGQvNTkxMjUwMjkwYzJhZmY0OTIxNzRlNmVlXzE5MjB4MTA4MF9GX3YwLmpwZw==?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "103.5 KTU", "fb": {"app_id": 409625425402, "pages": 120727317966271}, "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2017-06-19-chris-soules-had-no-alcohol-in-system-after-crash-negative-for-drugs/", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-06-19T13:56:00Z", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "parsely-author": "Shari Weiss", "parsely-section": "Entertainment News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497826800.0, "source": "http://ktu.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
