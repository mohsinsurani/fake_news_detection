sustain 10 minutes of cocktail party small talk often form close friendships for no other reason than that they\u2019re both rich and famous.\n\nJust like in high school, some people are deemed cool enough to move seamlessly between cliques, and it should come as no surprise that Jennifer Aniston is one such social butterfly, beloved by both A-listers and reality stars alike.\n\nWhich is why when Paris Hilton\u2019s mom says Aniston is pregnant, there might really be something to it.\n\nPhoto via Getty Images\n\nAniston was in attendance at the 2017 Academy Awards on Sunday night, and it seems that while the rest of the country was preoccupied with #Envelopegate and Gary From Chicago, Kathy Hilton was busy spreading rumors about the actress:\n\n\u201cJennifer Aniston looks so beautiful tonight I am telling you she is having a baby girl. 100/ percent,\u201d Kathy tweeted after the ceremony.\n\nShe deleted the tweet less than an hour later, but only after being bombarded by requests to elaborate.\n\nIs it possible that Kathy realized she had shared information that she was supposed to keep to herself?\n\nPhoto via ABC\n\nKathy, of course, was not in attendance at the Oscars, but she did snag a coveted invitation to Elton John\u2019s after-party.\n\nIs it possible that she and Jen talked pregnancy, and in her excitement, Kathy spilled the tea all over Twitter.\n\nEh \u2026 probably not.\n\nAccording to Aniston\u2019s publicist Stephen Huvane, Kathy has no information about what\u2019s going on in Jen\u2019s uterus than anyone else.\n\n\u201cJennifer is not pregnant nor does she know Kathy Hilton,\u201d Huvane tells Hollywood Life.\n\nThe situation begs the question:\n\nPhoto via Getty Images\n\nWhat in the actual hell was Kathy Hilton talking about?\n\nFor starters, Jen didn\u2019t look remotely pregnant on Sunday night.\n\nNot only that, Kathy skipped right over speculation that Jen is pregnant and jumped right to speculating about the non-existent baby\u2019s gender.\n\nLook, Kathy, we understand that your family is a bit thirsty these days, but this isn\u2019t the way.\n\nPhoto via Getty\n\nThe Internet generates approximately 40,000 Jennifer Aniston pregnancy rumors a day on its own.\n\nWe don\u2019t need you adding fuel to the fire.\n\nIf you need attention this badly, we suggest you keep it in-house and start a rumor about Paris.\n\nYour daughter, not the city.\n\nAlthough come to think of it, Americans are probably equally apathetic about both these days.", "images":
