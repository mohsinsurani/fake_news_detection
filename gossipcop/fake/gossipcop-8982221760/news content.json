In a lawsuit filed today, the Pirates Of The Caribbean star is going after The Management Group for more than $25 million in a jury-seeking suit alleging fraud and several other claims.\n\n\u201cAs a result of years of gross mismanagement and sometimes outright fraud, Mr. Depp lost tens of millions of dollars and has been forced to dispose of significant assets to pay for TMG\u2019s self-dealing and gross misconduct,\u201d reads the 52-page complaint (read it here) filed in Los Angeles Superior Court by the actor and fellow Plaintiff Edward L. White as trustees of the Mooh Investment Trust.\n\nThe lawsuit alleges 11 complaints ranging from fraud to breach of contract to professional negligence. It claims TMG paid itself more than $28 million in contingency fees without a written agreement; failed to file or pay his taxes on time, resulting in more than $5.6 million in fees and penalties on his federal returns; and \u201cloaning\u201d nearly $10 million to third parties without Depp\u2019s authorization or proper documentation.\n\n\u201cIn essence, TMG treated Mr. Depp\u2019s income as their own, available to either TMG or third parties to draw upon as desired,\u201d read the complaint filed by attorneys at Los Angeles-based Manatt, Phelps & Phillips, LLC.\n\n\u201cTMG\u2019s gross mismanagement and fraud remained undetected as TMG borrowed millions of dollars to survive from movie-to-movie,\u201d add the filing.\n\n\u201cIt was only recently, when Mr. Depp terminated TMG and hired new business management and accounting services, when Mr. Depp learned the gravity of his financial losses and some, but surely not all, of the underlying facts,\u201d the complain states bluntly, also adding that the management firm is seeking foreclosure on Depp\u2019s primary home through a loan the actor says came from TMG\u2019s own self-dealing.\n\nIn addition to the more than $25 million sought in compensatory damages, the suit asks for a temporary restraining order and permanent injunction enjoining the Defendants from proceeding with the foreclosure on the home.\n\nDepp, recently in the courts for his high-profile divorce from Amber Heard last summer, is plenty busy. He recently shot Open Road\u2019s cop drama LAbyrinth, joined 20th Century Fox\u2019s Murder On The Orient Express, and will co-star in Warner Bros\u2019 follow-up to Fantastic Beasts And Where To Find Them. Of course, Pirates Of The Caribbean: Dead Men Tell No Tales bows worldwide May 26.\n\nHe also in the fall signed with CAA after a three-decade run at UTA.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=422369225140645&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/johnny-depp.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-0f0nSqEQ_DwA6&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/johnny-depp.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/johnny-depp.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dominic Patten Patrick Hipes", "Dominic Patten", "Patrick Hipes"], "canonical_link": "https://deadline.com/2017/01/johnny-depp-lawsuit-business-managers-fraud-1201886061/", "title": "Johnny Depp Sues Business Managers For $25M Over Fraud", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-deadline-2019/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/cropped-icon-512x512.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Johnny Depp has sued his former managers The Management Group for more than $25 million alleging fraud and several other claims.", "news_keywords": "Johnny Depp", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=533209613", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Patrick Hipes", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Deadline", "application-name": "Deadline", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1201886061, "title": "Johnny Depp Sues Business Managers For $25M Over Fraud", "published_at": "2017-01-13 17:01:48", "image": "https://deadline.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/johnny-depp.jpg?w=296&h=166&crop=1", "comment_count": 6, "tags": "Johnny Depp", "topics": "TV", "body": "Like many an actor before him, Johnny Depp believes he has been swindled in the Hollywood accounting shell game -- by his own business managers and lawyers.
