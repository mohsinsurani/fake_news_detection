With the press corps photographers snapping away, the 46-year-old Slovenia-born stunner smiled for the cameras as the billionaire, 70, awkwardly reached for her hand and clutched the tips of her fingers.\n\nOnce the obligatory photo op was complete, she, Donald and their 11-year-old son, Barron, boarded Marine One, POTUS\u2019 helicopter, which whisked them away to their Palm Beach, Florida, estate, Mar-a-Lago. Aboard the chopper \u2014 and away from the public eye \u2014 Melania dropped the act. And Donald\u2019s hand. \u201cMelania,\u201d a family source alleges in the new issue of Us Weekly, \u201cdoes not keep hidden from everyone around her how miserable she is.\u201d\n\nThat includes the presi\u00addent himself. Multiple sources claim that the former fashion model \u2014 who\u2019s currently living 200 miles away from Washington, D.C., in NYC\u2019s Trump Tower while Barron finishes the school year \u2014 refuses to share a bed with Donald even on the rare occasions when they sleep in the same city. \u201cThey have separate bedrooms,\u201d says another Trump insider. \u201cThey never spend the night together \u2014 ever.\u201d (A third source says the couple do sleep in the same room but keep separate beds: \u201cIt\u2019s very \u2018royal\u2019 of them!\u201d)\n\nUpset with the former reality star for trapping her in a life she despises, \u201cMelania wants as little to do with Donald as possible,\u201d explains the family source. \u201cShe is not interested in Donald, the presidency or anything involving him.\u201d A rep for Melania denies the claims, telling Us, \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that you are going to feature unnamed \u2018sources\u2019 that have provided fictional accounts.\u201d\n\nSince assuming the role of first lady January 20, Melania has kept an extremely limited official schedule. After the inauguration, she mostly stayed in her gilded Fifth Avenue triplex penthouse and didn\u2019t set foot in the nation\u2019s capital again for 21 days. And the few official appearances she has made were done so begrudgingly.\n\nMelania escorted Akie Abe, the Japanese prime minister\u2019s wife, around Palm Beach in February, but \u201conly because she was going to be at Mar-a-Lago already,\u201d according to the family source. \u201cShe refused to do it in Washington.\u201d\n\nFor much more on the Trumps, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/donaldmelenia-trump-1-744cbc09-d984-4987-b06e-622ce793d7f1.jpg?crop=1px%2C1px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "http://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/donaldmelenia-trump-1-744cbc09-d984-4987-b06e-622ce793d7f1.jpg?crop=1px%2C1px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/donald-trump-and-first-lady-melania-keep-separate-bedrooms-w473116/", "title": "Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Donald Trump and first lady Melania keep separate bedrooms, sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get all the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms", "description": "Donald Trump and first lady Melania keep separate bedrooms, sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get all the details!", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/donald-trump-and-first-lady-melania-keep-separate-bedrooms-w473116/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-19T16:53:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/donaldmelenia-trump-1-744cbc09-d984-4987-b06e-622ce793d7f1.jpg?crop=1px%2C1px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/donaldmelenia-trump-1-744cbc09-d984-4987-b06e-622ce793d7f1.jpg?crop=1px%2C1px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-03-22T12:32:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-19T16:53:41+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump and First Lady Melania Keep Separate Bedrooms", "description": "Donald Trump and first lady Melania keep separate bedrooms, sources reveal in the new issue of Us Weekly \u2014 get all the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/donaldmelenia-trump-1-744cbc09-d984-4987-b06e-622ce793d7f1.jpg?crop=1px%2C1px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1490185920.0, "source": "http://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
