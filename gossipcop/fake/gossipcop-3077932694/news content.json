Mel filed for divorce in March, after nearly 10 years of marriage.\n\nThe following month, the singer got a restraining order against her estranged husband, alleging that Belafonte beat and threatened her throughout their nearly 10-year marriage.\n\nWATCH: Nick Cannon, Simon Cowell, Sharon Osbourne and 'AGT' Stars Support Mel B Amid Divorce Drama\n\nDays later, Belafonte, who denied the allegations, responded when he filed a petition seeking joint custody of their 5-year-old daughter, Madison, and requesting spousal support and that Mel pay his legal fees.\n\nFor more on the Spice Girls star's tumultuous split, check out the video below.\n\nWatch Entertainment Tonight on Yahoo View, available on iOS and Android.\n\nRelated Gallery\n\nRelated Articles", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_w_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/5VVg6kBeokMbxUJjXg8XFw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTE0NDI-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aBYGAyLVlHyrl5zSpE.fQQ--~B/aD00OTI4O3c9MzI4MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/83e6ecc768434cb17b55ee138019c8d8", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ah.zH2Cz3o7dYIXtOmd7Xw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTUwO2g9NDg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/07b8d210-243d-11eb-bbff-617af51ac603", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/ue7oPZxQMpoEvgPRhRvvsQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTEyOTc-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/IRaVcyg0ZcmMiE05ixBJ_Q--~B/aD00NDMyO3c9MzI4MDthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/7328a178bc6c42b63b1e0eca2fb33f4f", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eR6jzoacWuZTwYjt4U27Iw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/8a6e3eb07a2ce086a37210ee4458490c", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/oMSXGoaBcjfa5BLc166VJA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/F4S5FDPBeJSYQqS7wRUPRg--~B/aD03MjA7dz0xMjgwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/8a6e3eb07a2ce086a37210ee4458490c", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197800334&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fentertainment%2Fmel-b-making-statement-her-004718025.html&c14=-1"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eR6jzoacWuZTwYjt4U27Iw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/8a6e3eb07a2ce086a37210ee4458490c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mel-b-making-statement-her-004718025.html", "title": "Is Mel B Making a Statement About Her Divorce With Her MTV VMAs Dress?", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Mel B, MTV Video Music Awards, Heidi Klum, Inglewood, California, Stephen Belafonte", "twitter": {"title": "Is Mel B Making a Statement About Her Divorce With Her MTV VMAs Dress?", "description": "The 'America's Got Talent' star rocked a colorful dress on the red carpet that could be a bold comment about her contentious split.", "site": "@Yahoo", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eR6jzoacWuZTwYjt4U27Iw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/8a6e3eb07a2ce086a37210ee4458490c", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eR6jzoacWuZTwYjt4U27Iw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/8a6e3eb07a2ce086a37210ee4458490c"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"title": "Is Mel B Making a Statement About Her Divorce With Her MTV VMAs Dress?", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/mel-b-making-statement-her-004718025.html", "description": "The 'America's Got Talent' star rocked a colorful dress on the red carpet that could be a bold comment about her contentious split.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eR6jzoacWuZTwYjt4U27Iw--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NzU-/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/etonline.tv/8a6e3eb07a2ce086a37210ee4458490c", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "al": {"android": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=71ebbb97-5b43-387c-bdb7-5a8815800601&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo"}, "ios": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=71ebbb97-5b43-387c-bdb7-5a8815800601&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842}}, "description": "The 'America's Got Talent' star rocked a colorful dress on the red carpet that could be a bold comment about her contentious split.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
