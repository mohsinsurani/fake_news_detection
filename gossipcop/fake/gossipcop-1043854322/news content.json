The War Machine actor said he\u2019s been spending his time \u201ckeeping the ship afloat\u201d and \u201cfiguring out the new configuration of our family\u201d these days.\n\n\u201cKids are everything,\u201d he said of his six children \u2014 Maddox, 15, Pax, 13, Zahara, 12, Shiloh, 10, and twins Vivienne and Knox, 8. \u201cKids are your life. They\u2019re taking all the focus, as they should anyway.\u201d\n\nAnd in a candid interview with GQ in May, the actor spent much of the chat talking about his transformation since his split from Jolie \u2013 including his healthy lifestyle changes.\n\n\u201cI was boozing too much,\u201d he shared. \u201cIt\u2019s just become a problem. And I\u2019m really happy it\u2019s been half a year now, which is bittersweet, but I\u2019ve got my feelings in my fingertips again.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cTruthfully I could drink a Russian under the table with his own vodka. I was a professional. I was good.\u201d\n\nWhen asked how he simply stopped drinking, the Allied star said, \u201cDon\u2019t want to live that way anymore.\u201d\n\nPitt recently wrapped shooting the science-fiction thriller Ad Astra, opposite Tommy Lee Jones. In his spare time, the actor has also been trying his hand at sculpting. The solitude allows him to reflect and \u201ctry to make sense of where we are at this time,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cI remember literally having this thought a year, a year and a half ago; someone was going through some scandal,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cSomething crossed my path that was a big scandal\u2014and I went, \u2018Thank God I\u2019m never going to have to be a part of one of those again.\u2019 I live my life, I have my family, I do my thing, I don\u2019t do anything illegal, I don\u2019t cross anyone\u2019s path. What\u2019s the David Foster Wallace quote? \u2018Truth will set you free, but not until it\u2019s done with you first.\u2019\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Jolie has spent her fall promoting her third film as director, the Cambodian Netflix drama First They Killed My Father (it was recentlynominated for a Golden Globe), as well as the Globe-nominated animated film The Breadwinner, which she produced. She\u2019s also been busy supporting her philanthropic causes. On Friday, the actress brought along four of her children to accompany her to the 2017 United Nations Correspondents Association Awards at Cipriani Wall Street, where Jolie was honored as the 2017 UNCA Global Citizen of the year.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/ME2qUw7cHyNnP_xc09hcfDqaoZQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(329x0:331x2)/angelina-jolie-6f8c30eac75c4a1baae6e61065e1a271.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RTd4g3PrJuofHxs5erLYLZjFF6c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(694x0:696x2)/angelina-jolie1-3a8cb5904e31473f8cd9f157348d8318.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/hsINUQl0caKWMJ1FZ3ypJRC3TkQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(216x0:218x2)/angelina-2-435-71f2a712176d4504b9b3a4421b44dcea.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Kly0w-ivZDkOrwRlyQVRBbvE4N4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(531x419:533x421)/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-1-ca19f56f8d8f419ea04518c2c6e7ac1c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4OHLqwjruAv7s_UOE_sKXPm_GHo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(216x0:218x2)/angelina-1-435-17b79f149ff748958812374ee2ac0610.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8cJmVZc7Ok6w5_4Wwxc14qmMsU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_generic-1885945d8bd544778fbbf4be88a63f00.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/e_Sgk0ed-Bjmrzj0kJuEOiKIbPM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(216x0:218x2)/angelina-6-435-40b3bf47c59947c88b884b601de7ac3b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/otN-XjCUFCXsecnDOWRvNSzoooE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/angelina-jolie5-1-2000-aea894d718cb4067bb4069395cf7f3c9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/1Hc0m9nLeH_6Bx7PZWIwTEFhPNA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/brad-pitt-2-2000-c422aa7f22f14bd8b7f6eeecef67ee9d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WipPR-vGEETyHf5oiyMKH2qrB0o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/brad-pitt-1-1-bc4ebae2626d4ab386e34280760a9938.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3Hs-JkpKL_0C2Rb5CmS6UJDQMXE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(587x223:589x225)/angelina-jolie-1-2b124302a8644440a370dfb00176c94b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/eA6jgiCtZORfisIFM0G67y4DSgk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(216x0:218x2)/angelina-5-435-5-efcd8337f0534b0dbc60c1afa0176418.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Bx-N2Izb_QHTaORVcyqFJENPR-M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/jolie-pitt-2000x2000-0ab2ee83b2854d7a8fbe488d9d7cc43f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/b9LJCMQ7yYvUTcUpliIlALAj9yg=/650x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/brangelina-3d32493689354cddb2cbb87940d29171.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2rdBjIIMNsvOmxjkGLsgvELo6WI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(703x0:705x2)/brad-pitt-1-2-e3b763b905734c6ba6d0dfa8edcbb818.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/YrBmKKNxnxJS5n6EJijNmIuTYMM=/1433x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/brad-pitt-cc1d7e77ee3e4e26854d46bfa866e5dc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/41K3sgmfwx79TvHJ_ebvYJ_wMNA=/650x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(715x0:717x2)/brad-pitt-cc1d7e77ee3e4e26854d46bfa866e5dc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rZRYwhhOVDtqR_5IH-h8uY3Cy1g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt1-2a941b7ab64d48c98870735131226f2f.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/YrBmKKNxnxJS5n6EJijNmIuTYMM=/1433x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/brad-pitt-cc1d7e77ee3e4e26854d46bfa866e5dc.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Guglielmi", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/brad-pitt-birthday/", "title": "Brad Pitt Turns 54!
