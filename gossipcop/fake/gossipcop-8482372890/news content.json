That's the alarming claim being made in a recent article in The National Inquirer. According to the Enquirer, Brad has been living the \"hippy\" lifestyle, refusing to take showers and change his clothes as he continues to get over his divorce from Angelina Jolie and the separation from his children. He has also allegedly been sleeping on friends' couches because he's afraid that if he remains home alone, he will relapse into addiction.\n\nBut Gossip Cop, a site that's become known for debunking celebrity rumors has said the report smells just as fishy as they claim Brad Pitt smells.\n\n\"Brad's gone days, if not weeks, at a time without taking a shower, so of course he stinks of body odor a lot of the time,\" an alleged close friend of the War Machine actor reportedly told The National Enquirer, as reported by Gossip Cop.\n\nBut Gossip Cop has a different story that they claim they received from someone who is actually in Pitt's inner circle.\n\n\"We're told Pitt isn't living the lifestyle of a smelly drifter, and the claim otherwise is completely bogus,\" Gossip Cop states.\n\nThe latest report in the ongoing Brad Pitt Angelina Jolie saga is that Brad Pitt was \"allowed\" to see his children to celebrate Father's Day.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/Ashley-Benson.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4307067/is-brad-pitts-body-odor-becoming-a-problem-for-friends-helping-him-through-angelina-jolie-divorce/", "title": "Is Brad Pitt's Body Odor Becoming A Problem For Friends Helping Him Through Angelina Jolie Divorce Aftermath", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is Brad Pitt's Body Odor Becoming A Problem For Friends Helping Him Through Angelina Jolie Divorce Aftermath", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4307067/is-brad-pitts-body-odor-becoming-a-problem-for-friends-helping-him-through-angelina-jolie-divorce/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Is Brad Pitt's Body Odor Becoming A Problem For Friends Helping Him Through Angelina Jolie Divorce Aftermath", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-06-19 19:04:55Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Is Brad Pitt's Body Odor Becoming A Problem For Friends Helping Him Through Angelina Jolie Divorce Aftermath", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497899095.0, "source": "http://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
