While the two are supposedly just in the stages of reconnecting their friendship, they just haven\u2019t been able to stay away from each other in the past week. Sel even broke up with her boyfriend of 10 months, The Weeknd, 27. That\u2019s because Selena feels she and Justin were always destined to be together. \u201cNo matter what happens, and where life goes, Selena\u2019s heart always ends up coming back to Justin. They truly do love each other deeply, but despite multiple tries they\u2019ve never been able to make it work, and they\u2019ve always ended up splitting,\u201d a source close to Selena tells HollywoodLife.com EXCLUSIVELY.\n\n\u201cSelena believes they\u2019re destined to be together though, and that Justin is her soulmate, but they just met each other at too young an age to be able to make a go of it,\u201d our insider continues. They were just teenagers when Jelena made things official way back in 2011. In the years since they worked hard to transition into being successful adult artists and are now two of the biggest singers on the planet! But it took a toll on their romance plans as it would for any young stars.\n\n\u201cThey still have those deep intense feelings for each other \u2014 they don\u2019t just dissolve because they split \u2014 so, inevitably they end up agreeing to try to give it just one more try,\u201d our source continues. The two were photographed having breakfast at a vegan restaurant outside of LA on Oct. 29, the third time in a week that they have been spotted hanging out after not seeing each other for at least the past year and a half. See Jelena\u2019s most couples goal moments in pics, here.\n\nA second source tells us Selena has big hopes for the couple now that they\u2019ve reconnected, especially after her dramatic kidney transplant over the summer. \u201cSelena has always hoped that Justin would be the one she would marry. She has the biggest weakness for Justin, the first true love of her life. Selena\u2019s health scare put her whole life into a new perspective and she has reevaluated having a family, getting married and everything else in her life,\u201d our insider tells us. \u201cShe has always wanted everything out of life and now time is more precious than ever before. She is learning now to seize the day and take action on things. If she wants a happy ending with Justin, she needs to make it happen now.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, when do you think Justin and Selena will confirm they\u2019re back together?", "images": ["https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/jen-aniston-loved-wet-brush-now-kid-friendly-disney.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/bb-heather-tom-katie-hw.jpeg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Angelina-Jolie-Shopping-Maddox-Zahara-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/selena-gomez-believes-justin-bieber-is-her-soulmate-they_re-destined-to-be-together-ftr.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/howtosupportiran.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kylie-jenner-stormi-webster-mega-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Shania-Twain-Oprah-Disagreed-Sour-SS-ftr-1.jpg?w=620"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/selena-gomez-believes-justin-bieber-is-her-soulmate-they_re-destined-to-be-together-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Shilliday", "Taylor Jeffries", "Roya Backlund", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Candace Young", "Charlie Mason"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2017/10/30/justin-bieber-selena-gomez-soulmates-relationship-destined-to-be-together/", "title": "Selena Gomez Believes Justin Bieber Is Her \u2018Soulmate\u2019 & They\u2019re Destined To Be Together", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Selena Gomez believes that she and Justin Bieber are soulmates who are destined to be together.
