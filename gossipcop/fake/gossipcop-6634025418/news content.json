Check it out.\n\nDid Beyonce have a nose job?\n\nPersonally, I believe Beyonce puts a lot of work onto her nose.\n\nBut I\u2019m not talking about a nose job here. Instead, I think she uses a ton of contouring to make her nose look thinner.\n\nClose up, Beyonce\u2019s nose actually looks quite similar to her younger self.\n\nDid Beyonce get lip fillers?\n\nThere was a period when Beyonce\u2019s lips look bloated.\n\nThis obvious attracted media attention and some even suggested that the star had lip injections.\n\nBut I think it\u2019s all makeup, as you can probably see above.\n\nDid Beyonce have botox?\n\nCan you believe Beyonce is in her 40s?\n\nHer face still looks amazing though and she has amazing skin too!\n\nShe doesn\u2019t have many wrinkles either, but her laugh lines are more visible these days.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think she\u2019s had botox. Not yet.\n\nHas Beyonce had a boob job?\n\nIt\u2019s clear that Beyonce has put on some weight.\n\nBut this is not the only reason for her larger breast size today. Beyonce\u2019s boobs are actually not small to begin with, so I don\u2019t think they are not fake.\n\nAt best, she might have gotten a breast lift, but not implants.\n\nDid Beyonce get a butt lift?\n\nUnlikely.\n\nBeyonce has an amazing curve and her butt size was prominent even when she was skinnier.\n\nThe only reason why they appear bigger now is due to her weight gain.\n\nSo, I don\u2019t think she had a butt lift.\n\nBeyonce: Then and Now\n\nLet\u2019s see the singer\u2019s transformation over the years.\n\nEarly Childhood\n\nAs a child, Beyonce had a cute and chubby face.\n\nTeenager Days\n\nA skinny Bey used to be part of a church choir in her teens. Y\u00eas, the singing started at a young age.\n\nBeyonce in 1998\n\nBack then, Beyonce was part of Destiny\u2019s Child. She seemed to have a bigger nose, but I think her baby fat may have played a role.\n\nBeyonce in 2001\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what makeup can do to Beyonce\u2019s face. She looks different.\n\nBeyonce in 2003\n\nThis was the year she debuted her solo album, \u201cDangerously in Love\u201d.\n\nBeyonce in 2007\n\nBeyonce walked onto the American Music Awards looking absolutely stunning!\n\nBeyonce in 2012\n\nIsn\u2019t this the most beautiful smile in the world?\n\nBeyonce has beautiful teeth but I wonder if she\u2019s had any work done?\n\nBeyonce 2015\n\nThis was the year that Beyonce gave birth to her twins.\n\nYear 2018\n\nPost pregnancy, Beyonce performed at the Coachella and did not disappoint.\n\nBeyonce in 2022\n\nAt 40, Beyonce is showing no signs of aging.\n\nConclusion\n\nI couldn\u2019t find sufficient evidence.\n\nBeyonce\u2019s flawless perfection may in fact be a natural gift.\n\nThe singer has never admitted to having cosmetic surgery and most likely never will.\n\nLet\u2019s see what happens in the coming years.", "images": ["https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-butt-lift.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-2003.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/park-seo-joon-plastic-surgery-150x150.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-lip-fillers.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/selena-gomez-plastic-surgery-150x150.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/laura-dern-plastic-surgery1-150x150.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-2015.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-teen.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-2001.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/keith-urban-plastic-surgery-150x150.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-nose-job1.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-botox.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/PSP-logo.png", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/lee-jong-suk-plastic-surgery-150x150.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-2007.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-boob-job1.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-1998.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-2012.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/young-beyonce.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-2018.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-2022.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-plastic-surgery.jpg", "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/PSPlogo-1.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.plasticsurgerypeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/beyonce-plastic-surgery.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Psp Team"], "canonical_link": "https://www.plasticsurgerypeople.com/beyonce-plastic-surgery/", "title": "Beyonce: BEFORE and AFTER 2022", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Beyonce: BEFORE and AFTER 2022", "description": "As one of the most successful female artists of all time, Beyonce doesn\u2019t seem to have a beauty misstep.
