We count at least five\n\n(Carolyn Kaster / Associated Press)\n\nThe Wall Street Journal didn\u2019t release the full transcript of the interview its reporters and editors had last week with President Trump, but when Politico obtained a copy and published it, the interview quickly drew attention for several false statements Trump made.\n\nThe one that immediately gained notoriety was Trump\u2019s claim that after his speech at the Boy Scout Jamboree last week, \u201cI got a call from the head of the Boy Scouts saying it was the greatest speech that was ever made to them.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, the Boy Scouts of America released a statement saying \u201cwe are unaware of any such call.\u201d The Scouts specifically said that neither the organization\u2019s president, AT&T chairman Randall Stephenson, nor its chief executive, Mike Surbaugh, had made such a call.\n\nIn fact, Surbaugh last week issued an unprecedented apology for a presidential speech \u2014 Scouts have heard from presidents back to Franklin D. Roosevelt \u2014 saying he was sorry that some members of the scouting community had been offended by Trump\u2019s partisanship, language and tone.\n\nIn the daily White House press briefing, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that other Boy Scout leaders, whom she did not name, had complimented Trump after his speech.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the only call to come into question recently. A few days after the Journal interview, Trump said that Mexico\u2019s president, Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto, had paid him the \u201cultimate compliment\u201d by calling and telling him that \u201ctheir southern border, very few people are coming because they know they\u2019re not going to get through our border.\u201d\n\nThe Mexican government press office issued a statement Wednesday denying that.\n\nPe\u00f1a Nieto \u201chas not had recent telephone communication with President Donald Trump,\u201d the statement said.\n\nSanders said that Pe\u00f1a Nieto did compliment Trump, but in a personal conversation, not a telephone call.\n\n\u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it was a lie,\u201d she said of Trump\u2019s statements.\n\nOther false statements involved broader factual matters.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re the highest-taxed nation in the world,\u201d Trump said \u2014 a statement that he has repeatedly made and which has repeatedly been debunked. Whether measured by the top tax rate or the overall percentage of national income which is taxed, the U.S. has lower taxes than most of its chief economic competitors.\n\nTrump may have been thinking about the U.S. corporate tax rate, which is higher than most developed countries, although not the highest. Yet few companies actually pay that top rate given various tax deductions, credits and exemptions.\n\nTrump also said \u201cI honestly believe for six months, I have done more than just about any other president when you look at all of the bills that were passed, 42, 43.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s untrue. Many of Trump\u2019s predecessors had signed more legislation, and nearly all recent ones had signed more significant measures by this point in their tenures.\n\nJimmy Carter had signed 70 bills into law by this point, Bill Clinton 50. Franklin D. Roosevelt had 76 in just his first 100 days.\n\nAbout one-third of the bills Trump has signed have been ceremonial measures, such as renaming courthouses.\n\nReferring to his top economic advisor, Gary Cohn, Trump said \u201cGary wrote a check for $200 million\u201d when he entered the government. \u201cHe had to pay $200 million in tax.\u201d\n\nTrump has said that before, including in a speech in June. It\u2019s false.\n\nCohn owned about $220 million in Goldman Sachs stock when he resigned as the bank\u2019s president to become the head of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council. He sold the stock to minimize conflicts of interest, as most appointees do. But he certainly didn\u2019t have to pay $200 million in tax on that sale.\n\nIn fact, it\u2019s likely Cohn hasn\u2019t paid any tax so far. He may never have to.\n\nFederal law allows appointees to government positions to defer any tax they owe on assets that they sell to avoid conflicts. The law requires that they put the proceeds of the sale into neutral investments such as Treasury securities. If his securities go up in value, Cohn might have to pay tax on that gain. The top tax rate on capital gains is 20%.\n\nTrump also repeated a false claim about his defeated rival from the election, Hillary Clinton.\n\n\u201cReal crimes are what Hillary did with 33,000 emails, where she deleted them and bleached them after getting a subpoena.\u201d\n\nTrump made that claim more than once during the campaign, and more recently on Twitter.\n\nHe is correct that Clinton deleted 33,000 emails from the private server she used for her messages while she was secretary of State. She says that all of those deleted emails were personal and that she had no obligation to keep them. No one has come up with evidence to the contrary.\n\nThe evidence from the FBI\u2019s investigation of the emails shows that in December 2014, after she turned over about 30,000 work-related emails to the State Department, Clinton\u2019s aides told the company that managed the server to delete the rest of the emails. The emails were subpoenaed about three months later, on March 4.\n\nThe company didn\u2019t actually do the deletion until later in March, but there\u2019s been no evidence that Clinton knew about the delay at the time or that the company knew the messages were under subpoena.\n\nIn any case, the FBI declined to recommend prosecution, contrary to Trump\u2019s assertion that Clinton committed \u201creal crimes.\u201d\n\nA poll released Wednesday by Quinnipiac University asked Americans if they believe Trump is honest. By 62% to 34%, a majority said no.\n\n12:30 p.m.: This article was updated with comments by White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders.", "images":
