He then unfollowed the 41-year-old singer on Twitter today, the same day it was announced she had left Interscope Records to start her own record label under BMG and will be working with them on her upcoming solo album, Double Duchess.

If the group \u2014 which also includes member apl.de.ap \u2014 is officially donezo, we do hope they stay on good terms.
