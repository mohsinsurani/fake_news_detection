Literally,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cI am currently doing well although if I dropped dead you would see a funeral like al Capone!\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess this heart attack has really made me reflect,\u201d he added. \u201cYou know, we aren\u2019t guaranteed tomorrow, or u really think about it.\u201d\n\nJason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nA rep for Quinn tells PEOPLE the actor is \u201cdoing great.\u201d On Monday, he continued to crack jokes about his health emergency as he thanked everyone for all the messages that had been sent his way.\n\n\u201cThanks for all the kind words and support,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cStarting a list of those who didn\u2019t \u2018check in\u2019 yet. Guarantee they\u2019ll regret the day they didn\u2019t wish me well on the road to recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cA heart attack is a serious thing. When it happens to a celeb let\u2019s double the importance,\u201d he joked. \u201cI understand some people wish me dead, it\u2019s human. I feel that way about plenty of people myself. But there\u2019s ways of doing things. \u2018Keep up appearances\u2019 as they say.\u201d\n\nThe comedian, who starred in Trainwreck alongside Amy Schumer, also thanked the staff of Mount Sinai Hospital in New York City for saving \u201ca great man\u2019s life.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey realized they had a precious jewel of comedy in their hands,\u201d he quipped.\n\nFollowing the health scare, Quinn announced he would be rescheduling a series of planned concerts in Florida.\n\n\u201cMy heart goes out to all the people who bought tickets to my show. Literally. My heart went out,\u201d he said in a statement, according to the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cI know you people are still mad that I postponed the show even though I had a heart attack. I felt the same way when I bought Lou Reed tickets last year. I will reschedule once you tell me which weekends are best for you.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/nFf4d217WzLwbgG5vo5euaxhiKo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x319:766x321)/bob-odenkirk-b7739e360158488cb08b082d7349749a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-rkYWKGqiV1RdEgwEUjPrWYrkP0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(644x239:646x241)/Hailey-Bieber-0b4449085c5b4682b26017521f0cf257.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/4ShcSnzgP0W6XVU4tUgzRwmlIoI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x52:961x54)/GettyImages-460309382-e8278da4afdc461884b36077168f821b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jOZoCSdCuCseS2eY8-XHIU0X_A0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/amy-schumer-sag-1da292c8a8fb4f01ac0aaee94bee0e2e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/RwPrjRnuUv4z1Tyg36HwRsGXyw8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(741x0:743x2)/biebers-1-2000-050a5dc3af444b798f382c037e8a138c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/gT8lMWC3iTN1rVf3ozRtucpQQQc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(706x299:708x301)/keith-urban-2-b9926082d446418d94cb5cc1783e802d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/LhnJ9s9nkwEWpeBVQFahVAwnN58=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/justin-hailey-bieber-1-6b3d412cbf114a42812eb6ce7a432c48.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/M3Pq9FRvKej-rwwencmNxqI0W2M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1319x31:1321x33)/kim-kardashian-2000-fc3c8f81be4445668ecd16246ce1008e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/F7KpAMc29duPGALkJXbjRfIkyVk=/650x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/colin-quinn-1-2000-9a8c2d32a1f047efa480fbb5524e6c8c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/F-p-1oCTo8-Rm8uQstjyiwCoWoY=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/colin-quinn-1-2000-9a8c2d32a1f047efa480fbb5524e6c8c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/A3XB9jq5to0TCLPRdLg0ec552Zw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(764x459:766x461)/justin-bieber-66a22ad264e84f86b686b5a5efb4dc16.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rNIC_81sYGIo49oXbah7zvRD5cY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(468x0:470x2)/justin-bieber-0-94c86fdd1e4148c49ea4fa373cd5a863.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/-n_nOJcaMYBNKFzEnBaldBpPpmo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/justin-bieber-4f0990e8d7a24684877882b8465f7326.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/xjrTRNv9yf5b4QCBniBpXiKOuq4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1059x572:1061x574)/justin-bieber-a1c78253bb484318a193d1daecc5a287.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/30ghwDUKEK8uhnI45q1ozqSkGkU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(527x614:529x616)/Heather-McDonald-06b0c678ea93438981cca82cd1f767f4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/e59s1BBY_NMsCmIDNSkn5GFRbj4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(959x438:961x440)/carlos-santana-1-33da9170f9f94a65808aaa3d6707d742.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/F-p-1oCTo8-Rm8uQstjyiwCoWoY=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/colin-quinn-1-2000-9a8c2d32a1f047efa480fbb5524e6c8c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Pasquini", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/colin-quinn-heart-attack-recovering/", "title": "Colin Quinn Recovering After Suffering Heart Attack on Valentine's Day", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"A heart attack is a serious thing.
