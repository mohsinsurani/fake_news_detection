I lie to Lyft drivers when they ask what I do, I keep my head down when walking through places like The Grove, and I never, ever talk about my love life in interviews. I know some may say that\u2019s a silly pursuit considering what I do for a living, but I am nowhere near interested in fame. I am not saying I\u2019m some recluse, either \u2014 I enjoy interaction with all sorts of people, I love Twitter, and I want to be involved in what\u2019s going on in the world. But being \u201cfamous\u201d sounds horrible. I know some people get into this business for fame, but I try to keep what I do and that shitty side effect separate. I really just like acting and filmmaking, and while I\u2019d like to be well-known among my peers as someone fun to work with who does good stuff, I definitely do not want your Aunt Belinda to know any details about me or my dating life. I\u2019m fine being Tom Haverford\u2019s girlfriend to some select cool people, but I\u2019d much rather go to the airport dressed like a total slob and go unnoticed. Anyway, I\u2019m about to blow that all up. Hopefully, for a good reason.\n\nPhoto by NBC/Ben Cohen\n\nWe are all living on this earth during a remarkable period in history. I mean, if we thought the Industrial Revolution changed things in a big way, look at what having widespread use of the internet for roughly two decades has done. So much has changed in such a short time. The world, for better or for worse (I think it\u2019s for better), has become so much more connected. I can be walking down the street in New York and FaceTiming with a friend in India. That\u2019s NUTS. This very rapid change has left some people reeling, understandably so, for this idea of the way things \u201cshould be\u201d. Let me tell you something: If there\u2019s one thing I have learned in my 32 years on this planet (There\u2019s privacy leak #1 \u2014 now you know how old I am, yikes!) is that nothing \u2014 nothing is supposed to be any way. Things just are what they are. People are what they are. We try to fit things into boxes, into labels, because it helps us understand them, but not everything or everyone fits into our boxes or labels. (That\u2019s why we keep adding letters to the term LGBT\u2026) The rapid connection of the world has shown us that. Some are more accepting of this idea than others.\n\nI have been a supporter of LGBTQIA+ rights since I was a very little kid. Since I first learned what gay was. I was an only child who lived with my single mom in a 200 sq. ft. garage that was converted into an efficiency. We didn\u2019t have a lot of money, and a man she befriended at work gave her a backpack full of school supplies for me. I was over the moon. I will never, ever forget that. I had never even met this man. I asked my mom about him and who he was and if he had kids, and she explained to me that he didn\u2019t because he was gay and what that meant. I don\u2019t remember my reaction to that, but I think the reason I don\u2019t remember is because it wasn\u2019t a big deal to me at the time. It was explained that he liked other men, I understood it, plus COOL LISA FRANK STUFF AND MARKERS! As far as I was concerned, this man was the coolest and the nicest, and he deserved everything good in the world, too.\n\nI have this distinct memory of being in third grade and going to mass with my class (This was a thing we did pretty often; I went to a Catholic School, and going to church during the school day was akin to a pep rally at a non-religious school). A girl \u2014 let\u2019s call her Lily \u2014 who was a friend (although she was much more popular than I was) sat in front of me. I remember sitting through that mass looking at her hair, her smile, her jewelry and her shaved legs (which I wasn\u2019t allowed to do yet) and thinking she was so cool. She was so beautiful. I wanted to be like her. I wanted to be around her.\n\nI then went to a public high school, and it was a crazy transition after spending my entire life up to that point in a Catholic School uniform, but I really loved it. At first. Freshman year, I found a group of great friends in the Drama Club who were welcoming and cool and older than me. I was riding high on a very newfound popularity based on my mysterious \u201cnew kid-ness\u201d and big boobs that puberty had awarded me over the summer. I discovered acting. Life could not be better. There was a girl in my class who was SO cool. I\u2019ll call her Katy. She was a senior and she was gorgeous and funny and was friends with everyone. She was also openly bi. This was new to me. It felt scary and brave and I knew sometimes some people gave her shit and that her parents didn\u2019t approve, but she was confident and proud. We hung out a lot as the school year started, during lunch, during our shared acting class, after school. One day, during a rehearsal, she and I were sitting in the back of the nearly empty auditorium eating some candy and I told her I liked her. And she said \u201cI like you too.\u201d And I said, \u201cNo, I mean, I like you. And I don\u2019t know what to do about it, but I just thought I should tell you.\u201d Katy had never flirted with me. Katy had never, ever crossed the line of friendship, and by her look at that moment, I realized that she just didn\u2019t think I was into girls. Hell, I didn\u2019t think I was into girls. I\u2019d genuinely pined over only boys up until that point, but Katy made me feel like my entire body was smiling. I thought about her all day. I\u2019d thought about her all month leading up to that moment, when that came out of my mouth. From what I remember, she took a day or two to think about what I\u2019d said. And then she said she felt the same way. I was elated. We kissed. It was magic. It was also, as I said it had to be, a big secret.\n\nvia Giphy\n\nI know in a lot of places, things are different these days. Schools openly display pride posters and have LGBT clubs. Gay marriage is legal nationwide, \u201cDon\u2019t Ask Don\u2019t Tell\u201d has been repealed and LGBTQ rights are front and center in our national discussion. It\u2019s getting easier and easier for kids to come out. Not everywhere, not all the time, but we\u2019re getting somewhere. That wasn\u2019t the case not that long ago. Katy and I had to hide. We shared a notebook we\u2019d write notes to each other in and exchange it by putting it in our lockers during the day to communicate back and forth. Her name in that notebook was \u201cJorgie\u201d in case my mom or anyone found it. We created a whole backstory. Jorgie was a football player, and in hindsight, Jorgie was maybe not the most masculine name we could have come up with? I told one friend about it; a gay goth guy I knew who was so sweet and understanding and constantly getting beat up for being all of those things. Katy and I would go to her house during lunch and make out and talk and be in love and then go back to school and never touch in front of anyone. Understandably, Katy eventually got a little frustrated with that. Once, Katy and I were watching a movie at my house and we were under the covers on my bed. My mom walked by, saw us, and asked what we were doing. I said \u201cWe\u2019re cold.\u201d When Katy left, my mom said, \u201cYou need to be careful around that girl. She\u2019s not like you.\u201d We broke up in a dramatic fashion while I operated a spotlight during a pep rally. She ripped up our notebook and threw it at me, along with a note she\u2019d found where I told my goth friend she was being \u201cclingy and weird\u201d just because she had the desire to show any kind of affection towards me when we weren\u2019t in hiding. The ripped pages of all of my secrets rained down on the population of the school in the auditorium below us, and I thought, for sure, my life was over forever.\n\nI went home and told my mom I couldn\u2019t go back to school. I cried for days. I never told my mom what was really wrong (or I made up some excuse I\u2019ve since blocked out), and she took me to a therapist because I was absolutely hysterical and inconsolable. I think I\u2019ve blocked out what that therapist told me, too. But I know I thought I was sick. I know I thought something was really wrong with me. I was ashamed and I thought I was dirty. I knew that the church said it was wrong and that God said it was wrong (even though I couldn\u2019t exactly figure out why, if it wasn\u2019t hurting anyone). I was told bisexuals were degenerates who are selfish and just want the best of both worlds. I was told gay men are fine because they\u2019re funny and have good taste, but lesbian women are wastes of space. I was told the idea of two women kissing was disgusting.\n\nI don\u2019t remember going back to school, either. But I eventually did. Katy and I avoided each other, but I think I made it seem like she was just nuts. (Sorry, Katy.) Katy never outed me. Shortly after that, I dated the most popular senior boy. That was fun until he asked my friend to the prom, across the room from me, while we were still together. I kept dating and falling for boys after that, and I pushed the idea of liking girls out of my mind as much as possible until I got into my twenties. I moved to LA. I came out to my friends, slowly. I didn\u2019t want to hide it anymore and I was starting to feel like maybe I didn\u2019t have to. Considering I\u2019d shut them out for the last 7 years, I decided to go to my first lesbian club to meet girls. No one talked to me and I stepped on a bloody tampon on the dance floor and then I never went to a lesbian club again. Nothing against lesbian clubs, everything against clubs in general. Thankfully, I found other ways to meet people. Since then, I\u2019ve been in relationships with all sorts of beautiful, amazing, inspiring human beings. I have been lucky to stand by them and to learn from them. Many of them have helped me open up to myself and to the world. A special few have given me true freedom to learn about myself and express myself without feeling judged and without the fear of losing them. I am not attracted specifically to any type of gender. I\u2019m attracted to people. Each person is their own incredible, massive universe. That is what I am attracted to; that is what I want to know, want to love, want to defend, want to take care of.\n\nI don\u2019t like labeling myself, or anyone else, but if it\u2019s easier for you to understand me, what I\u2019m saying is that I\u2019m queer. What queer means to me is just simply that I\u2019m not straight. That\u2019s all. It\u2019s not scary, even though that word used to be really, really scary to me.\n\nI know this isn\u2019t some big, life-shattering revelation that everyone will be shocked by. The reason I decided to share this with you and with the world is because even though me telling you I\u2019m queer might not be a big deal these days, things are still pretty bad out there for people like me. There are gay concentration camps in Chechnya where people are being tortured right this second. In our very country, 49 people were killed and 58 people were wounded just last year because they were dancing in a gay club. Our safe spaces are not safe. I think it\u2019s important that I tell you that this familiar face you see on your TV is the Q part of LGBTQ, so that if you didn\u2019t know someone who was queer before, you do now. I also think it\u2019s important that if there are any scared kids out there, like I was, I can tell you that whole \u201cIt Gets Better\u201d campaign is true. It does. And you\u2019re not weird. You\u2019re not bad. You\u2019re not unholy. You\u2019re exactly what God intended you to be. You are exactly what you are supposed to be, because nothing is supposed to be anything except for what it is, even if not everyone understands that. You are an essential part of the world just as you were created, and I want to see you. The real you.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nSo while I\u2019ll still insist on privacy, and I still don\u2019t want you to know who I\u2019m dating, you should know that it could be anyone. And that\u2019s okay, because that\u2019s what it\u2019s supposed to be. Because that\u2019s me.", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/0*FFIauUZ2v22VX_du.jpg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/1*V6lw02-sSBW_3c7TVLqq0Q.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/270/1*Crl55Tm6yDNMoucPo1tvDg.png", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/64/64/1*i8ERZsOQkRP8ckwRz_ZyxA.png", "https://miro.medium.com/focal/112/112/50/50/1*ZosxbH6JDX4kVFHCQztVLg.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*i8ERZsOQkRP8ckwRz_ZyxA.png", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/0*mmlsI5SnVzCBMScF.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/1*PoSGvyBie0TufHcm7GzhhA.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/176/176/1*i8ERZsOQkRP8ckwRz_ZyxA.png", "https://miro.medium.com/focal/112/112/50/50/1*_k03K8qr9bhLe-YnffXkug.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/1*dmbNkD5D-u45r44go_cf0g.png", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/1*K1onfFP69I2jeHp9BkppZA.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/focal/112/112/50/50/0*-i4jB5_nHXBOXb3A", "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*y8I-KzkSY-a_kMYY9Eldjg.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/1*Zltsyfr6ZvbTSeeqBePZcw.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/focal/112/112/50/50/0*UAw0n2BT4HRR59m6.", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/40/40/1*tiJX1oflQkm0ve-uQOSvQg.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/270/1*W_RAPQ62h0em559zluJLdQ.png", "https://miro.medium.com/focal/112/112/50/50/1*rlPfKA7o_E-e92or-sxkyQ.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/focal/112/112/50/50/1*9I3n9upMRjqs6NA91mBjwg.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1200/1*y8I-KzkSY-a_kMYY9Eldjg.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Smartgirls Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://amysmartgirls.com/natalie-morales-would-like-you-to-know-nothing-about-her-except-for-one-thing-da80fc9b46f8", "title": "Natalie Morales would like you to know nothing about her, except for one thing\u2026", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}, "url": {"iphone": "medium://p/da80fc9b46f8"}}, "title": "Natalie Morales would like you to know nothing about her, except for one thing\u2026", "site": "@Medium", "description": "I am a very private person.
