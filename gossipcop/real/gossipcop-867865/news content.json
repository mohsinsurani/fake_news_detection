Joseph Gordon-Levitt and his wife, Tasha McCauley, welcomed their second child, a son, in June, a rep for the actor confirms to Us Weekly.\n\nThe couple are also parents of a 23-month-old son, whose name they have chosen to keep under wraps to protect his privacy.\n\n\u201cMy son, he\u2019s just a baby, you know? He hasn\u2019t made the choice to be in the public eye, and that\u2019s a choice that I would like him to be able to make when he\u2019s older, when he can think about these kinds of things and make that decision for himself,\u201d Gordon-Levitt, 36, said during an appearance on Live With Kelly and Michael in September 2015, one month after his son\u2019s birth. \u201cAnd so, for now, I\u2019m just a protective dad, and I want to protect his privacy.\u201d\n\nThe actor and businesswoman have kept most aspects of their relationship out of the public eye. The duo quietly tied the knot at their home in December 2014, and in the beginning stages of their relationship, Gordon-Levitt wouldn\u2019t publicly name his then-girlfriend. During a 2013 conversation with Howard Stern, the Snowden star opened up about his budding romance without revealing who he was dating. \u201cI think I\u2019m a pretty good person and a good boyfriend. Yeah, I just wouldn\u2019t want to be with someone who was disrespectful to me,\u201d he said at the time. \u201c[She\u2019s] not in show business.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joseph-gordon-levitt-and-tasha-mccauley-candid-66d06a5e-9879-415a-ae5c-b30c6dffac93.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1391px%2C782px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joseph-gordon-levitt-and-tasha-mccauley-candid-66d06a5e-9879-415a-ae5c-b30c6dffac93.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1391px%2C730px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joseph-gordon-levitt-and-tasha-mccauley-candid-66d06a5e-9879-415a-ae5c-b30c6dffac93.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1391px%2C730px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/joseph-gordon-levitt-tasha-mccauley-welcome-second-child-w493403/", "title": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Tasha McCauley Welcome Second Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tasha McCauley have welcomed their second child together, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Wife Tasha McCauley Welcome Baby No. 2", "description": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tasha McCauley have welcomed their second child together, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/joseph-gordon-levitt-tasha-mccauley-welcome-second-child-w493403/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:49:29+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joseph-gordon-levitt-and-tasha-mccauley-candid-66d06a5e-9879-415a-ae5c-b30c6dffac93.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1391px%2C730px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joseph-gordon-levitt-and-tasha-mccauley-candid-66d06a5e-9879-415a-ae5c-b30c6dffac93.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1391px%2C730px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-07-20T19:29:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:49:29+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt, Wife Tasha McCauley Welcome Baby No. 2", "description": "Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Tasha McCauley have welcomed their second child together, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/joseph-gordon-levitt-and-tasha-mccauley-candid-66d06a5e-9879-415a-ae5c-b30c6dffac93.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1391px%2C730px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500578940.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
