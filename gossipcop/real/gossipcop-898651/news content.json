She also battled bouts of drug induced psychosis and dementia.\n\n\u201cI was hallucinating on a daily basis. It took a year after getting after that drug for the chemicals in my brain to settle so that I stopped seeing things,\u201d the 42-year-old told the U.K.\u2019s iNews in an interview published on Thursday, December 7. \u201cI\u2019d just be sitting there, seeing a random bee or bunny.\u201d\n\nAt one point, the \u201cM.I.L.F $\u201d singer believed the CIA, FBI and SWAT team were tracking her every move and sought refuge at a church. \u201cThey tried to kick me out, because I was moving down the aisles in this crazy way, as I thought there was an infrared camera i the church trying to check for my body,\u201d Fergie recalled. \u201cI bolted past the altar into a hallway and two people were chasing me. I remember thinking: \u2018If I walk outside, and the SWAT team\u2019s out there, I was right all along. But if they\u2019re not out there, then it\u2019s the drugs making me see things and I\u2019m going to end up in an institution. And if it really is the drugs, I don\u2019t want to live my life like this anymore, anyway.\u2019\u201d\n\nOf course, there was no SWAT waiting for her in the parking lot. \u201cIt was a freeing moment,\u201d Fergie revealed. \u201cThe drugs thing, it was a hell of a lot of fun . . . until it wasn\u2019t. But you know what, I thank the day it happened me. Because that\u2019s my strength, my faith, my hope for something better.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the former Black Eyed Peas band member clean about her substance abuse and hitting rock bottom. In September she opened up to the Evening Standard about her \u201cdark period.\u201d\n\n\u201cI went into a church and had this epiphany. It was a crossroads,\u201d she said at the time.. \u201cThe drugs I was taking were making me insane. I was definitely seeing things and talking to them.\u201d\n\nBut those days are long behind her. Clean for more than 14 years, the mom of Axl, 4, with ex Josh Duhamel (the couple announced their separation in September after eight years of marriage) often marvels at how far she\u2019s come. As she told iNews: \u201cIt\u2019s incredible. I must have guardian angels.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fergie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C5px%2C1431px%2C809px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fergie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1431px%2C751px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fergie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1431px%2C751px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fergie-opens-up-about-crystal-meth-and-hallucinations/", "title": "Fergie: My Crystal Meth Addiction Made Me Hallucinate on a Daily Basis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Fergie opened up on Thursday, December 7, about how crystal meth made her hallucinate on a daily basis \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Fergie: My Crystal Meth Addiction Made Me Hallucinate on a Daily Basis", "description": "Fergie opened up on Thursday, December 7, about how crystal meth made her hallucinate on a daily basis \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/fergie-opens-up-about-crystal-meth-and-hallucinations/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:59+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fergie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1431px%2C751px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fergie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1431px%2C751px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-07T14:17:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:59+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fergie: My Crystal Meth Addiction Made Me Hallucinate on a Daily Basis", "description": "Fergie opened up on Thursday, December 7, about how crystal meth made her hallucinate on a daily basis \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/fergie1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1431px%2C751px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@rachelpaula", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512656259.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
