[I saw] her shaking, and she\u2019s got blood everywhere,\u201d Baltierra recalled. \"She kinda, like, cleaned herself up and we figured what was going on\u2026 We just sat on the bed and cried. We just held another. There\u2019s nothing you can really do.\"\n\nThe MTV reality stars share 3-year-old daughter Novalee and are biological parents to 8-year-old daughter Carly, whom they gave up for adoption. According to Baltierra, the loss of their baby felt similarly painful to what they dealt with when they gave up Carly.\n\n\"Carly\u2019s a little different because we get to see her every year, but it\u2019s a loss. I feel like you process it as a loss,\" Baltierra shared. \"I guess it\u2019s something I didn\u2019t really understand before.\"\n\nFollowing her miscarriage, Lowell struggled with the loss and said that if it weren't for her husband and family, she might not have made it through her pain.\n\n\"If they weren\u2019t around, I probably would\u2019ve offed myself. Seriously, I\u2019m sure a lot of people can relate,\" Lowell said. \"It\u2019s like, I don\u2019t want to live another day like this.\"\n\nShe continued to spiral in the aftermath, however, and made another remark about taking her own life. Baltierra acted quickly, finding a mental health treatment facility in Tuscon, Arizona, where his wife could get the emotional help she really needs.\n\nBaltierra drove his wife to the facility, where MTV's cameras were not allowed entrance, and he broke down in tears when he got back to his car after dropping her off.\n\nThe reality star took to Instagram on Feb. 17 after visiting her at the treatment facility and shared his love and support in the caption alongside a sweet snapshot of himself and his wife.\n\n\"Seeing this gorgeous woman & all the work she has done has given me such hope, a feeling of peace, and unconditional love that is hard to explain with words,\" he captioned it. \"It was a very emotionally intense Family Week Program, but I know that our love & commitment towards each other will persevere through anything this life throws our way.\"\n\n\"I\u2019m so proud of you Babe & I can\u2019t wait until you finally come home so I can just hug you & hold you for as long as I want,\" he added. \"You are worthy...You are strong...You are beautiful...You are loved! Thank you for not giving up on your life.\"\n\nA post shared by Tyler Baltierra (@tylerbaltierramtv) on Feb 16, 2018 at 4:07pm PST\n\nOn Monday, after the episode, Baltierra took to Twitter to share some words of support and strength for other families dealing with similar tragedy.\n\n\"That baby may have not been fully grown in the womb...but it was fully grown in our hearts,\" he wrote. \"For every parent out there who has lost a baby...it is not your fault & it is more than acceptable & understandable to mourn the loss of that baby & take your time to grieve #ParentStrong.\"\n\nThat baby may have not been fully grown in the womb...but it was fully grown in our hearts.
