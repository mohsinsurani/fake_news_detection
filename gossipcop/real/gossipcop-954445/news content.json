The couple, who just recently celebrated two years of marriage, are expecting to welcome their first child together in 2021, People reports.\n\nThe model has kept her relationship with Kushner fairly private since the pair began dating almost a decade ago. While most people are aware of Kushner's famous White House connection, Kloss's husband is still a bit of an enigma. Here's what to know about Joshua Kushner.\n\n\n\nHis brother is Jared Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband\u2014but he doesn't share their politics.\n\nDespite keeping a relatively low profile himself, Joshua's older brother, Jared, has been making a name for himself in the Trump administration as a senior advisor. However, Joshua doesn't share Jared's political views.\n\n\"It is no secret that liberal values have guided my life and that I have supported political leaders that share similar values,\" the 33-year-old revealed in a 2017 Forbes interview. \"But neither political party has a monopoly on the truth or on constructive ideas for our country. It's important to be open minded and learn from differing opinions.\"\n\nForbes also reported that the Democrat did not vote for Trump in the 2016 election. According to The Daily Mail, \"Josh and Jared\u2019s parents were Democratic donors until 2016.\"\n\nIt seems as though Joshua shares his wife's political views\u2014Kloss was vocal about voting for Hillary Clinton. She regularly gets involved in political campaigns, with Joshua supporting her at political marches including March for Our Lives in 2018.\n\nHe married Kloss in 2018.\n\nThe couple tied the knot on October 18, 2018 in a small, Jewish ceremony in Upstate New York with fewer than 80 guests, according to People. Kloss wore a custom Dior gown.\n\nIn June 2019, they had a second, Western-themed wedding ceremony in Wyoming. Famous friends like Katy Perry, Mila Kunis, and more were in attendance.\n\nHe started dating Kloss in 2012.\n\nAccording to Bustle, Kloss and Kushner first met in June 8, 2012, with the model revealing on the same date in 2016, \"Four years ago today I met my best friend. I love you more everyday.\"\n\nRumors about their relationship initially started when Kushner attended a Victoria's Secret Fashion Show afterparty in November 2012, with Us Weekly reporting via a source that, \"They are really cute together. [Kushner] seemed nervous and shy around everyone but handled it well. Karlie is stunning and the sweetest girl ever. She stuck close to him.\"\n\nOf keeping her relationship private, Kloss told in April 2018, \"I know in my life what really matters to me. I'm not trying to hide that from the world; I just really like having a more private, private life. I've got nothing to hide, though!\"\n\nThe couple recently made a rare public appearance together at the 2018 Met Gala.\n\nThe Kushner family's net worth is estimated at $1.8 billion.\n\nForbes estimated in 2016 that the Kushners were worth $1.8 billion, with their main sources of income being real estate ($1.15 billion) and venture capital investments ($420 million). $240 million of that share comes from Oscar, a millennial-focused health insurance company Josh founded in 2012. However, CNBC reported in March that the start-up is now valued at $3.2 billion.\n\nAccording to Celebrity Net Worth, Josh Kushner's net worth is $800 million, although the accuracy of that exact figure is unclear.\n\nKloss's new husband also co-founded investment firm Thrive Capital, which has ties to Instagram. He's also a graduate of Harvard Business School.\n\nOf his business ventures, Kushner told Ariana Huffington in 2015, \"It's incredibly difficult to build a business... I think it's important to kind of ignore when people say good things about you especially in this industry... Just be incredibly focused.\"\n\nKloss converted to Judaism for Kushner.\n\nA source revealed to People that in June 2018, Kloss converted to Judaism, a step which Ivanka Trump also took before marrying Jared.\n\nHe's not into fashion.\n\nWay back in March 2013, Kloss told People that she was ecstatic that Kushner wasn't a part of the fashion world. She described her then-boyfriend as, \u201cso not in fashion. It\u2019s really refreshing to leave all the fashion shows and shoots and chaos totally behind.\u201d From the start of their relationship, it sounds like Kloss has been enjoying the quiet life with her new beau.\n\nKushner proposed in upstate New York.\n\nKushner proposed in the summer of 2018 in upstate New York. As insider told People, \"They\u2019re both overjoyed and happily celebrating. Their hearts are full and they\u2019re excited to build their future together.\"\n\nBoth Karlie and Joshua revealed the news on their respective Instagram accounts in July 2018. Karlie wrote, \"I love you more than I have words to express. Josh, you\u2019re my best friend and my soulmate. I can\u2019t wait for forever together. Yes a million times over \ud83d\udc8d,\" while Joshua simply captioned his photo, \"fianc\u00e9e \u2764\ufe0f.\" Karlie also shared photos of the ring on her Instagram Stories.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2478974-012-1665067784.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joshua-kushner-and-karlie-kloss-attend-2020-state-farm-all-news-photo-1604011341.?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0.0159xh&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joshua-kushner-and-karlie-kloss-attend-2020-state-farm-all-news-photo-1604011341.?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0588xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image003-1665237979.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0674xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665155826.jpg?crop=0.984xw:1.00xh;0.00962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2479931-003-1665162992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0192xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665151779.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-arriving-for-lunch-at-the-abbey-of-san-news-photo-1665070515.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0551xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-and-gisele-b-c3-bcndchen-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1664907170.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-del-castillo-teresa-mendoza-lrds3-tlmd-2-1664910940.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0566xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/joshua-kushner-and-karlie-kloss-attend-2020-state-farm-all-news-photo-1604011341.?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0588xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22545116/who-is-joshua-kushner-karlie-kloss-fiance/", "title": "Karlie Kloss' Husband Josh Kushner Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Who Is Joshua Kushner? - Karlie Kloss' Husband Josh Kushner Net Worth", "description": "Most people are aware of Josh Kushner's famous brother, Jared, but Karlie Kloss' husband\u200b is still a bit of an enigma.
