The rest of the magazine includes interviews with Chelsea Handler, James Corden and a piece by Hefner's son, Cooper.\n\nHefner will also be honored in a forthcoming 100-plus page special tribute.\n\nPlayboy\n\nRELATED: Jared Leto to Play Hugh Hefner in Upcoming Biopic\n\nThe magazine mogul died peacefully at his home at the age of 91, and was laid to rest in a private ceremony attended by his wife, Crystal, and children at Los Angeles' Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery earlier this month.\n\nIn 1992, Hefner purchased the crypt next to Marilyn Monroe for $75,000.
