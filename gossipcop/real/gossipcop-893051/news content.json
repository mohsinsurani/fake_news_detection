At the time, I said to myself that what I did was O.K. because I never showed a woman my dick without asking first, which is also true. But what I learned later in life, too late, is that when you have power over another person, asking them to look at your dick isn\u2019t a question. It\u2019s a predicament for them. The power I had over these women is that they admired me. And I wielded that power irresponsibly. I have been remorseful of my actions. And I\u2019ve tried to learn from them. And run from them. Now I\u2019m aware of the extent of the impact of my actions. I learned yesterday the extent to which I left these women who admired me feeling badly about themselves and cautious around other men who would never have put them in that position. I also took advantage of the fact that I was widely admired in my and their community, which disabled them from sharing their story and brought hardship to them when they tried because people who look up to me didn\u2019t want to hear it. I didn\u2019t think that I was doing any of that because my position allowed me not to think about it. There is nothing about this that I forgive myself for. And I have to reconcile it with who I am. Which is nothing compared to the task I left them with. I wish I had reacted to their admiration of me by being a good example to them as a man and given them some guidance as a comedian, including because I admired their work.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/10comedy-alpha/10comedy-alpha-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/arts/10louisck-reacts2/10louisck-reacts2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9b1cd1b0c921666daea9cdf21c1a144b0c7bedb418c58e06e03fd68a1bc69b4d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/arts/10louisck-reacts2/merlin_120190808_9e8ae8ee-9830-4c5d-981d-2726b2dcfe7f-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/arts/10louisck-reacts2/10louisck-reacts2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=9b1cd1b0c921666daea9cdf21c1a144b0c7bedb418c58e06e03fd68a1bc69b4d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/10/arts/television/louis-ck-statement.html", "title": "Louis C.K.
