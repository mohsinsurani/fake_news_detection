Johansson was one of the first actresses to wear the high-fashion label to a major red carpet event since news of Weinstein\u2019s sexual misconduct scandal broke last fall.\n\nAndVogue editor-in-chief Anna Wintour, who has long hosted the Costume Institute\u2019s benefit at New York City\u2019s Metropolitan Museum of Art, fully supported Johansson\u2019s decision.\n\n\u201cI totally agree with that,\u201d Wintour said during a visit to The Late Show with Stephen Colbert. \u201cGeorgina is a brilliant designer and I don\u2019t think she should be blamed for her husband\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cI think it was a great gesture of support on Scarlett\u2019s part to wear a dress like that, a beautiful dress like that, on such a public occasion,\u201d she added.\n\nLooking for more style content?

She attended the annual event alongside her newly-confirmed boyfriend and SNL star Colin Jost.\n\nAndrew H. Walker/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOn Tuesday, Johansson stood by her choice to wear a Marchesa gown.\n\n\u201cI wore Marchesa because their clothes make women feel confident and beautiful and it is my pleasure to support a brand created by two incredibly talented and important female designers,\u201d Johansson said in a statement to PEOPLE, who selected a romantic off-the-shoulder burgundy gown featuring a tulle skirt embellished with floral appliqu\u00e9s.\n\nMarchesa echoed a similar sentiment in the following statement to PEOPLE: \u201cWe are truly honored that Scarlett chose to wear Marchesa for the Met Gala. She is an amazingly talented actor who has incredible style and presence. It was wonderful to work so closely with her in creating this custom look.\u201d\n\nHarvey Weinstein and Georgina Chapman. Gisela Schober/Getty\n\nSince the news about Weinstein broke, Marchesa\u2019s fate as one of Hollywood\u2019s go-to labels has been questioned by some in the industry.\n\nFemale stars of Weinstein\u2019s films often wore Marchesa designs on the red carpet, and Chapman and Weinstein\u2019s businesses were often linked. A few stars, including Jessica Chastain, claimed that Weinstein would pressure them to wear his wife\u2019s designs. In Chastain\u2019s case, she said he mocked her when she didn\u2019t do so.\n\n\u201cThey absolutely had a push from Harvey,\u201d writer Neil Gaiman, a friend of Chapman\u2019s, told Vogue in an interview published Thursday. \u201cBut you cannot hype something from nothing and make it last. And Harvey\u2019s hyping worked because George is actually an artist. I\u2019ve watched her at work and been impressed and fascinated. She has a vision, and she\u2019s really good at it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Georgina Chapman, Harvey Weinstein Prenup Revealed: She Could Get Nearly $12 Million in Divorce\n\nAfter Weinstein and Chapman agreed to a divorce settlement in January (they haven\u2019t yet publicly filed for divorce), Marchesa canceled its runway show at New York Fashion Week.\n\nThey also didn\u2019t offer any dresses to celebrities for awards season \u2014 something Chapman told Vogue was her decision alone. \u201cWe didn\u2019t feel it was appropriate given the situation,\u201d she said. \u201cAll the women who have been hurt deserve dignity and respect, so I want to give it the time it deserves. It\u2019s a time for mourning, really.\u201d\n\nThe brand, however, is continuing its business. Chapman and co-founder Keren Craig even recently released a lookbook of pre-fall 2018 designs and announced it would be debuting a Fall 2018 line in a new format.", "images":
