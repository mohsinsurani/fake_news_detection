From 2005 to 2008, Spears played Zoey Brooks on the Nickelodeon teen sitcom Zoey 101 (2005\u20132008). She is the younger sister of singer Britney Spears.\n\nBeginning in December 2007, Spears was subject to significant media attention and controversy after announcing her pregnancy at age 16. A misconception emerged that this canceled Zoey 101. The final season wrapped filming in August 2007, but would not premiere until the following year. After giving birth in 2008, she stopped acting and making albums for five years.[2]\n\nSpears returned from her hiatus in 2013 and released her debut single \"How Could I Want More\" from her debut EP in country music, The Journey (2014). In 2015, Spears earned songwriting credits for Jana Kramer's certified Platinum single, \"I Got the Boy\", a song she wrote in 2011 during writing sessions in Nashville for her 2013 EP.[3] In 2016, Spears released a documentary Jamie Lynn Spears: When the Lights Go Out, reflecting on the controversy of her pregnancy, showcasing her country music career after \"realizing [her] true calling was music\" as well as her personal life as a wife and mother.[4] Despite this, Spears has not released a debut album. In 2019, it was announced Spears would instead return to acting and portray Noreen Fitzgibbons in the Netflix romantic drama series Sweet Magnolias (2020\u2013present).\n\nEarly life [ edit ]\n\nSpears was born in McComb, Mississippi,[5] and raised in Kentwood, Louisiana,[1] to James and Lynne Spears. Her older siblings are Bryan and Britney.[6] She attended Parklane Academy in McComb, where she was a cheerleader, and point guard of the basketball team.[7] Spears studied with tutors while filming Zoey 101 in Los Angeles.[8] She finished her education via online correspondence[9] and received her GED in February 2008 through Tangipahoa Parish School System Adult Education Center.[10]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n2002\u20132008: Career beginnings and success with Zoey 101 [ edit ]\n\nIn February 2002, Spears made her acting debut in the Paramount Pictures drama film Crossroads which starred her sister, who portrayed the central character Lucy Wagner. Spears made a cameo, playing the younger version of Britney's character.[11] Following Crossroads, Nickelodeon cast Spears as a regular performer in the eighth season of the sketch comedy series All That.[12] The season followed a two-year hiatus of the series. Spears portrayed various roles through the two seasons she appeared in as well as herself.[13] Spears's performance received positive reviews from critics with many complimenting her comedic timing and being a highlight of the show. Spears did not return for the series' tenth and final season to pursue other roles on the network. Spears made a guest appearance at Stars, Stripes and Skates skating gala at Madison Square Garden in September 2002.[citation needed]\n\nIn August 2004, Spears signed a development deal with Nickelodeon in which she would star as the protagonist in her own scripted television series that would air on the network. The series went on to be titled Zoey 101 and Spears portrayed the role of Zoey Brooks. The series centered on Zoey and her friends who attend a fictional boarding school, Pacific Coast Academy (PCA). Spears recorded the series theme song, titled \"Follow Me\", which was written by her sister Britney Spears. Filmed at Pepperdine University in Malibu, California, the series premiered on January 9, 2005, the network's highest-rated series premiere in over eight years. Spears won a Young Artist Award and a Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her performance.[14] Nickelodeon announced the fourth season would be the series' last season. The series finale, \"PCA Confidential\", aired on May 2, 2008. Nickelodeon issued a statement shortly after the announcement of Spears being pregnant at the age of 16, stating that the network respected Spears's decision to take responsibility and noting that its primary concern was for her well-being.[15][16]\n\nIn December 2007, Variety announced that Spears had signed on to guest-appear in the ABC comedy sitcom series Miss Guided, in which she played the role of the promiscuous high-school student Mandy Fener in the episode \"Hot Sub\" which aired on March 20, 2008. That same year, Spears voiced Goldilocks in the direct-to-DVD animation film Unstable Fables: Goldilocks & 3 Bears Show.

She was later airlifted to Children's Hospital of New Orleans, where she remained unconscious in a coma for two days. She woke up and was released from care on February 10.[30] Police reported the incident as occurring before 3:00 p.m. on a Sunday afternoon, and the sheriff explained that she was steering \"100 yards from her parents\" when she took \"a hard right to avoid running over a nearby drainage ditch\". The police report stated, \"In doing so, she overcorrected causing the ATV to enter the pond. The ATV and child were instantly submerged in the water right before their eyes. Within seconds the child's mother, stepfather and other family members reached the pond, dove in and attempted to rescue the child to no avail. The child was trapped and secured by the seatbelt and the ATV's safety netting. Within two minutes, Acadian Ambulance Services arrived and assisted in freeing the child from the cold waters.\"[31]\n\nDouble Dare in 2018 Spears and her daughter Maddie on the game showin 2018\n\nIn 2020, Spears explained the situation further.

The firefighter was able to get a pulse, but her case looked \"grim at the time\", leading to her being airlifted to the hospital. In a statement sharing private photographs of her daughter at the hospital, Spears said:\n\n\"It started like most Sundays, going to church, visiting family, to suddenly trying to save my daughter's life, to them taking her away, to us believing we had lost her forever, and it literally felt like the world stood still around me,\" she wrote. \"I have never spoken fully in detail about that day, and the events that followed, but what I will share is that God blessed us with a true miracle. Maddie not only stayed here with us, but she made a full recovery.\"[32]\n\nIn an episode that aired on July 13, 2018, Spears returned to Nickelodeon for the first time in over ten years as a contestant on the revived game show Double Dare with her daughter Maddie, competing against fellow All That alumnus Josh Server and his niece.[33] She and Maddie won over $15,000 to donate to the New Orleans hospital that treated Maddie following a near-fatal ATV accident in 2017.[34]\n\n2019\u2013present: Return to television acting and autobiography [ edit ]\n\nIn July 2019, Netflix announced that Spears has been cast as a series regular in the upcoming romance drama series Sweet Magnolias, which is based on the novel series by Sherryl Woods.[35][36] She played young woman called Noreen Fitzgibbons, who works as a nurse and wants to build a new life after making bad choices.[37] In November 2019, Teen Vogue reported that Spears has joined the cast of a new Nickelodeon television series, which is uniting two of the channel's most iconic shows from the past: All That and Zoey 101.[38][39] In July 2020, the cast of Zoey 101 reunited in an episode of the eleventh season of All That.[40] Spears played herself and her old All That character Thelma Stump.[41] While working on a Zoey 101 reboot, Spears and Chantel Jeffries recorded a new version of the show's theme song \"Follow Me\".[13][42] The music video for the song featured appearances by JoJo Siwa, Dixie D'Amelio, Gigi Gorgeous, Eva Gutowski, Loren Gray, Lynne Spears and Spears' elder daughter Maddie.[43][44][45]\n\nIn July 2021, Worthy Publishing, an imprint of Hachette Book Group announced her plans to release a memoir, releasing a statement saying: \"Jamie Lynn's book has been in development over the past 12 months and will allow the world to hear her inspiring story in her own words, for the first time.\"[46][47] A portion of the book sales was planned to go to mental health organization This Is My Brave.[48] On October 19, 2021, the organization stated that they would decline the offer due to the negative reaction from the general public.[49] Her memoir entitled Things I Should Have Said was released on January 18, 2022.[50][51][52] Rolling Stone recommended the book but highlighted that Jamie Lynn ostensibly used her sister Britney Spears' highly-publicized struggles and conservatorship to promote her new book.[53]\n\nPublic image [ edit ]\n\nSpears has been featured in several fashion blogs and magazines such as Nylon,[13] Seventeen, Teen Vogue, CosmoGirl, Teen People, Teen, Girls' Life, Mizz and Nickelodeon Magazine.[54][55] Spears has appeared in commercials and print ads throughout her career.
