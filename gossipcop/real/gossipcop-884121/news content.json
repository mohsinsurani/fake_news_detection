Simpson is beginning post-prison life in the city where he committed the crime that saw him locked up.\n\nAfter serving nine years for a Las Vegas kidnapping and armed robbery, he left prison early Sunday to start a new chapter as a parolee.\n\nSimpson\u2019s parole plan was agreed upon at Lovelock Correctional Center prior to his release, Nevada\u2019s Division of Parole and Probation said.\n\n\u201cMr. Simpson submitted a parole release plan for a residence in Las Vegas, Nevada. The plan was investigated and approved by the Division of Parole and Probation,\u201d it said.\n\nThe center did not provide more specifics of Simpson\u2019s release plan, saying it was up to Simpson, his family and his attorney as to whether they wanted such information shared.\n\nHowever, now that the former NFL star is out of prison, those who know him are not expecting him to become a recluse.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s not going to hide,\u201d said longtime friend Tom Scotto, who attended Simpson\u2019s parole hearing this summer.\n\nSeveral associates told CNN Simpson would be living in a gated residence with unspecified friends in a wealthy Las Vegas suburb, and planned to move to Florida later on.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to focus on kids, friends, his family and golf,\u201d Scotto said. \u201cMaybe not the first day or second, but he is going to go out.\u201d\n\nTwo of Simpson\u2019s children live in the Tampa Bay area in Florida, one lives in Los Angeles and another in Georgia.\n\nSimpson was picked up by a friend shortly after midnight local time Sunday, according to Brooke Keast, a spokeswoman for the Nevada Department of Corrections.\n\n\u2018Don\u2019t come back\u2019\n\n\u201cI told him, \u2018Don\u2019t come back,\u2019 and he responded, \u2018I don\u2019t intend to,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cHe was upbeat, personable and seemed happy to get on with his life.\u201d\n\nUnlike previous instances, where controversy followed wherever he went, Simpson was released in the middle of the night to avoid media attention.\n\n\u201cOur biggest concern was our safety and the public\u2019s safety and not wanting anybody, paparazzi, to follow him,\u201d Keast said. \u201cHe left through a big blue door through the front gatehouse and exited quietly. He looked down because he didn\u2019t want to be photographed.\u201d\n\nRead: From football star to prisoner\n\nMeeting with parole officer\n\nBefore his release, prison officials did an inventory of what he wanted to take with him or leave behind. He walked out of prison with paperwork and \u201cthree or four boxes about the size of a microwave,\u201d according to Keast.\n\nInside the boxes were items such as a hot plate, clothing and shower shoes, she said.\n\nSimpson also met with one person who\u2019ll become a fixture in his post-prison life: his parole officer.\n\n\u201cThey went over what he needs for parole and where he needs to check in, what he should do to get a driver\u2019s license, et cetera, (and) instructions on what to do once he\u2019s out there,\u201d Keast said.\n\nThe Nevada Board of Parole Commissioners voted unanimously in July to release Simpson after he served nine years of a 33-year sentence for armed robbery and kidnapping.\n\nDuring that robbery in 2007, he was part of a group that raided a hotel and casino to steal sports memorabilia at gunpoint. Simpson, a former player for the Buffalo Bills, said the items belonged to him.\n\nNo drugs, no alcohol\n\nAs a parolee, Simpson will have to meet a number of conditions set by the Nevada parole board.\n\nWhile out of prison, he won\u2019t have the liberty to consume alcohol in large quantities or hang out with ex-convicts. The Nevada parole board forbids parolees from associating with convicted felons and people who engage in criminal activity, or possessing guns and drugs. Alcohol abuse can get a parolee hauled back to prison.\n\n\u201cYou are permitt ed to consume alcoholic beverages but not in excess,\u201d the conditions of parole supervision read. \u201cYou shall submit to a medically recognized test for blood/breath content. Test results of .08 alcohol or higher shall be sufficient proof of excess.\u201d\n\nSimpson received a bad score on his parole risk assessment guideline in the drug/alcohol abuse category, with the document citing him for \u201cfrequent abuse, serious disruption of functioning.\u201d\n\nHe testified that he had been drinking alcohol the day of the raid on memorabilia dealers that led to his arrest and conviction.\n\nO.J. Simpson reacts after learning he was granted parole at Lovelock Correctional Center on Thursday, July 20, in Lovelock, Nevada. Simpson is serving a nine-to-33-year prison term for a 2007 armed robbery and kidnapping conviction.

His 2008 conviction came 13 years after his acquittal on murder charges in the deaths of ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and Ronald Goldman. Julie Jacobson /Getty Images Prev Next\n\nState of Florida \u2018objects\u2019\n\nFlorida Attorney General Pam Bondi wrote a letter to Florida\u2019s Department of Corrections on Friday saying she did not want Simpson to move to her state and asking them to \u201cnotify all appropriate authorities of the State of Nevada that the State of Florida objects to the granting of such permission.\u201d\n\nBut Simpson lawyer Malcolm LaVergne lambasted Bondi over the letter, accusing her of exploiting the issue to score political points ahead of elections.\n\n\u201cOne hundred percent Mr. Simpson will be able to move to Florida,\u201d he said Sunday. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t have jurisdiction over his move.\u201d\n\nBut Shawn Arruti, spokesman for Nevada Parole and Probation, said it\u2019s not a sure thing.\n\n\u201cInterstate compact is not a guaranteed thing,\u201d he said after Simpson\u2019s parole hearing in July, referring to an agreement between two states. \u201cInterstate compact is a privilege, but it\u2019s a privilege based on meeting certain criteria. And Florida, when they do their investigation, they\u2019ll make the determination of whether or not they\u2019re going to be willing to accept his case. \u201c\n\nFrom NFL star to murder suspect\n\nSimpson spent a lifetime in the limelight \u2013 first for his athletic prowess, charm and good looks, then as a murder suspect in the 1994 killing of his ex-wife, Nicole Brown Simpson, and her friend, Ron Goldman.\n\nHis murder trial in Los Angeles was dubbed \u201cthe trial of the century\u201d and sparked years of debate over race and justice.\n\nSimpson pleaded \u201c100% not guilty\u201d and assembled a team of famous local and national lawyers. He was eventually acquitted in 1995, but many questioned whether he got away with murder.\n\nThe victims\u2019 families filed a suit for wrongful death. Two years after his acquittal, he was ordered to pay $33.5 million in damages.", "images":
