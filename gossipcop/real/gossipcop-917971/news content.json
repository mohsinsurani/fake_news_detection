Oscars 2017: 10 things you need to know, from the epic mix-up to Viola Davis\u2019s speech A few hours after Faye Dunaway and Warren Beatty announced \u201cLa La Land\u201d as best picture at the Academy Awards (when the trophy actually belonged to \u201cMoonlight\u201d), PricewaterhouseCoopers, the longtime accounting firm in charge of the Oscar ballots, took responsibility and released an apology statement. Dunaway and Beatty were apparently given the envelope and card for the best actress category, which read \u201cEmma Stone, \u2018La La Land.\u2019 \u201d Thus, the confusion.\n\nWatch the crazy ending of the Oscars (Video: Clip Courtesy A.M.P.A.S.\u00a9 2017)\n\n\u201cThe presenters had mistakenly been given the wrong category envelope and when discovered, was immediately corrected,\u201d the statement read in part. \u201cWe are currently investigating how this could have happened, and deeply regret that this occurred.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOkay. Sure. But social media had other ideas: What if it wasn\u2019t just a simple mix-up? On ABC\u2019s official Oscars \u201cAfter Party\u201d special, before there was more information, host Anthony Anderson also seemed convinced it was all a conspiracy. Here are some of the theories floated in the early hours of Monday morning:\n\n1. This was an especially mean prank from Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nThe late-night host is famous for his practical jokes, from his YouTube hoaxes (the twerking girl on fire, the wolf at the Sochi Olympics); to urging parents to pretend they ate their kids\u2019 Halloween candy; to his holiday prank war with his neighbors, John Krasinski and Emily Blunt. So \u2026 couldn\u2019t this just be a way to make his Oscars gig really, really memorable?\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Leqsee/status/836100391314075649\n\n@jimmykimmel that was a really mean prank - to both La La Land and Moonlight. \u2014 Charlie Roxbee (@CharlieRoxbee) February 27, 2017\n\nthis was kimmel's best prank tbh \u2014 Lana Berry (@Lana) February 27, 2017\n\n2. It\u2019s all Leonardo DiCaprio\u2019s fault.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSome eagle-eyed viewers noticed that Leonardo DiCaprio, who announced best actress, didn\u2019t give Stone her card when she won. Uh oh \u2014 could he be responsible?\n\nLater, Stone said she was in possession of the card; which is actually plausible, as there are two cards printed for each category. Either way, time for some suspicions about DiCaprio\u2019s role in this madness.\n\nLEO CARRIED THAT CARD OFFSTAGE PUT IT DOWN WHEN HE SAW WARREN AND WARREN PICKED IT UP\n\nHey, maybe Leonardo DiCaprio laid the Best Actress card on top of the Best Picture card while walking off stage? It's his fault. #Moonlight \u2014 MoonBlossom (@MoZone) February 27, 2017\n\n3. This was a prank from Matt Damon on Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nThroughout the entire ceremony, Kimmel mercilessly teased Damon, extending their years-long \u201cfeud.\u201d Toward the end of the show, the announcer referred to Damon as Ben Affleck\u2019s \u201cguest\u201d when they presented an award, and music played over Damon when he started talking. So it looked like Kimmel got the last laugh \u2026 or did he?\n\nTheory: Did Matt Damon prank Jimmy Kimmel by giving the wrong envelope to Beatty? Bwahahaha! #Oscars2017 #MerylSaysHi @moonlightmov pic.twitter.com/XeibuVaW1g \u2014 Julie Salek (@tampajulie) February 27, 2017\n\n95% sure this was a revenge prank by Matt Damon to finally get @jimmykimmel back \u2014 The Gregory Brothers (@gregorybrothers) February 27, 2017\n\n4. The universe.\n\nUltra-dramatic, stunning upset victories and twists for the election, World Series, Super Bowl and now this?
