Paltrow is in New York for a health and wellness fair, and Colbert brought on Paltrow for a \"sneak peak\" at the Goop-Covetton House \"exclusive line of aspirational, medically adjacent product-portunities\" that won't be unveiled at the fair.\n\nPaltrow was a good sport, and a partner in her own mockery. When Colbert said he was thankful about their partnership, she replied, \"Yeah, but we're not partnering \u2014 we prefer the term 'conscious coupling.'\" When Colbert asked if he could try her concoction of matcha, chia seeds, and \"tears shed by butterflies during Oprah's Golden Globes speech,\" she asked: \"Are you mortal?\" \"I think so,\" he said. \"It's not safe for you,\" she replied. Things got a little strange at the end, but for the uncharacteristically small price of a little free event publicity you can watch Paltrow's conscious self-ridicule below.
