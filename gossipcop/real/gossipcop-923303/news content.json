Speaking to a counselor in a joint therapy session, Catelynn expressed her fears that Tyler might leave her for another girl. \"We\u2019re at totally different stages in our life,\u201d she said. \"There\u2019s like so many different women. I\u2019m totally not Tyler\u2019s type at all. I guess that\u2019s what freaks me out. I\u2019m not good enough for him. I\u2019m not tiny. I guess I always wish I could be better. I feel like I have to change in order to keep him around.\"\n\n05 of 20 WELCOMING NOVALEE REIGN Tyler Baltierra/Instagram In 2015, Catelynn and Tyler welcomed their second daughter, Novalee Reign. Catelynn struggled with postpartum depression and entered a treatment facility in Arizona in March 2016. \u201cI\u2019m seeking help for myself and my family,\u201d she told MTV News.\n\n06 of 20 MARRYING HER SOULMATE MTV After almost 10 years together (they started dating in middle school!), Tyler and Catelynn finally tied the knot in an intimate ceremony with family and friends in August 2015, a few months after the birth of Nova.

The duo hadn\u2019t seen Carly in about a year and struggled with the lack of recent contact with Carly's parents. \"They need to just let me know, are\u2026 are we done having visits forever?\" Catelynn asked, breaking down. \"Until she\u2019s 18 I\u2019ll hear nothing from her?

Catelynn told PEOPLE seeing the two meet helped manage her anxiety. \"We went to the beach so we were feeding ducks with bread,\" Catelynn said of the easygoing afternoon. \"Carly just wanted to hold Nova immediately and be like, 'Can I feed her? Can I hold her?' \"\n\n09 of 20 LASTING RELATIONSHIP WOES MTV In season six, Catelynn was forced to face her fears that Tyler would leave her for another woman, which he addressed during a getaway to Jackson Hole Mountain Resort. \"Do you wholeheartedly in your soul believe that I\u2019m not going to leave you?\" Tyler asked her.

She considered taking out her IUD but said her fear might be too great. \u201cIt\u2019s a daily fight in my mind to not be afraid of postpartum [depression],\u201d she told Tyler, adding, \u201cI can\u2019t let my mind stop me from one of the most amazing things ever.\u201d\n\n13 of 20 BREAKING DOWN OVER CARLY MTV The couple\u2019s concerns about being kept away from Carly mounted in season 7. Catelynn broke down while the two were talking to Dawn after they had made plans to meet Carly\u2019s adoptive parents. \u201cI try not to make it difficult,\u201d she said, tearing up. \"I\u2019m willing and trying and offering. And then I get ignored for months and I try. I feel like I get punished because my kid asks questions about me, or she wants to know where she comes from. What [did they] think adoption is? She\u2019s going to do that.\"\n\n14 of 20 REUNITING WITH CARLY MTV Catelynn and Tyler were finally reunited with Carly during an episode of the MTV show. While cameras were not allowed to film the visit, the duo passed on touching photos of the kids\u2019 day in the park. After the meeting, Tyler said Catelynn grew emotional. \"She was saying after raising Nova, she\u2019s actually feeling that love you have for your kid, and after seeing [Carly and Nova] together she said it was really hard [to leave Carly],\" he said.\n\n15 of 20 TYLER ENCOURAGES HIS DAD TO SEEK HELP Tyler worried about his father Butch\u2019s health during an episode in early January. Speaking to Catelynn, he wondered if Butch should enter rehab once again. Admitting that he was \u201calways going to feel angry\u201d about his father\u2019s substance abuse issues, Tyler set out to convince his father to seek treatment again. Butch seemed receptive, saying, \u201cYeah, yeah, I\u2019m ready. I can\u2019t be doing what I\u2019ve been doing. I slow down a lot.\u201d\n\n16 of 20 CATELYNN RETURNS TO REHAB FOR A THIRD TIME MTV Catelynn revealed she was headed back to rehab in mid-January, tweeting, \u201cWell they say third times a charm\u2026 I\u2019m going back to treatment people for 6 weeks to work on my trauma and getting on different meds.

I made it to my therapist appointment,\" Tyler said in the video. \"Putting in a little self care today, know what I mean? Sometimes you have to put yourself ahead of some other people sometimes in life. Doesn\u2019t mean you don\u2019t love \u2019em or care about \u2019em. It just means you love \u2019em enough to put yourself first so you can be the best \u2018you\u2019 you can be.\"\n\n18 of 20 ANOTHER BABY ON THE WAY Jeff Kravitz/FilmMagic The Teen Mom OG stars confirmed they were expecting on the Jan. 29, 2018, episode of the show. Catelynn decided to surprise Tyler by having daughter Nova wear a pink T-shirt that read, \u201cI\u2019m Going to Be a Big Sister.\u201d\n\n19 of 20 LOSING THEIR BABY MTV Sadly, on the Feb. 26 episode, the couple revealed Catelynn had suffered a miscarriage. \u201cIt\u2019s very traumatic. When you see her shaking and she\u2019s got blood everywhere, it\u2019s like \u2026 you don\u2019t really know what to do,\" Tyler said. Catelynn confessed to experiencing suidical thoughts. \u201cIf they weren\u2019t around I probably would\u2019ve offed myself. Seriously. I\u2019m sure a lot of people can relate,\u201d Catelynn said of her husband and daughter Nova. \u201cIt\u2019s like I don\u2019t want to live another day like this.\u201d The episode then showed her
