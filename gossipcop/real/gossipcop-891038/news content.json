If your answer is a resounding yes, you have at least one thing in common with dancer Mette Towley. Last week, N.E.R.D, the funk hip-hop band fronted by Pharrell, dropped their music video for their comeback single \"Lemon,\" featuring none other than Bad Gal RiRi. The video opens with the singer\u2014wearing a sleek fringed bob, silver chain necklace and Raf Simons' \"Nebraska\" sweatshirt\u2014wielding clippers in a hotel, giving pause with a laser-like stare into the camera before shaving off Towley's cloud of natural curls. The there's-no-turning-back-now transformation plays into the video's \"no one ever really dies\" theme (a play on the N.E.R.D acronym) by suggesting: If you want a new lease on life, radically shearing off your lengths is a fruitful first step.\n\n\"It was a once in a lifetime experience,\u201d says Towley, a member of Pharrell's dance squad since 2014. \"There weren't multiple takes. I only had one head to shave.\" Believe it or not, it wasn't the 26-year-old Minnesota native's first beauty transformation. At 15, she transitioned her hair from straightened back to its natural kinky texture. \u201cI was done spending hours trying to maintain a look that wasn\u2019t me,\" she recalls. \"It was the first time I really took ownership of my body.\" She'd go on to spend the next decade diligently nurturing her curl pattern, flexing its versatility by wearing a halo of glossy ringlets or a picked out afro. \u201cWith all the love and care I'd given my curls, I surprised myself with how ready I was for the cut,\u201d she says. \u201cAfterwards, I put my hair in a bag and took it [home] with me from set--I couldn't just throw it away!\u201d Still, the dramatic hair shift has been liberating for Towley as a performer: \u201cI\u2019ve never felt a stronger sense of femininity,\u201d she explains. \u201cI have a very womanly physique and I love the juxtaposition with the buzz cut. My body [has a] whole new silhouette.\u201d", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632e4ced682912b849a994c4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632b62a0b39ac71d5a7997e1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/633b46f7064bb2cfbe04248f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0e59c1319291916b216/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-mette-towley.gif", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0e48b86ae229b94261c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-mette-towley.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6321f91589fef3b50ae7ab65/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6330ac4383c557e45082bc4f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0c8e3243c28ba479e26/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-mette-towley.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/63307a374441545acfb1a753/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0c58b86ae229b94261a/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-image-mette-towley.gif"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0c8e3243c28ba479e26/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-mette-towley.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lauren Valenti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/mette-towley-rihanna-head-shaved-nerd-lemon-music-video", "title": "Meet Pharrell\u2019s Muse Mette Towley, the Dancer Who Let Rihanna Shave Her Head", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Pharrell\u2019s muse Mette Towley dishes on the drastic makeover she received from Rihanna in N.E.R.D\u2019s \u201cLemon\u201d video.", "id": "59f9faab50ff1c7339abc2f8", "keywords": "rihanna", "news_keywords": "rihanna", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59f9faab50ff1c7339abc2f8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Pharrell\u2019s muse Mette Towley dishes on the drastic makeover she received from Rihanna in N.E.R.D\u2019s \u201cLemon\u201d video.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0c1049f3e1509b418e6/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-image-mette-towley.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0c1049f3e1509b418e6/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-image-mette-towley.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "Pharrell\u2019s muse Mette Towley dishes on the drastic makeover she received from Rihanna in N.E.R.D\u2019s \u201cLemon\u201d video.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0c8e3243c28ba479e26/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-mette-towley.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Meet Pharrell\u2019s Muse Mette Towley, the Dancer Who Let Rihanna Shave Her Head", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/mette-towley-rihanna-head-shaved-nerd-lemon-music-video"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-11-01T19:07:47.702Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-10T00:13:00.000Z", "author": "Lauren Valenti"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Pharrell\u2019s muse Mette Towley dishes on the drastic makeover she received from Rihanna in N.E.R.D\u2019s \u201cLemon\u201d video.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a04e0c8e3243c28ba479e26/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-mette-towley.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Meet Pharrell\u2019s Muse Mette Towley, the Dancer Who Let Rihanna Shave Her Head"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509563267.702, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
