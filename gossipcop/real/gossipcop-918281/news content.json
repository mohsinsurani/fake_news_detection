WHA!?! That's crazy!\" he posted to the social media site. \"Question: Do you guys have any suggestions for what I should be doing instead of watching the show?\"\n\n[NATL] The Best of the 2018 Oscars Red Carpet\n\nCulkin then went on to poke fun at this year's nominees and, though he didn't address the allegations directly, the actor also called out several Hollywood stars involved in scandals in the past year.\n\nParis Jackson and Godfather Macaulay Culkin's Adorable Friendship\n\n\n\n\"EXCLUSIVE: I heard Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein were going to come disguised as a very tall man in a long trench coat but they got busted by security,\" he wrote, before calling out Casey Affleck.\n\n\"Casey Affleck couldn't make it cause he was stuck in the 1950s.\"\n\nCulkin then went on to mention Franco, writing, \"James Franco is a disaster. Artists? #CallMeRogen #OrGoldberg #Imnotpicky\" He added, \"The Disaster Artist was the worst harry potter movie this year.\"\n\nCasey Affleck couldn't make it cause he was stuck in the 1950s. \u2014 Macaulay Culkin (@IncredibleCulk) March 5, 2018\n\nFranco has denied sexual misconduct allegations brought forth by five women, while Weinstein has rebutted all allegations of non-consensual sex.\n\nAffleck faced sexual harassment allegations in 2010 in two public civil suits during the production of the mockumentary \"I'm Still Here.\" The suits were settled for undisclosed sums and Affleck has said that the terms of the settlement prevent him from discussing the matter.\n\nSpacey has faced numerous sexual misconduct and assault allegations, but he has remained mostly silent. In a statement to NBC News in November, Spacey's representatives said the actor would take a step back for evaluation, but did not give further details.\n\nIn addition to tweeting about Affleck and Franco, Culkin also posted a number of messages about show's host, Jimmy Kimmel.\n\nSo glad to hear @jimmyfallon is hosting the #Oscars90 ceremony! What a great guy!,\" he wrote. \"Oh THAT Jimmy is hosting! Did he ever win Ben Stein's Money? #ManShow\"\n\nCulkin continued, \"WOW. @jimmykimmel is #SoBrave for hosting the show in his native dialect. I bet Jimmy Kimmel's humor is so dry tonight it could easily be a #VaginaMonologue\"\n\nSo glad to hear @jimmyfallon is hosting the #Oscars90 ceremony! What a great guy! \u2014 Macaulay Culkin (@IncredibleCulk) March 5, 2018\n\nThe actor also sprinkled his Twitter feed with a number of \"things I'm doing instead of watching the Oscars,\" including playing the guitar, cooking ramen noodles and painting his toenails, all while wearing a formal tuxedo.", "images":
