The former race car driver proposed to the 26-year-old Virginia Beach native during the live finale on Tuesday, March 6, with yet another Neil Lane engagement ring, and we\u2019ve got exclusive details on how Lauren B.\u2019s sparkler compares to the one Luyendyk gave Becca K.\n\nFor his original proposal to Kufrin in Peru, Luyendyk met with celebrity jeweler Neil Lane to select a 4-carat ring. While we didn\u2019t see the Bachelor star meet with Lane for his second go around, we know the ring he presented to Burnham weighed in slightly smaller at 3.65 carats.\n\nAs Us Weekly previously reported, Kufrin\u2019s sparkler \u2014 which she returned to Luyendyk when he blindsided her with a breakup in January \u2014 was a platinum set diamond halo ring that featured an additional set of smaller diamonds surrounding the center stone. The band was also completely covered in diamonds.\n\nSources tell Us that Burnham\u2019s rock, meanwhile, features a cushion cut diamond accented by two baguette stones with tiny gems surrounding it on all sides. There are also micro-pave stones akin to chips laid into the band \u2014 about 170 in total \u2014 but they don\u2019t go all the way around.\n\nWhile Burnham\u2019s bling certainly looked blinding on TV, these subtle differences mean it is likely worth less than the $80,000 Kufrin\u2019s was estimated to cost.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s any less dazzling \u2014 designer Lane released a statement saying \u201cthis is one of the most intricate ring designs I have ever done for The Bachelor, which is appropriate as this is also the most intricate and intriguing finale I\u2019ve ever been involved with. But I believe in doing whatever it takes to find love.\u201d\n\nBoth beautiful in their own right, here\u2019s hoping Burnham\u2019s ring gets a bit more use than Kufrin\u2019s did!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lauren-b-and-arie-engagement-ring.jpg?crop=142px%2C13px%2C1325px%2C695px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lauren-b-becca-bachelor-finale.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lauren-b-and-arie-engagement-ring.jpg?crop=142px%2C13px%2C1325px%2C695px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meg Storm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/becca-kufrin-vs-lauren-burnhams-arie-luyendyk-jr-bachelor-rings/", "title": "Becca Kufrin vs. Lauren Burnham\u2019s Arie Luyendyk Jr. Bachelor Rings", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "bachelor engagements,Celebrity Engagement Rings", "post-cats": "Stylish", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The scoop on how Lauren Burnham\u2019s ring from Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. compares to the one he gave Becca Kufrin \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Becca and Lauren\u2019s \u2018Bachelor' Engagement Rings Stack Up", "description": "The scoop on how Lauren Burnham\u2019s ring from Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. compares to the one he gave Becca Kufrin \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/becca-kufrin-vs-lauren-burnhams-arie-luyendyk-jr-bachelor-rings/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-07T23:09:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lauren-b-and-arie-engagement-ring.jpg?crop=142px%2C13px%2C1325px%2C695px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lauren-b-and-arie-engagement-ring.jpg?crop=142px%2C13px%2C1325px%2C695px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-07T23:08:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-07T23:09:05+00:00"}, "author": "Meg Storm", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Becca and Lauren\u2019s \u2018Bachelor' Engagement Rings Stack Up", "description": "The scoop on how Lauren Burnham\u2019s ring from Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. compares to the one he gave Becca Kufrin \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/lauren-b-and-arie-engagement-ring.jpg?crop=142px%2C13px%2C1325px%2C695px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520464137.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
