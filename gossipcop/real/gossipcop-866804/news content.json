{"url": "http://time.com/4410084/kanye-kim-kardashian-taylor-famous-call/", "text": "On Sunday evening, Kim Kardashian West posted a tweet that at the time seemed harmless enough: \u201cdo u guys follow me on snap chat?\u201d she wrote. \u201cu really should ;-)\u201d\n\nIt was retweeted thousands of times, and those who heeded her call were greeted on Snapchat with footage that has, for want of a less cringeworthy term, broken the Internet. In the undated video, we see her husband Kanye West apparently on a speakerphone call with Taylor Swift, informing her that he was referencing her in his song \u201cFamous.\u201d The lyric in question: \u201cFor all my Southside n***** that know me best / I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex / Why? I made that b**** famous.\u201d\n\nSwift appears to be heard on the other end calling the shout-out \u201ctongue in cheek\u201d and saying that she \u201creally appreciate[d]\u201d West giving her a heads-up. (The call is available in its entirety here.)\n\nThe years-long feud between the Wests and Swift has been one of the great culture dramas of our age. In February, the Guardian reports, Swift\u2019s representative claimed that \u201cKanye did not call for approval\u201d about the track, and that Swift was \u201cnever made aware of the actual lyric \u2018I made that b**** famous.'\u201d\n\nAfter Kardashian West posted the video, Swift was, er, swift to speak out. \u201cWhere is the video of Kanye telling me he was going to call me \u2018that b****\u2019 in his song?\u201d she wrote in a statement she shared on Twitter. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t exist because it never happened. You don\u2019t get to control someone\u2019s emotional response to being called \u2018that b****\u2019 in front of the entire world.\u201d\n\nShe goes on to say she has been \u201cfalsely painted as a liar,\u201d describing the matter as \u201ccharacter assassination.\u201d\n\nAt the time of press, however, the court of popular opinion seemed to be ruling in the Wests\u2019 favor.
