From Rihanna\u2019s interpretation of the pope by way of Maison Margiela to Kendall Jenner\u2019s pared-back Off-White jumpsuit, all of the below piqued our attention in one way or another. As is customary each year, every Vogue-approved outfit ticks a slew of boxes, including remaining on-theme and managing a near-perfect execution of styling: think outfits that have been seriously and carefully considered before being paraded down the carpet. Whether they be extraordinary in their design, or manage to wrangle the theme with the elegance of a Met red carpet, these outfits prove the night is definitely the Oscars of fashion. Below, the Vogue team reveal their best dressed of the Met in 2018\u2014Katy Perry wings and all.\n\nKaty Perry in Versace\n\n\u201cAnyone who has to come in a convertible car because her wingspan is six-foot high gets my vote. That\u2019s an A-plus effort.\u201d \u2014Edwina McCann, editor-in-chief", "images":
