The new mom opened up to her Twitter followers about why she longed for her first child to be a boy.\n\nI wanted a boy so badly Because Mason and I are so close. I love our bond. I felt confident in having a boy but God blessed me with my precious True and now I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a boy. True has made me sweeter and more gentle. God gives you what you need. My BFF 4Life \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) July 28, 2018\n\n\u201cI wanted a boy so badly Because Mason and I are so close. I love our bond,\u201d the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star tweeted on Saturday, July 28, referring to sister Kourtney Kardashian\u2018s eldest child. \u201cI felt confident in having a boy but God blessed me with my precious True and now I wouldn\u2019t know what to do with a boy. True has made me sweeter and more gentle. God gives you what you need. My BFF 4Life.\u201d\n\nKardashian, 34, noted that True fits in well with the two cousins closest to her in age: Kim Kardashian\u2019s 6-month-old daughter, Chicago, and Kylie Jenner\u2019s 5-month-old little girl, Stormi. \u201cANDDDD she has her two cousins to be her besties,\u201d she added. \u201cWe call them the triplets it\u2019s just the cutest!! GOD IS GREAT.\u201d\n\nFans will recall Khlo\u00e9 was disappointed when she learned the sex of her unborn child during a March episode of KUWTK. \u201cI\u2019m really hoping Kylie\u2019s gonna say she\u2019s lying and that I\u2019m really having a boy,\u201d she said after her youngest sister shared the news with her.\n\nMeanwhile, she was completely honest on Saturday when a fan tweeted her to ask if her body bounced back after giving birth to True. \u201cHell no!! Lol i\u2019m still working on it. And it will come in time \u2026 I hope LOL,\u201d she quipped. \u201cBut sitting down I have a completely different stomach then I used to have LOL I really can\u2019t even talk about it.\u201d\n\nWhen put on the spot about whether she thinks about having more children, the Good American founder \u2014 who welcomed her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson in April \u2014 was equally as forthcoming: \u201cNot right now lol True is only 3 months old so give me some time lol.\u201d\n\nOver on her Instagram Story, Khlo\u00e9 enjoyed time with True, singing to her: \u201cGood morning to you / Good morning to you / Good morning, sweet True/ Good morning to you,\u201d before adding, \u201cThat\u2019s your song.\u201d The baby cooed and smiled as her mom serenaded her.\n\nbaby True \ud83d\udc97 A post shared by Kardashian Videos. (@kardashianvideos) on Jul 28, 2018 at 8:34am PDT\n\n\u201cI\u2019m such a dork. I sing this song every morning to her,\u201d the Revenge Body host elaborated on Twitter. \u201cI think she looks forward to it but maybe that\u2019s wishful thinking lol.\u201d\n\nWhile all seems well with mom and baby, the same cannot be said for Khlo\u00e9\u2019s relationship with Thompson, 27. (The NBA player was caught cheating on the reality star with multiple women while she was pregnant.) \u201cKhlo\u00e9 and Tristan are still not fully OK,\u201d a source revealed in the new issue of Us Weekly. \u201cThey act like they are when they\u2019re in front of others, but it\u2019s all a show at this point.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Khloe-Kardashian-Baby-Boy.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1495px%2C785px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Khloe-Kardashian-Baby-Boy.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1495px%2C844px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Khloe-Kardashian-Baby-Boy.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1495px%2C785px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-reveals-why-she-wanted-a-baby-boy/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Reveals Why She Wanted a Baby Boy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Khloe Kardashian had a sweet reason for wanting her first child to be a boy \u2014 read her explanation", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: Why I Wanted a Baby Boy \u2018So Badly\u2019", "description": "Khloe Kardashian had a sweet reason for wanting her first child to be a boy \u2014 read her explanation", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-reveals-why-she-wanted-a-baby-boy/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-28T18:44:38+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Khloe-Kardashian-Baby-Boy.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1495px%2C785px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Khloe-Kardashian-Baby-Boy.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1495px%2C785px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-28T18:44:38+00:00"}, "author": "Erin Crabtree", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: Why I Wanted a Baby Boy \u2018So Badly\u2019", "description": "Khloe Kardashian had a sweet reason for wanting her first child to be a boy \u2014 read her explanation", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Khloe-Kardashian-Baby-Boy.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1495px%2C785px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532803478.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
