Mandy Moore, whose character delivered a simultaneously heartfelt and humorous eulogy for her late husband underneath his favorite tree, had to grapple not only with the immense emotional weight of the material, but with a seriously distracting nearby ruckus.\n\n\u201cThe location we are shooting at was so loud,\u201d Moore said with a laugh during a phone interview with V.F. Wednesday morning. \u201cThere was so much traffic, and we were right by an airport, and so there were planes constantly landing.\u201d Understandably, it took a bit of work for Moore to get out of her head into the monologue amid so many distractions. But she knew all too well how important this moment was: as she put it, Rebecca\u2019s speech, delivered for an audience of just her and Jack\u2019s three children, was \u201ca deliberate move on her part . . . to really honor their father; it was her own way for just the four of them to really eulogize him.\u201d She wanted to honor that\u2014and, with a little helpful sound editing, she did, delivering the emotional cornerstone of a crucial episode as the series moves forward from the crushing death of its patriarch.\n\nRebecca starts her eulogy by revealing something she and Jack had never told their children: \u201cDid you know that when your father and I first got married, I wasn\u2019t sure that I ever wanted to have kids? I mean, I figured I would eventually, but . . .\u201d She trails off before jumping to a topic that doesn\u2019t seem relevant\u2014at first: \u201cHe was the worst at movies. Wasn\u2019t he? He was just the worst. I mean, as soon as a movie started, he would just figure out who would end up with who or who murdered who. Somehow he was always, always right. It was like he could see things before they happen. You know? I mean, he could see you three before you happened. Thank God he did.\u201d\n\nTo Moore, this scene was a moment of tremendous strength for Rebecca, a grieving, newly single parent to three kids who saw their father as a superhero. She reassures her sons that neither one of them needs to become the new \u201cman of the house,\u201d and insists to Kate that it\u2019s not her fault Jack decided to go back into the house for the family dog\u2014a decision that quite possibly sealed his fate.\n\n\u201cI thought it was so eloquent,\u201d Moore said, before crediting Rebecca\u2019s sit-down with the doctor who delivered her children with fortifying her spirit. Their conversation, she said, \u201creally showed her that she could be the type of parent that Jack was, and that she needed to be for these kids.\u201d The words Rebecca says to Jack\u2019s spirit under the tree\u2014\u201dWe\u2019re going to be O.K.\u201d\u2014became the mantra that helped her focus while filming.\n\nAs fans know, though Jack\u2019s death has finally been revealed, Moore\u2019s co-star Milo Ventimiglia is not going anywhere; there\u2019s plenty of Jack\u2019s story left to be told through flashbacks. Plus, Moore notes, \u201cI don\u2019t know if anything\u2019s ever really behind us or in the rearview mirror with this show, because we\u2019re consistently jumping around in time and there\u2019s lots of stuff that we shoot that I have a feeling, when it doesn\u2019t make it an episode, will be used further down the road in some other way.\u201c She can confirm that we\u2019re pretty much done with this particularly dark moment, but makes no promises that it won\u2019t be examined again in the future.\n\nOne overarching theme of the past few episodes of This Is Us has been Rebecca\u2019s quiet strength\u2014a change of pace from past plotlines in which the Pearson kids seemed to under-appreciate and undervalue their mother. Increasingly, it seems they\u2019re coming to realize just how much pain she shouldered for them\u2014which has been a welcome development for Moore.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not a mother, but just speaking from my own experience and observations, I feel like moms often are sort of relegated to that,\u201d Moore said. \u201cNot all the time, and that is sweeping generalization\u2014but I feel like moms often are underestimated. Because they do carry, in a lot of cases, so much of the heavy load in life. And I am glad that like the tide has sort of shifted in this season.\u201d And while Jack might have been a superhero on the surface, Rebecca is very much his equal: \u201cThey were such a duo and a unit,\u201d Moore said, \u201cAnd I love that she\u2019s sort of getting her due now.\u201d", "images":
