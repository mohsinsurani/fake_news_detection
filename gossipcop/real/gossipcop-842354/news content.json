Recently, stars Lauren Graham and Alexis Bledel discussed the possibility of another Netflix revival, Deadline reports.\n\nThis past November, the streaming service debuted Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life\u2014a four-part follow-up to the original WB/CW series. The cast included Graham, Bledel, Kelly Bishop, Scott Patterson, Keiko Agena, Sean Gunn, Matt Czuchry, Milo Ventimiglia, and Yanic Truesdale.\n\nDuring a recent panel, Graham said she doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s a need for more Gilmore Girls:\n\nI love her writing; from the moment I read the pilot, I felt so connected to Amy Sherman-Palladino\u2019s voice as a writer. It was so invigorating and fulfilling to do that work. In terms of an actor, I would never tire of that. Now it has become, \u2018What can we do that is satisfying, and worth continuing, and gratifying to the people who care so much about it.\u2019 I don\u2019t know if there is a need to do more. I would never want it to feel like we overstayed our welcome. \u2026 There\u2019s probably a way to keep these characters alive but I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the best thing for them.\u201d\n\nBledel mentioned she isn\u2019t sure if she\u2019d dive back in for another season:\n\nI think for me it comes down to what story we\u2019re telling. I\u2019m just interested in telling a story that is dynamic and that I sort of relate to and can hook into. And if that happens \u2026 I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s such an unknown, I don\u2019t think we anticipated that this would happen.\u201d\n\nLater, Bledel revealed the ending of Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life was not what she was expecting:\n\nIt certainly wasn\u2019t the ending I was expecting. I told Amy that I hoped Rory would end on a high note. After all her hard work, I wanted to see her succeed and be thriving. So it was a hard thing for me to digest. I was hoping that we would see that she had lived an interesting life and had been fulfilled up until this point where her grandfather dies and [she] comes back home. But, because I know Amy after all these years, I knew it was her true intention and it was something that satisfied her as a writer because she knew the reaction she was going to get from the audience. \u2026 So I trusted her.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think? Are you a fan of Gilmore Girls? Do you think there should be more episodes?", "images": ["https://tvseriesfinale.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/039_GILMOREGIRLS_101_SUM_03265R3-590x393.jpg",
