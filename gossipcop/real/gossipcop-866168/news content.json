Now a decade later, it feels incredible to be a part of the most-viewed video on YouTube.\"\n\nWiz Khalifa added, \"I'm super excited and grateful to everyone who supported the song and video on YouTube, and happy to inspire and impact so many lives.\u201d", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/crimea-bridge-_hpMain_20221008-040311_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/john-lynch-points-house-damage-abc-jt-221007_1665185645263_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/uvalde-1-gty-er-221007_1665161778549_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/WireAP_aa698f905f6f4e618663d16ac67f2639_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-white-house-oval-office-gty-jt-221004_1664919462010_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/GTY-charlie-puth-wiz-khalifa-jef-170711_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://abcnews.go.com/Entertainment/breaks-record-viewed-youtube-video-time/story?id=48571822", "title": "'See You Again' breaks record for most-viewed YouTube video of all time", "meta_data": {"description": "It beat out former top video \"Gangnam Style.\"", "keywords": "see you again, charlie puth", "copyright": "2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.
