Over the weekend at San Diego Comic-Con, which ran from July 19th to July 22nd, Reynolds revealed which show he and Lively are currently addicted to, and honestly, same.\n\n\u201cLoving Handmaid\u2019s Tale. Wishing there were more, we just watched the last one,\u201d Reynolds said while speaking to fans at a Deadpool 2 panel. Although there\u2019s no release date set for Season 3 yet, it\u2019s expected to hit our screens in April 2019. Reynolds also said he\u2019s been \u201con a weird movie tour,\u201d while Lively has been overseas shooting The Rhythm Section. \u201cI\u2019ve been having a ton of time to pretend like I\u2019m watching the kids,\u201d he joked. \u201cShe\u2019s probably filing [divorce] papers as we speak.\u201d\n\nPart of Reynold\u2019s \u201cweird movie tour\u201d is watching \u201clike every Quentin Tarantino movie,\u201d he told the audience.
