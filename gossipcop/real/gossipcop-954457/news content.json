That being said, it has to be done.\n\nFrom the top songs and albums of the year to the best male and female artists, each music category for the E!

People's Choice Awards 2019 nominees for music, though, who do you think will get the most votes? Could Shawn Mendes take the Male Artist of 2019? Will BTS take the Group of 2019 award?

People's Choice Awards nominations below and vote up the musicians you think have the best chance of topping their category.", "images": ["https://static.ranker.com/img/brand/entertainment/header/background.jpg", "https://static.ranker.com/img/brand/ranker-logo.svg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/XsX3ATc3FbA/hqdefault.jpg?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&h=150&w=200", "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/16523/2736523/original/peoples-choice-awards-2018-music-nominees?w=817&h=427&fm=jpg&q=50&fit=crop", "https://static.ranker.com/img/brand/wordmark.svg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10600724&cv=3.6&cj=1", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_img/1/2273/original/calistylie-u2?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&h=56&w=56", "https://imgix.ranker.com/user_node_img/50100/1001993049/original/love-yourself-world-tour-photo-u1?auto=format&q=60&fit=crop&fm=pjpg&dpr=2&crop=faces&h=150&w=150", "https://www.ranker.com/api/px?lid=2736523&t=1665245031869"], "top_img": "https://imgix.ranker.com/list_img_v2/16523/2736523/original/peoples-choice-awards-2018-music-nominees?w=817&h=427&fm=jpg&q=50&fit=crop", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jules Burke"], "canonical_link": "https://www.ranker.com/list/e-peoples-choice-awards-2019-music-nominees/calistylie", "title": "Which E!
