It\u2019s dark and dramatic and surprisingly fluid, despite having to briefly showcase virtually every Marvel superhero we\u2019ve ever seen onscreen, plus Josh Brolin\u2019s grim Thanos and his new cadre of sub-baddies. No fewer than 22 major characters are packed into the two-and-a-half minute preview, many of whom are sporting radically different looks from when we saw them last. Some of these makeovers are awesome, some of them are not. Let\u2019s take a brief run through them all, from worst to best.\n\n11. Peter Parker\u2019s Arm Hair\n\nI understand this shot is meant to signify Peter\u2019s spidey sense going haywire, what with the massive alien Stargate thing floating in the sky behind him and all. But it winds up feeling more like a visual reminder that this kid is still in high school and going through puberty, which is pretty icky overall.\n\n10. Tony Stark\u2019s Rich Guy Tracksuit\n\nTony Stark is rich, and rich guys like wearing matching tracksuits. I have no problem with that. What I do take issue with is the fact that Stark\u2019s tracksuit of choice looks like it was designed by an early-\u201900s web developer and has the schlubby fit one would expect of an overworked dad driving his kids to hockey practice\u2014not a \u201cgenius, billionaire, playboy philanthropist.\u201d Next time, Tony, ask Nas for some pointers.\n\n9. Thanos\u2019 Metal Tanktop\n\nThe brief handful of times we\u2019ve seen Thanos prior to Infinity War, he\u2019s sat menacingly upon a space throne wearing a helmet and full suit of armour. It seems odd, then, that for his first major onscreen action, they\u2019d choose to stick him in a goofy, tight sleeveless number and expose his full bald noggin. Maybe the point was to make him look more like Dom Toretto? Frankly, though, he mostly just reminds me of Grimace.\n\n8. Vision\u2019s Human Disguise\n\nListen, Paul Bettany: I\u2019m happy for you, man. I\u2019m glad you managed to convince Marvel to give you a few scenes where you wouldn\u2019t require the three-and-a-half hour makeup process to turn you nearly as red in the face as the sitting president. But why did you let them make your human form so swagless? In real life, you turned up to a press conference wearing all-cream-everything and a pair of Leon: The Professional sunglasses like you owned the damn place. In Infinity War, save for that Mind Stone-sized pimple on your forehead, you look about as bland as a pack of saltines.\n\n7. Iron Man\u2019s Latest Armour\n\nIt\u2019s better than Tony Stark\u2019s tracksuit, sure, but it\u2019s mostly just boring: Another Marvel movie, another marginally different Iron Man suit. This one is the Mark 48\u2014forty-eight!!!\u2014for those of you still counting. Yawn.\n\n6. The Winter Soldier\u2019s Hockey Flow\n\nThis is pretty minor, all things considered, but I\u2019m reasonably certain that Bucky\u2019s hair is several inches longer this go \u2019round. I\u2019m into it. It\u2019s got a bit of an Aragorn vibe, especially when he\u2019s standing alongside such a massive army. (More on them later.)\n\n5. Thor\u2019s Eyepatch\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen Ragnarok already\u2014and if you haven\u2019t, you really should\u2014then this isn\u2019t new to you. But it warrants inclusion anyway, because it\u2019s really quite becoming. A rugged and worthy change for the Norse god going forward. Good job by you, Taika Waititi.\n\n4. Black Widow\u2019s Blonde Locks\n\nScarJo looks great as a blonde, because of course she does: it\u2019s her natural hair colour. A vast improvement over the shoddy red dye jobs she\u2019s been forced to endure for more than half a decade now.\n\n3. Captain America\u2019s Beard\n\nOf all the things on this list, Cap\u2019s beard has probably gotten the most buzz on the blogosphere. And rightly so: it\u2019s kind of the anti-Vision-as-a-human, insofar as it takes the generally pretty vanilla-looking Chris Evans and makes him look like a grizzled, salty sea captain. That\u2019s a beard with character; a beard that demands respect; a beard so powerful you might even be able to weaponize it, given that we don\u2019t see Cap\u2019s shield even once in this trailer.\n\n2. The Wakandan Army\u2019s Cape Game\n\nSQUAD GOALS. Son, the Wakandan Army\u2019s uniforms are STRAIGHT FLAMES. The flowy, earthy-toned layers look part-Jedi, part-Engineered Garments SS15, and those boldly patterned, off-the-shoulder capes are the stuff of Pitti Uomo dreams. If y\u2019all want a rough idea of what I\u2019ll be wearing all next summer, look no further than these incredibly badass fellas. To misquote a dumb Killers lyric: They got soul and they are soldiers.\n\n1. Spider-Man\u2019s Iron Spider Suit\n\nWe got a brief glimpse at this bad boy at the end of Homecoming, but my word is it ever glorious to see it in action. The lines! The armoured exterior! The glowing eyes! I\u2019ve got a feeling there\u2019ll be plenty of bang-for-your-buck action crammed into Infinity War, but this suit alone seems worth the price of admission.", "images": ["https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-9-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-infintiy-war-1117-2560x1440-c-default.jpg\n", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-7-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-2-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-11-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-5-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/img/dst/logos/title-lockup.svg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-1-1117-1.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-infintiy-war-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-3-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-10-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/img/dst/logos/title-logo.svg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-4-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-6-1117.jpg", "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-screengrab-8-1117.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-infintiy-war-1117.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://thetitlemag.com/culture/ranking-avengers-new-looks-avengers-infinity-war-trailer/", "title": "Ranking All of the Avengers\u2019 New Looks In the Avengers: Infinity War Trailer", "meta_data": {"description": "Good men are hard to define", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "sjm": {"version": "1.8.6"}, "thumbnail": "https://cdn.thetitlemag.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/avengers-infintiy-war-1117-900x600-c-default.jpg", "msapplication-config": "/wp-content/themes/sjm-genus/img/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ranking All of the Avengers' New Looks In the Avengers: Infinity War Trailer - Title Magazine", "description": "Cap has a beard!
