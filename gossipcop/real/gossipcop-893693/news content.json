Her news comes after a slew of canceled dates over the past week due to \u201cvocal rest.\u201d\n\nShakira\u2019s full message, which was posted in Spanish and English, is below:\n\nTo my friend and fans,\n\nFor the last five months I\u2019ve been wholly dedicated to preparing my El Dorado World Tour.\n\nHowever, these past few days, just before my first concerts, have been the hardest of my career.\n\nAt the end of July I went for a routine checkup, before starting to design this tour and my doctor confirmed that my vocal cords were in perfect condition.\n\nTowards the end of October though, in the home stretch of my rehearsals, I felt a strange hoarseness that impeded my singing. The doctors, upon examination, detected that I had suffered a hemorrhage on my right vocal cord.\n\nI then went on vocal rest as recommended by the specialists in an attempt to recover in time for my first show in Cologne.\n\nUnfortunately the hemorrhage doesn\u2019t appear to have reabsorbed and my nightmare continues. At the moment I find myself in a difficult battle as I try to fully recover.\n\nIt pains me not to be able to sing this month, for those have done even the impossible to get tickets and accompany me throughout the different countries of Europe.\n\nFor my team of 60 plus people who have worked day and night until the last day to help me put together the best show of my artistic career, and who, like myself, are anxious to begin this tour.\n\nFor my kids who were excited to see their mom in concert as soon as possible.\n\nAnd above all, of my fans, who have always been by my side through the good and the bad, and who deserve the best of me.\n\nIn all the years I\u2019ve been singing, I\u2019ve never been faced with situation like this. As such, and with a heavy heart, I must announce that I find myself obliged to postpone my European tour until 2018, to allow my body several necessary weeks, dedicated to my complete recovery.\n\nThanks to my fans throughout the world for their understanding and loyalty, for all the encouraging messages and affection they\u2019ve transmitted to me, and for their prayers.\n\nI hope to overcome this difficult trial and to return to the stage as soon as possible, to once again hear your voices singing along with mine.\n\nI love all of you very much and I will always remember those who have been by my side during this time, offering their friendship and affection.\n\nShakira\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Somehow Shakira\u2019s Workout Routine for Her El Dorado World Tour Looks Fun\n\nLast November, the singer had to cancel appearances at the Latin Grammys and American Music Awards to take care of her son Sasha, who was sick.\n\nAlthough she did not reveal the nature of Sasha\u2019s illness, she noted on Instagram that her baby made a full recovery: \u201cThanks for all the messages you sent for Sasha while he was sick,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEverything is under control now, and he\u2019s back to his cheerful self!\u201d", "images":
