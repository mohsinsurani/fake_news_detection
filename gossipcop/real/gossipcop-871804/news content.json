There's even a cameo from Jimmy Kimmel Live security guard Guillermo, whose appearance that was shot for the movie didn't make the final cut, and one more guest appearance that we won't ruin here. It's no wonder James Gunn previously said on Twitter, \"This may be the greatest thing I've ever worked on.\"\n\nSadly, cast members Chris Pratt, Vin Diesel, Bradley Cooper and Kurt Russell must have been too busy to appear in this music video. However, if you wait until the end, you just might catch one of them wearing a surprising disguise, even if it appears to be a moment added in post-production.\n\nNot only is this music video great, but that song is quite catchy. Where else can you find a song that rhymes procyon lotor (the scientific name for a raccoon) with the word motor? Nowhere. Could that be enough to land this song an Oscar nomination for Best Original Song? We certainly hope so.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 arrives on Digital HD on August 8th and 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on August 22nd.\n\nSet to the backdrop of 'Awesome Mixtape #2,' Marvel's Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 2 continues the team's adventures as they traverse the outer reaches of the cosmos. The Guardians must fight to keep their newfound family together as they unravel the mysteries of Peter Quill's true parentage. Old foes become new allies and fan-favorite characters from the classic comics will come to our heroes' aid as the Marvel cinematic universe continues to expand.", "images": ["https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/l-intro-import.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/intro-import.jpg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/slashfilm-icon.svg", "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/slashfilm-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/l-intro-import.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ethan Anderton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.slashfilm.com/552552/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/", "title": "'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2' Disco Music Video Is The Wackiest Thing You'll See Today", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/l-intro-import.jpg", "title": "'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2' Disco Music Video Is The Wackiest Thing You'll See Today - /Film", "description": "Easily the wackiest and most wonderful thing from Marvel Studios, watch this Guardians of the Galaxy 2 music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.slashfilm.com/552552/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/", "site_name": "SlashFilm.com"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/l-intro-import.jpg", "twitter": {"title": "'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2' Disco Music Video Is The Wackiest Thing You'll See Today - /Film", "description": "Easily the wackiest and most wonderful thing from Marvel Studios, watch this Guardians of the Galaxy 2 music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno.\"", "site": "@slashfilm", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.slashfilm.com/img/gallery/guardians-of-the-galaxy-2-music-video/l-intro-import.jpg"}, "title": "'Guardians Of The Galaxy Vol. 2' Disco Music Video Is The Wackiest Thing You'll See Today - /Film", "description": "Easily the wackiest and most wonderful thing from Marvel Studios, watch this Guardians of the Galaxy 2 music video for the song \"Guardians Inferno.\"", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-07T06:00:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-08-06T20:06:50+00:00", "author": "Ethan Anderton"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3MMMe1drnZY?v=3MMMe1drnZY"], "publish_date": 1502085645.0, "source": "https://www.slashfilm.com", "summary": ""}
