The British actress, 33, was named Outstanding Female Actor in a Drama Series for her portrayal of Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown, beating the likes of Millie Bobby Brown, Laura Linney, Robin Wright and Elisabeth Moss. It's the second year in a row that Claire has won the award \u2013 and will also be the last; season three will feature an all new cast, with Olivia Colman taking over the lead role. Unfortunately the star was unable to attend the Los Angeles ceremony. Claire is currently in Berlin filming her new thriller, The Girl in the Spider's Web. \"She's really sorry not to be her tonight,\" her co-star Matt Smith, who plays Prince Philip, told Access Hollywood on the red carpet.\n\nClaire Foy stars as Queen Elizabeth II in The Crown\n\nOther winners on the night included fellow Brit Gary Oldman, who added to his 2018 trophy haul with the Outstanding Actor trophy for The Darkest Hour. Speaking to reporters about his success this awards season, the 59-year-old said: \"You have your moment in the sun, there's no guarantee that you're going to keep working,\" he said. \"God forbid, I could get sick, I could get hit by a car. We have today but there's no guarantee we're going to get tomorrow. So my feeling is: enjoy the moment in the sun, it will eclipse, it always does, and it will be someone else standing up here next year. I'm enjoying it.\"\n\nGALLERY: SAG Awards 2018: The cutest couples on the red carpet\n\nGary Oldman was honoured on the night for his role in The Darkest Hour\n\nNicole Kidman and Alexander Skarsgard were also honoured on the night for their roles in Big Little Lies, while Sterling K.
