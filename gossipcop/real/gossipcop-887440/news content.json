A lot of the feelings I\u2019ve been having about anxiety, about being honest, the guilt for not speaking up earlier or taking action,\u201d she said.\n\nAt the same event, Jennifer Lawrence said that she was \"degraded\" by a female producer who told her to lose 15 pounds as she got her start in show business.\n\n\u201cA female producer had me do a nude lineup with about five women who were much, much thinner than me. And we all stood side-by-side with only paste-ons covering our privates,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cAfter that degrading and humiliating lineup, the female producer told me I should use the naked photos of myself as inspiration for my diet.\"\n\nThe #MeToo movement is turning into a global phenomenon as hundreds of thousands of women are following a call to action by Charmed star Alyssa Milano to use the hashtag if they have been victims of sexual harassment or assault.\n\nSuperstore actress America Ferrara posted that she was sexually assaulted at age 9.\n\nGabrielle Union, who survived a rape when she was 19, spoke out about the #MeToo movement on Good Morning America Tuesday.\n\n\u201cI saw #MeToo and my arm went numb,\" she said. \"I thought it was all about me and when I realized literally hundreds of thousands of people, men and women, [were] talking about being a part of this unfortunate club... it just rips your heart out.\"\n\nRead: Woman Who Applied to Be Harvey Weinstein's Nanny Describes Creepy Interview With Movie Mogul\n\nMeanwhile, more women are coming forward with accusations against disgraced producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\nActress Lauren Holly told a Canadian talk show earlier this week that Weinstein was furious when she rebuffed his advances in a hotel room in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cHe told me I would make a bad decision if I got out of there, that it would be bad for me and bad for my career, that I needed to keep him as an ally,\u201d she claimed.\n\nShe said she got out by pushing him and running away.\n\nWatch: Ex-Pussycat Dolls Member
