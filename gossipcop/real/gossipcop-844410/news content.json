Every year, Stagecoach fashion helps set the mood for this massive, three-day fest. Inspired by their favorite country musicians, fans from across the country pull out their finest western-inspired clothes to enjoy live music at Empire Polo Field in Indio, Calif.\n\nA photo posted by @stagecoach on Apr 25, 2015 at 2:51pm PDT\n\nKeep reading for tips on what to wear to Stagecoach this year (for both girls and guys). You can also view a collection of past Stagecoach outfits when you jump to the bottom of the page.\n\nDress for the Weather\n\nWith average highs in the upper 80s and average lows in the 60s, weather in Indio, Calif., can change drastically from midday to midnight, as well as from day to day. Your best bet for the daytime is light-colored, lightweight clothing. Make sure it\u2019s something you\u2019ll be comfortable wearing for a full day outside. Since the nights can get chilly in Indio, it\u2019s not a bad idea to bring a jacket or flannel to layer on top.\n\nYou\u2019ll also want to make sure you\u2019re wearing comfortable, durable shoes. The terrain is not very smooth at Empire Polo Field, and things can get messy when thousands of people convene in one spot for three days.\n\nPro-Tip: Sunscreen is a must in the California desert. You can bring your own from home, but make sure it\u2019s non-aerosol. (Security will make you toss out any aerosol containers at the festival entrance.)\n\nA photo posted by @stagecoach on Nov 30, 2015 at 4:03pm PST\n\nWhat to Expect in Stagecoach Fashion\n\nStagecoach fashion is definitely one-of-a-kind. Put country music lovers in the California desert and you\u2019ll get some interesting (and some outrageous) outfits. Expect to see lots of cowboy boots and hats, American flag apparel, and swimsuits on both men and women.\n\nFor Girls: With the warm weather, lots of female Stagecoach outfits include jean shorts (think Daisy Dukes) and tank tops. Some even opt for just swimsuit tops to battle the midday heat. There\u2019s also a strong tradition of wearing western-inspired dresses, particularly in colors like white or dusty rose.\n\nFor Guys: Take the cowboy theme into serious consideration if you\u2019re planning men\u2019s Stagecoach outfits. Jeans, plaid button downs, cowboy boots, and even cowboy hats are fixtures of Stagecoach fashion. American flag-themed apparel is also pretty abundant. In past years, guys have worn American flag swimming trunks, bro tanks, socks, sunglasses, and even fanny packs to Stagecoach.\n\nView some of our favorite Stagecoach outfits via our Pinterest board below.", "images": ["https://a.vsstatic.com/common/logo/900x425-logo.jpg", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1036714031/?label=5xFeCIPTyAIQr4Cs7gM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://a.vsstatic.com/common/logo/vs-wordmark-white.png", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/ca/33/f0/ca33f01560069fff05714f40f72badf2.jpg", "https://s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/564x/5a/24/89/5a2489608ab645dce30c48f6076b7b6f.jpg"], "top_img": "https://a.vsstatic.com/common/logo/900x425-logo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.vividseats.com/blog/what-to-wear-to-stagecoach-a-festival-guide", "title": "What to Wear to Stagecoach: A Festival Guide", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0,minimum-scale=1.0,user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Vivid Seats", "image": "https://a.vsstatic.com/common/logo/900x425-logo.jpg"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "format-detection": "telephone=yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vivid Seats", "application-name": "Vivid Seats", "msapplication-TileColor": "#333333", "msapplication-config": "//a.vsstatic.com/common/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "A handy guide to what to wear to Stagecoach Festival, including photos of past Stagecoach outfits and more.", "keywords": "what to wear to stagecoach, stagecoach outfits"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.vividseats.com", "summary": ""}
