Now, she\u2019s apparently fallen for Eminem \u2014 or, so her recent lyrics would have us to believe.\n\nAs Billboard points out, several of Minaj\u2019s recent lyrics have alluded to a relationship with Slim Shady. \u201cI\u2019m still fly, just bagged a white guy,\u201d she raps on \u201cBarbie Tingz\u201d. She gets even more specific on her new collaboration with YG, \u201cBig Bank\u201d, which hears her spit, \u201cTold them I met Slim Shady, bag the Em/ Once he go black, he\u2019ll be back again.\u201d\n\nIn response to the lyrics, a fan on Instagram asked Minaj if she was dating Eminem, to which Minaj simply replied, \u201cyes.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Video\n\nRepresentatives for neither artists have commented on the alleged relationship, and it\u2019s entirely possible that Minaj is merely trolling her fans. Or, perhaps it\u2019s a publicity stunt for her new album? More as we have it.\n\nMinaj and Eminem previously collaborated on \u201cRoman\u2019s Revenge\u201d, which you can revisit below.", "images": ["https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eminem-and-minaj.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dan-harmon-chevy-chase-community-movie-i-dont-even-know-if-its-legal.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1753966171496536&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-example-preferred_2x.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mike-Patton.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mike-Patton.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/derry-girls-netflix.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/right-said-fred-beyonce-im-too-sexy.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/themes/cosv2/images/c15.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/nicki-eminem.png?w=806&resize=1031%2C580&quality=80&strip", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21854097&c3=&c4=https://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-eminem-dating/&c5=News&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eminem-and-minaj.png?w=905&h=475&crop=1&resize=1031%2C580&quality=80&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/right-said-fred-beyonce-im-too-sexy.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hans-Zimmer-photo-by-Lee-Kirby.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/FL-MaxStrainTincs-1080x1080-1.png?quality=80&resize=330,330", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dan-harmon-chevy-chase-community-movie-i-dont-even-know-if-its-legal.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip"], "top_img": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eminem-and-minaj.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Young"], "canonical_link": "https://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-eminem-dating/", "title": "Nicki Minaj says she\u2019s dating Eminem", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2f2e2a", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 434175690014}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "msvalidate.01": "8CABEAF0C9CE91FCEDBFB11C38206EE5", "description": "\"Told them I met Slim Shady, bag the Em/ Once he go black, he\u2019ll be back again,\" Minaj raps on her latest collaboration, \"Big Bank\".", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nicki Minaj says she's dating Eminem", "description": "\"Told them I met Slim Shady, bag the Em/ Once he go black, he\u2019ll be back again,\" Minaj raps on her latest collaboration, \"Big Bank\".", "url": "https://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-eminem-dating/", "site_name": "Consequence", "image": {"identifier": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eminem-and-minaj.png", "width": 905, "height": 475, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/consequence/", "published_time": "2018-05-25T18:07:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-25T18:22:42+00:00"}, "author": "Alex Young", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@alexyoung", "site": "@consequence"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.9.4", "parsely-title": "Nicki Minaj says she\u2019s dating Eminem", "parsely-link": "http://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-eminem-dating/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/eminem-and-minaj.png?w=150", "parsely-pub-date": "<span class=\"localtime\" data-ltformat=\"Y-m-d\\TH:i:s\\Z\" data-lttime=\"2018-05-25T18:07:24+00:00\">2018-05-25T18:07:24Z</span>", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-tags": "celebrity dating news,dating,dating rumors,hip-hop music news,rap,relationships,romance", "parsely-author": "Alex Young", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cropped-correct-blue.jpg?quality=80&w=270"}, "movies": ["https://player.vimeo.com/video/16389705"], "publish_date": 1527271644.0, "source": "https://consequenceofsound.net", "summary": ""}
