Courtesy: YouTube/Vogue\n\nNEARLY two months on from their intimate backyard wedding, Miranda Kerr has finally showcased the breathtaking wedding gown she wore as she tied the knot with Snapchat founder Evan Spiegel.\n\nIn photos published in this month\u2019s Vogue, the supermodel looked regal as she channelled a real-life princess in her classic long-sleeved custom-made Dior dress and pearl-encrusted headpiece.\n\nThe publication also posted a video of Kerr at one of her dress fittings, in which she explains that her wedding day inspiration was Grace Kelly.\n\nWatch Miranda Kerr\u2019s Fairy-Tale Wedding Dress Fitting | Vogue\n\nAccording to the magazine, her mother and grandmother wept when they first saw her dress.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I couldn\u2019t have imagined a more beautiful wedding dress,\u201d Kerr told Vogue. \u201cWhen I was young, my grandmother told me, \u2018Miranda, men are very visual. It\u2019s important to look good.\u2019 I was like, \u2018OK, Nan.\u2019\u201d\n\nFor @mirandakerr, it took two fittings and a team of couturiers at @dior to create her fairy-tale wedding dress. Take an exclusive inside look at the making of her dream dress in the link in our bio. Photographed by @patrickdemarchelier.

garden of their $16 million Brentwood mansion.\n\nIt was an intimate twilight affair, and featured no other bridal party except Kerr\u2019s son, six-year-old son Flynn (who\u2019s dad is Orlando Bloom), who was a ring-bearer.\n\nTMZ recorded footage while outside their home, which has audio of Kerr singing You\u2019re Still The One, a hit recorded by Shania Twain.\n\nWith a personal combined value of more than $6.7 billion, Kerr and Spiegel met in 2014 at a New York dinner party and started dating a year later.", "images":
