If so, how do you not tear their heads off with your bare hands? :),\" she wrote.\n\nHyland didn't specify her issues, but appeared to be resting and recovering in a photo on Instagram Stories. The picture shows the star relaxing at home with her dog.\n\n\"My life for the next 6 to 8 weeks. I'm ok with it,\" she wrote.\n\nHyland has previously spoken about her battle with kidney dysplasia, which required her to undergo a kidney transplant in 2012. She said in May 2017 that her much-discussed weight loss was due to her being put on bed rest for months.\n\n\"My circumstances have put me in a place where I'm not in control of what my body looks like. So I strive to be as healthy as possible, as everyone should,\" the actress said.\n\nFor those who are chronically ill and in chronic pain: Have you had the experience of doctors not listening to you? If so, how do you not tear their heads off with your bare hands? :) \u2014 Sarah Hyland (@Sarah_Hyland) March 21, 2018\n\nHyland is known for playing Haley Dunphy on the ABC series Modern Family. The show co-stars Ariel Winter, who supported boyfriend Levi Meaden the Los Angeles premiere of Pacific Rim Uprising on Wednesday.", "images":
