Ragland and Markle's father, Thomas Markle Sr., divorced in 1987, and it was announced that he was unable to attend the wedding after suffering a heart attack earlier this week.\n\n\"Beautifiully [sic] dressed Doria sitting alone in such a beautiful historical moment shows strength, & grace that must be an inspiration to Meghan,\" one user wrote. \"This is the reality of many single parents.\"\n\n\"Kudos to #DoriaRagland for sitting there alone representing,\" another said. \"It can't be easy with all that pressure and scrutiny.\"\n\nRoyal expert Alastair Bruce spoke with Town and Country leading up to the nuptials, and explained how much input Markle and Harry have in deciding who gets invited and who sits where at the wedding.\n\n\n\n\"It\u2019s very much a matter for the bride and the groom,\" Bruce said, adding that the couple enlists the help of The Lord Chamberlain's Office when deciding the seating chart. \"They will assist him. They know the layout of St. George\u2019s Chapel, and they will guide him.\"\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-995394744-1615175310.jpg?crop=0.809xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pre-royal-1512328552.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hm-1589890755.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pictured-rick-hoffman-as-louis-litt-gina-torres-as-jessica-news-photo-148451291-1548879078.jpg?crop=0.707xw:1.00xh;0.256xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-harry-meghan-markle-index-1526934897.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.232xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-harry-meghan-markle-index-1526831107.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/duchess-of-sussex-and-prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-wave-as-news-photo-960173986-1544793777.jpg?crop=0.681xw:1.00xh;0.106xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-looks-at-his-bride-meghan-markle-as-she-news-photo-960051980-1544130764.jpg?crop=0.556xw:0.835xh;0.391xw,0.165xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1054546696-1543340962.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.140xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1xw:0.667xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/fa419146-b081-425c-8aa5-25d5c4ebf9c0_1506715449.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-style-1655915134.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-harry-meghan-markle-cute-moments-2019-05-gettyimages-1142167978-2-1557339976.jpg?crop=0.494xw:0.987xh;0.229xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0963xh&resize=1200:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-duchess-of-sussex-departs-after-her-wedding-to-prince-news-photo-960068514-1549489684.jpg?crop=0.669xw:1.00xh;0.100xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/doriaragland1-1526732348.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.335xh;0,0.0963xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20754831/meghan-markle-mother-doria-ragland-sitting-alone-royal-wedding/", "title": "Why Meghan Markle's Mother, Doria Ragland, Sat Alone at the Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Why Did Meghan Markle's Mother Doria Ragland Sit Alone in Second Row at Royal Wedding?
