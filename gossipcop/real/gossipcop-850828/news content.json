And when it comes to balance, the four-time Emmy-nominated star says she taps into her Scandal character Olivia Pope for inspiration.\n\n\u201cWe will not fail. We will not go down. We will fight the fight. There\u2019s always a solution,\u201d she says, adding that the words have \u201csapped into [her] bloodstream\u201d after she has said them so many times.\n\n\u201cNow I feel that way,\u201d Washington shares. \u201cI wake up, I have a house full of kids and pets, a new production company, I\u2019m number one on the call sheet, and I think: \u2018I will not go down. There\u2019s always another way.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Supermodel Christie Brinkley is 63 and back in SI\u2018s Swimsuit Issue with Her Daughters!\n\nOne person who helps her keep her goals in line?

Seeing the community she\u2019s created and the work ethic \u2013 I feel like there should be more of this in the world.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/_M2Cj6PXmhpXNohMkES-DuRn-jE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(634x0:636x2)/kerry-washington-40826d1d48644a44a1a2f06783a41ac4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/FpdOQ9TdPwVoBes9I6k4W6hUbSA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/msdsath_ec026-2000-bc70d8cc63724d1ab922ee0a864275ba.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/X-T-JMF6ef25RwD3SgXC7RY5oyY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kerry-washington-05bd72398fa34dffaec0d57a9e732be7.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8cJmVZc7Ok6w5_4Wwxc14qmMsU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_generic-1885945d8bd544778fbbf4be88a63f00.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/cTH0ZfQ6QxUmaBVPHMvcis1koAk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kerry-washington-nails1-6112d8edd18a4d5d95d3aba3b1828ac0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/31em-VaUVHCDHhWbpDaSoMm2So8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(399x0:401x2)/scandal-800-5-975be0a8da1b4a90b63ae8c3ceecab7f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Hia9ZSsF6xTWook-x-tRvuEnryI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(757x599:759x601)/Judy-Smith-2-035742602ac644678d2eb7a8d5dcd72e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_PL_NAwC-zVoeCT1p9hdyGITWPQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(194x67:196x69)/Ashley-Graham-f8dc70bd061d404585854abeea1f9e70.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BPf5aWZ3B4czEYk8RhiAuhEys88=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(614x0:616x2)/kerry1-2000-98bfbc9266524d63907186d26eb94838.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/I--3lsDvQtYqyLrSae9OieBgSTU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(747x0:749x2)/kerry-washington5-e7eeab597722471f90e7b241d26c6455.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/shSetJrr2uvrEXoAMkqbMRCrTtQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/greys-anatomy-b772d9a184664539a267fd7c1aac2a9e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/uuBdg3LYgSXu2D_d-mJmjkMJQuk=/1061x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/kerry-washington-2aae9a325636486eaf8365a296273483.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JpwZM42tRKtsr5YtUqQmPkSdrEw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/kerry-washington2-b9d96cb256964cb3937b51bff6d99356.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9igKrtIFf1t6dftaeWQnDElv1u0=/900x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(529x0:531x2)/kerry-washington-2aae9a325636486eaf8365a296273483.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EXC1CGaSb12OTiGaMv2BVs_PsBM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kw_today_tout-2000-573f89e3cb7442dbb7f87c41f1e8aec1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/uuBdg3LYgSXu2D_d-mJmjkMJQuk=/1061x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/kerry-washington-2aae9a325636486eaf8365a296273483.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jen Juneau", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/parents/kerry-washington-working-mom-net-a-porter/", "title": "Kerry Washington Talks Being a Working Mom", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\" 'I will not go down.
