With the season 15 renewal, Grey\u2019s Anatomy becomes ABC\u2019s longest-running primetime drama ever, passing The Adventures of Ozzie and Harriet (which ran for 15 seasons and 435 episodes). Only seven dramas in the history of television \u2014 Gunsmoke, Law & Order and its SVU spinoff, NCIS, CSI, ER and Bonanza \u2014 have had more seasons than Grey\u2019s. (And Grey\u2019s will now be tied with ER as TV\u2019s longest-running medical drama.)\n\n\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy has a special place in my heart and millions of viewers feel the same way,\u201d said ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey. \u201cThanks to fiercely loyal fans who have been on this journey since the beginning, and new generations of viewers who continue to discover the joy and drama of Grey Sloan Memorial, the show is as strong as ever.\u201d\n\nThe path for the Grey\u2019s renewal was cleared late last year when star Ellen Pompeo \u2014 who has been with the series since day one \u2014 signed a new two-year deal to remain with the show through a 16th season. The $20 million annual pact makes Pompeo TV\u2019s highest-earning actress on a drama series. The deal included a seven-figure signing bonus and two full backend equity points on the show as well as producing fees on both the flagship series and spinoff Station 19 on top of development deals for her ABC Studios-based Calamity Jane banner.\n\nA decision on a record-breaking 16th season will likely rest with Pompeo, as creator Rhimes has always maintained that Grey\u2019s will run \u201cas long as Ellen wants to do it.\u201d\n\nWith Rhimes having departed her longtime home at ABC Studios last year for a nine-figure deal with Netflix, Grey\u2019s has become increasingly important for ABC.\n\nRhimes recruited and handed off day-to-day control of her first TV series to Krista Vernoff, who returned to the show this season after a six-year detour. Vernoff has helped creatively recharge the series and Pompeo. The current 14th season ranks as ABC\u2019s No. 1 drama among the advertiser-coveted adults 18-49 demographic (a top-five series on all of broadcast) and No. 2 at the network among total viewers (tied with rookie drama The Good Doctor). Season 14 is up 3 percent among total viewers and ranks as Grey\u2019s most-watched season since the 2013-14 run.\n\nPompeo (Meredith), Justin Chambers (Alex), Chandra Wilson (Bailey) and James Pickens Jr. (Richard) are the only series regulars remaining from the pilot. They are all set to return for season 15, alongside co-stars Kevin McKidd (Owen), Jesse Williams (Jackson), Caterina Scorsone (Amelia), Camilla Luddington (Jo), Kelly McCreary (Maggie) and Giacomo Gianniotti (Andrew). Sarah Drew (April) and Jessica Capshaw (Arizona) will say farewell this season, joining Martin Henderson (Nathan) and Jason George (Ben), with the latter having moved over to spinoff Station 19 (the second to spring from Grey\u2019s after Private Practice).\n\nAs for the remaining Shondaland dramas, Scandal wrapped its seven-season run on Thursday and rookies Station 19 and For the People are both awaiting word on their respective futures. Of the two, Station 19 has the edge to return.\n\nGrey\u2019s Anatomy joins a roster of ABC shows set to return for 2018-19 including comedies The Goldbergs, Modern Family and Roseanne and the previously renewed Good Doctor. Those join new pickups including the 1990s-set Goldbergs spinoff, Nathan Fillion drama The Rookie and Take Two, with the latter likely set for this summer.\n\nKeep track of all the latest renewals and cancellations with THR\u2018s scorecard and of all the pilot pickups with our handy guide.
