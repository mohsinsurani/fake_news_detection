Meghan Markle's Dad Recalls Hanging Up on Prince Harry in Heated Phone Call\n\nAccording to ET's source, Harry, 33, and Meghan, 37, have discussed their desire to have children. \"Harry is tactile and protective of his new wife. He is completely besotted and nothing would make him happier if they were starting a family,\" the source says.\n\nIn a March interview with ET, royal expert Katie Nicholl said, \"My sources are saying that Prince Harry, particularly, is very keen to start a family, pretty soon after the royal wedding. He's made no secret about wanting children.\"\n\n\"Meghan is very doting with children,\" Nicholl continued. \"She is very maternal and she was thrilled to meet George and Charlotte. I think one of the lovely things, anecdotes that I discovered [while writing my book] was, it was actually a moment involving children when Meghan really fell for Prince Harry.\"\n\nThe couple also opened up about starting a family during their first joint interview together after their engagement last year. \"I think eventually, one step at a time, and we\u2019ll start a family in the near future,\" they said.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nMeghan Markle Goes Bold in Blue at Military Charity Gala With Prince Harry\n\nPrince Harry Gives Sweet Shout Out to Meghan
