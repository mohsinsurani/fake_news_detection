The rapper told E! News at OK! Magazine\u2019s summer kick-off party that she\u2019s still processing the reality star\u2019s death. As previously reported, Big Black died of a heart attack on May 9 at the age of 45.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all very sad that he\u2019s gone. It\u2019s super tragic,\u201d Chanel said. \u201cHe was so young and he has a little girl, which makes it even sadder.\u201d (Boykin shares a 9-year-old daughter with ex-wife Shannon Turley.)\n\n\u201cI think everyone is going to remember him as such a funny guy,\u201d she added of her former MTV costar. \u201cHe\u2019s going to keep people laughing forever in reruns to come. I think we\u2019re all going to remember him in a great way. It\u2019s just super tragic.\u201d\n\nBig Black\u2019s pal Rob Dyrdek previously paid tribute to the former security guard. After the shocking news of his death, the pro skateboarder made several Instagram posts, revealing they had reconciled after a brief feud.\n\n\u201cMy heart is broken. I don\u2019t want to write this post. I don\u2019t want to believe that this is reality. I am so thankful for you,\u201d Drydek wrote on May 9. \u201cWe truly were brothers that lived an unexpected unforgettable adventure. I just can\u2019t fathom that it would end so suddenly. You will forever be in my heart.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/fdff3bf48d7_chanel-west-coast-zoom-52d5685d-360d-4f33-a8f4-e5029759d47b.jpg?crop=258px%2C1px%2C1485px%2C779px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/fdff3bf48d7_chanel-west-coast-zoom-52d5685d-360d-4f33-a8f4-e5029759d47b.jpg?crop=258px%2C1px%2C1485px%2C779px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chanel-west-coast-opens-up-about-big-blacks-death-w483001/", "title": "Chanel West Coast Opens Up About Big Black\u2019s Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Rob & Big\u2019s Chanel West Coast opened up about Christopher \u2018Big Black\u2019 Boykin's death \u2014 read her quotes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chanel West Coast Opens Up About Big Black\u2019s Death", "description": "Rob & Big\u2019s Chanel West Coast opened up about Christopher \u2018Big Black\u2019 Boykin's death \u2014 read her quotes", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/chanel-west-coast-opens-up-about-big-blacks-death-w483001/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:03:42+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/fdff3bf48d7_chanel-west-coast-zoom-52d5685d-360d-4f33-a8f4-e5029759d47b.jpg?crop=258px%2C1px%2C1485px%2C779px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/fdff3bf48d7_chanel-west-coast-zoom-52d5685d-360d-4f33-a8f4-e5029759d47b.jpg?crop=258px%2C1px%2C1485px%2C779px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-05-18T17:27:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:03:42+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chanel West Coast Opens Up About Big Black\u2019s Death", "description": "Rob & Big\u2019s Chanel West Coast opened up about Christopher \u2018Big Black\u2019 Boykin's death \u2014 read her quotes", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/fdff3bf48d7_chanel-west-coast-zoom-52d5685d-360d-4f33-a8f4-e5029759d47b.jpg?crop=258px%2C1px%2C1485px%2C779px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495128420.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
