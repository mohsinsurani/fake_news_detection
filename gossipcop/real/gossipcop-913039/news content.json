The 20-year-old took to Instagram to announce that her short film had been screened at the SBFF.\n\nJudd took to Instagram to congratulate his daughter as well as the co-director, Olivia Rosen Bloom, whom he also linked on the social media platform.\n\nApatow \u2013 who is known for hits such as Knocked Up and Funny People \u2013 wrote alongside a picture of him and his daughter standing together.\n\nAs you may know, Maude comes from a line of entertainment juggernauts including her father, Judd, as well as her mother, Leslie Mann, who is most known for playing in Judd\u2019s movies.\n\nShe made an appearance in the 40-Year-Old Virgin. During his 2007 film, Knocked Up, his youngest daughter, Iris, made a short cameo and even portrayed Leslie\u2019s daughter in Funny People and This Is 40.\n\nMaude has big shoes to fill. In fact, during an interview with Nylon in 2016, she thanked her father for his advice and took the wisdom from women such as Lena Dunham and Amy Schumer.\n\nMaude said her father always told her to \u201cwrite for yourself,\u201d because when a person is an actor, they rarely have much control over what happens in a film.\n\nMaude said Lena and Amy are both involved in writing, acting, directing, and editing, so it inspired her to become an all-star producer in the Hollywood\u2019s sphere.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt appears as though the daughter of Apatow is just getting started, and we can\u2019t wait to see what she has in store. Her introduction into film-making comes at a turbulent time in the entertainment capital of America, considering the wave of sexual assault allegations to flourish in recent months.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Judd-Apatow-PopSugar.com_-e1518235297928.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/82b202de938491b45b85612a851e7257-1-300x244.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2042%2042%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/Pete-Davidsons-Says-Making-His-New-Movie-Has-Helped-Him-Heal-And-Move-On-Instead-Of-Feeling-Sorry-For-Himself-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/steve-bannon-700x466.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2060%2060%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20210%20140%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/79260820-f97b-11e9-bf57-7526c91bfe01-300x233.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2035%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/rhoa-porsha-williams-reunion-1280x720-1-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ti_getty_images-0-300x200.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%2027%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/erica-mena-lhhny-10-vh1-300x166.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%201050%20700%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Camila-Cabello-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/kandi-burruss-3-300x217.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/od2uj6ifkamaiwjzqpkk-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/tiny-harris-t-i-king-big-fight-bathroom-300x233.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556im_/https://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Judd-Apatow-PopSugar.com_-e1518235297928.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Rhonda Perry", "Joann Hooper"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201201143556/https://celebrityinsider.org/judd-apatow-supports-his-daughter-following-in-his-footsteps-despite-sexist-hollywood-113711/", "title": "Judd Apatow Supports His Daughter Following His Footsteps", "meta_data": {"author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "Funny People, Judd Apatow", "keywords": "celebrity news, Funny People, Judd Apatow", "p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "theme-color": "#dedede", "description": "Judd Apatow has his daughter Maude's back following her directorial debut during the Santa Barbara International Film Festival tonight.
