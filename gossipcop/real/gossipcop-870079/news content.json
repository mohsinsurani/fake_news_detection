While the past 16 years have just flown by, fans of the real-life fairytale franchise have never given up hope for a third Princess Diaries movie. And 2020 feels as fitting a time as any to bestow the world with some good news.\n\n\n\nIn recent years, traction on a trilogy-making sequel has stalled. Anne Hathaway, who played plucked-from-obscurity princess Mia Thermopolis, confirmed a script exists last year, and while she claimed to be on board for the film alongside co-star Julie Andrews as Queen Clarisse, there haven't been many updates since.\n\nBut, as The Princess Diaries taught us, miracles happen once in a while if you believe. Ahead, everything we know about the status of Princess Diaries 3, including Chris Pine's involvement and Mandy Moore's surprising character theories.\n\nAs of 2020, the film is possibly going to happen.\n\nQueen Andrews herself gave the latest update on the third movie. During a virtual interview with The Talk in April, the Oscar winner managed to both inspire optimism and cast doubt when it comes to PD3. \"I heard that there might be one,\" she revealed. \"It\u2019s long been talked about but nothing sort of been on my desk or anything like that. I think I would [do it]. I\u2019m getting awfully old and crotchety. I\u2019m not sure if it\u2019s the right timing, but I think to work with Annie [Anne Hathaway, who played Princess Mia] would be lovely again, and sure I\u2019d be up for it. I think we should wait for\u2014if a script comes in, let\u2019s wait for that. Of course, we wouldn\u2019t have the wonderful Gary Marshall who was the director. He\u2019s passed. And he was really the nuts and bolts of it all.\"\n\nA script does exist somewhere in the world.\n\nHathaway was last asked about the status of the project during her January 2019 appearance on Watch What Happens Live. She wants it to happen. Julie Andrews wants it to happen. They're working on it, she confirmed. \"There is a script for the third movie.... There is a script,\u201d she said. \"I want to do it. Julie [Andrews] wants to do it. Debra Martin Chase, our producer, wants to do it. We all really want it to happen. It\u2019s just we don\u2019t want to unless it\u2019s perfect, because we love it just as much as you guys love it. It\u2019s as important to us as it is to you, and we don\u2019t want to deliver anything until it\u2019s ready, but we\u2019re working on it, so...\"\n\nThe Princess Diaries The Princess Diaries $10 at Bookshop\n\nBut that script may as well be in the fictional country of Genovia itself, as no one seems to have read it. Or if they have, they're not willing to tease details. Prior to Hathaway confirming there was a script, the author of The Princess Diaries book series, Meg Cabot, told Entertainment Weekly that a script exists. She also said that if the movie gets made, it'll happen \"kind of as a tribute\" to director Garry Marshall, who passed away in 2016. But Cabot refused to reveal any further details, apart from saying that the movies would likely deviate from the book series. She said, \"I think of them as two different universes.\"\n\nGarry Marshall was reportedly planning the third installment before he died.\n\nSpeaking of Marshall, the filmmaker was also passionate about a third movie about Princess Mia. In an interview with People in March 2016, Marshall said, \"I was with Anne Hathaway a couple weeks ago. It looks like we want to do The Princess Diaries 3 in Manhattan.\" Sadly, Marshall's plan never came to fruition, but it's possible that the sequel will still be set in New York, to honor his idea.\n\nChris Pine is open to a third movie.\n\nThe actor seemed enthusiastic when asked about reprising his role as the dashing Nicholas Devereaux in 2016. After quite literally sweeping Mia off her feet at the end of the 2004 sequel, questions remain about the status of Nicholas and Mia's romance. During a fan Q&A for Entertainment Weekly in 2016, Pine was asked, \"Don't you pray every night for a Princess Diaries 3?\" To which he replied, \"Have you been reading my diary?\"\n\nPine and Hathaway in 2004. Giulio Marcocchi // Getty Images\n\nMandy Moore would consider a cameo.\n\nIn July 2017, Moore, who played mean-girl cheerleader Lana, told ELLE.com, \"If I'm going to be involved, I would be down for a cameo\u2014maybe she could make amends with Mia and apologize for being a bully when she was younger. She was insecure, going through a difficult time in her life and [has now] reflected on why that wasn't okay.\"\n\nMoore also appeared on People Now in February 2019 and was asked what she would like to see for her character Lana. The actress had a pretty fleshed out answer: \"I would like to see if life kicked down a few pegs because she was the bully in school [if she comes back]. I'd like to see her is life has come full circle and maybe she's a little more well humble. I would be down!\"\n\n\u00a9Walt Disney Co./Courtesy Everett Collection // Everett\n\nPrincess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz would come back.\n\nIn July 2016, Heather Matarazzo, who played Princess Mia's best friend Lilly Moscovitz, told Cosmopolitan that she would definitely return for another sequel. She said, \"If Annie and Julie are down, of course.\"\n\nThe fans are ready for a royal return.\n\nIf you had concerns about the fanbase returning for a third movie, allow Twitter's evergreen excitement to ease your mind.\n\nAs we await an official announcement, there's plenty of time to rewatch the first two movies, and reflect on Sandra Oh's Oscar-worthy turn as Vice Principal Gupta.\n\nAmy Mackelden Amy Mackelden is a freelance writer, editor, and disability activist.
