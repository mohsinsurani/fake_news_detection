Both proud parents showed off their completed looks for the recital in a group shot.\n\n\u201cOn call makeup artist!!!\u201d the singer captioned one snap.\n\nRodriguez also shared a video from the car ride to the event, featuring Lopez lip syncing to Rick Springfield\u2018s classic \u201cJessie\u2019s Girl\u201d while Emme\u2019s twin brother Maximilian \u201cMax\u201d David, 10, made silly faces behind her. The athlete even gave his girlfriend\u2019s son a quick kiss on the head!\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

At one point she\u2019s heard saying, \u201cThey\u2019re killing me right now!\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a new generation of party people,\u201d she captioned one video before Natasha danced, wearing a flowing skirt.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jennifer Lopez Shares Sweet Home Videos of Her Twins on Their 10th Birthday\n\n\n\nAfter the performance, the girls received bouquets of flowers and the entire group posed for family photos along with the father of Lopez\u2019s twins, her ex-husband Marc Anthony.\n\n\u201cNatasha, Ella & Emme dance recital,\u201d Rodriguez, 42, captioned a smiling shot with Anthony, Lopez and Emme, adding the hashtag, \u201c#familia.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cDinero\u201d singer shared another group shot featuring the blended bunch, captioning it, \u201c#familiaprimero \ud83c\udf1f,\u201d which translates to \u201cFamily first.\u201d\n\nLopez said in a recent interview with Good Morning America that despite the lyrical content of her latest song \u2014 \u201cEl Anillo,\u201d which is Spanish for \u201cThe Ring\u201d \u2014 she and Rodriguez are in no rush to walk down the aisle.\n\n\u201cWe have to take our time,\u201d she explained. \u201cI\u2019ve made plenty of mistakes in my past. We\u2019re mature now. We\u2019re grown-ups, and we\u2019re going to take our time and we\u2019re going to do things at our own pace.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old continued, \u201cOur life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work, we\u2019re truly blessed. We don\u2019t need anything more right now.\u201d", "images":
