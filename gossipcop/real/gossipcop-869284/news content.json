Selena Gomez debuted her sexy new single, \u201cFetish,\u201d which features rapper, Gucci Mane, on Thursday at midnight, and it just might be her most provocative song yet.\n\nRELATED: Watch Haim Cover Selena Gomez\u2019s \u2018Bad Liar\u2019 Using Homemade Percussion Instruments\n\nThe 24-year-old pop star seductively sings, \u201cYou\u2019ve got a fetish for my love. I push you out and you come right back. Don\u2019t see a point in blaming you. If I were you, I\u2019d do me.\u201d\n\nThe music video, which she released alongside the new tune, features a simple close-up shot of Gomez\u2019s mouth as she sings the entirety of the racy song, brushing her finger against her lips.\n\nShortly after dropping \u201cFetish,\u201d another new song surfaced online, titled \u201cStained.\u201d The moody electro-pop track has a darker vibe than the sultry \u201cFetish\u201d and the previously released upbeat single \u201cBad Liar.\u201d\n\n\u201cNow I\u2019m stained by you,\u201d Gomez sings on the chorus. \u201cLike a coffee ring upon this table. I\u2019m unstable.\u201d\n\n\u201cFetish\u201d is the second single Gomez has recently put out after she debuted the catchy, \u201cBad Liar,\u201d in June.\n\n\u201cThe funny thing is I was very single when we were working on the song, but it was that feeling that I was missing. I\u2019m very obvious when I have feelings for someone and we were talking about that feeling,\u201d Gomez said of \u201cBad Liar\u201d during a radio interview last month.\n\nRELATED: Selena Gomez Teases New Song \u2018Fetish\u2019 With Seductive Audio and Visuals \u2014 Listen and Look!\n\nThe singer hasn\u2019t made any official announcement about putting out a new album, though she has returned to the spotlight after taking some time off last year.\n\nFor more from Gomez, watch the clip below!", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kanye-West-Diddy.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1131311335.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-etcanada-blue.png?w=32", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1428861897.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/christian-bale-feature-gq.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC100722NicoleRichieComedy_Nicole_Richie.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC100622MELCNAMEGAME_2_YOUTUBE.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/beyonce-right-said-fred-getty.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC10722STEPUP3CHRISITINA.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1081213698.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=1268px%2C598px%2C1515px%2C1010px&resize=387%2C258", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5b7753aa-7d67-4aee-a43e-ade8290ecb41.jpg?quality=80&strip=all", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1389388354.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/x1r6adcqgy-bska8otyjs/image.jpeg.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/ubgtg9uq24-9fp8wwineq/ETC100722TaylorSwiftMidnightsTracklistYoutube.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ford_CCMA_ETC_Country_Club_340x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/web-MYSTIC-RAISIN-BRICK-340x150-co-brand.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-etcanada-blue.png?w=32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady", "Published", "Last Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/240098/selena-gomez-releases-her-most-sexual-song-yet-fetish-watch-the-steamy-music-video/", "title": "Update: Selena Gomez Releases Her Most Sexual Song Yet, \u2018Fetish\u2019: Watch the Steamy Music Video!", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "theme-color": "#0060b6", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ET Canada", "application-name": "ET Canada", "title": "Update: Selena Gomez Releases Her Most Sexual Song Yet, \u2018Fetish\u2019: Watch the Steamy Music Video!", "author": "Rachel McRady, ETOnline.com", "description": "Goodbye, Disney Channel!
