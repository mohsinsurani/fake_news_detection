I *never* would have guessed. I\u2019VE SAID TOO MUCH.\"\n\nMy initial guess was wrong. The real person? I *never* would have guessed. I\u2019VE SAID TOO MUCH \u2014 chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) March 26, 2018\n\nTeigen added: \"I AM NEVER TELLING I\u2019m scared I\u2019ve said too much KNOWLEDGE IS A CURSE!\"\n\nHaddish also did not offer any details as to the actress she claims to have bitten Beyonce, but did speak at length about the alleged incident.\n\n\u201cBeyonce's at the bar, so I said to Beyonce, \u2018Did she really bite you?\u2019\" Haddish recalls. \"She was like, \u2018Yeah.\u2019 I was like, \u2018She gonna get her a** beat tonight.\u2019 She was like, \u2018Tiffany, no. Don't do that. That b***h is on drugs. She not even drunk. The b***h is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.\u2019\u201d\n\nGQ reached out to Beyonce's rep, Yvette Noel-Schure, who told the magazine, \"I absolutely cannot comment on any of this, as I have no knowledge.\"\n\nEarlier this month at the Oscars, ET spoke to Haddish about Beyonce seemingly calling her out in her song, \"Top Off,\" with DJ Khaled. In the track, the mother of three raps: \"If they\u2019re tryna party with the queen, they gon\u2019 have to sign a nondisclosure.\"\n\nThe line is rumored to be in reference to the 38-year-old comedian's story about the night that Beyonce took a selfie with her so she wouldn\u2019t get into a fight.\n\n\"I made it!\" Haddish joyously proclaimed. \"Beyonce put my name in a song. I made it!\"\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTiffany Haddish Says an Actress Bit Beyonce in the Face on the Night They Met\n\nTiffany Haddish Says She and Brad Pitt Made a Plan to Hook Up If They\u2019re Both Still Single in a Year\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z Have 'a Team of Nannies' Taking Care of Blue Ivy and Twins as They Prep for Tour (Exclusive)\n\nTiffany Haddish Reacts to Beyonce Calling Her Out in 'Top Off' and It's Priceless (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-03/chrissy_teigen_gettyimages-911508650_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=ZdV2SYGT", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Kaye_GettyImages-1429667472_300.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=79-eWDg7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%202.01.34%20PM.png?h=597e033f&itok=1KV1Fu0Z", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2017-02/1280_beyonce_getty_634996532.jpg?itok=4cmlHgIN", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-03/chrissy_teigen_gettyimages-911508650_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=AfSScL4A"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-03/chrissy_teigen_gettyimages-911508650_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=AfSScL4A", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Willis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/chrissy-teigen-thinks-she-knows-who-allegedly-bit-beyonce-and-its-not-gwyneth-paltrow-99100", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Thinks She Knows Who Allegedly Bit Beyonce -- and It's Not Gwyneth Paltrow", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "The pregnant model took to Twitter after hearing Tiffany Haddish's story about Queen Bey.", "keywords": "News, Chrissy Teigen, Beyonce, Tiffany Haddish", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/chrissy-teigen-thinks-she-knows-who-allegedly-bit-beyonce-and-its-not-gwyneth-paltrow-99100", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Thinks She Knows Who Allegedly Bit Beyonce -- and It's Not Gwyneth Paltrow", "description": "The pregnant model took to Twitter after hearing Tiffany Haddish's story about Queen Bey.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-03/chrissy_teigen_gettyimages-911508650_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=AfSScL4A", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The pregnant model took to Twitter after hearing Tiffany Haddish's story about Queen Bey.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Chrissy Teigen Thinks She Knows Who Allegedly Bit Beyonce -- and It's Not Gwyneth Paltrow", "creator": "Jackie Willis\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/chrissy-teigen-thinks-she-knows-who-allegedly-bit-beyonce-and-its-not-gwyneth-paltrow-99100", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-03/chrissy_teigen_gettyimages-911508650_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=AfSScL4A"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
