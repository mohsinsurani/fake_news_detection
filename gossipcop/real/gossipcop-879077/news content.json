The breakup was announced the same week that Affleck was photographed in the company of 22-year-old Playboy model Shauna Sexton, followed by video of his ex-wife Jennifer Garner driving him up to Malibu to check into rehab for his ongoing struggles with alcohol addiction.\n\nBut in addition to joining Lorne Michaels and the rest of her \u201cSNL\u201d crew to pick up some Emmys, Shookus has apparently found other ways to cope with separating herself from Affleck\u2019s high-profile personal challenges.\n\nVanity Fair writer Josh Duboff said on his \u201cIn the Limelight\u201d podcast that Shookus was spotted on a date Sept. 8 at the U.S. Open women\u2019s final. A source emailed Duboff to say that Shookus was seen with an unidentified man, holding hands, and hustling to leave the USTA Billie Jean King National Tennis Center in New York City after the match between Serena Williams and Naomi Osaka.\n\nShookus, wearing a khaki jacket, white jeans, sneakers and sunglasses, \u201cseemed concerned she was going to be spotted,\u201d the source told Duboff. \u201cAt least that\u2019s how she framed it to her affectionate date, who held hands tightly with her as they rushed out a side entrance.\u201d\n\nIf both Shookus and Affleck, 46, have moved on with new romances, they\u2019re both enjoying pretty quick rebounds, given that they looked like they were getting pretty serious.\n\nThey dated publicly for year but it\u2019s been reported that their romance went back to 2013 or 2014 when Affleck was still married to Garner, the mother of his three children.\n\nBut maybe things were never that serious between them. There have been various accounts offered for why things didn\u2019t work out, including Affleck\u2019s acknowledged drinking problems.\n\nBut it\u2019s also possible he was never \u201cfully committed\u201d to Shookus, according to People. Or maybe Garner found it hard to accept Shookus being around their three children. There also were reports that Affleck and Shookus, who are based on opposite coasts and are each parents to young children, simply couldn\u2019t find time to be together.\n\nIn any case, Affleck hasn\u2019t been letting what should be an intensive recovery program at The Canyon in Malibu interfere with his budding relationship with Sexton. While he stays the nights at the Malibu facility, he enjoys daily trips back to his Pacific Palisades home to work out with trainers. He also has been spending time with Sexton at his mansion, and the model has been seen visiting The Canyon and driving around Los Angeles in his SUV.\n\nA source told Entertainment Tonight that Affleck has been told to hold off starting a new relationship while he is so early in his recovery program. But he\u2019s not listening.\n\n\u201cHis closest friends hoped he was just dating her and would break it off after going to rehab, but he seems to get closer to her every day,\u201d a source said. \u201cThe more time Ben seems to spend with Shauna, the more he seems to want to go home.\u201d\n\nFor Shookus, hearing about Sexton becoming Affleck\u2019s new female companion hasn\u2019t been easy, the source told Entertainment Tonight.\n\n\u201cLindsay was supporting Ben in the beginning but now he seems to be relying more on Shauna than Lindsay and she is devastated,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cShe believed he would get sober and they would work it out, but that isn\u2019t how things seem to be panning out,\u201d the source added.", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/wp-mason/static/images/site-logo/banglogo_small.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shookus2.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/BenAffleckRecovery.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mn-logo.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shookus1.jpg?w=1024&h=820"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Shookus1.jpg?w=1024&h=820", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
