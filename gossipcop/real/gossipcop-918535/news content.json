In a year, if they're both single, they'll hook up with each other in what could become one of the unlikeliest celebrity pairings ever. Haddish, the breakout star of Girls Trip, made the revelation during an interview with Kelly Ripa at the 2018 Academy Awards as they played a round of \"Marry, Date or Dish,\" E! News reports.\n\nTiffany said that she met Angelina Jolie's estranged husband by chance in an elevator that night.\n\n\"Oh I just met him an the elevator, he said in one year if he's single and I'm single we gonna do it, so you know what that means,\" Haddish said.\n\n\"But he do got seven kids, I don't know if I could deal with a man that's got that many kids.\"\n\nAs for hook up predictions for Brad Pitt, Tiffany Haddish needs to get in line. Since the public breakup of Jennifer Aniston and Justin Theroux's marriage, there have been lots of rumors that Aniston is going to reunite with her ex-husband.\n\nHaddish received loads of attention at the Oscars. Her dress on the red carpet was one of the night's standout ensembles. As CNN reports, Tiffany wore a zuria, which is a type of dress native to Eritrea, her father's homeland. During an interview on the red carpet, Tiffany said her now-deceased father made her promise to pay homage to Eritrea if she ever ended up at The Oscars.\n\n\"He said one day I would end up here, and if I ever end up at the Oscars to honor my people,\" she said of her dress choice.\n\nThe decision went over well with viewers on social media, with many Eritreans expressing pride at their culture being represented on the Academy Awards' red carpet.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/dee9f0b262b2cc498f0c56b5221d31a3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2ad8ff48-d2ac-4491-8571-d1067a8c9004.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/28fd1ecd-acc0-48fc-be3b-21a0f5ef3d90.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/06752bf4-81fd-43b9-8d98-a65ec048434c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4814631/tiffany-haddish-and-brad-pitt-agreed-to-hook-up-if-theyre-single-in-2019-girls-trip-star-reveals/", "title": "Tiffany Haddish And Brad Pitt Agreed To Hook Up If They're Single In 2019, The 'Girls Trip' Star Reveals", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tiffany Haddish And Brad Pitt Agreed To Hook Up If They're Single In 2019, The 'Girls Trip' Star Reveals", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4814631/tiffany-haddish-and-brad-pitt-agreed-to-hook-up-if-theyre-single-in-2019-girls-trip-star-reveals/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Tiffany Haddish And Brad Pitt Agreed To Hook Up If They're Single In 2019, The 'Girls Trip' Star Reveals", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-03-05 23:39:46Z", "section": "Celebrities"}, "description": "Tiffany Haddish And Brad Pitt Agreed To Hook Up If They're Single In 2019, The 'Girls Trip' Star Reveals", "keywords": "Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520293186.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
