Apparently, only Victoria Beckham (who attended William and Kate's wedding in 2011), Geri Halliwell and Emma Bunton are on the guest list, a source told the celeb news site.\n\n\n\nThat means only Posh Spice, Ginger Spice and Baby Spice will be present, while Sporty Spice (Mel C) and Scary Spice (Mel B) are MIA. To put salt in our wounds, the insider added that Spice Girls \"were never going to perform\" at the wedding in the first place. This news follows previous reports that the whole girl gang had received invites for the May 19 nuptials.\n\nAnd now, Mel C has spoken out about being left off of the guest list. Appearing on Australian radio program Fitzy & Wippa this week (via Daily Mail), Mel C announced, \"I should clear up the invitation part of it\u2014we were never invited!\" Basically, Mel B's previous claims that the group would be performing at the wedding appear to have been untrue.\n\nMel C reiterated that, \"No. We were never invited, we were never asked to perform... and I was a little bit annoyed, actually!\" She also revealed that, having seen Prince Charles at an event recently, she was tempted to say something about the snub. She told the hosts, \"He's a lovely, lovely man. But I felt like going 'Oy! Where's my invite?'\"\n\nTMZ also reported earlier this week that \"there are no current plans to have the group perform at any point in the festivities.\" Prince Harry, Meghan Markle and Kensington Palace had reportedly not asked the iconic girl group to take the stage for their big day.\n\nSources told the TMZ that Spice Girls \"haven't rehearsed anything for the wedding,\" further shutting down speculation for a performance. So although the epic quintet are officially reuniting, it looks like the royal wedding isn't included in their list of new projects.\n\nSpeculation over Spice Girls' possible royal wedding cameo began in February, after Mel B's vague answers about the ceremony left fans to believe she and the rest of the band would be present at the event.\n\nEllie Goulding performed at Prince William and Kate Middleton's reception in 2011; which pop star will take the stage for Harry and Meghan's ceremony?\n\nErica Gonzales Erica Gonzales is the Senior Culture Editor at ELLE.com, where she oversees coverage on TV, movies, music, books, and more.
