We tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed,\" Chris shared to Facebook at the time.\n\nBut apart from that bleak announcement, Pratt has never spoken publicly about the high-profile split - until now.\n\nHappier times. Getty\n\n\"Divorce sucks,\" Pratt told Entertainment Weekly. \"But at the end of the day, we've got a great kid who's got two parents who love him very much. And we're finding a way to navigate this while still remaining friends and still being kind to one another. It's not ideal, but yeah, I think both of us are actually probably doing better.\"\n\nFaris has previously opened up about the former couple's co-parenting arrangement, telling E! News in January: \u201cI think the key is surrounding him with a lot of joy and happiness, which he has a ton of.\u201d\n\nThe actress has also spoken about her new views on marriage after walking down the aisle twice.\n\n\u201cI need to figure out what the purpose is,\u201d the 41-year-old explained on friend Dax Shepard's podcast. \u201cIs it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more?\u201d\n\nFaris added: \u201cFor me, I\u2019m just not quite sure where it fits\u2026I am a romantic. I believe in a partnership, I believe in companionship. I just don\u2019t know if I believe in a ceremony of a wedding.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.marieclaire.com.au/Branding/MarieClaire/images/enhanced-header-logo-alt.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=340329063622688&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/100982/mc07_insta-cover-jennifer.jpg?height=158", "http://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/33885/chris-pratt.jpg", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/Branding/MarieClaire/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/5d0907b606a05d5316bc8020361b166e/5B5B2A57/t51.2885-15/s640x640/sh0.08/e35/13150980_267691483576059_446293298_n.jpg", "https://www.marieclaire.com.au/Branding/MarieClaire/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.marieclaire.com.au/media/33885/chris-pratt.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Mcclelland", "Anna Is Marie Claire", "Instyle'S Assistant Digital Content Manager", "Reporting On Everything Sell-Out Skincare To Meghan Markle'S Messy Bun.
