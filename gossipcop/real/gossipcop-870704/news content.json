News, admitting that the incident caused \"a little tear\" to roll her cheek.\n\nHowever, Murgatroyd kept cool and composed and explained to the site that she calmly told her firstborn, who she and her husband welcomed into the world on January 4, that \"mama's hurt.\"\n\nBut grabbing chunks of his mom's hair isn't the only way little Shai has been expressing himself. Peta revealed that the youngster is also asserting himself when it comes to his food habits.\n\n\"He'll grab the food bowl [and] throw it wherever he can,\" she said. \"He's very cheeky right now.\"\n\nMurgatroyd's latest confessions about her and Chmerkovskiy's bundle of joy comes shortly after she revealed that he's already getting very strong and pulling himself up, while the youngster is also starting to get two teeth coming through.\n\n\"We have some nights of screaming at the moment with the pain,\" the Dancing with the Stars professional told Extra of how she's having sleepless nights with her baby as he starts teething. \"You just get up as soon as you hear anything\u2026 mommy mode just kicks in and you just get straight up.\"\n\nBut while it sounds like Shai certainly isn't afraid to express himself, Maksim revealed last week that he could soon be taking all that feistiness and channeling it into dancing just like his parents.\n\nChmerkovskiy shared a video of his son getting his very first dance lesson from his brother Val Chmerkovskiy, who also appears on Dancing with the Stars alongside Maksim and Peta, to Instagram.\n\nThe adorable video, which has since gone viral, shows the brothers spending some quality time with little Shai as Maks holds him in his arms while Val wiggled his hands to make him dance.\n\nThe youngster could be seen grooving and giggling while enjoying a dance break with his dad and his uncle while Maksim joked in the caption that his son has most definitely inherited his parents dancing genes.\n\n\"DNA. Something about some fruit and some trees,\" he captioned the sweet clip.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/04740ca59ff3a7ed6178872d42206b16?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/2ad8ff48-d2ac-4491-8571-d1067a8c9004.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/28fd1ecd-acc0-48fc-be3b-21a0f5ef3d90.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/06752bf4-81fd-43b9-8d98-a65ec048434c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4411111/dwts-peta-murgatroyd-maksim-chmerkovskiy-son-shai-pulled-hair-out/", "title": "'DWTS' Star Peta Murgatroyd Says Her & Maksim Chmerkovskiy's Son Pulled Her Hair Out", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'DWTS' Star Peta Murgatroyd Says Her & Maksim Chmerkovskiy's Son Pulled Her Hair Out", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4411111/dwts-peta-murgatroyd-maksim-chmerkovskiy-son-shai-pulled-hair-out/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "'DWTS' Star Peta Murgatroyd Says Her & Maksim Chmerkovskiy's Son Pulled Her Hair Out", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-08-05 06:24:38Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "'DWTS' Star Peta Murgatroyd Says Her & Maksim Chmerkovskiy's Son Pulled Her Hair Out", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501914278.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
