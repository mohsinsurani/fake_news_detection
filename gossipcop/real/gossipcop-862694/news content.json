We kept trying to get it in episodes before that and I like that in that episode, she throws on her jeans and the purple Members Only jacket. That whole ensemble is my favorite.\u201d\n\nMorgan notes that Ruth\u2019s wardrobe \u201chas a masculinity to her in a way that she wants to be seen and heard and feel like she has a voice to make a difference.
