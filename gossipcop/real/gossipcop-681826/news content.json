The target in the lawsuit was an anonymous Twitter user who responded to Woods\u2019 conservative politics by suggesting the actor was a \u201ccocaine addict.\u201d In filing the lawsuit, Woods wanted to send a message. \u201cAL, and anyone else using social media to propagate lies and do harm, should take note,\u201d stated the complaint handled by Michael Weinsten at Lavely & Singer. \u201cThey are not impervious to the law.\u201d\n\nWoods then beat back an anti-SLAPP motion that attempted to make the argument that the \u201ccocaine addict\u201d tweet was \u201ca constitutionally protected political insult,\u201d the type made routinely by Woods as \u201ca well-known part of Twitter\u2019s culture of political hyperbole.\u201d\n\nAn appeal abruptly was cut short when the defendant died. That wouldn\u2019t stop Woods. The actor wrote that he hoped the defendant died \u201cscreaming my name,\u201d adding, \u201cLearn this. Libel me, I\u2019ll sue you. If you die, I\u2019ll follow you to the bowels of Hell. Get it?\u201d\n\nWoods did make some efforts to pursue the defendant\u2019s estate, but that\u2019s all over now thanks to a settlement. Full terms hasn\u2019t been disclosed, but it does include White\u2019s letter.\n\n\u201cTo be clear, my client did not intend for his July 15, 2015 tweet about Mr. Woods to be understood as a statement of fact,\u201d the letter continues. \u201cHe regretted having made the tweet, and further regrets any harm caused to Mr. Woods\u2019 reputation by the tweet. His family was not aware of the tweet until after the fact and regrets if any harm came from the tweet being taken literally.\u201d\n\nWoods is done with this Twitter defamation case, but the tables have turned because he\u2019s a defendant in another.\n\nPortia Boulger, an Ohio woman, is suing him for $3 million. She claims he misidentified her as a Nazi on Twitter. Specifically, the Chicago Tribune posted a photograph of a woman at a Donald Trump rally who might have been making a Nazi salute. Other Twitter users asserted it was Boulger, which led Woods to tweet the photograph along with a question: \u201cSo-called #Trump \u2018Nazi\u2019 is a #BernieSanders agitator/operative?\u201d\n\nThis got retweeted by Donald Trump, Jr.\n\nStill in court over the matter, Woods filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings last month. He argued the case was an attempt to quell his free speech rights.\n\n\u201cFirst, Plaintiff\u2019s claim for defamation fails as a matter of law because Mr. Woods\u2019 allegedly defamatory question is not a statement of fact,\u201d writes Woods\u2019 attorney. \u201cNor would a reasonable reader interpret Mr. Woods\u2019 question \u2014 seeking clarification \u2014 as inferring any factual content.\u201d\n\nLater in the Woods\u2019 brief, it\u2019s argues that the word \u201cNazi\u201d is \u201cinherently imprecise and subject to myriad subjective interpretations\u201d and that \u201cseveral courts have consistently held that use of the term \u2018Nazi\u2019 is rhetorical hyperbole.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-643057832_copy.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-643057832_copy.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/gettyimages-643057832_copy.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eriq Gardner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/james-woods-drops-lawsuit-cocaine-addict-tweet-getting-trophy-letter-1022660/", "title": "James Woods Drops Lawsuit Over \u201cCocaine Addict\u201d Tweet After Getting Trophy Letter", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The actor filed a $10 million libel action two years ago.
