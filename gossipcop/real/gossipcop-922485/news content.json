For years, Farrow has claimed that Allen sexually abused her when she was a child. (Allen has denied the claims.) Numerous actresses\u2014Greta Gerwig, Rebecca Hall, Ellen Page, Rachel Brosnahan, Kate Winslet\u2014and actors\u2014Colin Firth, Michael Caine, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet\u2014who collaborated with Allen in the past have publicly spoken out against the director in recent months. But one actress, Allen\u2019s Oscar-winning Blue Jasmine leading lady Cate Blanchett, isn\u2019t quite as ready to step away. In a new interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour, Blanchett said that social media\u2014the birthplace of these hashtag social-justice movements\u2014is \u201cnot the judge and jury\u201d when it comes to Allen.\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nIn the wake of the Time\u2019s Up movement, Dylan Farrow has been emboldened to share her story more publicly and more often, prompting journalists such as Amanpour to press former- and current-Allen collaborators for their take on the director. Amanpour questioned Blanchett, saying: \u201cHow do you juxtapose being a #MeToo proponent, a Time\u2019s Up proponent, and staying silent or having worked with Woody Allen?\u201d She also asked if Blanchett would work with Allen again, given the allegations. The actress responded:\n\nI don\u2019t think I\u2019ve stayed silent at all. At the time that I worked with Woody Allen, I knew nothing of the allegations, and it came out during the time that the film was released. At the time, I said it\u2019s a very painful and complicated situation for the family, which I hope they have the ability to resolve. And if these allegations need to be re-examined which, in my understanding, they\u2019ve been through court, then I\u2019m a big believer in the justice system and setting legal precedents. If the case needs to be reopened, I am absolutely, wholeheartedly in support of that. Because I think that there\u2019s one thing about\u2014social media is fantastic about raising awareness about issues, but it\u2019s not the judge and jury.\n\nBlanchett elaborated that her preference for a more codified condemnation of sexual abusers is derived from concern for future victims. \u201cI feel that these things need to go into court, so if these abuses have happened, the person is prosecuted, and so someone, who is not in the shiny industry that I am, can use that legal precedent to protect themselves,\u201d she explained. \u201cAlways, in my industry or any other industry, they\u2019re preyed upon because they\u2019re vulnerable.\u201d\n\nAllen, meanwhile, issued the following statement to CBS This Morning back in January after Farrow re-stated her allegations of abuse:\n\nWhen this claim was first made more than 25 years ago, it was thoroughly investigated by both the Child Sexual Abuse Clinic of the Yale-New Haven Hospital and New York State Child Welfare. They both did so for many months and independently concluded that no molestation had ever taken place. Instead, they found it likely a vulnerable child had been coached to tell the story by her angry mother during a contentious breakup. Dylan\u2019s older brother Moses has said that he witnessed their mother doing exactly that\u2014relentlessly coaching Dylan, trying to drum into her that her father was a dangerous sexual predator.\n\nFarrow named Blanchett (and a few other actresses) specifically when pointing out what was, in her view, an incongruity between defending Woody Allen while also declaring that \u201cTime\u2019s Up.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62990e66f0746bf707feb29a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined",
