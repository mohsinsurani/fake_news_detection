They would bring their A-game,\" he said. \"It was very sweet.\n\n\"She was such a beautiful, lovely, great spirit...\"\n\n\n\nDavid Spade remembers his late sister-in-law Kate Spade: https://t.co/hOA4cYZxGS pic.twitter.com/NAusA7mobf \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) July 18, 2018\n\n\"They would be like, \u2018Is Katie coming? Are Andy and Katie gonna be there?\u2019\" he continued. \"And if they were, it was a whole new wardrobe.\"\n\nSpade said Kate, being \"very sweet\" and knowing his friends had dressed to impress, would compliment them.\n\n\"And when I\u2019d say, \u2018You don\u2019t dress up for me,\u2019 they\u2019d go, \u2018Yeah, that\u2019s her and you\u2019re you,'\" joked Spade.\n\nNoting he could just \"start bawling,\" Spade said of his sister-in-law: \u201cShe was such a beautiful, lovely, great spirit that obviously will be missed.\u201d\n\nKate was found dead in her New York City apartment last month of an apparent suicide, Det.
