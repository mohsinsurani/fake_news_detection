The couple had a low-key ceremony at a private home in Hidden Hills, California, according to the site.\n\nThe nuptials\u2014which took place almost five months after Meghan and Prince Harry's royal wedding\u2014were so secretive that barely any photos from the event surfaced online. But a few Instagram Stories captured by DailyMailTV give a glimpse at Engelson and Kurland's big day.\n\nThe images show Engelson wearing a light pink shirt under a gray-blue suit, with the bride in an off-the-shoulder, knee-length white dress with layered gold bracelets. She wore her hair in loose ombr\u00e9 waves.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarkle and Engelson were married from 2011 to 2013. They had a getaway wedding in 2011 in Ocho Rios, Jamaica with 102 guests, according to Us Weekly. For the beachfront nuptials, the bride wore a strapless sheath gown with a notch neckline and bejeweled belt. The laid-back, bohemian-inspired look was fitting for the shoreside venue, but a far cry from the Givenchy Haute Couture gown Markle had custom-made for her royal wedding to Prince Harry.\n\nWPA Pool // Getty Images\n\nEngelson's engagement to Kurland was reported in June, just weeks after Meghan and Harry tied the knot. The producer announced the news on Instagram, although his account is private. \"Luckiest guy I know! Get ready to party!\" he wrote in a post.\n\nMeghan and Harry have been to a number of weddings together since becoming a couple; they attended a friend's nuptials months after celebrating their own and are expected to be at Princess Eugenie's ceremony this Friday.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665062756.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0.0252xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-trevor-engelson-tracey-kurland-1539120206.jpg?crop=1xw:0.6666666666666666xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-meghan-markle-prince-harry-ex-married-index1-1539120225.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/crown-prince-frederik-of-denmark-prince-vincent-of-denmark-news-photo-1664899080.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.170xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fekixdhxgaapvq7-1664823960.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0406xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-royal-wedding-960071696-1538155016.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664895878.jpg?crop=0.527xw:1.00xh;0.237xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4m769-1664893662.jpg?crop=0.644xw:0.957xh;0.0962xw,0.0430xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2011-trevor-engelson-1518295175.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2018-09-22-at-6-56-05-pm-copy-1537657017.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.836xh;0,0&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4x9br-1664984071.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.185xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664976504.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.691xh;0,0.0431xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664889898.jpg?crop=0.684xw:1.00xh;0.146xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-meghan-markle-prince-harry-ex-married-index1-1539120225.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23694469/meghan-markle-ex-husband-trevor-engelson-married/", "title": "Meghan Markle's Ex-Husband, Trevor Engelson, Reportedly Just Got Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Meghan Markle's Ex-Husband, Trevor Engelson, Reportedly Just Got Married", "description": "Meghan Markle's first husband, Trevor Engelson\ufeff, got married to Tracey Kurland, a nutritionist, over the weekend, Daily Mail reports.
