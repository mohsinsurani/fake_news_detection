I will look at it that way. Here\u2019s to a new life, baby girl. Goddamnit, I didn\u2019t want to cry, I wanted to be all peppy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBye, house,\u201d she adds. \u201cThank you. I love you.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

It was hard.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Rose McGowan\u2019s Ex-Manager Dies by Suicide \u2014 and Her Family Slams McGowan and Harvey Weinstein\n\nMcGowan was one of the first women to speak out in October when Weinstein\u2019s alleged decades of alleged sexual misconduct and assault broke in The New York Times and The New Yorker. McGowan claims Weinstein sexually assaulted her in 1997.\n\nThe former movie mogul has since been accused by over 60 women of various forms of sexual assault and misconduct.
