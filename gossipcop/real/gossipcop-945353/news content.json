I got heated and caught up in what I was feeling and wanted people to hate on them cause I felt like the situation was unjust. It\u2019s really not my place to be the justice police, as much as I wish it was.\u201d\n\nHowever, Martinez isn\u2019t ready to let the situation go completely. \u201cTo clarify, I could have still kept it real and spoken my truth in a less abrasive, less shit-stirring way,\u201d she later tweeted adding that \u201cthe issue is the way I handled it, not the content.\u201d\n\nThe argument between the two began on Friday, June 15, after Martinez took aim at Tia Booth and Colton Underwood for allegedly filming Bachelor in Paradise with each other after the two assured current Bachelorette Becca Kufrin that there were no feelings between them.\n\nThe former couple \u2014 who briefly dated before Underwood joined Kufrin\u2019s season \u2014came face-to-face on an episode of the reality dating show June 11 and claimed their relationship was over.\n\nGates came to the defense of her pal Booth by directing a mean tweet at Martinez. \u201cHey everybody!! Make sure you follow @Whats_Ur_Sign_ so she can get those followers so she can stop talking s\u2014t about her friends\u2026like Tia!!!! And Becca!!\u201d she wrote in a since-deleted tweet. \u201cCome on now hurry up!\u201d\n\nThe comeback sparked banter between the two, which ultimately fizzled after Gates blocked Martinez on social media.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bekah-Martinez-Apologizes-After-Raven-Gates-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bekah-Martinez-Apologizes-After-Raven-Gates-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Bekah-Martinez-Apologizes-After-Raven-Gates-Feud.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bachelor-alum-bekah-martinez-apologizes-to-raven-gates/", "title": "'Bachelor' Alum Bekah Martinez Apologizes to Raven Gates", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Bachelor Nation's Bekah Martinez took to Twitter on Tuesday, June 19, to apologize for Raven Gates drama \u2014 see what she said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Bachelor' Alum Bekah M.
