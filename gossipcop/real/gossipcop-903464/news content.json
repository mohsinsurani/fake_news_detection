Ellen Page revealed that she and girlfriend Emma Portner tied the knot!\n\n\u201cCan\u2019t believe I get to call this extraordinary woman my wife,\u201d the 30-year-old actress captioned an Instagram photo on Wednesday, January 3, of she and the dancer\u2019s hands sporting elegant wedding bands.\n\nAlthough the low-key couple have yet to speak publicly about their relationship, they have been seen together holding hands and locking lips on multiple occasions since first stepping out in July 2017. Before romancing Portner, the Oscar nominee dated Samantha Thomas from September 2015 to early 2017.\n\nPage has been open about her sexuality since coming out as gay on Valentine\u2019s Day 2014. While speaking to The Hollywood Reporter in May 2014, the Juno star revealed that she is so \u201cf\u2014king happy\u201d and \u201cevery tiny aspect of [her] life feels better.\u201d Later that year, Page covered Out magazine and was honored as their Entertainer of the Year for making strides in the LGBT community.\n\nThe Inception actress also opened up about coming out during an interview with Stephen Colbert in September 2015. \u201cI feel so grateful to feel how I feel now, compared to [how I felt] when I was a closeted person. It\u2019s not a nice place to be,\u201d she explained. \u201c[Staying in the closet] is toxic. I wish that no one had to live that way.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-portner-and-ellen-page-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1739px%2C913px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-portner-and-ellen-page-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1739px%2C913px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ellen-page-maries-girlfriend-emma-portner-details/", "title": "Ellen Page Marries Girlfriend Emma Portner: Details", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ellen Page revealed that she and girlfriend Emma Portner got married \u2014 see their rings!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ellen Page Reveals She Married Girlfriend Emma Portner: See the Rings!", "description": "Ellen Page revealed that she and girlfriend Emma Portner got married \u2014 see their rings!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ellen-page-maries-girlfriend-emma-portner-details/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-03T21:35:33+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-portner-and-ellen-page-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1739px%2C913px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-portner-and-ellen-page-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1739px%2C913px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-03T21:13:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-03T21:35:33+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ellen Page Reveals She Married Girlfriend Emma Portner: See the Rings!", "description": "Ellen Page revealed that she and girlfriend Emma Portner got married \u2014 see their rings!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/emma-portner-and-ellen-page-married.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1739px%2C913px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515014022.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
