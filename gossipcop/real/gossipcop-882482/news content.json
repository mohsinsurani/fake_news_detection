That\u2019s not even taking into account the number of military shows already on TV, including long-running procedurals like \u201cNCIS\u201d and the post-apocalyptic \u201cThe Last Ship\u201d on TNT. Other shows, like \u201cThe Night Shift\u201d and the upcoming \u201cS.W.A.T.\u201d aren\u2019t directly about the military, but feature characters with service pasts or with direct connections to combat scenarios.\n\nShowrunners and other execs said that the move wasn\u2019t in response to current events and a possible resurgence in American pride; it was more of a coincidence. And it wasn\u2019t until the TCAs that they noticed how their shows compared to each other.\n\nThe executive producers, showrunners and casts still made their cases to press, attempting to separate their show from the pack. While they are similar on the surface \u2014 and have comparable distinctive traits \u2014 there are some slight differences. But is it enough? Below, we\u2019ve broken down the three dramas to see if first impressions are enough to provide uniqueness.\n\nAlso Read: CW 2017-18 Schedule: 'Jane The Virgin' Banished to Fridays, 'Valor' Will Follow 'Supergirl'\n\n\u201cVALOR\u201d\n\n\u201cValor\u201d is the CW\u2019s first military drama. Compared to \u201cSEAL Team\u201d and \u201cThe Brave,\u201d it\u2019s also specifically female-driven, character-focused and plays to more soapy sensibilities.\n\nWhile the conflicts of the pilot episode revolve around a botched mission and what exactly went wrong, protagonist Nora (played by Christina Ochoa) is dealing with the consequences of her PTSD, going back to flying after a month away and her growing dependence on prescription drugs. Meanwhile, her colleague Gallo (played by Matt Barr) is in a relationship with another woman who works on the base, but isn\u2019t allowed to interact with her.\n\nKyle Jarrow, writer and executive producer on \u201cValor,\u201d said he was inspired to create a military show because his brother served in the 173rd Airborne, which meant he got a closer look at how that kind of lifestyle affected people.\n\n\u201cFolks in the military, like my brother, like these characters, are human beings. They are sleeping with people\u2026. They\u2019re cheating on people. They\u2019re struggling with questions of personal morality and personal choices, just like we all do,\u201d Jarrow explained. \u201cIt felt really important to dramatize that in telling a full story of what it\u2019s like to be someone in the military.\u201d\n\nBecause it\u2019s on the CW, the scope is much smaller than on the other military shows. The pilot episode takes place almost entirely on the base and in the homes of the characters involved.\n\nAlso Read: CBS Sets Fall Premiere Dates for 2017-18 Schedule\n\n\u201cSEAL TEAM\u201d\n\nSo, is \u201cValor\u201d the military drama of the season? You could say that, but \u201cSEAL Team\u201d also promises that viewers can expect more character-driven stories instead of just simply military raids or narratives. If anything, it\u2019s not about the military at all, according to executive producers.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think our show is about the military. I think it\u2019s about the people who do this work rather than about the work itself in some way,\u201d EP Benjamin Cavell said.\n\nStar David Boreanaz agreed, calling it more of a \u201cworkplace show\u201d that happens to involve special ops.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s interesting is the character that\u2019s involved in the workplace show and how he deals with that specifically and, when he comes home, how he deals with his own inner turmoils and how he deals with his personal life,\u201d Boreanaz, who plays Jason Hayes, leader of the Tier One team, explained to reporters.\n\nTo get at the heart of those characters, the \u201cSEAL Team\u201d execs stressed how much they utilized military consultants on the show.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve had the real people who do this work in this project from the beginning, not from after we wrote a script and we called them as tech advisers,\u201d Cavell said. \u201cTheir involvement predates that, and the DNA of this show is about the authenticity of the real stories of the people that we\u2019re making it about \u2014 and I couldn\u2019t be prouder of it.\u201d\n\nRegardless of character work, the show does follow the Navy\u2019s most elite special ops force, so there is some focus on current events, like the battle with the Islamic State. In a first look uploaded by CBS, the team is shown strategizing about a mission, going into a foreign country, and then going about attempting to succeed.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if this will play into our current political climate in any way, or if it\u2019ll address the ethics and problems that go along with invading foreign lands and dealing with other people, specifically when they\u2019re of a different religion, race or culture. The EPs promise, though, that \u201cSEAL Team\u201d isn\u2019t all-American.\n\n\u201cWe want to have a diversity in our storytelling, and we don\u2019t want to be a chest-pumping show,\u201d said co-showrunner Ed Redlich. \u201cAgain, it\u2019s the American military, and they go on, and they do stories. But, again, it\u2019s how creatively and artistically you choose to tell a story.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: NBC Shakes Up Fall Schedule: 'This Is Us' Back to Tuesdays, 'Chicago Fire' Moves to Thursdays\n\n\u201cTHE BRAVE\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s \u201cThe Brave,\u201d which also promises that it\u2019ll be more about the people than the military set pieces. Execs say that it\u2019ll stand out due its more gender-balanced and diverse cast. The main, eight-member list includes three women and four people of color.\n\n\u201cI think what really drew us to join this project was the strength of women, the female characters in the show, not just out in the field, but in the DIA,\u201d said co-showrunner Chris Ord.\n\nIn this one, the characters are what the execs call \u201crealistic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am really interested in resiliency as a characteristic of human beings. And so I\u2019ve been a fan about reading about special forces operators for years, and I wanted to see them portrayed in a way that I felt was realistic,\u201d said series creator Dean Georgaris.\n\nWhat separates \u201cThe Brave\u201d from the pack is that, although it follows an elite special-ops military team, NBC describes it as a group of \u201celite undercover military heroes.\u201d Characters are involved with intelligence work, sniping and other more discreet lines of combat. The focus is less on all-out warfare and more on espionage.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t your typical straightforward military show,\u201d said actor Demetrius Grosse. \u201cThe thing that makes the show unique and special is that you see the behind-the-scenes things that you normally wouldn\u2019t associate with military: espionage, code switching, deep cover kind of stuff.\u201d", "images":
