Online. \"I happily oblige respectfully, so I can sit next to her.\"\n\nThe upcoming pay-per-view is set for Sunday, June 17, in Chicago.\n\nRousey made her in-ring debut for WWE at WrestleMania 34 as part of a tag team match alongside Kurt Angle, taking on Triple H and Stephanie McMahon. However, the upcoming battle will not only represent her start of competing in the women's division, it will give her a chance at a title.\n\nJax is the current Raw women's champion, beating Alexa Bliss for the belt at WrestleMania. While she has already successfully defended her title, she knows Rousey represents a different challenge.\n\n\"I've never been in a ring with somebody like Ronda,\" Jax said. \"She's one of a kind, so there definitely has to be an alternation to my regimen and I'm looking forward to it.\"\n\nWhile Rousey is new to the sport, her mixed martial arts background makes her fun to watch in the ring, potentially creating an exciting battle at the next big PPV.", "images": ["https://static-assets.bleacherreport.net/img/molecules/nav/flagUKGray.png",
