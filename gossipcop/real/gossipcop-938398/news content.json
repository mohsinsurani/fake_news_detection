It doesn\u2019t typically involve quoting \u201cSprockets.\u201d But in 2016, when Liev Schreiber decided to retool his triplex apartment in Manhattan\u2019s NoHo district, the Saturday Night Live reference just seemed right. The initial brainstorms yielded proposals that struck the actor as \u201cuncomfortably Teutonic,\u201d he says, recounting his lively give-and-take with Ariel Ashe and Reinaldo Leandro, the 30-something principals who head up the AD100 New York design firm Ashe + Leandro. \u201cLike, \u2018I know you want to touch my monkey.\u2019 \u201d\n\nSchreiber, wearing a Rag & Bone sweater and jeans, in the kitchen of his NoHo loft. Douglas-fir and black lacquer cabinets by Ashe + Leandro; black soapstone counters. Fashion styling by Chloe Hartstein.\n\nSchreiber, of course, nails this line\u2014the accent, the inflection\u2014with diamond-laser accuracy. He couldn\u2019t have found a better audience for it. Ashe\u2019s first design job was on set at SNL, and her brother-in-law is Seth Meyers. Suffice it to say, she has a sense of humor. More to the point, Ashe and Leandro\u2019s work has an easygoing cool to it; it\u2019s rigorous, but it\u2019s also relaxed, not unlike the duo themselves. So, you don\u2019t want \u201cSprockets\u201d? OK, no \u201cSprockets.\u201d Put into practice at Schreiber\u2019s apartment, the Ashe + Leandro approach\u2014modernist yet utterly livable\u2014has yielded something that all three agree is rare in the age of too-tall, too-skinny condo towers and Edison-bulbed brownstone renos. \u201cWe wanted it to feel like a real New York space,\u201d Leandro says. And it does. Schreiber knows from real New York spaces.\n\nHe grew up virtually around the corner, spending a chunk of his boyhood at the corner of 1st and First. \u201cThis reminds me of my friends\u2019 lofts down in SoHo when we were kids,\u201d the actor says, settling his six-foot-three frame into one of the living room\u2019s outsize sofas, which Schreiber already owned. (During the nine-month renovation, this specimen, too big to get out the door, was wrapped and lashed to the ceiling.) \u201cThat, for me, felt like home\u2014something that had art in it and had that kind of rawness and openness.\u201d Schreiber\u2019s place has all of that, in spades.\n\nThe space itself has some backstory: Starting in the late \u201990s, Schreiber cobbled together the three-level, three-bedroom apartment from a couple of units in this circa-1880, redbrick, Neo-Grec industrial building. The Yale Drama grad\u2019s career had taken off following a breakthrough role in Nora Ephron\u2019s Mixed Nuts. Soon enough came Scream (and Scream 2), and an eye-opening turn as Hamlet in 1999 at the Public Theater, just a few blocks away. The bachelor pad, tricked out with help from his older brother, a stonemason, served Schreiber well.\n\nLiev was very clear that he didn\u2019t want a bachelor pad.\n\nAfter he partnered up with Naomi Watts, in 2005, the place became the stage for a whole new production: family life. (Their sons, Sasha and Kai, are now ten and nine.) Still, the couple got the itch for a new home. And in 2012, they found digs farther downtown, hiring Ashe and Leandro to do the job (AD, March 2016). When Schreiber and Watts separated, in late 2016, he was determined to create something new from his beloved old NoHo apartment. He felt a real rapport with the designers, so he enlisted them to update the space for his life now. \u201cLiev was very clear that he didn\u2019t want a bachelor pad,\u201d Leandro says. \u201cHe wanted a real home, one that catered to family and kids.\u201d\n\nInside Liev Schreiber\u2019s Industrial NYC Apartment\n\nSo, with no shortage of punchy back-and-forth between client and design team, the bachelor pad grew up. As Schreiber puts it, \u201cThey\u2019d do things, and I\u2019d say, \u2018You know, I\u2019m not as butch as you think I am! Warm it up!\u2019 \u201d Ashe admits that the bestubbled actor, with his hulking presence and flair for hard-bitten roles, did seem, at first, \u201csort of terrifying.\u201d But, she says, she managed to emerge victorious: \u201cWe\u2019d bring new stuff over, and he\u2019d be like, \u2018No. Hate it.\u2019 And I\u2019d say, \u2018Call me in three days.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc4c650232a884f6e22/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/AD060118_WELL01_50.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc3c650232a884f6e1f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/579-AD_Schreiber_PORTRAIT02_085-02-02.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc4c650232a884f6e22/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/AD060118_WELL01_50.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us-reverse.0ae5c38d353e00b66b06ff79880d6cbcaac70fc2.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/633b22925c0b45bc4084f433/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc4c650232a884f6e23/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/AD060118_WELL02_01.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/6320eb3013690b6b4958324c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc675a4f940de3da7b2/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/AD060118_WELL06_01.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us.651c7dd3bde4415d6ae6e43ca752399cf2213fc2.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc375a4f940de3da7ae/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/579-AD_Schreiber_STAIRCASE_015-02-02.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/63333d09a864262fc9833d3f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/633c7169fa166362d91531c2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc4c650232a884f6e22/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/AD060118_WELL01_50.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Mark Rozzo", "Douglas Friedman", "Michael Reynolds"], "canonical_link": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/liev-schreiber-new-york-city-apartment", "title": "Liev Schreiber Invites AD to Tour His New York City Apartment", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Liev Schreiber enlists Ashe + Leandro to turn his old bachelor pad into a home for him and his two sons", "id": "5b0440ba75a4f940de3da762", "keywords": "june 2018,liev schreiber", "news_keywords": "june 2018,liev schreiber", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b0440ba75a4f940de3da762", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Liev Schreiber enlists Ashe + Leandro to turn his old bachelor pad into a home for him and his two sons\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc3c650232a884f6e1f/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/579-AD_Schreiber_PORTRAIT02_085-02-02.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc3c650232a884f6e1f/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/579-AD_Schreiber_PORTRAIT02_085-02-02.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Liev Schreiber enlists Ashe + Leandro to turn his old bachelor pad into a home for him and his two sons", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc4c650232a884f6e22/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/AD060118_WELL01_50.jpg", "site_name": "Architectural Digest", "title": "Liev Schreiber Invites AD to Tour His New York City Apartment", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/liev-schreiber-new-york-city-apartment"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-23T12:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-23T12:00:00.000Z", "author": "Mark Rozzo"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ArchDigest", "description": "Liev Schreiber enlists Ashe + Leandro to turn his old bachelor pad into a home for him and his two sons", "domain": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5b046bc4c650232a884f6e22/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/AD060118_WELL01_50.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@ArchDigest", "title": "Liev Schreiber Invites AD to Tour His New York City Apartment"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267091300008193, "pages": 43794751042}, "google-signin-client_id": "960933707988-c28a5u0f04t7r9sdmr2u8ct9tioi4m1n.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527076800.0, "source": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "summary": ""}
