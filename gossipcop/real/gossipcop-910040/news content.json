I don\u2019t even know how !\u201d she captioned a shot of the performance on Instagram. \u201cMaybe one day you\u2019ll need a kidney \ud83d\ude02I got you \ud83d\udcaa\ud83c\udffe\u201d\n\nThe \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d singer added, \u201cCongrats on your Wins tonight you deserve I.T .You sing, dance play instrument, produce your videos S\u2014 you probably know how to build a house .You ARE AMAZING \u2026and you gave me rythm [sic].\u201d\n\nBe sure to check out PEOPLE\u2019s full Grammys coverage to get the latest news on music\u2019s big night.\n\nOriginally featured on Mars\u2019 24K Magic album, the song \u2014 co-written and produced by the Stereotypes \u2014 has a new jack-swing inspired beat and plenty of drums in the version with Cardi B. Of course, their performance brought the house down, and even included an extra verse from the rapper and a dance break to highlight Mars\u2019 skills.\n\nTheo Wargo/WireImage\n\nThe music video also features In Living Color-inspired themes, with both stars in colorful gear and boasting paint brushes as they dance.\n\nMars, 32, racked up the major awards of the night, winning six gramophones including best R&B album, song of the year, record of the year, best R&B song and best R&B performance (\u201cThat\u2019s What I Like\u201d). He won every category in which he was nominated, and even beat out JAY-Z and Kendrick Lamar for album of the year.\n\nTheo Wargo/WireImage\n\nIn his acceptance speech for album of the year, he also told a touching story about growing up in Hawaii and performing songs by Babyface, Jimmy Jan Lewis and Teddy Riley when he was 15, saying that the experience taught him how music brought everyone together.\n\n\u201cI remember seeing it first hand,\u201d Mars recalled. \u201cPeople dancing who had never met each other from two sides of the globe dancing with each other, toasting with each other, celebrating together. All I wanted to do with this album was that and those songs were written with nothing but joy and for one reason and for one reason only: love. That\u2019s all I wanted to bring with this album. Hopefully I can feel that again and see everybody dancing and everybody moving.\u201d\n\nThe 60th annual Grammy Awards, hosted by James Corden, were broadcast live on CBS from Madison Square Garden in New York City.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png",
