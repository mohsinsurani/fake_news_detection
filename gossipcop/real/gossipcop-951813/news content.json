Other sources say they had been discussing marriage and were planning to walk down the aisle.\n\nStill, another source maintains that there was never a formal engagement. But by all accounts, in the weeks prior to Monteith\u2019s trip to Vancouver, he was spending almost all of his time with Michele.\n\nVIDEO: Jane Lynch Chokes Up Remembering Cory Monteith\n\nOn Tuesday, in a statement via her reps, Michele, 26, extended her thanks for the outpouring of support during this devastating time.\n\n\u201cLea is deeply grateful for all the love and support she\u2019s received from family, friends and fans. Since Cory\u2019s passing, Lea has been grieving alongside his family and making appropriate arrangements with them,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cThey are supporting each other as they endure this profound loss together.\u201d\n\nThough the Glee costars hadn\u2019t been photographed in the days leading up to Monteith\u2019s shocking death, they were \u201chappy and very in love,\u201d a different source says.\n\nAfter dating for more than a year, Michele told PEOPLE that working with her real-life love was something she enjoyed.\n\n\u201cI love working with Cory, I always have,\u201d she said in September 2012. \u201cHe really, really inspires me, and he motivates me and I think he\u2019s just so talented. Working with him has been one of the best experiences of this whole process.\u201d\n\nWhen Monteith entered treatment for substance abuse last March, Michele stood by her man and the pair reunited and relaxed in Mexico in May.\n\nFans of Monteith may make donations in his name to three charities that were especially important to him: Project Limelight Society, which exposes youth living in Vancouver\u2019s Downtown Eastside to the arts; Virgin Unite, founded to support entrepreneurial efforts to better the world; and Chrysalis, which helps homeless and low-income individuals find employment.\n\nCory Monteith\u2019s 11 Best Glee Performances\n\n", "images":
