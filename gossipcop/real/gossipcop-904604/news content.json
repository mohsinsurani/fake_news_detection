(And maybe they got a drink from Tom Hanks?)\n\nIn her telling, Carey\u2019s apology was met with graciousness by Streep, who told her, \u201cYou can take my seat any time!\u201d\n\nTwitter followers couldn\u2019t get enough. As one wrote: \u201cTwo women at the top of their game!\u201d\n\nThe 75th annual Golden Globes were presented live on NBC from the Beverly Hilton in Beverly Hills, California, on Sunday.", "images":
