That was when I was 14 years old. And at age 15, my friend calls me and says: \"Hey, this manager wants to start this singing group for girls.\" So I started at age 15, after school, to go to the Valley [San Fernando] with my mother and went to these rehearsals with these girls and I was in this group of girls for 11 years called Wild Orchid. \"\n\nFor now, it's nice It's well known that Fergie spent a year of that time between childhood stardom and the fame of Black Eyed Peas just floating over the abyss.\n\nHe sat with Oprah Winfrey ] for Oprah's next chapter in 2012 and reflected on how, a little over a decade ago, he was broke, with a drug problem and a career in ruins, his substance of choice was methamphetamine, sometimes considered lightly as a party drug (or as the co-star of Breaking Bad ) but which actually wreaks havoc on the brain.\n\n\"Does a lot of things,\" Fergie acknowledged when Winfrey commented on the effects methamphetamine. \"It's not good \u2026 It can make you crazy. \"\n\n\" What helped me was a lot of therapy, deep searching, finding out why I took the drugs in the first place, because that's really what it is, \"the singer said.\n\nWhy did it start? to do methamphetamine?", "images": ["https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017117/rs_915x1024-171207114201-634-fergie-2004.jpg", "https://tech2.org/the-story-of-fergies-dramatic-comeback-after-touching-rock-bottom/l", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017117/rs_763x1024-171207112233-634-fergie-kids-incorporated.jpg", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017117/rs_634x1024-171207114830-634-fergie-2009-brown-hair.jpg", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2012820/634.JoshFergie.mh.092012.jpg", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017103/rs_600x600-171103161951-600.Fergie-Concert-Napa.ms.110317.jpg?fit=around", "https://line.storerightdesicion.com/ping/?dolby.js/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017117/rs_732x1024-171207113343-634-fergie-2001.jpg", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017117/rs_1024x759-171207114409-634-fergie-mtv-2004.jpg", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2017117/rs_634x1024-171207113531-634-fergie-90s.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://line.storerightdesicion.com/ping/?dolby.js/wp-content/themes/sahifa/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://tech2.org/the-story-of-fergies-dramatic-comeback-after-touching-rock-bottom/", "title": "The story of Fergie\u2019s dramatic comeback after touching rock bottom \u2013 tech2.org", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "The story of Fergie\u2019s dramatic comeback after touching rock bottom - tech2.org", "type": "article", "description": "[ad_1] Stacy on Kids Incorporated was the coolest.
