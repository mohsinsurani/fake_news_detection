You've given your teammates and the game your all for so many years...you've worked so hard and made us all so proud! Isaiah and I love you so much and are so excited to be able to have you home a lot more...We can't wait to cheer on the Nashville Predators WITH you in the stands!\n\nFisher scored 18 goals and 24 assists last season, helping the Predators make it to the Western Conference title. Unfortunately, they fell short of bagging the Stanley Cup Final trophy after losing to the Pittsburgh Penguins in six games.\n\nThe 37-year-old hockey star began his career in hockey with the Ottawa Senators, where he became known for his aggressive play style and eventual offensive production.\n\nHe played for the Senators up to 2011. But before his time ended there, 2010 to be exact, Fisher exchanged vows with Underwood. They have a two-year-old son, Isaiah Michael.\n\nAfter all that, he was traded to the second and last team he will ever play for \u2014 the Nashville Predators. He won the NHL Foundation Player Award while playing for the squad.\n\nFisher is the first captain in the Predators history to retire. He is leaving with a whopping 1,088 career games under his belt.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/image/14/64/146421_a_66_66.jpg",
