{"url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-skincare-routines-review", "text": "With both Jenner sisters eager to share their hair, makeup and skincare recommendation on every app and social platform imaginable, it's pretty much impossible to determine who gives better beauty advice. Kendall and Kylie Jenner look flawless all the time, so how are we supposed to know which one of them to listen to when it comes to our own beauty regimens? In an attempt figure it out, I took their tips for a test drive and tried Kendall and Kylie's skincare routines to see which reigned supreme. The result? Two weeks worth of the glowiest skin I've ever had.\n\nKendall and Kylie are both adamant about using eye cream and sunscreen every day (tricks they picked up from Kim and Khloe, respectively), but the similarities in their regimens pretty much stop there.\n\nKendall has been open about her struggles with acne (which makes me love her even more, TBH), and the majority of her skincare routine is made up of prescription products she gets from her dermatologist. She also uses skincare from The Est\u00e9e Edit, a line that she helped create, as well as Elta MD sunscreen.\n\nKylie, whose skin seems to be a bit less irritable than her sister's (at least as far as she's shared), is a bit more experimental with her products, although she tends toward those with all-natural ingredients. Considering how beauty-obsessed she is, it's no surprise that she likes to try out a bunch of different things. (She changes skincare products almost as frequently as she changes hairstyles.) She's touted the below products (AKA, the ones I tested) as some of her all-time favorites, and has also recently professed her love for Nip + Fab Dargon's Blood Fix Serum, Nip + Fab's Glycolic Fix Night Pads, Mario Badescu's Drying Lotion, and Kiehl's Daily Reviving Concentrate.\n\nLet me just say: every single one of the products I tested exceeded my expectations \u2014 which, in hindsight, makes sense considering the KarJenners have access to the best skincare in the world. Every product did exactly what they promised to do for my skin, and all smelled straight-up amazing while doing it. Because of this, picking a \"winner\" didn't really make sense, especially considering how different their skincare needs are not only from each another's, but also from my own.\n\nWith that in mind, here are my honest opinions on every product in I sampled in the Kendall vs. Kylie skincare challenge. If you're looking to try any of them, you really can't go wrong. And the best part? Not a single one of them costs more than $60. Apparently, keeping up with the Kardashians is more affordable than I thought \u2014 at least as far as skincare goes.\n\nCleanser", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58919be974508ccc46b56910/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/UVclear-squiggles-web.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5893a8f8bb02f4c7663139b0/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-601352740.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58919be8bb02f4c7663137d8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Unknown.jpeg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58919c1074508ccc46b56912/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/s1803006-main-Lhero.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/582f4212c1bb0f0a13118667/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/1474466652164.jpeg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/589346daf133b9357a3f33a4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-02-02%2520at%252010.47.12%2520PM.png", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6335a7ee8611297b17473509/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58919c1174508ccc46b56915/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/creamy_eye_treatment_with_avocado-14-g-1468207616-km.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5893a8f7f133b9357a3f3427/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-fb.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63360d6c55284445707e12b5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63403a02741d4e9d391116dc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633f1aa2038a40336b350a05/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58919c0fbb02f4c7663137da/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/s1802941-main-Lhero.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633c63963d918e54c4fd37ca/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58919c1174508ccc46b56916/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/mimosa-blossom-cream.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63397fc942ae4e4fa7da20d8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5893a8f7f133b9357a3f3427/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Zo\u00eb Weiner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-skincare-routines-review", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Kendall Jenner Skincare Routine Reviews", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "We put Kylie and Kendall Jenner's skincare routines to the test to see which sister gives better beauty advice.", "id": "589183fc74508ccc46b5690a", "keywords": "kylie jenner,kendall jenner,celebrity skincare,kylie jenner skincare,kendall jenner skincare,celebrity skincare routines", "news_keywords": "kylie jenner,kendall jenner,celebrity skincare,kylie jenner skincare,kendall jenner skincare,celebrity skincare routines", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "589183fc74508ccc46b5690a", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"We put Kylie and Kendall Jenner's skincare routines to the test to see which sister gives better beauty advice.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5893a8f8bb02f4c7663139b0/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-601352740.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5893a8f8bb02f4c7663139b0/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-601352740.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The results might surprise you.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5893a8f7f133b9357a3f3427/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "I Tried Kendall and Kylie\u2019s Skincare Routines to See Which One Wins", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-skincare-routines-review"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-02-02T21:51:28.844Z", "modified_time": "2017-02-02T21:51:28.844Z", "author": "Zo\u00eb Weiner"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "The results might surprise you.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5893a8f7f133b9357a3f3427/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kendall-jenner-kylie-jenner-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "I Tried Kendall and Kylie\u2019s Skincare Routines to See Which One Wins"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1486072288.844, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
