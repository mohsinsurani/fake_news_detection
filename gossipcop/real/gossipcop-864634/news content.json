She teased King that something was behind him, referring to the digital character. \u201cKing, there\u2019s something in front of you! What is that? It\u2019s behind you now!\u201d she quipped as Toni Basil\u2019s hit \u201cMickey\u201d blasted in the background.\n\nIn another video, she exclaimed, \u201cThere\u2019s something behind you, look! It\u2019s coming to get you right there. Oh my God!\u201d pointing behind her son.\n\n\u201cI told you something was behind you. Where\u2019d it go?\u201d she asked a curious King, who quickly turned around to look for the character.\n\nChyna then used a Hello Kitty filter on a smiling Dream \u2014 her 7-month-old daughter with Kardashian \u2014 who was bopping around to music while her mom chanted, \u201cGo Dream!\u201d\n\nKardashian and Chyna fueled speculation that they were getting back together when they were spotted with Dream at Disneyland on Father\u2019s Day in June. However, she seemed to put those rumors to rest on Instagram on Sunday.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blac-chyna-06894aeb-a6e7-45c0-84d7-f7907b174129.jpg?crop=0px%2C170px%2C1676px%2C942px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blac-chyna-06894aeb-a6e7-45c0-84d7-f7907b174129.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C1676px%2C880px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blac-chyna-06894aeb-a6e7-45c0-84d7-f7907b174129.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C1676px%2C880px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blac-chyna-confirms-shes-single-and-happy-w490710/", "title": "Blac Chyna Confirms She\u2019s \u2018Single\u2019 and \u2018Happy\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Just a day after Blac Chyna snapped adorable videos of a day out with her children, King and Dream, she posted a picture on Instagram stating she\u2019s 'single' and 'happy' \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blac Chyna Confirms She\u2019s \u2018Single\u2019 and \u2018Happy,\u2019 Hangs Out With Kids", "description": "Just a day after Blac Chyna snapped adorable videos of a day out with her children, King and Dream, she posted a picture on Instagram stating she\u2019s 'single' and 'happy' \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blac-chyna-confirms-shes-single-and-happy-w490710/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:54:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blac-chyna-06894aeb-a6e7-45c0-84d7-f7907b174129.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C1676px%2C880px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blac-chyna-06894aeb-a6e7-45c0-84d7-f7907b174129.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C1676px%2C880px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-07-02T19:05:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:54:30+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blac Chyna Confirms She\u2019s \u2018Single\u2019 and \u2018Happy,\u2019 Hangs Out With Kids", "description": "Just a day after Blac Chyna snapped adorable videos of a day out with her children, King and Dream, she posted a picture on Instagram stating she\u2019s 'single' and 'happy' \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/blac-chyna-06894aeb-a6e7-45c0-84d7-f7907b174129.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C1676px%2C880px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499022327.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
