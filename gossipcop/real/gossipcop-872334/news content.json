But when she does, it\u2019s powerful and terrifying, and when it\u2019s over, it\u2019s really over. (Power and terror are acceptable in a partner but absolutely necessary in a mother, as far as I\u2019m concerned),\" The opening pages, obtained by Entertainment Weekly, read. \"And she does mother very well, both our son, Jack, and me, when needed.\"\n\nPart of the memoir discusses Hollywood gossip and jealousy.\n\n\n\nImage: Getty\n\nAnna reveals that she feels jealousy when Chris has an on-screen kiss with an another actress, though she has learned to befriend them instead of stirring a dramatic situation. She says it's in a genuine way and not in a \"frenemy\" way.\n\nSimilarly, Chris felt jealous when Anna filmed scenes with Chris Evans in the 2011 film What's Your Number?, though they later became friends and Marvel colleagues.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Weekly, an entire chapter of Unqualified details every sweet thing Chris does for Anna, including, \"braiding her hair, writing poems and letters by hand from international locations, sending flowers to the set of Mom every Friday before the show tapes, and giving her thoughtful, and unexpected gifts.\"\n\nRelated: Everything we know about Chris Pratt and Anna Faris' split so far: loneliness, cheating rumours, Trump, and money issues\n\nChris and Anna announced their separation on Sunday.\n\nTaking to their respective social media accounts the pair posted an almost identical statement calling time on their time together.\n\n\"Anna and I are sad to announce we are legally separating,\" Chris wrote on Facebook. \"We tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward.\"", "images": ["https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/NeExLrWr9kAZqisHwuoqPMGw5BE=/0x13:585x343/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F038cb53e-cb6d-46b6-97cd-215b2887d471", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/4yUsnklKeDNWR0uiCz_Sv2u3Lmo=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F03%2Fninecouponsblue.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/WgMvdQ3c2_s1I4R9J90PZg6XfkA=/396x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F08%2F10%2F07%2F12%2FANNAFARISFIX1008_2.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/NHVfQOd4p_FZ-3N0omQFyTViY40=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F05%2F29%2F08%2F34%2Ffooter-creative-146x82.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/d4xEJS8rrdHN-r5zJSPw7c14ksc=/180x153:1080x660/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F117e577c-4386-4789-8adf-06abc0bdd192", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/gUeEeCavYaYPan0FlNkFqF7I65U=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F27e3d89d-8a28-4a03-99e2-12033f6af415", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/rGCwwoJxFIq81v9_WqdS-NXiD_s=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F24%2Fdomain_partner_module_lrg.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/m8gVRogNItHNEAXp7xnBU1H3mMw=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F09%2F01%2F10%2F23%2Fnational.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/E9RNc18C7X6vDY0hjdpf379Nx80=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F0a52b725-e1b8-400a-bfc4-6ce10a4254b2", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/rztiZlY9ajkVdSfptQrL0zKZqPs=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2022%2F09%2F09%2F17%2F35%2Flast_light.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/BHdwVsBJuA6QtNgevwAb6FpmEQw=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fc3379a04-9b1e-4e8c-955f-0e2c6a4d5315", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/THVNz_SMLuTy3qgiQ615OdoWZF0=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com%2Fvms-network-images-prod%2F2017%2F08%2F88208%2F170810_ENT_Prat.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/zODZAc23LwFdE6ROcnWEdl4NivY=/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F669e88ce-1e0b-4d57-b28d-fcfd0edb6385", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/LGQ5o-bu9wlWw8wRsW09LhPAtnA=/396x223/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2017%2F12%2F15%2F09%2F44%2Fhalle2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/THVNz_SMLuTy3qgiQ615OdoWZF0=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fs3-ap-southeast-2.amazonaws.com%2Fvms-network-images-prod%2F2017%2F08%2F88208%2F170810_ENT_Prat.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "//celebrity.nine.com.au/latest/chris-pratt-wrote-forword-anna-farris-book-unqualified/5c016116-83ee-4032-9649-df1cdae797a9", "title": "Chris Pratt wrote the foreword to Anna Faris' new book before announcing separation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00daa7", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/imgs/celebrity/ms-icon-144x144.f93a8f07.png", "theme-color": "#00daa7", "nine": {"video-player": {"nielsen-plugin": "{\"apid\":\"P366BEB07-2E11-4EE0-B65B-0E24519B7560\",\"sfcode\":\"dcr\",\"nsdkv\":\"511,\",\"apn\":\"nineFix\",\"section\":\"nine.com.au Honey -
