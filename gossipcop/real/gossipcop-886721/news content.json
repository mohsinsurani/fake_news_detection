The powerful producer has been accused of sexual assault and harassment by numerous women, dating back to his earliest years in the movie industry. (John Carucci/AP)\n\nIn 1984, Harvey Weinstein was 32 years old and making one of his first real feature films, on location outside of Scranton, Pa. It was a comedy called \u201cPlaying for Keeps,\u201d featuring a not-yet-famous Marisa Tomei, and the mood on set was anxious. Weinstein was foul-mouthed and domineering. He sparred routinely with his younger brother, Bob, his co-director. At one point, they wanted to shoot two versions of each scene because neither would compromise his vision.\n\nOne day, a young female crew member came to the office of lead producer Alan Brewer, an old high school friend of Harvey\u2019s from Queens, and started crying.\n\nWeinstein had asked her to come to his hotel room, ostensibly for work reasons, she told Brewer, but then kissed her. She resisted. Weinstein overpowered her. He forced her on the bed and attempted to perform oral sex on her. Eventually, she got him to stop.\n\nBrewer asked if she wanted to file a police report. (Another crew member heard the woman\u2019s account separately at the time, and corroborated Brewer\u2019s memories.) No, she said, shaking. She wanted to keep the job \u2014 but she wanted the co-director to stay away from her.\n\nWeinstein would go on to become the toast of Hollywood, building a mini-empire and a towering reputation as a cultural kingpin \u2014 and then it would all come crashing down with a series of damning stories over the past several days, by the New York Times and New Yorker, alleging years of harassment and criminal sexual abuse against women he encountered in his work as an A-list film producer. On Saturday, just days after being fired from his own company, the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences Board of Governors voted to expel Weinstein from the Academy, a major denunciation of someone who helped shape Oscar races for decades.\n\nIn interviews with 67 people currently or formerly in Weinstein\u2019s orbit, The Washington Post found three previously unreported allegations of sexual or physical assault \u2014 and a striking pattern, going back to the dawn of his career, of ruthlessness and ma\u00adnipu\u00adla\u00adtion.\n\nHe was violent toward women and men, and his abuse came in many forms \u2014 from screaming and berating to character assassination and nonconsensual advances. His behavior was both an open secret and a secret ritual.\n\nHow SNL went after Harvey Weinstein and sexual harassment in Hollywood\n\nWhen presented with the accounts in this report, Weinstein\u2019s representative Sallie Hofmeister reiterated previous statements: \u201cMr. Weinstein obviously can\u2019t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of those relationships were consensual,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cAny allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein.\u201d\n\nSome, who have known and worked with him for years, are still trying to fathom the severity of the accusations.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sad, I\u2019m disgusted,\u201d said publicity executive Cindi Berger, who represented Weinstein\u2019s films over the past two decades but says she never heard of any abusive sexual behavior. \u201cI learned so much from Harvey. . . . When people say he was a modern-day Louis B. Mayer, he was.\u201d\n\n\u201cEveryone knew these stories,\u201d one Hollywood publicist said. \u201cNot the specifics. But people knew it was a hostile work environment, and that he was a bully to people. Because he could win you an Oscar, we were all supposed to look the other way.\u201d (Several sources, who were not authorized to speak publicly or who fear Weinstein\u2019s wrath even now, spoke on the condition of anonymity.)\n\nBrewer, Weinstein\u2019s long-ago producer, is now 64 and living in Hermosa Beach, Calif. On Tuesday, when the New Yorker published a 2015 audio recording of Weinstein trying to lure a model into his hotel room, Brewer was stopped cold.\n\nIt took him back to the day before the \u201cPlaying for Keeps\u201d premiere, in Miramax\u2019s cramped Manhattan office. Weinstein, enraged that he had been out of pocket for a few hours, lunged at him and began punching him in the head, Brewer said; the skirmish tumbled into the corridor and then the elevator. By the time Brewer reached the street, intent on never associating with the Weinsteins again, he said, Harvey was pleading for him to stay and help ensure that their film got launched.\n\n\"Listening to the audiotape, it gave me this visceral reaction to my experience that day,\" Brewer said by phone Thursday. \"This alternating between violence, threats, commands and then begging, mock-crying, trying anything \u2014 any angle to get what he wanted.\"\n\n\n\nStory writers Weinstein, right, and Brad Grey, center, talk with journalist Michael Healy, left, on the set of \u201cThe Burning,\u201d outside Buffalo, N.Y. The 1981 film, which Weinstein also produced, was the first release by Miramax. (Stan Beinstein)\n\n\u2018He\u2019s very seductive at the start\u2019\n\nThrough sheer force of ambition, Weinstein, now 65, transformed himself from a pudgy kid from Flushing, Queens, into a wealthy mogul who could bend reality to his will. He was a college dropout who turned multiplex audiences on to foreign films and quirky indies; a genius of promotion who persuaded Oscar voters to pick his lighthearted \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d over epic front-runner \u201cSaving Private Ryan\u201d as best picture in 1999.\n\nHe grew up an unathletic honors student sharing a room with his brother in a lower-middle-class housing development. At 15, Harvey started going to foreign films at art-house cinemas. He played cards on Saturday nights with other boys who couldn\u2019t get dates. He had a \u201cfunny, whiny\u201d voice, and was often bullied, according to former classmates, but he was persistent, sure of himself, an operator.\n\nOnce, he crashed a Simon and Garfunkel concert with a friend, knocking on doors to the box seats until someone let them in.\n\n\u201cHe was supremely confident, and not worried about any repercussions,\u201d the friend recalled. \u201cIt was like, \u2018Eh, if they catch me, so what, I\u2019ll do it again.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAfter attending the University of Buffalo, Weinstein went into business with his brother, first as concert promoters and later, in 1979, in a small film-distribution company that they dubbed Miramax \u2014 a fusion of their parents\u2019 first names. Around that time, Lauri Githens was fresh out of college and working as a disc jockey. She remembered some unwritten rules of the Buffalo music scene in the early \u201980s.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t mention the competition on the air. Don\u2019t put two car ads in the same segment,\u201d she said this past week. \u201cAnd, if you\u2019re a young woman, don\u2019t be alone with Harvey Weinstein.\u201d\n\n[The growing list of women who have accused Harvey Weinstein of sexual misconduct]\n\nHis job then wasn\u2019t to make movies but to discover them and get them into theaters. His forcefulness was a boon for independent and foreign films that lacked bankable names. He would be their star, their champion, deploying a brassy, fearless persona to conduct cutthroat negotiations and impassioned publicity campaigns.\n\n\u201cPlaying for Keeps\u201d flopped with critics, but Miramax rebounded by seeking out promising projects, buying their rights and packaging them as must-sees for the masses. Miramax distributed the debut features of Steven Soderbergh in 1989 and Quentin Tarantino in 1992.\n\nBy the time \u201cPulp Fiction\u201d exploded a few years later, Miramax had expanded its work into development and production, and its logo symbolized the vanguard of edgy, independent cinema.\n\nAll the while, Weinstein was on the prowl.\n\nIn 1993, Washington arts patron Kay Kendall met Weinstein at the home of the novelist William Styron on Martha\u2019s Vineyard in Massachusetts. She told the producer \u2014 fresh off a sensational marketing campaign for \u201cThe Crying Game\u201d \u2014 that her 23-year-old daughter Katherine was an aspiring actress. Weinstein offered to help her career.\n\nWithin a week, Katherine Kendall had a meeting at Weinstein\u2019s New York office. He invited her to his apartment, where she said he took off his clothes and asked for a massage. Horrified, she said that she made up a story about meeting her boyfriend and tried to leave, but Weinstein insisted that he go with her.\n\n\u201cHarvey has a bargaining quality, a back-and-forth bullying that makes you just go \u2018okay,\u2019 \u201d she explained. She jumped out of their taxi blocks later and ran inside a bar, begging the bartender to pretend that he was her boyfriend.\n\nWeinstein sat in the cab, watching.\n\nKatherine Kendall didn\u2019t tell anyone in a position of authority. \u201cThere were no cuts or bruises, so what recourse did I have?\u201d she said. \u201cSo I thought immediately: \u2018I better shut up. No one is going to care.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat same year, Warren Leight worked with Weinstein as director on \u201cThe Night We Never Met,\u201d a romantic comedy starring Matthew Broderick and Annabella Sciorra.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s very seductive at the start,\u201d Leight said. \u201cYou think he understands you and your destiny is about to change.\u201d\n\nBut Weinstein\u2019s behavior was erratic. Leight said Weinstein pressured him to ask an actress to \u201cshow tit\u201d on screen, though the script required no nudity. Weinstein bulldozed the editing process, said Leight, who was unhappy with the cuts. He told Weinstein as much.\n\n\u201cRight now this feels like getting f---ed up the ass without Vaseline,\u201d Weinstein responded, according to Leight. \u201cBut in 10 years, it\u2019s going to seem like the best sex of your life.\u201d Each outburst, Leight said, would be followed by a gift basket and an apology.\n\nLeight was so worn down that he retreated from the film business, finding success in theater and television. In retrospect, he said, the abusive tactics that Weinstein used with women were in line with those he used with directors and male employees: the domination, the cycle of eruptions followed by contrition, the swagger, accompanied by shows of neediness.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s absolutely the same behavior,\u201d Leight said.\n\n\u2018A friend of Harvey\u2019s\u2019\n\nShow business is known for its comically unbalanced ratio of supply and demand: Hordes of young, aspiring actors and filmmakers scrap over every grunt-level Hollywood position. For a toehold in the industry, hopefuls will endure bad parts, low pay, long hours and a level of mistreatment that might not stand in other professions.\n\nSeveral people interviewed by The Post said that a desire to keep working in the business would prompt many of their colleagues to stay silent about any mistreatment they experienced. And that Weinstein\u2019s immense talent and vast power allowed him to keep going.\n\nLouisette Geiss, one of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, said that she had heard before she met him that Weinstein could be lewd, but she didn\u2019t know the full extent. She felt compelled to meet with him anyway, because as an aspiring screenwriter, she thought it could change the course of her career.\n\n\u201cYou hear about it all the time,\u201d said Geiss, who has since left show business. \u201cThat one moment when you get to pitch your script \u2014 and this is Harvey Weinstein! There\u2019s that one moment when you are no one, and then you pitch a script and you are found.\u201d\n\nInstead, she said, she found herself fending off Weinstein\u2019s advances as he physically overpowered her in his hotel room during the 2008 Sundance Film Festival.\n\nThe offices of the Weinstein Co. in Los Angeles are a stark, white-marble edifice on Wilshire Boulevard. One mile west is the Peninsula Beverly Hills hotel, where the New York-based producer often stayed, and where many of his alleged assaults were said to have taken place.\n\nWorking at the Weinstein Co., which the brothers founded after leaving Miramax in 2005, was seen as a launchpad for ambitious Hollywood newcomers. One former employee recently speculated why: \u201cBecause people knew that if you had worked there, you could put up with anything.\u201d\n\nWest Coast employees employed a system of alerts, passed along by whisper, to prepare for the boss\u2019s arrival.\n\nHarvey is coming.\n\nHarvey is five minutes out.\n\nHarvey is on a kick about \u201cTulip Fever.\u201d If you haven\u2019t seen it, make sure you do now.\n\nOne preparation \u2014 described by multiple individuals and recognized as both practical and ridiculous \u2014 was to hide all the office candy bowls.\n\n\u201cHe would take and eat them all and his blood sugar would spike,\u201d the former employee explained. \u201cWe were trying to control his moods.\u201d\n\nThe mood swings, the employee said, were frequent and relentless. Workers discussed in hushed tones how to manage them. There was a rumor of one junior-level employee being fired and then rehired in the span of three minutes, and another being dumped unceremoniously on the side of a New York state highway.\n\n\u201cIt was not clear that he was assaulting people,\u201d the former employee said. \u201cBut was it clear that he was trading his power for sexual favors? Yes.\u201d\n\nIf an actress was described around the office as \u201ca friend of Harvey\u2019s,\u201d then it meant that a meeting involving her might be other than professional: She was a person Harvey was courting, or hoping to, and not necessarily there because of her acting talent, the employee said.\n\n\"What you have to understand is, Harvey was somebody who everybody who worked there didn't like,\" another former employee said. \"Talking s--- about Harvey was the normal course of action. He's disgusting. He's rude. He has food on his shirt.\"\n\nIn some ways, the second former employee said, Weinstein\u2019s blatant bad behavior managed to mask his more insidious tendencies. In other words, you didn\u2019t believe he could be any worse in private than you had seen him behave in public.\n\n\u201cIf I heard another gross thing about him,\u201d the second former employee said, \u201cI just wouldn\u2019t think that hard about it.\u201d\n\nSome women who have made claims against Weinstein have alleged that his assistants were facilitators of his behavior, or said they were in the room immediately before he assaulted them. A representative of the Weinstein Co. said that no one knew there was nonconsensual sexual activity going on. The company has nearly 200 employees, the representative said, and very few of them witnessed Weinstein\u2019s day-to-day life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m upset for the employees of the company,\u201d said the representative, who spoke on the condition of anonymity. \u201cThere\u2019s people saying we aided and abetted him. I understand that narrative, but it\u2019s unfair and untrue. The whole industry is as guilty as we are. Ex-employees of his, colleagues everywhere \u2014 we all knew the same man. No one knew that he was hurting these women. Which, in hindsight, is pretty stupid.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just thought we were seeing the bad end of a bad temper,\u201d said one industry professional, who often encountered him over several decades. \u201cI once watched him fire his whole staff at an awards show. It was one of the worst things I\u2019ve witnessed \u2014 they were running away in tears and crying in parking lots.\u201d\n\nBut people put up with it.\n\n\u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d was a beautiful film.\n\n\u201cGood Will Hunting\u201d was a beautiful film.\n\nA parade of beautiful movies followed Harvey Weinstein. Beautiful movies sometimes made by miserable people.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s a man who would take a little film that couldn\u2019t and make it into hits that won Oscars,\u201d said the publicist who watched Weinstein fire his entire staff. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t the only one to do that, but he had a really good track record. Sometimes, to do that, you have to be a steamroller. I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s right or wrong. I think it\u2019s wrong.\u201d A pause. \u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\n\u2018What have you heard about me?\u2019\n\nWeinstein seemed to be aware of his reputation as both a stubborn lech and a Machiavellian operator. The journalist Kim Masters, who has covered Hollywood for more than 25 years, first met him at a lunch in the 1990s.\n\n\u201cHe said, \u2018What have you heard about me?\u2019\u201d Masters said. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018I\u2019ve heard you rape women.\u2019 \u201d\n\nWeinstein responded, Masters said, \u201cwith neither shock nor anger.\u201d\n\nNow an editor at large for the Hollywood Reporter, Masters said the magazine tried \u201creally hard\u201d to publish a report on Weinstein\u2019s sexual behavior a few years ago. But the source backed out, leaving it without on-the-record corroboration of festering rumors.\n\n\u201cHe had this way of bending people to his will,\u201d said Larry Hackett, former editor of People magazine. \u201cMichael Eisner didn\u2019t call you, Alan Horn didn\u2019t call you, but Harvey did. Harvey was the Trump of the movie industry. He knew what was a good story. He knew how it worked. He knew what a deadline was. He knew about the caring and feeding of gossip columns.\u201d\n\n\n\nJournalist Kim Masters says an earlier attempt, by the Hollywood Reporter, to report Weinstein\u2019s abuse fell short when a source backed out. (Michael Loccisano/Getty Images for Peabody)\n\nWhen \u201cInglourious Basterds\u201d was coming out in late summer 2009, Weinstein called him.\n\n\u201cLarry, I want the cover,\u201d Weinstein said, according to Hackett, who balked at being pitched a bloody Tarantino movie.\n\n\u201cHarvey, this is People magazine,\u201d Hackett replied. \u201cWe do Julia Roberts movies.\u201d\n\nBut Weinstein provided the film\u2019s star, Brad Pitt, and People ran him on the cover, five days before the film\u2019s opening, with the headline \u201cBrad opens up to People.\u201d\n\nNew York journalists said Weinstein \u2014 one of the few Hollywood moguls based in the city \u2014 was a frequent source of scoops and celebrity gossip for tabloid papers. Many Weinstein-watchers took note of what seemed to be an orchestrated media campaign against Ambra Battilana Gutierrez, the model who accused Weinstein of groping her in a Tribeca hotel room in 2015.\n\nThe New York Post published photos of her in a bikini and labeled her \u201cGrope Beauty\u201d on its cover. Its Page Six column reported that a police source said there was no physical evidence for Gutierrez\u2019s claim. In fact, Gutierrez had worn a hidden police microphone and recorded Weinstein apologizing to her for the incident.\n\nBut Weinstein had a knack for flattering reporters. He once had his staff put together a mock poster for \u201cPage Six: The Movie\u201d \u2014 starring George Clooney, Nicole Kidman, Russell Crowe, Mel Gibson and Matt Damon as the column\u2019s authors \u2014 and sent it to the newsroom.\n\n\u201cUnfortunately, everyone likes to be around glamour, right?\u201d said Tina Brown, the veteran New York City editor who oversaw Talk magazine, a much-hyped but short-lived project of Miramax. \u201cAll these favors and goodies were cherished by these reporters. It wasn\u2019t worth it to them to disrupt that system.\u201d\n\nWeinstein was occasionally the subject of stories, which he also tried to control. After reports that he had been spotted with supermodel Gisele B\u00fcndchen at a nightclub, he contacted Lloyd Grove, author of the New York Daily News\u2019s gossip column from 2003 to 2006. \u201cHe asked me to do a follow-up item saying they were just friends,\u201d said Grove, who sensed that Weinstein was trying to calm the suspicions of his then-wife, Eve.\n\nOn another occasion, Grove said Weinstein \u201ccajoled and threatened\u201d him when he wouldn\u2019t kill an item about Weinstein\u2019s divorce from Eve. Weinstein first tried to trade the item for another bit of gossip, Grove said, and next threatened to ban him from Miramax\u2019s film screenings. Grove said he could buy his own movie tickets.\n\nEventually, Grove said, Weinstein backed down when he realized he had no leverage. But first, he said something Grove said \u201cshould be embroidered on a pillow. He said, \u2018I\u2019m the scariest m-----f----- you\u2019ll ever have as an enemy in this town.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018It\u2019s just a kiss\u2019\n\nAs difficult as Weinstein was in private, in public he presented himself as a champion of liberal political campaigns and overlooked causes.\n\n\n\nDirector and actress Lina Esco says that Weinstein pressed her to kiss him \u2014 and also presented himself as a champion of women. (VALERIE MACON/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nIn 2014, a young director and actress named Lina Esco gave Weinstein a \"very special thanks to\" credit in her first film, \"Free the Nipple,\" a feminist look at gender inequality and objectification. While making it, she struggled to find the right editor and, at a friend's urging, contacted Weinstein, who offered assistance.\n\nWhat Esco didn\u2019t publicly share until she was contacted by The Post last week was a previous interaction she had with Weinstein. Around 2010, they were introduced through a mutual friend, in a casual and platonic setting, and she accepted his invitation to dine with him at the Peninsula. Esco viewed it as a chance to talk with a mentor about film craft. But toward the end of dinner, she said, Weinstein told her: \u201cI think we should see a movie in the theater, like back in the day, and we should kiss.\u201d\n\nShe brushed him off by saying she didn\u2019t date older guys, but she said he pressed on \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s just a kiss\u201d \u2014 and kept pressing.\n\n\u201cHe tried to insinuate that everything would be easier for me if I went along,\u201d Esco remembered. Increasingly uncomfortable, she tried to speed up the dinner, but assumed it was an isolated incident.\n\nHer story illustrates the complicated vortex of Harvey Weinstein: He'd been inappropriate. But he was the most powerful man she knew. She was a feminist. And he'd presented himself as a champion of women. He implied that she needed him. He'd set up a Hollywood world in which everyone needed him.\n\nLast week, when the allegations started to pour in, Esco realized that her dinner hadn\u2019t been an isolated incident. \u201cIt all made me want to puke,\u201d she said. \u201cI sat and had dinner with this guy. I had dinner with this guy and it turns out he is everything I stand against.\u201d\n\nYet within liberal politics, Weinstein was seemingly everywhere: White House state dinners, fundraisers alongside Leonardo DiCaprio, the premiere of \u201cShakespeare in Love\u201d with Hillary Clinton on his arm.\n\nHe called her \"the first lady of all our hearts,\" the New York Times reported at the time.\n\nShe called Weinstein \u201cmy friend Harvey.\u201d\n\nHis personal giving was dwarfed by that of many other showbiz moguls \u2014 only $1.8 million since 1979. But when President Bill Clinton sought help for his legal-defense fund during the Monica Lewinsky saga, Weinstein cut a $10,000 check.\n\n\n\nIn 2012, Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Weinstein attend the Time 100 Gala in Manhattan. At the premiere of \u201cShakespeare in Love,\u201d Clinton was on his arm. (Larry Busacca/Getty Images for Time)\n\n\u201cIt would be almost impossible not to go to something that he convened over the years; he just did so much,\u201d said longtime Clinton donor Alan Patricof. \u201cI did a lot of fundraising for the Clintons over the years, but I was throwing pancake breakfasts. His were not pancake breakfasts.\u201d\n\nOn Oct. 5, as the first allegations of sexual harassment broke in the New York Times, Weinstein issued to the paper a rambling statement of apology that seemed crafted to remind readers of his liberal bona fides, joking about his wish to give President Trump \"a retirement party\" and vowing some form of atonement through political work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to give the [National Rifle Association] my full attention,\u201d Weinstein wrote, adding that he would establish a $5 million scholarship foundation at the University of Southern California for women directors.\n\n\u201cIt will be named after my mom,\u201d he wrote, \u201cand I won\u2019t disappoint her.\u201d\n\n\n\nWeinstein and Ben Affleck attend the 2013 Producers Guild Awards in Beverly Hills, Calif.

In 2015, dozens of women, one after another, accused legendary comedian Bill Cosby of drugging and assaulting them over nearly 50 years. In early 2016, female employees of Fox News, spurred on by high-profile host Gretchen Carlson, accused chief executive Roger Ailes of sexual harassment. He resigned that July. Less than a year later, Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly was ousted under similar circumstances.\n\nMeanwhile, Trump \u2014 publicly accused of harassing or groping more than a dozen women \u2014 achieved the nation\u2019s highest office, an event that some women found crushing but also catalyzing.\n\nBrown, who said she had never heard anything but milder rumors about Weinstein, called the election \u201ca tipping point for a great many women.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe dam has broken for Mr. Weinstein and for others,\u201d said the lawyer Gloria Allred. She is representing several of Weinstein\u2019s accusers, but said she has \u201calso been getting calls about other men in Hollywood. Studio executives, A-list actors. Big names. Names you would know.\u201d\n\nThough she represented more than 30 of Cosby\u2019s victims, she said she suspects \u201cthis is going to be bigger. It\u2019s a tsunami.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday night in Los Angeles, a group of women met for their regular writers group, and they talked about Weinstein. One of the attendees was Cami Delavigne, the co-writer of \u201cBlue Valentine\u201d \u2014 a searing drama, starring Michelle Williams, that was distributed by the Weinstein Co. At its 2010 premiere, Delavigne approached the producer to thank him for having faith in the movie.\n\n\u201cWhat I got from him was a look up and down my body, and a look of disdain, and then I was dismissed,\u201d Delavigne said. \u201cAnd I see that form of dismissal if I look simply at the Weinstein Company\u2019s roster.\u201d The Weinsteins, she said, \u201cbuilt Soderbergh\u2019s career . . . built Tarantino\u2019s career, he championed Paul Thomas Anderson, he championed his boys \u2014 and there were no female voices in there.\u201d\n\nThe lack of female voices in Hollywood, Delavigne said, is \u201ca more entrenched danger, and entrenched culture.\u201d A common note she receives from producers, during the screenwriting process, is to make her female characters more \u201clikable.\u201d That one word, she said, epitomizes the film industry\u2019s attitude about women.\n\n\u201cIt is not \u2018likable\u2019 for a woman to say \u2018no,\u2019 to say \u2018you can\u2019t do that,\u2019 \u201d Delavigne said. \u201cThat is not likable. That is not charming. That is not sweet.\u201d\n\nAnd for 30 years, it was very important for women in Hollywood to be likable to Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\n\nChelsea Skidmore says that she met Weinstein around 2013. She says she had at least four encounters with Weinstein in which, under the pretense of discussing business, he would expose himself or try to coerce her into getting physical with other women. (Chelsea Skidmore)\n\nChelsea Skidmore met Weinstein around 2013, shortly after she moved to Los Angeles to pursue an acting and comedy career.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d love you,\u201d she remembers a producer saying. So she met Weinstein for tea in the lobby of the Peninsula. Two assistants joined at first, but he soon dismissed them.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re going upstairs,\u201d she said he told her.\n\nIn his suite, she said, he asked her for a massage. She tried to laugh it off, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not very good at massages.\u201d She said he then began masturbating in front of her. (Skidmore\u2019s mother confirmed that her daughter told her about the incident at the time; Geiss made an almost identical claim). And after he finished, while Skidmore sat in shock, Weinstein told her nonchalantly that he\u2019d like her to write a pilot for him.\n\nSkidmore would have at least three other encounters with Weinstein in which, under the pretense of discussing business, she said, he would expose himself or, on two occasions, try to coerce her into getting physical with other women \u2014 one of whom, at Weinstein\u2019s behest, would try to convince Skidmore to participate by saying, \u201cOh, but he\u2019s helped out so many girls.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe had just a very forceful way of going about things,\u201d Skidmore said in an interview with The Post, the first time she had publicly spoken about these encounters. \u201cHe forces himself on you, talks you into it and doesn\u2019t leave you with an option.\u201d\n\nBefore their final meeting, in 2016, she said he sent her text messages such as \u201cu r obviously mad at me?\u201d\n\nDuring that encounter, Skidmore tried again to keep the conversation focused on business, she said, until he walked into another room and returned naked.\n\n\u201cCan you help me out?\u201d she said he kept asking. \u201cCan you help me out? Can you help me out?\u201d\n\nHe was both needy and abusive, as on the day 30 years earlier when his \u201cPlaying for Keeps\u201d producer said Weinstein punched him and begged him to stay. Skidmore said he finally forced her to stand in front of the mirror, next to him, while he masturbated.\n\n\u201cI just grabbed my stuff and walked out and never talked to him again,\u201d Skidmore remembered. \u201cI was hysterically crying in the car. Went home really, really upset. Cried for a long time. Like, I\u2019m never, ever, doing that again.\u201d\n\nShe only decided to share her story after seeing other women\u2019s accounts, which made her feel that she wouldn\u2019t be alone.\n\nShe is still afraid that speaking out might hurt her career.\n\nHelena Andrews, Bethonie Butler, Alice Crites, Geoff Edgers, Paul Farhi, Emily Heil, Elahe Izadi, Kimberly Kindy, Stephanie Merry, Caitlin Moore, Anu Narayanswamy, Sarah Polus, Roxanne Roberts, Margaret Sullivan, Julie Tate, Ben Terris and Emily Yahr contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer-gray.png&w=3&h=2", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer-gray.png&w=1&h=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GLFC34VQJYI6PG4TXFYEHZL2EI.jpg&w=1484"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://arc-anglerfish-washpost-prod-washpost.s3.amazonaws.com/public/GLFC34VQJYI6PG4TXFYEHZL2EI.jpg&w=1484", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Monica Hesse", "Style Reporter", "Dan Zak", "Feature Writer", "October", "Monica Hesse Is A Columnist For The Washington Post'S Style Section", "Who Frequently Writes About Gender", "Its Impact On Society.
