They\u2019re a bunch of a**holes,\u201d he continued.\n\nThe actor goes on to recall a time a female reporter wrote false and discriminating stories about him after she \u201cpretended like she was in love.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf I ever see her again, I\u2019ll tell her to her face, I think she belongs in a zoo,\u201d he said. \u201cBunch of f***ing dirty whores!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou sit down with this sweet little nice girl and she seems to adore you and all this and that, and you're a perfect gentleman, and you know, unbelievable.\n\n\u201cThe way you combat is by let's not ever do an interview again to show these c***suckers,\u201d he said.\n\nIn the wake of the Harvey Weinstein scandal, a number of women have come forward with allegations of sexual harassment against Mr Seagal.\n\nWorld news in pictures Show all 50 1 /50 World news in pictures World news in pictures 30 September 2020 Pope Francis prays with priests at the end of a limited public audience at the San Damaso courtyard in The Vatican AFP via Getty World news in pictures 29 September 2020 A girl's silhouette is seen from behind a fabric in a tent along a beach by Beit Lahia in the northern Gaza Strip AFP via Getty World news in pictures 28 September 2020 A Chinese woman takes a photo of herself in front of a flower display dedicated to frontline health care workers during the COVID-19 pandemic in Beijing, China.
