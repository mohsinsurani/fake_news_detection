And here comes mama Tina Knowles to say what is on the minds of many Beyonce\u2019s fans.\n\nThe diva wore almost 7 million dollars worth of jewelry to the awards show that took place in New York.\n\nThe mother of three showed off her killer curves in a tight black dress and sported a huge hat all in a tribute to the Black Panthers.\n\nBlue Ivy even wore high heels and gave the media the viral moment it was seeking. It was supposed to be the Carters\u2019 night with JAY-Z\u2019s eight nominations.\n\nA post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Jan 28, 2018 at 2:58pm PST\n\nAs it turned out, it was a winless soir\u00e9e for Jay because Bruno Mars and Kendrick Lamar swept the event with epic performances and the number of trophies they picked up.\n\nMany are upset that Jay was snubbed this year and that Adele stole it from the Texan star in 2017.\n\nTina Knowles Lawson wrote: \u201cLast night at the Fammys, oops sorry, I mean the Grammys, Freudian slip.\u201d\n\nFans have reacted to Jay\u2019 loss in different ways; some say they are sore losers, while others think the Grammys used the couple and their daughter for ratings and embarrassed them.\n\nOne said: \u201cMy thing is they gave 11 Grammys to 2 people. They should spread them a lil more. Kendrick and Bruno deserved it but so did other people that\u2019s why they give out so many in the first place.But in all her years despite being nominated numerous times, and being deserving at least once, Beyonce has yet to win Album of the year. And don\u2019t tell me Jay-Z wasn\u2019t worthy of at least one of the 8 Grammys he was nominated for last night. Come on now.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Jan 28, 2018 at 10:45pm PST\n\nAnother claimed: \u201cOverrated: to rate or appraise too highly; overestimate: A LOT of artists work hard on what they do and what they present to people, Beyonc\u00e9 can sneeze, and Y\u2019all would make it a ringtone don\u2019t even lie. I\ufe0f can\u2019t stand a sore loser, have some class and let people that worked just as hard get their credit. Yeah, they can\u2019t win everything, but it\u2019s messed up and sketch how an artist can be nominated for 5+ awards and win not even one! \u2026. which is why they should attend the awards that FAIRLY celebrate everyone. BET, Soul Train; etc .. you know those that Y\u2019all pay dust.\u201d\n\nA post shared by Beyonc\u00e9 (@beyonce) on Jan 27, 2018 at 6:43pm PST\n\nA person told Tina to let it go and added: \u201cLet it gooooo. Let it goooooo. They can\u2019t win every freaking thing. Plus Bruno & Kendrick deserved those awards. lydiareignsPlease. I\u2019m sure Kendrick and Bruno don\u2019t think they are the Fammys (whatever that means).\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat are your thoughts?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/DylanFisher-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tiny-Harris-Working-Out-Atlanta-Mansion-300x192.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Raven-Symon\u00e9-T.I.-Clap-Back-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jay-z-and-blue-ivy-carter-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tina-Knowles-Jay-Z.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tiny-Tip-Have-Taken-Their-Second-Chance-Seriously-T.I.-Has-Even-Reached-Out-To-Jay-Z-For-Marital-Advice-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/katy-perry-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/blue-ivy-carter-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Rasheeda-Frost-Shower-Hair-300x216.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Game-Of-Thrones-Season-8-Spoilers-Winterfell-Will-Fall-Plus-A-Pregnancy-Twist-300x210.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/omarosa-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Ellen-DeGeneres-Shocks-Her-Audience-Calls-Out-Kenya-Moore-The-Host-Is-Gifting-The-Biggest-Prize-Ever-1-Million-300x169.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tina-Knowles-Jay-Z.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dylan Fisher", "Ja Bru", "Heather Cohen"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180205051713/http://celebrityinsider.org/tina-knowles-lawson-shades-the-grammys-after-jay-zs-winless-night-109953/", "title": "Tina Knowles Lawson Shades The Grammys After JAY-Z\u2019s Winless Night", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Dylan Fisher", "news_keywords": "beyonce, tina knowles,", "keywords": "celebrity news, beyonce, tina knowles,", "description": "Grammy night turned out to be a nightmare for queen Beyonce and her husband.
