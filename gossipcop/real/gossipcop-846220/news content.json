The Harpursville, New York, zoo has opened a baby-naming contest on their website after the calf\u2019s Saturday, April 15, birth.\n\nFans can submit any name for about 10 days, with an approximate end date of April 25, at nameaprilscalf.com. Each name submission costs $1 with a minimum purchase of five submissions. At the end of the voting period, the zoo will reveal the top 10 most popular names, and people can come back to vote on those 10 for about five days.\n\nThe proceeds from the contest will benefit the Giraffe Conservation Foundation, Animal Adventure Park and Ava\u2019s Little Heroes, a charity that helps families with medical expenses and is named after the zoo owners\u2019 daughter, who suffers from a rare form of epilepsy.\n\nAs previously reported, the internet-famous giraffe went into labor early Saturday morning after 16 months of pregnancy and gave birth to her fourth calf around 10 a.m. According to April\u2019s official Twitter account, the baby weighed 129 pounds and measured 5 feet, 9 inches. The event was livestreamed by approximately 1.2 million people after fans avidly watched for about two months prior in anticipation of the big day.\n\nAnimal Adventure Park owner Jordan Patch appeared on Good Morning America Monday, April 17, and said both April and her newborn are thriving. \u201cMom had a perfect delivery, perfect birthing,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a phenomenal mother thus far. Very protective and very encouraging of her calf. He\u2019s very outgoing. And Oliver [the father] \u2014 usually males have no part in raising of the young \u2014 [but] he\u2019s actually been quite inquisitive and getting nose to nose with baby. It\u2019s creating some very cute moments.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/ap_17105735261797_april-giraffe-zoom-8475f422-42eb-48ed-96ba-e0e07e537e60.jpg?crop=1px%2C239px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/ap_17105735261797_april-giraffe-zoom-8475f422-42eb-48ed-96ba-e0e07e537e60.jpg?crop=1px%2C239px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/april-the-giraffes-zoo-wants-you-to-name-her-calf-w477222/", "title": "April the Giraffe\u2019s Zoo Wants You to Name Her Calf", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Celebrity Pets", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Here\u2019s how you can help name April the giraffe\u2019s newborn calf!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "April the Giraffe\u2019s Zoo Wants You to Name Her Calf", "description": "Here\u2019s how you can help name April the giraffe\u2019s newborn calf!", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/april-the-giraffes-zoo-wants-you-to-name-her-calf-w477222/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T03:13:11+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/ap_17105735261797_april-giraffe-zoom-8475f422-42eb-48ed-96ba-e0e07e537e60.jpg?crop=1px%2C239px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/ap_17105735261797_april-giraffe-zoom-8475f422-42eb-48ed-96ba-e0e07e537e60.jpg?crop=1px%2C239px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-17T17:20:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T03:13:11+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "April the Giraffe\u2019s Zoo Wants You to Name Her Calf", "description": "Here\u2019s how you can help name April the giraffe\u2019s newborn calf!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/ap_17105735261797_april-giraffe-zoom-8475f422-42eb-48ed-96ba-e0e07e537e60.jpg?crop=1px%2C239px%2C1999px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492449600.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
