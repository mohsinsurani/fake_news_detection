You can act that way you want, try to depict me as the liar. I would like my exes to come out and say amber\u2019s never put a hand on me.\u201d\n\nBaier backtracks, asking, \u201cAre you saying you\u2019ve never put your hands on me?\u201d\n\nPortwood doesn\u2019t answer, saying, \u201cA lot of this shit is your fault. When you came after me \u2014\u201d getting cut off as Baier laughed and said, \u201cWhen I came after you? Oh my God. Now you\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\n\u201cKeep calling me a f\u2014ing liar, you\u2019re really gonna f\u2014ing get me crazy,\u201d she says, her anger mounting. \u201cI feel very uncomfortable, you lying piece of s\u2014, backstabbing con artist. You will not say, \u2018Yes, I did hit her.\u2019\n\nBaier shocks Portwood by saying, \u201cYes, I did hit her.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom\u2019s Amber Portwood Expecting Second Child\n\nMouth open, she stares at him before saying, \u201cOh my, God.\u201d\n\nIn last week\u2019s episode, the mother of one claimed Baier had physically assaulted her in the past.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the truth! Why do you think I\u2019m so angry? Because you put your f\u2014\u2014 hands on me,\u201d a standing Portwood screamed at a sitting Baier, whom she split from last year.\n\n\u201cOh b\u2014\u2014-,\u201d he fired back.\n\nAlthough the couple has parted ways and since found love with new people \u2014 Portwood is dating Andrew Glennon, with whom she is expecting a baby boy, and Baier is married to Jennifer Kathleen Conlon \u2014 he only wants the best for the MTV star.\n\n\u201cAll I ever wanted for Amber is for her to be happy and safe,\u201d Baier told E!

I wouldn\u2019t trade them for anything.\u201d\n\nMarriage Boot Camp: Family Edition airs Fridays (9 p.m. ET) on WE tv.", "images":
