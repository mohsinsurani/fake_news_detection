After making Halle Berry drink a cup (like, a full cup, y\u2019all) of whiskey at Comic-Con, he owed her the chance to get even. So after visiting Ellen, Berry left a sealed envelope with a dare intended for Channing to pay his debt.\n\nAnd the dare was well worth the wait. Halle Berry dared her Kingsman: The Golden Circle co-star, Channing Tatum, to dress up like a princess and sing \u201cLet It Go.\u201d We have ample evidence now that Channing Tatum is pretty much game for whatever\u2026so, obviously, he delivered.\n\nHis princess costume was really, truly what dreams are made of.\n\nOur jaws were frozen to the ground for his whole performance. We know he\u2019s an exceptionally talented dancer and performer, and he clearly pulled out all the stops to take on this role. We\u2019re sure that, somewhere out there, Idina Menzel is green with envy. (Looking at you, Wicked fans!)\n\nIf you want to see his performance, check out the video below \u2014 we skipped to the crucial part for your convenience.\n\nMake sure your volume\u2019s up and you\u2019re somewhere private, because not laughing out loud is so not an option.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kdMCw-6NGFE?feature=oembed\n\n(Oh, and fun fact: This isn\u2019t the first time Tatum has performed \u201cLet it Go.\u201d He also did so on Lip Sync Battle, and let\u2019s keep this trend going!)\n\nWe don\u2019t know if we\u2019d trade this for a Magic Mike show, but we\u2019re just saying\u2026 If we were offered the chance to see Channing Tatum perform something live, we\u2019d have to think about it for a very long minute.\n\nHuge props to Channing Tatum, who seems to have no problem letting it go to entertain us time and time again.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/09/15/channing-e1505510699257.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/09/15/channing-e1505510699257.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/09/15/channing-tatum-frozen.png", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='615'%20height='297'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/09/15/channing-e1505510699257.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Thorne"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/channing-tatum-halle-berry-dare-let-it-go/", "title": "Halle Berry dared Channing Tatum to dress like a princess and sing \"Let It Go,\" and he *went* for it -
