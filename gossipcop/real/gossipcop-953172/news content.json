Jenner, 20, was all smiles in a black minidress and combat boots for the night out, while Scott, 27, wore jeans and a t-shirt, accessorizing with a thick diamond-encrusted chain.\n\n247PAPS.TV / Splash News (2)\n\nThe couple, who have been dating since connecting at Coachella in April 2017, recently posed for their first-ever photo shoot together to grace the cover of GQ\u2018s August issue. In the interview, it was revealed that Scott hates restaurants, with Jenner telling the magazine they \u201cdon\u2019t go on dates.\u201d\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re not spending time together. In fact, their bond is stronger than ever, and when asked whether they\u2019re worried about the so-called \u201cKardashian curse\u201d \u2014 the belief that all the men who date a member of the famous family ultimately end up derailing \u2014 the couple was completely unfazed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even be looking at motherf\u2014ers,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI don\u2019t be looking at s\u2014. Kylie actually likes me for me. Man, hell nah. Nervous for what? I\u2019m on my own island. So hey, come over there to Astroworld. I\u2019m not into all the other s\u2014. I don\u2019t get involved. I\u2019m over here. Kylie is different.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott Aren\u2019t Worried About the \u2018Kardashian Curse\u2019: \u2018We Love Each Other\u2019\n\nJenner was equally unbothered by the notion, acknowledging that while Scott isn\u2019t \u201creally cool\u201d with her and her family\u2019s level of fame, \u201che deals with it, because we love each other and we have a family.\u201d (They welcomed daughter Stormi on Feb. 1)\n\n\u201cFor sure, I know he doesn\u2019t like the attention,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we just go the extra mile to keep our relationship super private, or like, if he has events or something, I won\u2019t come. Because I want him to do his own thing. I want him to be him. I don\u2019t want it to be Kylie and Trav. If people don\u2019t ever see us together, that\u2019s okay with me, because we just do our thing.\u201d", "images":
