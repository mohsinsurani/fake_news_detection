However, Thursday\u2019s episode went one step further when it took aim at Harvey Weinstein following the onslaught of sexual harassment allegations made against the longtime film producer in recent weeks.\n\nWhen fan-favorite Beverley Leslie (Leslie Jordan) came out to Megan Mullally\u2019s Karen as gay, she quipped, \u201cWhat\u2019s your next bombshell? Harvey Weinstein isn\u2019t always a perfect gentleman?\u201d\n\nThe episode was shot Oct. 11, six days after The New York Times first reported that Weinstein had paid off sexual harassment accusers for decades. The taping was also one day after The New Yorker\u2018s expose, in which 13 women accused Weinstein of sexual harassment, with three of those individuals also claiming he had raped them.\n\nIn September when speaking with THR about the Must See TV comedy\u2019s return, creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick discussed how they planned to mine the current landscape for laughs, just as they did during the comedy\u2019s original run when George W. Bush was in the White House. \u201cIt made for a lot of tension. When there\u2019s a lot of tension in the air, there\u2019s a lot to write,\u201d Mutchnick said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of tension in the air, so there\u2019s a lot of things to write and there are a lot of reasons to make an audience laugh.\u201d\n\nAs evidenced with Thursday\u2019s Harvey Weinstein jab, that philosophy extends beyond comedy. \u201cWe\u2019re not just talking politically, we\u2019re also talking culturally and down to the real particulars about how people live their lives, about what they\u2019re looking at on their phones and what they\u2019re into,\u201d Kohan said in September. \u201cThat\u2019s always been what the show has concerned itself with, with just sort of the minutiae of contemporary life \u2014 and that exists, it\u2019s just that the minutiae have changed.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s episode also saw a big change for Will (Eric McCormack). After he was promoted to senior partner at his longtime law firm, Will suddenly came to the realization that he actually didn\u2019t want to be a lawyer anymore. It was a surprising turn of events for the character after he spent the show\u2019s previous eight seasons practicing the law.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s about a certain maturity. You don\u2019t want these characters to ever get too mature, that would take all the fun of it,\u201d McCormack tells THR. \u201cBut he finally realizes he doesn\u2019t want to be a corporate lawyer for the rest of his life, that he\u2019s done that for 25 years and wants to start something new. So there\u2019s that sense of rebirth. The characters are being reborn, each of them are finding who they are at this age and that\u2019s been fun to add to the mix.\u201d\n\nMcCormack says it was important to show some changes for the characters in the new installments, despite largely keeping the quartet in the same place they were 11 years ago (i.e. ignoring the series finale and keeping Will and Grace living together and without children). \u201cWe still need growth,\u201d the star says. \u201cAnd I want that growth to be organic and not just something that we say, \u2018Oh by the way, in the interim, Will has taken up woodworking.\u2019 What happens with his job is something that happens very naturally.\u201d\n\nIn the end, Will decided to leave the law behind to find a new partnership with Grace. McCormack says he knew that was the right way to go with the story when Kohan and Mutchnick first told him their idea. \u201cNot only do they have lots of ideas of where we can go, but they\u2019re all ideas that are organic to the show and only going to give us new avenues to play in.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nup_179312_3332-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nup_179312_3332-h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nup_179312_3332-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Stanhope"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/will-grace-tackles-harvey-weinstein-scandal-1052147/", "title": "\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 Tackles Harvey Weinstein Scandal", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Thursday's episode of the beloved comedy also saw Eric make an unpredicted professional move.", "news_keywords": "Eric McCormack, Will and Grace", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Kate Stanhope", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1052147, "title": "'Will & Grace' Tackles Harvey Weinstein Scandal", "published_at": "2017-10-27 11:14:10", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/nup_179312_3332-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Will and Grace", "topics": "TV News", "body": "[Warning: This story contains spoilers from Thursday's episode of Will & Grace, \"How to Succeed in Business Without Really Crying.\"]\r\nIt's been 11 years since Will & Grace was last on the air, but the revival of the NBC multicam hasn't hesitated to embrace the present day.\r\nIn the five episodes that have aired so far, the series has name-dropped both President Donald Trump, in a reference to his criticized Puerto Rico relief efforts, as well as Vice President Mike Pence.
