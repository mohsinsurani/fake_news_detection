Cheryl Cole confronted reports that her mother, Joan Callaghan, influenced her split from Liam Payne.\n\n\u201cI hate responding to stuff esp at such difficult times but I cannot sit here and listen to such nasty, false articles regarding my mam. I don\u2019t know why they involve her in stores about me,\u201d the \u201cCall My Name\u201d songstress, 35, tweeted on Monday, July 2. \u201cI can assure you she has absolutely nothing to do with any of it. I am a grown woman who is capable of dealing with my own life. She is a soft and kind woman who doesn\u2019t deserve to be dragged into something that has nothing whatsoever to do with her.\u201d\n\nCole\u2019s statement comes one day after she and Payne, 24, revealed their split. \u201cWe are sad to announce that we are going our separate ways,\u201d the X Factor judge tweeted onSunday, July 1. \u201cIt\u2019s been a tough decision for us to make. We still have so much love for each other as a family. Bear is our world and we ask that you respect his privacy as we navigate our way through this together.\u201d\n\nThe pop star\u2019s statement slammed British tabloid reports that Callaghan moved in with Cole and Payne shortly after they welcomed son Bear, 13 months. Also, according to the Daily Mail, Callaghan posed a \u201cproblem\u201d in the former pair\u2019s relationship and got \u201cin the way.\u201d\n\nThe One Direction alum, who shares son Bear, 13 months, with Cole, tweeted a similar statement at the same time.\n\nThe British singers, who started dating in 2015, have been dodging split rumors throughout their relationship. The \u201cFamiliar\u201d songster spoke out about the reports in March, noting that the pair have normal fights, as most couples do.\n\n\u201cThe funniest thing was a week before we were getting married. The next week we\u2019re splitting up. And the thing is, for me, I just like to think we\u2019re somewhere in the middle,\u201d he told Lodon\u2019s ES Magazine at the time. \u201cYou know, we have our struggles \u2014 like, of course I\u2019m not gonna sit here and say that everything\u2019s absolutely fine and dandy, because of course you go through different things, and that\u2019s what a relationship is. But we go through them together as a family and that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/922620746_Cheryl-Cole-Liam-Payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/922620746_Cheryl-Cole-Liam-Payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/922620746_Cheryl-Cole-Liam-Payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cheryl-cole-slams-nasty-rumors-about-liam-payne-split/", "title": "Cheryl Cole Slams \u2018Nasty\u2019 Rumors About Liam Payne Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Cheryl Cole slammed \u2018nasty\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 rumors that her mother influenced her split from Liam Payne \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cheryl Cole Slams Rumors That Her Mom Cause Liam Payne Split", "description": "Cheryl Cole slammed \u2018nasty\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 rumors that her mother influenced her split from Liam Payne \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cheryl-cole-slams-nasty-rumors-about-liam-payne-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-02T22:56:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/922620746_Cheryl-Cole-Liam-Payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/922620746_Cheryl-Cole-Liam-Payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-02T22:56:43+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cheryl Cole Slams Rumors That Her Mom Cause Liam Payne Split", "description": "Cheryl Cole slammed \u2018nasty\u2019 and \u2018false\u2019 rumors that her mother influenced her split from Liam Payne \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/922620746_Cheryl-Cole-Liam-Payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530572203.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
