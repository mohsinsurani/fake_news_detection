The sun sets on Wilshire Boulevard and the glimmer of lights that\u2019s coming through the Neiman Marcus windows matches the twinkling bulbs wrapped around the towering palms outside. Inside, well-dressed patrons shuffle through racks, stroll the tree-adorned halls, slip on hats and gloves and enjoy their last sips of ros\u00e9 at the Bar on 4 before ringing an Uber and bringing their goodies home.\n\nIt\u2019s easy to get sucked in. The vibe at Neiman\u2019s is intoxicating, especially during the holiday season. On the first floor, Erika Girardi\u2014better known as dazzling pop icon, alter-ego Erika Jayne\u2014is eyeballing every glittering heel on the Balenciaga display and reminiscing about her life before the spotlight. She recalls her first big Neiman\u2019s purchase, a carefully-chosen pair of Gucci shoes. \u201cThey were black platforms,\u201d she says. \u201cI knew they would go with everything.\u201d\n\nGirardi has come along way from that moment. Her shopping style now? She lets out a wild laugh: \u201cJeez, I run through here like a maniac! I know what I want, I know my sizes and I rarely return things. To be able to shop in a place like this is pure luxury.\u201d She picks up a pair of sparkling, lightning-bolt adorned Balmain ankle boots and grins.\n\nWatch the video above to see if Girardi is able to control herself when she has Neiman Marcus Beverly Hills all to herself on one very unforgettable night.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bfed01150e1692d6a548f71/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NMthumb.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5c0581ce8df3d82d3acb6841/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/market_slide_.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6321e81932b60f6ccb286fdd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6334721ef28c35bd8f883442/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/633c978b8bcfab836af99cf0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632c9821865823be1b6826de/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5c0581ce8df3d82d3acb6840/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/market_slide_2.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5c0581d1f097772deb482d32/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/market_slide_16.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632914abe15ee95258860b6b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/63307a374441545acfb1a753/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5bfed01150e1692d6a548f71/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/NMthumb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/watch-erika-jayne-locked-inside-neiman-marcus", "title": "Watch Erika Jayne\u2019s Unexpected\u2014And Unforgettable\u2014Night at Neiman\u2019s", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The vibe at Neiman Marcus is intoxicating, especially during the holiday season.
