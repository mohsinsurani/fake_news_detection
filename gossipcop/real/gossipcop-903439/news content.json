{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/09/awards-season-guide", "text": "So you want to learn about awards season, the never-ending footrace that annually dominates, terrorizes, and energizes the film industry. When does the season actually begin, and when does it end? What\u2019s the purpose of all those film festivals in faraway locales? What goes into an Oscar campaign, and why, exactly, must Oscars be campaigned for in the first place? What makes the Oscars so all-encompassingly important for movies, anyway?\n\nThe answers you seek can be found below\u2014starting with a definition of what we mean by \u201cawards season\u201d in the first place.\n\nTHE TIME FRAME\n\nThe truth is that for the movie industry, awards season never really ends. When one Oscar ceremony concludes, insiders immediately begin plotting for the next cycle\u2014and so on and so forth. It\u2019s like an election, except they prepare to run for president every year, instead of every four.\n\nThe more targeted answer is that awards season generally kicks off in September, and ends, of course, with the Oscars\u2014i.e. the Academy Awards, presented by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences, more commonly known as the Academy. The Oscars are usually held in late February or early March\u2014though that will change in 2020.\n\nWHY SEPTEMBER?\n\nTo make sure everyone in the Academy remembers your movie during the Oscar-voting window, of course. Feature-length films are eligible for Oscars if they screen theatrically between January 1 and December 31 of a given year. (So the Oscars held in 2019 actually honor the best films of 2018.) Nomination-round voting lasts for one week in January.\n\nGiven that, studios usually release their best movies in the fall, in order to ensure that voters won\u2019t forget about them before voting begins. Many opt for a prime Thanksgiving or December 25 slot\u2014which allows a movie to get holiday spending bucks and be the freshest film on an Academy member\u2019s mind right before they vote. This timing explains why good movie options are so hard to find at the start of the new year, and why movies like Get Out, which was released in February 2017\u2014an entire year before the Oscars for which it was eligible\u2014are anomalies. It\u2019s typically impossible for a film to maintain hype for an entire calendar year.\n\nTo get even more specific: awards season really, truly begins with the Toronto International Film Festival, which takes place in early September. That competition, with its convenient date and easy access for North American media and industry types, has become known as an event that separates awards wheat from the chaff. But more on that below.\n\nTHE FESTIVALS\n\nThese film competitions are where the biggest projects typically make their debut and vie for early attention. Here are some key fests to know:", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b8eb27ae7127249bd46b8ba/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/guide-to-award-season-lede.jpg",
