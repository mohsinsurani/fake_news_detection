I grew up with a gay brother whose every move I would emulate. I idolized him. Everything Frankie did, I would do.

Sexuality and gender were never topics my family and I were afraid to discuss. When Frankie came out my surprisingly unfazed (for his age) grandfather said \u201cCongrats! Can we go to dinner now?
