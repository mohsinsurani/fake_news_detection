The 46-year old actor is adapting to being single and seeing his family. Pitt stays busy by meeting with his large group of guy friends, none of them in the business, riding his motorcycle, and having regular dinner and lunch meetings. Though Pitt doesn\u2019t see his six kids as much as he wants, he has been filling his time with family, including going back to his Missouri and Oklahoma roots. As far as dating? This recently divorced celebrity says it\u2019s complicated and not a priority.\n\nThis celebrity news shows us celebs aren\u2019t immune to having to adjust. What are some ways to know you\u2019re ready to get back into the dating scene when you have kids?\n\nCupid\u2019s Advice:\n\nBalance is key when you\u2019re a single parent. You have to make sure you balance the demands of your career with the demands of your family. Maintaining a house, both the operations and finances, alone can be a challenge. Somewhere in there, of course, you need to be able to take care of yourself. Here\u2019s Cupid\u2019s dating advice to help you get ready for dating again:\n\n1. Balance career: If you were the main bread-winner, maintaining the house and investing in your family was on the back burner because you had someone else helping you. When suddenly your support is gone, having the mental and physical energy to still invest in your career in addition to your new responsibilities can be daunting. Make sure your career is in a place where you can take some focus away and instead invest in yourself and a relationship.\n\nRelated Link: Former Celebrity Couple Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt Agree to Seal Divorce Documents\n\n2. Are your kids ready: With a large brood of kids like Brad Pitt, getting back into dating can be a lot harder. Each age range of childhood processes divorce differently, so each child will vary on their resistance to a parent returning to dating. As a parent, be ready for that resistance, but make sure you\u2019re caring for your children, too.\n\nRelated Link: Celebrity News: Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt Are Talking Again\n\n3. Length of relationship: Depending on the length of your marriage, you may need more time to cope post-divorce. Shared affairs, such a mortgages and finances, can be hard to unravel and separate. Aside from that, the emotional aspect of becoming suddenly single can be a shock. As fun as dating can be again, if you\u2019re looking for something more serious, consider giving yourself the adequate amount of time to heal and the appropriate length of courting before claiming a relationship is serious.\n\nAs a single parent, how have you decided when it was the right time to start dating again?
