If you haven\u2019t watched yet and want to remain spoiler-free, please keep that in mind.\n\nStranger Things was an instant sensation when it debuted on Netflix last year. Its potent blend of frights, \u201980s nostalgia, and the revival of Winona Ryder\u2019s career made it a hit with fans and critics alike. But there was one thing that Stranger Things fans loved above all else: Barb.\n\nIn season one, Barbara Holland was Nancy Wheeler\u2019s best friend, the nerdy high-schooler clad in Sally Jesse Raphael\u2019s glasses and a puffy, ridiculously cerulean parka. Barb was quiet but loyal, awkward but fabulous, forgotten by Hawkins, Indiana but remembered by the entire audience. She was so great, in fact, actress Shannon Purser nabbed an Emmy nomination for the part. Sadly, Barb was also one of the demogorgon\u2019s first victims. While everyone raced ahead to rescue Will Byers from the Upside Down, Stranger Things treated Barb\u2019s death with the sort of shrug normally reserved for dropping a coin down a storm drain or losing a half-broken umbrella. She was last seen in the Upside Down, with a gross slug monster crawling out of her corpse, and that appeared to be that.\n\nNow, with Stranger Things 2 set to dominate TV marathons this weekend and beyond, one question looms large: Will we finally get justice for Barb?\n\nThe second season opens with Nancy (Natalia Dyer) furious that no one really knows what happened to her friend. The trench coats at the Department of Energy stashed Barb\u2019s car at a bus station, so everyone in Hawkins thinks that she skipped town because teens kept mocking her proto-normcore fashion sense. \u201cIt\u2019s like everyone forgot, and no one cares,\u201d Nancy tells her boyfriend, Steve (Joe Keery). \u201cExcept her parents \u2026 and it\u2019s destroying them.\u201d\n\nCut to the Holland residence, where Nancy and Steve suffer through an excruciatingly sad dinner of KFC with Barb\u2019s parents as penance for knowing what really happened but not being able to tell them. Mr. and Mrs. Holland believe their daughter is still out there, and they\u2019re selling their house to pay a shady investigative journalist to track her down. Understandably, Nancy reacts to this news by getting wasted at a house party and slurring to Steve, \u201cYou\u2019re pretending like everything\u2019s okay. Like we didn\u2019t kill Barb. Like we\u2019re partying. We\u2019re partying.\u201d\n\nThe funny thing about Stranger Things 2 is that it basically mimics the format of Stranger Things original recipe. Will (Noah Schnapp) is in danger again. Both seasons feature a new girl wreaking havoc with the group dynamic of Mike (Finn Wolfhard), Dustin (Gaten Matarazzo), Lucas (Caleb McLaughlin). Will\u2019s mother Joyce Byers (Winona Ryder) once again goes from a well-coiffed cashier to someone with the hair of a Times Square Elmo. And just like last time, Nancy has to leave Steve and join up with Will\u2019s brother Jonathan (Charlie Heaton) in order to find Barb.\n\nSoon enough, Nancy learns that the \u201cjournalist\u201d is a conspiracy-theory nut named Murray Bauman (Brett Gelman), who believes that Barb tried to help the \u201cRussian girl\u201d who was seen around town \u2014 a.k.a. Eleven. His working theory is that Barb was killed because she knew too much. So, in a pretty ingenuous move, Nancy and Jonathan get themselves captured by the feds and taken to Hawkins Lab, where they meet Dr. Owens (Paul Reisder) and record him admitting what really happened to Barb. Then they take the tape to Murray in hopes of exposing the truth to the wider public.\n\nWhen they arrive at Murray\u2019s bunker, he has a wall dedicated to his Barb investigation and all of his \u201cevidence\u201d is connected with red strings. (He\u2019s basically like Carrie Mathison when she goes off her medicine, but I looked at that wall and thought, \u201cSame,\u201d because that is what my apartment looked like in the middle of my Barb fever too.) Nancy tells Murray that he has everything wrong about Barb and fills him in on the truth about the Upside Down. After he hears the tape of Dr. Owens, they come up with a plan to water down the story so that the press will actually report it. Then, for several episodes, Stranger Things yet again forgets about Barb while Nancy and Jonathan hook up, Eleven goes to Chicago to turn herself into Jessica Alba from Dark Angel, Steve reveals the secret to his pompadour come mullet, and everyone fights a bunch of devil dogs (a much better name than \u201cdemodogs,\u201d in my humble opinion).\n\nWith all of those non-Barb objectives complete, our heroine finally gets a funeral after the Department of Energy admits culpability in her death, claiming that she was poisoned and they conspired to cover it up. Presumably, Barb\u2019s parents got a nice settlement and Murray got paid, which is kind of ridiculous because Nancy and Jonathan did all the hard work. (All he did was lie around his nasty apartment, listening to jazz and drinking watered-down Stoli. Shouldn\u2019t the teens get a cut too?)\n\nIn the end, Barb is still dead and now everyone knows it, but they think that she was a mere victim of government malfeasance rather than the prey of an interdimensional alien that stalked her after her Nancy bailed to have sex with Steve. She gets some photos placed at the center of some nice bouquets during her funeral, but that\u2019s about it. She\u2019ll probably be forgotten again by the time Stranger Things 3 comes around.\n\nClearly, this is not what true justice looks like. Justice for Barb would be if someone actually appreciated her. If someone saw Barb for who she was and said, \u201cShe was great and she deserved better.\u201d Nancy is grappling with a lot of difficult emotions in Stranger Things 2, and she does the admirable thing by helping the Hollands find closure, but she\u2019s mostly just driven by a need to assuage her own guilt. That\u2019s not justice as much as it is penance.\n\nGet all your Stranger Things 2 questions answered at the show\u2019s Vulture Festival LA panel on November 18!
