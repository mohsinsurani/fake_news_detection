The 3-year-old daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton served as a bridesmaid in the wedding, while her brother Prince George was a page boy.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time we\u2019ve caught a glimpse of Charlotte\u2019s royal wave. As she visited her new baby brother, Prince Louis, at St. Mary's hospital in London earlier this year, she adorably waved at the crowd gathered outside.\n\nThe youngest members of the bridal party donned outfits by Amaia, one of Kate's preferred children's clothing brands.\n\nEugenie, 28, wed Jack Brooksbank, 32, at the same venue where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry tied the knot earlier this year. She wore a beautiful open-backed gown designed to show off her scar from surgery to correct her scoliosis, which she underwent at the tender age of 12.\n\nA champagne luncheon, hosted by the queen, took place just after the ceremony, with a second reception scheduled for the evening.\n\nRELATED STORIES", "images": ["https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100522_doctor_tamper.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1223619061322807&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.insideedition.com/undefined", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100622_rowing_ireland_web.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/img/logo.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100622_campus_horror_web_0.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/bull.jpg?h=c673cd1c?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100622_building_jumper_intv_web_0.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196"], "top_img": "https://www.insideedition.com/undefined", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.insideedition.com/princess-charlotte-steals-show-eugenies-wedding-her-adorable-wave-47556", "title": "Princess Charlotte Steals the Show at Eugenie's Wedding With Her Adorable Wave", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "The 3-year-old daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton served\u00a0as a bridesmaid in the wedding, while her brother Prince George was a page boy.", "og": {"description": "The 3-year-old daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton served\u00a0as a bridesmaid in the wedding, while her brother Prince George was a page boy.", "title": "Princess Charlotte Steals the Show at Eugenie's Wedding With Her Adorable Wave", "site_name": "Inside Edition", "url": "https://www.insideedition.com/princess-charlotte-steals-show-eugenies-wedding-her-adorable-wave-47556", "image": {"identifier": "undefined", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "type": "Articles", "video": "https://cbsi-insideedition-video-fastly.global.ssl.fastly.net/2019/09/09/1600010819714/101218_royal_cuteness_take2_webmov-5848094805001_296823_5192.mp4"}, "twitter": {"description": "The 3-year-old daughter of Prince William and Kate Middleton served\u00a0as a bridesmaid in the wedding, while her brother Prince George was a page boy.", "title": "Princess Charlotte Steals the Show at Eugenie's Wedding With Her Adorable Wave", "url": "https://www.insideedition.com/princess-charlotte-steals-show-eugenies-wedding-her-adorable-wave-47556", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@insideedition", "image": {"identifier": "undefined", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "site": {"identifier": "@insideedition", "id": 23603092}}, "title": "Princess Charlotte Steals the Show at Eugenie's Wedding With Her Adorable Wave", "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-12T05:56:18-0700", "opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Inside Edition, Royals, , Royals, royal wedding, princess charlotte, royals", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 38, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "fb": {"app_id": 966341826790079, "admins": 3111204, "pages": 71728150722}, "theme-color": "#fd005b", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539348978.0, "source": "https://www.insideedition.com", "summary": ""}
