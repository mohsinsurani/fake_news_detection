Schumer\u2019s rep declined to comment on whether their relationship was romantic at the time.\n\nThe pair were most recently spotted together in New York in January, as they arrived at NBC Studios to watch Saturday Night Live, which marked only the second time they had been seen in public together.\n\nMEGA\n\nFischer lives on Beetlebung Farm in Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where he grew up and wrote the James Beard Award-winning Beetlebung Farm Cookbook. His restaurant Beach Plum was touted by Esquire magazine in 2013 as a favorite of Barack and Michelle Obama.\n\nSchumer previously split from Ben Hanisch in May of last year.
