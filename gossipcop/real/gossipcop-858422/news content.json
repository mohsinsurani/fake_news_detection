for Game 1 of the NBA Finals.\n\nAfter fans watched the Golden State Warriors thrash the Cleveland Cavaliers on ABC, basketball stars past and present read out toxic Twitter messages directed at them on the same network\u2019s late-night show.\n\nJames Harden, Magic Johnson, Shaquille O\u2019Neal, Karl Malone, DeAndre Jordan, Mike Conley Jr., Paul George, Doc Rivers, Walt Frazier and ESPN\u2019s Michelle Beadle all joined in what has become \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live\u2019s\u201d most popular skits.\n\nAlso Read: Jimmy Kimmel Has 4th Graders Read Trump Speeches to 'Show How They Stack Up' (Video)\n\n\u201cPersonally I think Paul George could be traded for half a bag of saltine crackers,\u201d George read out, dissolving into laughter.\n\n\u201cMichelle Beadle\u2019s hair looks like it hasn\u2019t been washed since the late \u201990s,\u201d the \u201cNBA Countdown\u201d host read, adding: \u201cWell, technically this is not all even my hair, so maybe it hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlso

him in stitches.\n\n\u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d airs 11:35 p.m. weeknights on ABC, and Game 2 of the NBA Finals tips off Sunday at 5 p.m. PT.", "images":
