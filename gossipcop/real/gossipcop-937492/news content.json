Hunt looked sharp in a brown suit and white button-up shirt, leaving the tie at home, while his date kept things simple in a beige long-sleeve mini dress and swept her hair into a fun ponytail.\n\nThe occasion marked Hunt and Fowler\u2019s first joint appearance since the CMT Music Awards in June 2017.\n\nCheck out PEOPLE\u2019s full Billboard Music Awards coverage to get the latest news on music\u2019s big night.\n\nJohn Shearer/WireImage\n\nThe country crooner, 33, made sure to give Fowler a shout out while accepting his award for the song \u201cBody Like a Back Road.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy wife: Thank you for being so selfless this past year, sacrificing so much for me and our future,\u201d he said.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

And the seventh trip I convinced her.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/ACMA2017/Getty\n\nWhile his career has been taking off, Hunt recognized that Fowler has been making many sacrifices for her husband.\n\n\u201cShe has her own life and her ambitions and her own dreams and things are important to her, and I want to support those as much as she\u2019s supported me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s been a little lopsided these first few weeks of marriage, so I owe her for sure\u2026 but she\u2019s having fun.\u201d", "images":
