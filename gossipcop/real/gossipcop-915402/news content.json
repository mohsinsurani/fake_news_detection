More info\n\nCheryl, 34, and Liam Payne, 24, attended the BRIT Awards last night, leaving young baby Bear at home for a well-deserved night off. The couple found themselves in the spotlight after host Jack Whitehall stopped by their table for a chat. Things got steamy after Jack asked Liam if there was a \u201csafe word\u201d for his Fifty Shades of Grey performance with Rita Ora, which was coming later in the show. Liam joined in the joke and pointing at Cheryl, said: \u201cShe knows.\u201d\n\nBut instead of playing coy, Cheryl shared their bedroom secret, and jokingly said their safe word is \u201cdon\u2019t stop\u201d - to the shock and amusement of the crowd. The clip has since gone viral - but what does a body language expert say about the joke? Expert Judi James has watched the footage and shared her thoughts with Express.co.uk. She said: \"Probably the last thing you want when you're in the middle of rumours of a crisis in your relationship is Jack Whitehall thrusting a mic under your already embarrassed-looking guy's nose and cracking jokes about date nights.\n\nITV Cheryl & Liam Payne BRITs body language: The couple were asked about their sex life by the host\n\nITV Cheryl & Liam Payne BRITs body language: Liam

alert from the start with her upright back and fiddly hand clasp on the table suggesting she might have already smelled comedy trouble brewing. \"Her smile looked fixed and signs of anxiety were suggested in the way she started picking gently at her own fingers. \"When she dropped one hand, the other hand picked away at itself in what is known as body language leakage. \"This is when a smile is outweighed by signs of anxiety or discomfort from the rest of the body, especially the hands or the feet.\n\nITV Cheryl & Liam Payne BRITs body language: Liam laughed at Cheryl's response to Jack
