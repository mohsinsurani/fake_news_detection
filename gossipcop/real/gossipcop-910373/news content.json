He was 35.\n\n\u201cI can confirm that Mark Salling passed away early this morning,\u201d attorney Michael Proctor said in a statement to CNN. \u201cMark was a gentle and loving person, a person of great creativity, who was doing his best to atone for some serious mistakes and errors of judgment.\u201d\n\nLos Angeles Police tell CNN they were called to investigate a report of a death in a wooded area near Tujunga at 8:50 am local time on Tuesday morning but could not confirm any further information.\n\nSalling was indicted in May 2016 on charges of receiving and possessing child pornography.\n\nHe pleaded guilty to one count of possession of child pornography involving a prepubescent minor and was scheduled for sentencing March 7.\n\nAs part of a plea agreement, Salling was expected to be sentenced to four years to seven years in federal prison, followed by a 20-year period of supervised release and registration as a sex offender.\n\n\u2018Glee\u2019 years\n\n\u201cGlee,\u201d created by Ryan Murphy, ran on Fox from 2009-15.\n\nSalling came into the show with few other television or film credits to his name. The overnight success of the high school-set musical series turned much of the original cast into overnight sensations.\n\nThe original cast included Lea Michele, Chris Colfer, and Cory Monteith.\n\nMontieth died of an overdose in 2013.\n\nSalling was a regular on \u201cGlee\u201d for the first four seasons. He was a recurring cast member during the last two seasons, as characters began to age out of storylines.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a painful loss, again,\u201d director Paris Barclay, who worked on \u201cGlee,\u201d wrote on Twitter, accompanied by a picture of himself with Monteith and Salling. \u201cTwo young actors, lost too soon. RIP #marksalling.\u201d\n\nSalling is survived by his mother and father, and his brother.\n\n\u201cThe Salling family appreciates the support they have been receiving and asks for their privacy to be respected,\u201d Proctor added.\n\nCNN\u2019s Lisa France contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190527141230-bill-buckner-1996.jpg?q=x_67,y_409,h_1081,w_1921,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/191006080932-03-ginger-baker.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180618190139-james-shaw-chadwick-boseman.jpg?q=x_5,y_198,h_2654,w_4718,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200828233248-18-chadwick-boseman.jpg?q=x_2,y_149,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180408144920-chadwick-boseman-4-8.jpg?q=x_375,y_63,h_651,w_1158,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190521115734-niki-lauda-2.jpg?q=x_0,y_117,h_1269,w_2256,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190514092944-tim-conway.jpg?q=x_6,y_123,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180216161540-bgc-black-panther.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1080,w_1919,c_fill/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180130104711-mark-salling.jpg?q=x_20,y_111,h_1223,w_2174,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/200828231748-04-chadwick-boseman-lead-image.jpg?q=x_3,y_107,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190714202754-01-charles-levin.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_900,w_1599,c_fill/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190711093620-denise-nickerson-file.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1078,w_1915,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140624222949-02-cochran.jpg?q=x_3,y_180,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/190608134844-01-tony-rodham-restricted.jpg?q=x_4,y_422,h_2270,w_4034,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180514114734-chadwick-bosemans-howard-university.jpg?q=x_236,y_12,h_773,w_1375,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180130171727-getty-mark-salling-file.jpg?q=x_4,y_317,h_2359,w_4193,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170619101431-sandra-gonzalez.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180130104711-mark-salling.jpg?q=x_20,y_111,h_1223,w_2174,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/30/entertainment/mark-salling-dead/index.html", "title": "Mark Salling of 'Glee' dead at 35", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Mark Salling, 'Glee' actor, dead at 35 | CNN", "description": "Actor Mark Salling, best known for his role as Noah \"Puck\" Puckerman on Fox's musical comedy-drama \"Glee,\" has died, according to his attorney.
