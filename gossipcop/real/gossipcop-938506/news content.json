I can\u2019t see you under all those layers!\u201d added another.\n\nRecommended Rebel Wilson claims comedy career took off when she gained weight\n\n\u201cCouture or not, it looks like a tent and doesn\u2019t do you justice.\u201d\n\nFurther critics argued that the title\u2019s styling team had \u201cdrowned\u201d the actress in fabric.\n\nOthers contested the authenticity of the images, claiming that her figure had been digitally-altered:\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t even have recognizable wrists,\u201d one person commented on Twitter, \u201cthey widened her smile and she was always naturally beautiful.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy is it that every time a \u2018plus-size\u2019 woman makes it to the cover of a fashion magazine, they wrap them in the heaviest coats imaginable?\u201d asked another.\n\nWilson personally responded to one tweet which described her as \u201cslimmed down\u201d, writing: \u201cNope, not slimmed down! I just ate healthy and exercised for the month before the shoot x but then immediately after ate brownies!\u201d\n\nThe actress followed her tweet up by uploading a side-by-side image of one of the raw photographs featured in the magazine alongside the published version to show that it hadn\u2019t been \u201cheavily photoshopped\u201d as fans had claimed.\n\nWhile criticisms were rife, the majority of comments regarding Wilson\u2019s cover were hugely complimentary, with fans lauding the Australian actress for her beauty and talent.\n\n\u201cYou look amazing and you are a true role model,\u201d enthused one fan on Instagram.\n\n\u201cYou shouldn't have to explain yourself you look absolutely amazing hun,\u201d added another, \u201cand i love the outfits.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/16/31941496-311693419364978-5803894014092509184-n.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/16/31941496-311693419364978-5803894014092509184-n.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/16/31941496-311693419364978-5803894014092509184-n.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Petter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/rebel-wilson-vogue-australia-cover-photoshop-fat-shaming-doctored-a8365746.html", "title": "Rebel Wilson defends Vogue Australia cover after fans claim images were 'slimmed down'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "'Rebel, is that you?'", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Lifestyle", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/life-style", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-05-24T08:01:31.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Rebel Wilson defends Vogue cover following claims images were doctored", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/rebel-wilson-vogue-australia-cover-photoshop-fat-shaming-doctored-a8365746.html", "type": "article", "description": "'Rebel, is that you?'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/16/31941496-311693419364978-5803894014092509184-n.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/16/31941496-311693419364978-5803894014092509184-n.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-24T08:01:31.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-24T08:01:31.000Z", "section": "Lifestyle", "author_name": "Olivia Petter", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 532, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 5, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2018-05-24T08:01:31.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Rebel Wilson defends Vogue cover following claims images were doctored", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'Rebel, is that you?'", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/23/16/31941496-311693419364978-5803894014092509184-n.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Rebel Wilson,Vogue,Body positive,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527148891.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
