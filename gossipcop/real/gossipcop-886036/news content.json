In this article I have some nail care tips for you, as well as 50 awesome Halloween nail art design ideas.\n\nAre you as excited for Halloween as I am? If I could dress up in a costume every day of October, I would. Unfortunately, once you reach a certain age that\u2019s not exactly appropriate. Instead, I can interject some Halloween spirit with Halloween nail art designs. Sometimes, Halloween nails can also really improve my costume \u2013 bloody nails for a zombie costume, long, pointy nails for a witch costume, or animal-print nails to go with a jungle creature costume.\n\nSalon or DIY for your Halloween Nails?\n\nAre you unsure whether you should do your nails at home, or get them done by a professional? First decide what kind of nails you want, and how steady your hand is. For some Halloween nail designs, doing it yourself at home is totally doable. All you need is a few Halloween-themed nail stickers, and some orange and black nail polish. You\u2019ll also see some simple bloody Halloween nail design ideas, which would be pretty easy to achieve.\n\nOn the other hand, if the design you want is very complicated, or requires a nail printer, going to a salon might be for the best. In every city there are at least a few nail artists that are pros at creating really unique designs. Additionally, Halloween is a great time to go out of your comfort zone, with gel nails or pointy acrylics -you can simply use them to accentuate a cat or witch costume.\n\nGreat Halloween Nails Are Healthy Halloween Nails!\n\nTo make sure your Halloween manicure looks truly fabulous (or that you have enough space to draw all those intricate designs), make sure your nails are strong and healthy. This is doubly important if you\u2019re going to do something more intense, like acrylics.\n\n\u2022 Make sure to regularly moisturize your nail beds with coconut oil or shea butter.\n\n\u2022 Get enough calcium and vitamin B in your diet, or take a supplement.\n\n\u2022 File your nails with an emery board, instead of trimming them.\n\n50 Spooky Halloween Nail Art Designs\n\nSo your nails look good? I have some cute, some stylish, and some straight up scary Halloween nail design ideas coming your way!\n\n1. Ghouls and Pumpkins Halloween Nails\n\nYou don\u2019t have to have long nails for cute Halloween nail art ideas! You can give each finger a cute Halloween character or motif, like the ghouls, pumpkins, mummies, and spider webs in this design.\n\n2. This is Halloween Nails\n\nThe Nightmare Before Christmas is a quirky Halloween classic, so pay homage to it with your nails! Jack Skellington\u2019s face is undeniably Halloween even for the uninitiate, while Sally\u2019s tattered ragdoll dress design is chic and abstract.\n\n3. Creepy Crawly Nails\n\nThese insect Halloween nail designs are weirdly sophisticated. The bugs are hand drawn with a graphic flourish, and the matte finish only adds to the biologist\u2019s sketchbook effect.\n\n4. Cutie Crawly Nails\n\nSo spiders are not technically insects, but they also don\u2019t smile this wide normally! There are plenty of cute Halloween nail art ideas, like these purple nails with spider and spider webs on the accent nails, and large chunks of glitter on the rest of the nails.\n\n5. Classy Witch Nails\n\nYou don\u2019t dig the obvious Halloween nail designs? Try something more abstract, with these sharp witchy nails.
