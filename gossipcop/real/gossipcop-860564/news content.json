Yeah...definitely not,\" Leah shared online. \"Just shows everyone how trashy that show is & how trashy the producers are to think it's ok to film sexual activity on an ABC SHOW. #garbage.\"\n\nShe followed up with, \"My opinion of the show is 100% towards the producers\u2014not the contestants,\" and told a follower, \"I am ashamed at myself for ever having anything to do with it.\"\n\nBut Derek Peth, who was meant to appear on the show alongside Corinne and DeMario \u2013 and who has since been sent home - rebuked her claims.\n\n\"Speaking generally for all of us @leahblock without full knowledge is not fair to anyone!!!\" he tweeted.\n\n\n\nDerek Peth, Leah Block, and Ryan Beckett, Image: ABC\n\nHe also posted of the incident, \"My heart has been breaking all day. I\u2019m constantly blown away by how horrible most of you are.\"\n\nMeanwhile, Ryan Beckett, a former Bachelor in Paradise contestant who also appeared on season 11 of The Bachelorette, said he witnessed drunk hookups on the show \"all the time\" but said producers always stepped in when needed.\n\n\"I would not imagine that a number of producers would stand idly by,\" the 35-year-old told People. \"I would expect two drunk contestants to do something stupid. But it would be surprising to me that something nefarious was going on and it was allowed to go on.\u201d\n\nAnd UsWeekly reports that Corinne and DeMario's fellow Bachelor in Paradise cast members are confused about the future of their show.\n\n\"The cast is basically in the dark about what happened and they are not being told anything,\" a source told the publication. \"They were all excited for this season and to get to know each other. They were all getting along with each other well.\"\n\nA source told People, \"the main reason [the show] will likely not be back is that the majority of the bill for the show is footed by the Mexico Tourism Board... It's not a good look and is not likely to be something Mexico Tourism wants to welcome back.\"\n\nThe Bachelorette is currently streaming on 9Now.", "images": ["https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/NeExLrWr9kAZqisHwuoqPMGw5BE=/0x13:585x343/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F038cb53e-cb6d-46b6-97cd-215b2887d471", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/4yUsnklKeDNWR0uiCz_Sv2u3Lmo=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F03%2Fninecouponsblue.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/NHVfQOd4p_FZ-3N0omQFyTViY40=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F05%2F29%2F08%2F34%2Ffooter-creative-146x82.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/gUeEeCavYaYPan0FlNkFqF7I65U=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F27e3d89d-8a28-4a03-99e2-12033f6af415", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/d4xEJS8rrdHN-r5zJSPw7c14ksc=/180x153:1080x660/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F117e577c-4386-4789-8adf-06abc0bdd192", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/rGCwwoJxFIq81v9_WqdS-NXiD_s=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2019%2F06%2F20%2F11%2F24%2Fdomain_partner_module_lrg.png", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/m8gVRogNItHNEAXp7xnBU1H3mMw=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F09%2F01%2F10%2F23%2Fnational.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/E9RNc18C7X6vDY0hjdpf379Nx80=/0x22/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F0a52b725-e1b8-400a-bfc4-6ce10a4254b2", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/rztiZlY9ajkVdSfptQrL0zKZqPs=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2022%2F09%2F09%2F17%2F35%2Flast_light.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/BMuoeza4i9l-wE5AsPC7PLimTaw=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2017%2F06%2F13%2F12%2F53%2Fbachelorfix1306_2.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/BHdwVsBJuA6QtNgevwAb6FpmEQw=/140x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2Fc3379a04-9b1e-4e8c-955f-0e2c6a4d5315", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/zODZAc23LwFdE6ROcnWEdl4NivY=/88x88/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2Ffs%2F669e88ce-1e0b-4d57-b28d-fcfd0edb6385", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/gkx-3U_hXn1JRyGOBzvIw-Eze1w=/480x270/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2017%2F06%2F13%2F12%2F53%2Fbachelorfix1306_2.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/8B_dK5EYtGM_ZM0QB6AL2TiwgoM=/396x0/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2F2017%2F06%2F13%2F12%2F59%2Fbachelorcontestantsfix1306-copy.jpg", "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/02eapYwdY6YZqRP0t2GwUfQO0ag=/396x223/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2Fnetwork%2Fimages%2F2018%2F11%2F12%2F07%2F17%2Fkariseevans_785.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imageresizer.static9.net.au/BMuoeza4i9l-wE5AsPC7PLimTaw=/1200x628/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fprod.static9.net.au%2F_%2Fmedia%2FNetwork%2FImages%2F2017%2F06%2F13%2F12%2F53%2Fbachelorfix1306_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "//celebrity.nine.com.au/tv/former-bachelor-in-paradise-contenstants-speak-alleged-sexual-misconduct/4904a44f-cce8-4949-ad6a-0ceca25f04ee", "title": "Former Bachelor stars speak out after alleged sexual misconduct: 'I am ashamed at myself'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00daa7", "msapplication-TileImage": "/assets/imgs/celebrity/ms-icon-144x144.f93a8f07.png", "theme-color": "#00daa7", "nine": {"video-player": {"nielsen-plugin": "{\"apid\":\"P366BEB07-2E11-4EE0-B65B-0E24519B7560\",\"sfcode\":\"dcr\",\"nsdkv\":\"511,\",\"apn\":\"nineFix\",\"section\":\"nine.com.au Honey -
