But at 7, I knew that if I were to take my own life that the pain would end.\u201d\n\nDiagnosed with bipolar disorder at age 18 and bullied at age 12, Lovato turned to drugs and alcohol to cope with the demons in her life.\n\n\u201cMy addiction with drugs and alcohol was very severe to where I had several scares, and I knew that at the rate I was using and drinking, I wasn\u2019t going to live a long life. I used very fast, very hard,\u201d she said.\n\nDr. Phil\n\nBut by sharing her trials and tribulations, Lovato hopes to inspire her fans and followers to seek help.\n\n\u201cIf I could tell anybody that\u2019s thinking about taking their own life, is to reach out to people. Don\u2019t hold it inside \u2014 don\u2019t isolate. Reach out to people, whether it\u2019s close friends, family,\u201d she advised. \u201cIf you feel like you don\u2019t have anybody, look within yourself and try to find that resilience that will ultimately get you through whatever it is you\u2019re going through. Every single person on this planet is worth life.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Demi Lovato Cries Recalling Past Struggles During Concert as DJ Khaled Celebrates Her Sobriety\n\nThe Dr. Phil interview aired days after the Disney Channel alum broke down in tears during her Brooklyn concert when talking about her sober birthday on Friday.\n\n\u201cYesterday was a really big day for me. Yesterday, six years ago, I was drinking vodka out of a Sprite bottle at nine in the morning, throwing up in the car and I just remember thinking, \u2018This is no longer cute. This is no longer fun. And I\u2019m just like my dad,\u2019 \u201d Lovato told concertgoers.\n\nHer biological father, Patrick Lovato, whom Demi had a strained relationship with, died in June 2013 after years of alcohol and substance abuse.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images":
