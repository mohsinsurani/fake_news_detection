This post may contain spoilers from Freaky Friday.\n\nActresses Heidi Blickenstaff and Cozi Zuehlsdorff are having a major identity crisis.\n\nWell, at least their characters are!\n\nThe two will be hilariously swapping bodies as the famous mom-and-daughter duo Katherine and Ellie Blake in Disney Channel\u2019s new musical adaptation of Freaky Friday.\n\nTeens and parents can expect all the familiar touches of the original story, with Katherine and Ellie at odds until an encounter with a magical hourglass leads them to spend a day in each other\u2019s shoes \u2014 literally. But in this latest version, viewers can expect a fresh, modernized take that they\u2019ll truly relate to, and with some thoroughly enjoyable musical numbers to boot!\n\nFor Zuehlsdorff, who starts off the movie as teenage Ellie, the experience was especially meaningful because she\u2019ll be turning 20 when the film premieres this week. Facing the end of her teen years helped the actress connect deeply with her rebellious character.\n\n\u201cThis movie really holds space for a lot of feelings,\u201d Zuehlsdorff tells Babble. \u201cI challenge you to find one teenager who doesn\u2019t feel insecure, including me. It was really important to me to play a teenager honestly \u2026 Even in her sassiness and her attitude, [I wanted] to find a way to do it that felt really honest.\u201d\n\nIn her effort to commit fully to Ellie, Zuehlsdorff also embraced a part of the high school experience most movies ignore \u2014 the sheer exhaustion teens feel in their changing bodies.\n\n\u201cTeenage years are the sleepiest years of your life, because you\u2019re just full of hormones and so tired and growing,\u201d she says. \u201cThat felt very relatable for me, because I still experience that.\u201d\n\nBlickenstaff can attest to her onscreen daughter\u2019s commitment, playfully remembering moments when Zuehlsdorff would pass out during their 14-hour shoot days on set.\n\n\u201cWe would find her in various spots, literally sleeping on her face on a table!\u201d Blickenstaff says.\n\nDisney\u2019s Freaky Friday will also boldly dive into the issues of loss and grief, and it gets very real about the painful vulnerability of being in a blended family. When we\u2019re introduced to the Blake family, they\u2019re still dealing with the untimely death of Ellie\u2019s father five years ago, and Katherine\u2019s new fianc\u00e9 only makes it tougher for them both to cope.\n\n\u201cThe whole reason we have to switch bodies, and the whole fight that ensues is because we\u2019re processing his death in different ways,\u201d Zuehlsdorff says. \u201cEllie wants to let it out, and Katherine wants to rein it in \u2026 and neither way is working. They have to really sit and talk and remember, so that they can move forward.\u201d\n\nBlickenstaff thinks the emotional scenes between Katherine and Ellie have the potential to help any teen who has experienced the death of a parent.\n\n\u201cA lot of kids deal with lots of real sadness in their lives and real separation from parents for lots of different reasons,\u201d she tells Babble. \u201cInstead of just sugarcoating that topic, we go there. And I think we give kids a lot of credit for having real feelings and being ready to hear it.\u201d\n\nNavigating a blended family also happens to be a subject close to Blickenstaff\u2019s heart, as she\u2019s officially earned \u201cbonus mom\u201d status in real life with her husband\u2019s two sons.\n\n\u201cI can barely talk about them without crying, because I feel so privileged to intersect with these two human beings,\u201d she says. \u201cThey continue to teach me all kinds of lessons all the time.\u201d\n\nSince Blickenstaff\u2019s stepsons are 14 and 17, they were both at the perfect age to help the actress navigate the all-consuming job of playing both mom to a teenager and the teenager!\n\n\u201cThey are in the thick of it,\u201d says Blickenstaff. \u201cThey are totally in that place where everything is changing, and they are figuring out who they want to be, and we\u2019ve got a front row seat to all of that.\u201d\n\nAdding to the authenticity of the new Freaky Friday is an aim to help create a self-acceptance movement, one teen viewer at a time. Zuehlsdorff screened the movie at a theater festival in the midwest for hundreds of high schoolers recently, and she was surprised to find that one particular moment resonated with every single audience member.\n\nIt\u2019s a point in the film when Ellie\u2019s friends are about to have a dance-off in a bowling alley, but spend the time tearing their bodies down instead of having fun. Ellie, who is being inhabited by Katherine during the scene, gives the girls a self-esteem-boosting pep talk they\u2019ll never forget.\n\nFor the young moviegoers, this was exactly the kind of encouragement they all clearly needed to hear as well.\n\n\u201cThe minute my character says, \u2018You guys, your bodies \u2014 our bodies \u2014 are beautiful,\u2019 the entire audience erupted in applause,\u201d Zuehlsdorff shares. \u201cIt was very special.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if they could swap with anyone in real life, the duo had some really adorable answers. Zuehlsdorff narrowed her list down to T\u00e9a Leoni from Madame Secretary and Spider-Man, but Blickenstaff had a much more unconventional response, saying she\u2019d love to switch places with her dog.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I rescued her about a year ago, and she is the apple of our eye, she says. \u201cI would just like a day to have all of that spoiled rotten treatment!\u201d\n\nFreaky Friday will premiere on August 10 at 8 PM EST on the Disney Channel.\n\nArticle Posted 1 day Ago", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180809015304im_/https://www.babble.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ff-630.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180809015304im_/https://www.babble.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ff-630.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Wolf"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180809015304/https://www.babble.com/entertainment/freaky-friday-disney-channel/", "title": "Disney\u2019s New \u2018Freaky Friday\u2019 Musical Tackles the Chaotic Teen Years in a Powerful Way", "meta_data": {"HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "Actresses Heidi Blickenstaff and Cozi Zuehlsdorff play the famous mom-and-daughter duo Katherine and Ellie Blake in Disney Channel\u2019s new musical adaptation of 'Freaky Friday.'", "author": "Lindsay Wolf", "og": {"site_name": "Babble", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180809015304/https://www.babble.com/entertainment/freaky-friday-disney-channel/", "title": "Disney\u2019s New \u2018Freaky Friday\u2019 Musical Tackles the Chaotic Teen Years in a Powerful Way", "description": "Disney Channel's 'Freaky Friday' musical airs Friday, August 10!", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180809015304im_/https://www.babble.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ff2-1200.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 800}}, "fb": {"app_id": 415310475147711}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-07T20:29:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-08-07T22:47:19+00:00", "author": "https://www.babble.com/contributor/lwolf/", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "teen"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533673766.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
