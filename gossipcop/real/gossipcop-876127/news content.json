Fans can vote for Fear The Walking Dead actress Alycia Debnam-Carey to advance to the finals!\n\nWhen it comes to winning awards, AMC\u2019s zombie survival dramas don\u2019t always fare too well. Despite their popularity, critics don\u2019t seem to enjoy them as much as fans. That\u2019s why it is important for viewers to support shows like Fear The Walking Dead when voting is involved.\n\nFor several weeks now, E! has been running a tournament using a fan vote to determine who the most popular young female actress of 2017 is. Among those left in the final 4 of the contest is Alycia Debnam-Carey.\n\nKnown for her role as Alicia Clark on AMC\u2019s zombie companion series, Alycia has brought a complicated character to life and managed to incorporate some great action and drama scenes into the mix as well.\n\nIn the competition, she faces off against tough competition from some of the most popular shows on television. Here are the 4 contenders remaining for the title of Girl on Top 2017 according to the E! website:\n\nEmily Bett Rickards \u2013 Arrow\n\n\u2013 Arrow Eliza Taylor \u2013 The 100\n\n\u2013 The 100 Melanie Scrofano \u2013 Wynonna Earp\n\n\u2013 Wynonna Earp Alycia Debnam-Carey \u2013 Fear the Walking Dead\n\nVoting for the final two is open until Wednesday, August 30 at 5 p.m. P.T. on the link above. The final two will go head-to-head in one final vote to determine E!\u2019s Girl on Top 2017.\n\nBest of luck to Fear The Walking Dead actress Alycia Debnam-Carey in this competition. Her strong fan base and performance on the AMC drama should move her into the finals, but she will need help to bring home the crown.", "images": ["https://undeadwalking.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/apple-app.png", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_850,h_560,c_fill,g_auto,f_auto/https%3A%2F%2Fundeadwalking.com%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2Ffear-the-walking-dead-136405864417203901-1605090954091.jpg", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fundeadwalking.com%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2Ffear-the-walking-dead-136405864417203901-1605090954091.jpg", "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/fansided-logo.svg", "https://cdn.fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/undeadwalking/logo_undeadwalking-com__150x150.png", "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/c_fill,f_auto,w_150,h_150/https://fansided.com/wp-content/assets/site_images/undeadwalking/logo_undeadwalking-com__150x150.png", "https://undeadwalking.com/wp-content/themes/fansided-v5/assets/images/android-app.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18120612&cv=3.6&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://images2.minutemediacdn.com/image/fetch/w_2000,h_2000,c_fit/https%3A%2F%2Fundeadwalking.com%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F08%2Ffear-the-walking-dead-136405864417203901-1605090954091.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Adam Carlson", "Sarabeth Pollock"], "canonical_link": "https://undeadwalking.com/2017/08/29/vote-alycia-debnam-carey-fear-walking-dead/", "title": "E!
