I was quickly scrolling down the script, and I can\u2019t really tell you what I was looking for. So I\u2019m like, \u2018So Nancy, I don\u2019t understand, what\u2019s the part?\u2019 \u201d Oh recalled to Vulture in April. \u201cAnd Nancy goes \u2018Sweetheart, it\u2019s Eve, it\u2019s Eve.\u2019 \u201d\n\nDominik Magdziak Photography/Getty\n\nHer surprise was the result of a bigger problem: racism she claimed to have experienced for so long in Hollywood that left her \u201cbrainwashed.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that moment, I did not assume the offer was for Eve,\u201d she said. \u201cI think about that moment a lot. Of just going, how deep have I internalized this? [So] many years of being seen [a certain way], it deeply, deeply, deeply affects us. It\u2019s like, how does racism define your work? Oh my goodness, I didn\u2019t even assume when being offered something that I would be one of the central storytellers. Why? And this is me talking, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cRacism exists. Let\u2019s start there. I felt it, and I have felt it deeply. And I\u2019m extremely fortunate. So I\u2019m not going to not say that it\u2019s not there, because it is,\u201d she added. \u201cAfter being told to see things a certain way for decades, you realize, \u2018Oh my god! They brainwashed me!\u2019 I was brainwashed! So that was a revelation to me.\u201d\n\nRandy Holmes/ABC via Getty\n\nAlthough she has experienced the effects of racism throughout her acting journey, Oh said she believes in the power of positive perspective for minority performers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s changing the mindset that being an actor of color, person of color, that you\u2019re at a disadvantage in the creative life. That you don\u2019t have opportunity. It\u2019s all how you see the opportunity. And the clearer and deeper you get into what you really want, you just become a better artist. If that\u2019s what you really want \u2014 becoming a better artist \u2014 does that include access? Does that include having 5 billion Instagram followers? I don\u2019t know. That\u2019s for you to decide,\u201d she told Vulture.\n\nShe continued: \u201cBut if what you want is to connect, if what you want is to be a great artist, I think you can find your way. Even within this giant paradigm that a lot of times doesn\u2019t include people who look like us.\u201d\n\nOh will face off against Elisabeth Moss (The Handmaid\u2019s Tale), Claire Foy (The Crown), Keri Russell (The Americans), Evan Rachel Wood (Westworld) and Tatiana Maslany (Orphan Black) come Emmy night.\n\nThe 70th annual Emmys will air live from Hollywood on Sept. 17 (at 8 p.m. ET) on NBC.", "images":
