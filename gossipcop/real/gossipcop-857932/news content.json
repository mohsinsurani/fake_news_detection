{"url": "https://people.com/crime/mary-kay-letourneau-wants-fix-marriage-vili-fualaau/", "text": "A year ago, Vili Fualaau grabbed national headlines when he filed for legal separation from his wife, former school teacher and sex offender Mary Kay Letourneau.\n\nBut things aren\u2019t over. The couple has repeatedly been spotted together around the Seattle area. Sources close to them have told PEOPLE that they\u2019re working on their marriage \u2014 and still in love.\n\nOn Tuesday night\u2019s Autobiography on A&E, Fualaau, now 34, declined to address the split directly. When asked about it by a producer, he sheepishly smiled while Letourneau said, \u201cWe\u2019re not talking about that.\u201d\n\nWhile the couple themselves wouldn\u2019t address it, their inner circle was given the green light to speak frankly about what went wrong in their notorious coupling.\n\n\u201cWhen the news came out that he filed for separation, people were stunned,\u201d friend Anne Bremner told the show. \u201cThey\u2019d been together all this time.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Want to keep up with the latest crime coverage?

She\u2019s living in hope. Mary wants this relationship to work. Vili\u2019s in his mid-30s, and Mary\u2019s in her mid-50s, and you just have to relate it to anyone else you know and their relationship issues.\u201d\n\n\u201cMary\u2019s hopeful,\u201d Greenberg continued. \u201cShe loves Vili. There\u2019s absolutely no question about that.\u201d\n\nDavid Gehrke, another friend, said the two are \u201cin counseling\u201d and still \u201cliving together.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re working on their problems,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody wants a good love story, and generally when you\u2019re caught up in this situation, there\u2019s no way it can end up happy, even if it was love.\u201d\n\n\u2022 It was the scandal that rocked America\u2019s most storied political family and changed the course of presidential history. PEOPLE\u2018s first-ever podcast, Cover-Up, dives into the Chappaquiddick scandal and attempts to piece together what happened in the hours after Ted Kennedy\u2019s car went over a narrow wooden bridge, killing his passenger, Mary Jo Kopechne.

Following a guilty plea for felony second-degree rape of a child, Letourneau was sentenced to six months behind bars, with three months suspended, and told to have no contact with Fualaau for life. But she was unable to stay away from him and was re-arrested when she was caught having sex with him, again, in a car.\n\nLetourneau was sent back to prison and was released in 2004. She twice became pregnant with Fualaau\u2019s child when he was underage. The couple eventually married and raised their two daughters together.\n\nOn Autobiography this week, she eventually agreed to speak in generalities about the state of her marriage.\n\n\u201cThere is a labor in love,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who\u2019s making love work in a marriage knows it\u2019s work.\u201d\n\nMary Kay Letourneau: Autobiography aired Tuesday and is available on demand and on A&E\u2019s website. It will be rebroadcast throughout the month.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/swgBmNSg_5G-z4cGHf9GbpoyOSw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-1-4ce3d4466f094b86afac9846e59b09fc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/p0ycLJRHyikYNn75MGXxu0_HypU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x0:901x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-21-db240fd35c694918871e1e69dfb41e36.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3IMw4fazohG8SZD02uCJKyulEUg=/650x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-1-4ce3d4466f094b86afac9846e59b09fc.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tjpd5bbzEXzEosvN8wbu5W-fJnc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-1-ce979884b06948fa83e401f36a2000d4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/OzFh1MwiRZLFRxOVqk3__GSrGfg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-2000-6f586a152ce042f3b3df867350105d9e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/iEtapXeZvdOgfva87vyVlKWDs5E=/650x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(899x0:901x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-21-db240fd35c694918871e1e69dfb41e36.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CFOXtAdbDmq_ldXmegX-Ervs0LM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-ec3ea50bc9ce4af28130e8b4903ec0be.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/s8HLatHmhVI2ihMYNZGgzQ6J8-Y=/1800x1432/filters:fill(auto,1)/mary-kay-letourneau-21-db240fd35c694918871e1e69dfb41e36.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7qMqCrfsCPD-St6JQ8PLc_AVZ-4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/mary-kay-letourneau-7d08dc52f7e14b75818b1bd8c8e21d05.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/s8HLatHmhVI2ihMYNZGgzQ6J8-Y=/1800x1432/filters:fill(auto,1)/mary-kay-letourneau-21-db240fd35c694918871e1e69dfb41e36.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steve Helling"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/crime/mary-kay-letourneau-wants-fix-marriage-vili-fualaau/", "title": "Mary Kay Letourneau Wants to Save Marriage to Vili Fualaau", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The notorious couple has repeatedly been spotted together around the Seattle area and sources have told PEOPLE that they're working on their relationship", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "PEOPLE", "sailthru.author": "Steve Helling", "article": {"section": "People", "opinion": "false", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/peoplemag"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Peoplemag", "url": "https://people.com/crime/mary-kay-letourneau-wants-fix-marriage-vili-fualaau/", "title": "Mary Kay Letourneau Wants to Save Marriage to Vili Fualaau", "description": "The notorious couple has repeatedly been spotted together around the Seattle area and sources have told PEOPLE that they're working on their relationship", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/s8HLatHmhVI2ihMYNZGgzQ6J8-Y=/1800x1432/filters:fill(auto,1)/mary-kay-letourneau-21-db240fd35c694918871e1e69dfb41e36.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "title": "Mary Kay Letourneau Wants to Save Marriage to Vili Fualaau", "description": "The notorious couple has repeatedly been spotted together around the Seattle area and sources have told PEOPLE that they're working on their relationship", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/s8HLatHmhVI2ihMYNZGgzQ6J8-Y=/1800x1432/filters:fill(auto,1)/mary-kay-letourneau-21-db240fd35c694918871e1e69dfb41e36.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
