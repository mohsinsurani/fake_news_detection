In touching scenes in front of them, the group of young page boys and bridesmaids led the way.\n\n(Arthur Edwards/The Sun/PA)\n\nThe husband and wife could not help smiling and, as they reached the main gates of St Mark\u2019s, they paused as the young children played around them. They then kissed for the waiting press who were gathered nearby.\n\nKate continued her role as big sister and marshalled the young bridesmaids and page boys into the classic cars that had brought them to the church as guests filed out and walked to nearby Englefield House, where it is believed a champagne reception will be held.", "images":
