The Bachelor alum Juelia Kinney is engaged to Aaron Bass, the brother of former Bachelor in Paradise star Evan Bass.\n\nKinney, 34, announced the news via Instagram on Wednesday, July 25, with a picture (taken by photographer Monica Lopez) of herself kissing her new fianc\u00e9 on a beach near Secrets Playa Mujeres Golf & Spa Resort in Canc\u00fan, Mexico.\n\n\u201cThis man. From the time I met him last year in Mexico I thought to myself he is hot \u2013 and would make such a good husband from all the good energy I felt from his heart. I didn\u2019t think much more of it because I lived in San Diego and he lived in Nashville,\u201d wrote the esthetician, who vied for Chris Soules\u2019 heart on season 19 of The Bachelor in 2015 before appearing on season 2 of Bachelor in Paradise later that year.\n\n\u201cLittle did I know he was going to come visit me and little did I know I would feel sick to my stomach when he left to go back home. I knew I hadn\u2019t felt that special or that close to someone in pretty much ever, and had no idea how it would work out,\u201d she continued. \u201cI am so happy that our relationship not only developed so much over the next couple months, but flourished.\u201d\n\nKinney admitted that it was \u201chard\u201d having a long-distance relationship with Aaron as they learned to navigate \u201cthe ups and downs,\u201d but they are now \u201cstronger and happier than ever.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am so excited to say\u2026. WE ARE ENGAGED!!!!!!\u201d she gushed. \u201cHe is the best man I could ask for and my best friend\u2026 not to mention he makes me laugh till my stomach hurts every morning and every day. I never would have expected we would have met like we did but I am so freaking grateful that we did. I love you @theaaronbass!! Thank you for making me the luckiest girl in the world!!\u201d\n\nEvan \u2014 whose wife, Carly Waddell, also competed on Soules\u2019 season \u2014 later congratulated his brother and future sister-in-law on their engagement. \u201cSo so happy for my brother getting engaged to this incredible woman,\u201d the 35-year-old tweeted. \u201cThese 2 snuck away to the beach after meeting at our wedding and then a little over a year later they sneak back to Mexico to get engaged!! Congrats @theaaronbass and @jueliakinney !!!\u201d\n\nKinney was previously wed to Dustin Kinney from 2010 until he died by suicide in 2013. She later dated JJ Lane from Kaitlyn Bristowe\u2019s season 11 of The Bachelorette.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Juelia-Kinney-aaron-bass-engaged.jpg?crop=98px%2C18px%2C634px%2C333px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Juelia-Kinney-aaron-bass-engaged.jpg?crop=98px%2C18px%2C634px%2C333px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bachelors-juelia-kinney-engaged-to-evan-bass-brother-aaron-bass/", "title": "Bachelor\u2019s Juelia Kinney Engaged to Evan Bass\u2019 Brother Aaron Bass", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 alum Juelia Kinney announced via Instagram on Wednesday, July 25, that she is engaged to Evan Bass\u2019 brother, Aaron Bass \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 Alum Juelia Kinney Is Engaged to Evan Bass\u2019 Brother Aaron", "description": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 alum Juelia Kinney announced via Instagram on Wednesday, July 25, that she is engaged to Evan Bass\u2019 brother, Aaron Bass \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bachelors-juelia-kinney-engaged-to-evan-bass-brother-aaron-bass/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:09:25+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Juelia-Kinney-aaron-bass-engaged.jpg?crop=98px%2C18px%2C634px%2C333px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Juelia-Kinney-aaron-bass-engaged.jpg?crop=98px%2C18px%2C634px%2C333px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-26T12:50:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:09:25+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 Alum Juelia Kinney Is Engaged to Evan Bass\u2019 Brother Aaron", "description": "\u2018The Bachelor\u2019 alum Juelia Kinney announced via Instagram on Wednesday, July 25, that she is engaged to Evan Bass\u2019 brother, Aaron Bass \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Juelia-Kinney-aaron-bass-engaged.jpg?crop=98px%2C18px%2C634px%2C333px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532609427.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
