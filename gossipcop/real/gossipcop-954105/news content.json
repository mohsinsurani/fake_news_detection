Our businesses are open 24/7 and, of course, we\u2019re always working and grinding. But then I started talking to her and then realised, very quickly, just how wrong I was.\"\n\nOhanian co-founded the news website Reddit in 2005 and became a multi-millionaire aged 23 when he sold it 16 months later. He met Williams at a cafe in Italy in 2015 and improved the tennis ace's website with a superior \"tech strategy\" while also helping secure \"deal flows with sponsorships and investments.\"\n\nThe pair got married in 2017 and Ohanian said Williams has inspired him in business.\n\n\"It's a front row seat to greatness and that is what I\u2019m working towards in my own career,\" he said.\n\nOhanian and Williams had a daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., in September last year. Since then, Williams has returned to tennis and almost captured her first major since being a mom, what would have been her 24th Grand Slam title, when she reached the 2018 Wimbledon Championships final \u2014 but she missed out to Angelique Kerber.\n\nOhanian co-founded Initialized Capital in 2010, is an Open Internet activist (an advocate for net neutrality), and is widely regarded as \"one of the most creative people in business.\"", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E",
