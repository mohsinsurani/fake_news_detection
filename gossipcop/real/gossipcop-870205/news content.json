Rose complimented the wavy bob with a black tank-top with a plunging neckline, coupled with black pants and open-toe heels.\n\nAside from her (temporary) new \u2018do, Rose has also been opening up about another major change in her life \u2014 her blossoming romance with rapper 21 Savage.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s pretty amazing waking up every morning feeling love like this,\u201d she wrote on Instagram earlier this month. \u201cI\u2019ve cried endlessly and been hurt a lot in my life, I\u2019ve been abused, talked to like I wasn\u2019t s\u2014, been gaslighted and Slut shamed by men that I once loved and cared about. So I\u2019m so thankful that God brought this amazing person in my life who genuinely has my back and is ready to \u2018pull up\u2019 to defend my honor by any means.\u201d\n\n\u201cMaybe he\u2019s just as broken as me and that\u2019s why we\u2019re perfect for each other,\u201d she added. \u201cBut either way he\u2019s not going anywhere and neither am I.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWWtUZ4hUly/\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Amber Rose Interview\n\nRose has also been making headlines for her interview with the Complex\u2018s \u201cEveryday Struggle\u201d talk show, where she opened up about her 2010 split from Kanye West.\n\n\u201cI see this a lot on the Internet: \u2018Amber\u2019s going to hurt him.\u2019 I\u2019ve been the one that\u2019s been heartbroken. I have never cheated on any of my boyfriends,\u201d Rose revealed. \u201cI still have never said anything mean about Kanye. This is after six, seven years of constant bullying from him.\u201d\n\nIn January 2016, Rose\u2019s ex-husband Wiz Khalifa and their then-3-year-old son, Sebastian, were targeted by West during a Twitter rant. However, Rose and West eventually mended fences thanks to West\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian West. West also later publicly apologized to Khalifa and Rose.", "images":
