Briana DeJesus and Javi Marroquin ended their relationship during the Monday, July 2, episode of Teen Mom 2. To make matters worse, Javi was a guest on Kailyn Lowry\u2019s podcast, and they gushed about all of the juicy details. But Briana wasn\u2019t innocent as she also revealed she is reconnecting with one of her exes. Find out what you might have missed during this week\u2019s episode below.\n\nBriana and Javi Break Up\n\nBriana went to Delaware to visit Javi, and it went bad \u2026 to say the least. He tried to pressure her into doing a lot of things \u2014 from talking her into moving to Delaware to advising her to not post about her upcoming plastic surgery on social media. When the trip was over, so were they as a couple.\n\n\u201cI felt controlled,\u201d Briana said. \u201cI felt like he was trying to manipulate me in a situation I didn\u2019t want to be in.\u201d\n\nJavi was supposed to take care of Briana and her friend after they got their plastic surgery, but things between them were so bad she had to turn to her ex Dre to help them.\n\n\u201cJavi\u2019s going to be butthurt when he sees who\u2019s taking care of us,\u201d she said to her friend, but didn\u2019t seem to care too much. We smell trouble!\n\nKailyn and Javi Stir the Pot\n\nTo make matters worse, Javi decided it would be a good idea to involve Kailyn in everything about his breakup. She was the first person he told when he planned on breaking up with her.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re always right,\u201d he told her and apparently apologized. He then went on Kailyn\u2019s podcast to talk about his split Briana and his relationship with his ex. He said there are a lot of things he would have done differently if he went back to the start of his relationship with Briana.\n\n\u201cMy new relationship should not be mixed with a past relationship,\u201d Javi said. \u201cI\u2019m trying to learn from my mistakes.\u201d However, the two continued to talk about it anyway, and Kailyn totally trashed Briana. Briana obviously caught wind of the episode and went off on Twitter.\n\n\u201cI was so pissed, I couldn\u2019t hold back,\u201d Briana said. And we thought the last reunion was crazy.\n\nLeah and Jeremy Go on a Date\n\nLeah Messer finally went on a date to a pottery painting place with her ex Jeremy Calvert this episode, except she made her daughter Addie come. Jeremy seemed upset he didn\u2019t get one-on-one time with Leah but liked having the family together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m glad I got to take you and Addie out for an evening,\u201d Jeremy said. Leah later told her friend that she had so much fun with her ex.\n\n\u201cHe just wants me to be like \u2018Let\u2019s get back together,\u2019\u201d Leah said. \u201cDoes it cross my mind when he mentions it? Yes.\u201d However, she said things would need to be drastically different than it was in their previous relationship for it to even work.\n\nJace Calls Jenelle and David \u2018Pieces of S\u2014t\u2019\n\nDavid Eason wasn\u2019t being filmed after MTV cut ties with him for a string of homophobic tweets last week, but Jenelle Evans acted like it was his decision to not be filmed. She got to spend some time with Jace this week, but when he went back to Barbara Evans house, he did not seem to have a good time at his mother\u2019s.\n\n\u201cI missed you so much,\u201d Jace told his grandma, adding that Jenelle wouldn\u2019t let him call her. \u201cMommy was being mean.\u201d\n\nAs the episode went on, Jace told Barbara about how the couple was treating Kaiser. Specifically, they wouldn\u2019t let Kaiser hang out on the boat with them and sent him to daycare for the day. \u201cMommy and David are pieces of s\u2014t,\u201d Jace said before spitting on the ground. Jenelle is not going to be happy about this one.\n\nChelsea Finds Out Her Baby\u2019s Gender\n\nChelsea Houska found out she was having a girl and couldn\u2019t wait to surprise Cole Deboer. She decorated the house in pink things, but she and her daughter had to be super sneaky at the party store so news wouldn\u2019t get out that she was pregnant.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re on the same team,\u201d she said to Aubree. \u201cI hate lying Aubree \u2026 I\u2019m a terrible liar.\u201d\n\nTheir plan worked and Cole was over-the-moon about having a baby girl of his own. \u201cI had a feeling from the get go,\u201d he said. \u201cI have a lot of learning to do.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/briana-dejesus-javi-marroquin-teen-mom-kiss-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C1080px%2C568px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/briana-dejesus-javi-marroquin-teen-mom-kiss-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C1080px%2C568px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Apryl Lovera", "Alex Darus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/teen-mom-2-recap-briana-dejesus-and-javi-marroquin-split-and-kailyn-lowry-makes-things-worse/", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Recap: Briana and Javi Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "teen mom 2", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Briana DeJesus and Javi Marroquin broke up during the Monday, July 2, episode of \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 \u2013 read Us Weekly\u2019s recap", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Recap: Briana and Javi Split, and Kailyn Makes Things Worse", "description": "Briana DeJesus and Javi Marroquin broke up during the Monday, July 2, episode of \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 \u2013 read Us Weekly\u2019s recap", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/teen-mom-2-recap-briana-dejesus-and-javi-marroquin-split-and-kailyn-lowry-makes-things-worse/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-09T20:21:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/briana-dejesus-javi-marroquin-teen-mom-kiss-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C1080px%2C568px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/briana-dejesus-javi-marroquin-teen-mom-kiss-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C1080px%2C568px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-03T02:01:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-09T20:21:48+00:00"}, "author": "Apryl Lovera", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Recap: Briana and Javi Split, and Kailyn Makes Things Worse", "description": "Briana DeJesus and Javi Marroquin broke up during the Monday, July 2, episode of \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 \u2013 read Us Weekly\u2019s recap", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/briana-dejesus-javi-marroquin-teen-mom-kiss-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C1080px%2C568px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530583260.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
