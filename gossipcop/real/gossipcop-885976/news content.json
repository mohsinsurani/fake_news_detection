The style on display is really striking, as is the new balanced philosophy of the Force it seems to be presenting.\n\nBut instead of getting overly excited about what we saw today, we should take a step back and remember that \u201cStar Wars\u201d marketing is hardly trustworthy these days. Personally, I\u2019m more wary of \u201cStar Wars\u201d marketing now than I\u2019ve ever been before \u2014 and that\u2019s saying something after the disastrous prequel era.\n\nMy skepticism is certainly warranted. Marketing for the prequels wasn\u2019t full of scenes that weren\u2019t in those movies. The trailers for \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d and \u201cRogue One,\u201d on the other hand, very much were.\n\nAlso Read: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi': Let's See What We Can Learn from These 25 Trailer Shots (Photos)\n\nWhile \u201cThe Force Awakens\u201d set off warning bells for the absence of seemingly significant trailer dialogue and scenes here and there, \u201cRogue One\u201d took that to another level completely. We are, after all, talking about a movie which was still including scenes that were cut in TV spots through its release in theaters. My friends and I went to a bar after our first viewing, and were very amused to see a commercial on TV featuring multiple scenes that didn\u2019t make the cut. It\u2019s pretty hard not to be cynical after that!\n\nMore pertinent to this first \u201cLast Jedi\u201d trailer, though, is that the vast majority of the stuff in the initial trailer for \u201cRogue One\u201d ended up on the cutting room floor. It was actually pretty shocking to go back and watch that trailer again after seeing the movie \u2014 I knew some things were missing, but didn\u2019t quite realize that much was gone. Sequences and shots that were at the center of \u201cRogue One\u201d marketing from that trailer onward \u2014 the shot of the titular heist crew running on the beach of Scarib toward Imperial walkers springs immediately to mind \u2014 were extremely notable for their absence from the movie itself.\n\nThere was, of course, a pretty obvious reason for why that turned out to be the case. It was hardly a secret that \u201cRogue One\u201d underwent significant rewrites and reshoots (though to what degree is up for debate), some of which was said to have continued after that first trailer was revealed last April. The plot of the movie changed enough that a bunch of scenes became obsolete. Including that money shot of our heroes running on the beach. during the big battle. In the finished film, the main heroes, Jyn and Cassian, never even fought on the ground at all during that battle, so it made sense that it no longer fit.\n\nAlso Read: 'Star Wars: The Last Jedi' Trailer: 'It's Time for the Jedi to End' (Video)\n\nNot that we\u2019re ever going to be happy about that, since, as mentioned above, they continued to use that shot in the marketing until the movie was released.\n\nAnd so it\u2019s hard to look at this first trailer for \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi\u201d and have any real feelings about it. By the time the movie comes out in December all or significant amounts of this stuff could be rendered obsolete. There\u2019s no reason to assume that this time will be different, and that LucasFilm will base its marketing campaign on things that are actually in the movie. Until the movie comes out we can\u2019t know for sure.\n\nSo, for now, you\u2019d be wise to take this first trailer for \u201cThe Last Jedi\u201d with a grain of salt.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Star-wars-the-last-jedi-trailer-luke-skywalker-daisy-ridley-ray-hand.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thewrap-film-slate.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cover-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo_Small.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a35fd3f5b42ea1ce687d607de9efb300?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewrap.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fthewrap-canvas%2Fimgs%2Fthewrap-gravatar.png&r=g", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo-Stacked.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Image-2022-04-26-at-3.00.43-PM-300x81.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Star-wars-the-last-jedi-trailer-luke-skywalker-daisy-ridley-ray-hand.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Owen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/star-wars-last-jedi-trailer-looked-great-much-will-actually-movie-commentary/", "title": "That \u2018Star Wars: The Last Jedi\u2019 Trailer Looked Great, But How Much of It Will Actually Be in the Movie?
