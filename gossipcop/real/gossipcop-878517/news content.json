But she claimed there are \"others\" who do but are too embarrassed to say so publicly.\n\n\"I am doing this so that he does not do this to anyone else,\" she said, urging the singer to reveal his status. \"Usher, if you are negative, please say so. If you are positive, you need to warn your sex partners, so that they can make their own informed decisions.\u201d\n\nThe Sharpton lawsuit, which does not specify how much the plaintifs are seeking in damages, asserts that Usher contracted herpes before his encounters with the plaintiffs. Bloom said those happened after 2012.\n\nBloom called Usher's response to the lawsuit \"a standard legal answer. We look forward to taking Usher's deposition soon and to proving our case in court,\" she told USA TODAY.\n\nUsher's publicist has not yet responded to USA TODAY's request for comment.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/96540a62a4baca573aa67ead301ef6d67ee0a2f4/c=343-0-5707-4033/local/-/media/2017/09/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636403971553822794-EPA-SCHWEIZ-MUSIC.jpg?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7821f68466cd44cf0bb2bf07b49b03bdf7c6deb7/c=0-121-6042-3534/local/-/media/2017/09/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636403971553822794-EPA-SCHWEIZ-MUSIC.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5533692341001_5533692434001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7821f68466cd44cf0bb2bf07b49b03bdf7c6deb7/c=0-121-6042-3534/local/-/media/2017/09/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636403971553822794-EPA-SCHWEIZ-MUSIC.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Puente"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/09/07/usher-responds-herpes-lawsuit-denies-he-exposed-plaintiffs-std/643003001/", "title": "Usher responds to herpes lawsuit, denies he exposed plaintiffs to STD", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/2017/09/07/usher-responds-herpes-lawsuit-denies-he-exposed-plaintiffs-std/643003001/life", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Usher responds to herpes lawsuit, denies he exposed plaintiffs to STD", "description": "In first response to lawsuit accusing Usher of exposing sex partners to herpes, he denies it, seeks dismissal.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7821f68466cd44cf0bb2bf07b49b03bdf7c6deb7/c=0-121-6042-3534/local/-/media/2017/09/07/USATODAY/USATODAY/636403971553822794-EPA-SCHWEIZ-MUSIC.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "In first response to lawsuit accusing Usher of exposing sex partners to herpes, he denies it, seeks dismissal.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504738800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
