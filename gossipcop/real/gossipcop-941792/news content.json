Martin) and Iris (Candice Patton) never knew they had. Once in Central City, he eventually took on the role of Kid Flash. During this past season of the CW superhero drama, Lonsdale jumped ship to sister series Legends of Tomorrow, boarding the Waverider as a series regular.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve changed a lot in the past year (as you\u2019ve probably noticed lol), and for infinite reasons my perspective on life & what I want from it now is just completely different,\u201d continued Lonsdale. \u201cBecause of that, my heart told me it was the right time to continue my journey on an unknown path, and I\u2019m so damn grateful to both shows for honouring & respecting that with me.\u201d\n\nHe concluded, \u201cI love Kid Flash, I love the family I\u2019ve made, & I\u2019m absolutely in love with the invaluable lessons I\u2019ve learnt along the way. Thank you for believing in me & rooting for Wally to thrive, you honestly helped me see that i did indeed deserve to play him, & that shit right there made me a stronger actor ?? Anyway, I hope you stick around for the new adventures, the only thing I can promise is Magic.\u201d\n\nWhile Lonsdale won\u2019t be back, Legends of Tomorrow has already added Matt Ryan and Jes Macallan full-time for season 4, which, along with The Flash season 5, premieres in the fall.", "images":
