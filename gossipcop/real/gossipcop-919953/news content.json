Information on the DC march and other sister marches can be found on the March for Our Lives official website.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shawn-mendes-time-gala-1525455897.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.891xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-930632738-1520868617.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/parkland-students-clear-backpacks-1522773934.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://www.seventeen.com/_assets/design-tokens/seventeen/static/images/logos/network-logo.21081f5.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/20191212-dhr2-1576198973.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-930632726-1520868311.jpg?crop=0.6665064872657376xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rally-for-gun-control-1519399522.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0994xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unknown-1-1518710490.jpeg?crop=0.6570477247502775xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mg-3961-1522081033.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/evil-eye-gloves-1522080236.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/unknown-41-1521571364.jpeg?crop=0.9958333333333333xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/march-for-our-lives-posters-1522075942.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.251xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/march-for-our-lives-protestors-1522954047.jpg?crop=0.721xw:1.00xh;0.114xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ebc9841a-f2a6-4043-85a9-243348d2098a_1649694247.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/17-index-gunviolenceteens-1550084334.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/demi-lovato-march-for-our-lives-1522080563.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bkz049918-cover-noupc-1522938917.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.738xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-930632726-1520868311.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0313xh&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-930632726-1520868311.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0313xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/a19407397/eminem-hailey-baldwin-iheartradio-music-awards-2018-gun-violence/", "title": "Celebrities Made a Powerful Statement About Gun Violence at the the iHeartRadio Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Hailey Baldwin, Eminem Address Gun Violence at the the iHeartRadio Awards 2018", "description": "Big Sean, Hailey Baldwin, and Eminem took to the stage at the iHeartRadio Music Awards on March 11 to talk about gun violence.
