Their intended office romp, however, was interrupted by a janitor and never continued due to the unexpected arrival of a new client: Charles\u2019 ex-wife, played by Jennifer Westfeldt. Liza also stopped short of finally confessing the truth about her age.\n\n\u201cSome of the biggest debates we have in the writers room are about where Liza\u2019s heart lies and what she really wants,\u201d Younger creator Darren Star tells The Hollywood Reporter of Liza ping-ponging between Charles and Josh. \u201cLiza is, in a lot of ways, inauthentic. She discovers a lot of her inner-authenticity in a way by being inauthentic in her roles and relationships. Some of her strongest relationships, like between her and Charles, are built on a shaky foundation. We talk about: How complicit is she in telling this emotional lie? And when and how does it end?\u201d\n\nVeteran show writer Alison Brown, who spoke to THR about the groundbreaking portrayal of Lauren (Molly Bernard) after last week\u2019s episode, said the \u201ctouchy\u201d office relationship between Liza and Charles is more difficult for the writers to hash out behind the scenes than blazing a trail with the sexually fluid character. (Last week delivered Younger with its most-watched episode to date.)\n\n\u201cThe Liza and Charles relationship is the discussion we are constantly having in the writers room,\u201d she tells THR. \u201cHow far do you take this relationship of a boss and a co-worker? That is something we have long conversations about, as opposed to conversations about how to portray Lauren\u2019s sexuality. We have a pretty queer room, we\u2019re very aware.\u201d\n\nFoster had previously summed up the problem as being very simple: \u201cLiza loves two men,\u201d the actress told THR earlier in the season. \u201cThere\u2019s a part of her that will always love Josh. And he will always love Liza, so there\u2019s this thing. But the Charles of it all just hasn\u2019t been explored yet, and that\u2019s why I say I\u2019m Team Charles. I want them to have their moment.\u201d\n\nHermann was also jonesing for Liza and Charles to come together and for Charles to find out Liza\u2019s big secret, despite the likely consequences. \u201cIt would be a really beautiful aspect to see this age barrier fall between them, but it also would make him have to re-edit everything,\u201d the actor told THR. \u201cThat means interactions or moments together where you thought the other person was being their honest self. That\u2019s something to process.\u201d\n\nWednesday night brought their moment, which seemed dead in the water until the end of the episode when Charles called Liza to say that he has no regrets. But even if they decide to take things further, the massive lie of Liza\u2019s true age, and double life, will still be hanging between them.\n\n\u201cThis season, we really take things very much to edge,\u201d says Star. \u201cThat is why at the end of the first season Liza had to let Josh know the truth about her age, and that\u2019s why she had to tell Kelsey. There\u2019s a level of emotional involvement with people where you don\u2019t want to continue lying to them.\u201d\n\nWith Charles still in the dark, Star classifies their relationship as being \u201cmuddy,\u201d and says the arrival of Westfeldt \u2014 who is signed on for a guest arc \u2014 throws a \u201cmonkey wrench\u201d between them and proves to be a real complication. That fact, coupled with Liza\u2019s rise at Empirical Press, makes Charles finding out the truth in the near future seem unlikely.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s important that she has her job,\u201d Star says of the threat of Liza losing the publishing gig if Charles were to find out. \u201cRight now, Liza is very intent on having a job, somewhere. That\u2019s her intent in doing this from the start. Younger is a show about work and people whose work defines them and is really important.\u201d\n\nThe other big development from Wednesday was the long-hinted-at coming together of Josh and Kelsey. During a weekend getaway, the flirty roommates acted on their feelings with a kiss, but Kelsey stopped it there and told Josh it wasn\u2019t right. The moment seemed open-ended, but Star says the mature scene shuts the Josh and Kelsey chapter.\n\n\u201cI thought they resolved something with a lot of integrity,\u201d says Star. \u201cI do feel like it\u2019s a resolution to the story we\u2019ve been telling this season in a small way.\u201d\n\nHow to handle the Josh and Kelsey betrayal was another hot discussion topic for the show\u2019s writers.\n\n\u201cThat is something that what we talked a lot about: Would they have sex, could they have sex and what would happen if they did? We decided pretty firmly that it wasn\u2019t something we wanted our characters who we love to do and we felt like that was something they wouldn\u2019t do. It felt off-limits,\u201d says Star.\n\nHe wouldn\u2019t comment on whether Liza will ultimately find out \u2014 despite her being otherwise occupied with her brewing Charles relationship \u2014 but he says the side romance has come to an end.\n\n\u201cI think it does close the book for now,\u201d he says of Josh and Kelsey and any feelings they might have for each other. \u201cThey acknowledge it, it\u2019s on the table. But I think the door is definitely closed for now in a way that preserves the characters. They made a decision based on a level of integrity that they both have.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/younger_cast_and_inset_of_darren_star.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/younger_cast_and_inset_of_darren_star.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/posttruth7_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/younger_ep407_mp_8752_r-_embed_2017.jpg?w=928", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/younger_cast_and_inset_of_darren_star.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Strause"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/younger-boss-darren-star-liza-charles-josh-kelsey-kisses-future-1028455/", "title": "\u2018Younger\u2019 Boss Provides Clarity on Two Open-Ended Character Romances", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'Younger' creator Darren Star shuts the door on one of the two TV Land series' couples who finally kissed on Wednesday's episode.", "news_keywords": "Darren Star, Younger", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Jackie Strause", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1028455, "title": "'Younger' Boss Provides Clarity on Two Open-Ended Character Romances", "published_at": "2017-08-10 11:21:53", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/younger_cast_and_inset_of_darren_star.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Younger", "topics": "TV News", "body": "Younger\u00a0officially graduated from a love triangle to a love square on Wednesday's double whammy of an episode.\r\nIn a game of relationship musical chairs, the TV Land series finally pushed forward the long-gestating relationship between Liza (Sutton Foster) and her boss Charles (Peter Hermann), as well as the percolating\u00a0romance between Liza's ex Josh (Nico Tortorella) and best friend Kelsey (Hilary Duff).\u00a0\r\nAfter Charles confessed his feelings to Liza the episode prior, his employee \u2014 who is posing as a twentysomething but is actually age-appropriate for forty-something Charles \u2014 acted on her uncontrollable sex fantasy and lunged, lips first, towards him.
