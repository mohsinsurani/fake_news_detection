In that position, he would focus on revenue and business development over content and media management.[17][18] In April 2019, Playboy Enterprises CEO Ben Kohn confirmed Hefner would exit his senior role at Playboy to launch a media brand, the Hefner Media Corporation, and a digital content platform called HefPost.[19] Later, through Instagram and Twitter accounts after having left Playboy, in July 2019 Hefner stated his new digital content platform would be called instead StagDaily.[20][21]\n\nIn December 2019, Hefner halted plans to start a media company and digital content platform, and chose instead to enlist in the United States Air Force.[22] Hefner was previously a member of the California State Military Reserve.[23] Hefner was deployed stateside to New Jersey's Joint Base McGuire\u2013Dix\u2013Lakehurst for Operation Allies Welcome, which supported resettlement of approximately 130,000 refugees airlifted from Afghanistan following the U.S. withdrawal in 2021.[24]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 2015, Hefner became engaged to British actress Scarlett Byrne.[8] On November 4, 2019, Hefner and Byrne announced that they had married.[20] On August 24, 2020, Byrne gave birth to their first daughter.[25] On March 26, 2022, she gave birth to twin daughters.[26]\n\nHefner is a teacher at Chapman University, where he also serves on the board of governors.[27][28]\n\nHefner considered running for Congress in California's 37th congressional district in 2016.[10] In July 2020, Hefner announced his campaign as a Democrat for the California Senate in 2022, in the state's 30th District, but suspended it four months later.[29][30]\n\nReferences [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Cooper_Hefner.jpg/220px-Cooper_Hefner.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Cooper_Hefner.jpg/1200px-Cooper_Hefner.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Cooper_Hefner.jpg/1200px-Cooper_Hefner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cooper_Hefner", "title": "Cooper Hefner", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c5/Cooper_Hefner.jpg/640px-Cooper_Hefner.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 688}, "title": "Cooper Hefner - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
