More info\n\nThe HBO mammoth hit\u2019s final episode will be a very sad day for devoted Game of Thrones fans, but it\u2019s sure to be a cracker that ties up all the loose ends. One of the major questions on everybody\u2019s lips is what will happen to fan-favourite characters Daenerys (played by Emilia Clarke) and Jon Snow (Kit Harington). The pair joined forces as allies in the final episodes of season seven before taking things to the next level to become lovers, but fans can\u2019t forget about the mother of dragons\u2019 first love Khal Drogo (Jason Momoa), who died in season two. After watching season two episode ten, one fan put the startling pieces together to form an incredible theory for a Drogo return, despite the fact he and their son died.\n\nPosting on fan forum site Reddit, the fan claimed one moment could be a huge foreshadowing for season eight. User Bronn of The Blackwater wrote: \u201cI\u2019m currently doing a re-watch, and I just finished watching S02E10. I just realised that Daenerys\u2019 vision might be a big foreshadow. \u201cIn her vision, Dany sees the iron throne, she reached for it, but then decided to go north of the wall and found Khal Drogo with her son. \u201cI think the first part already happened: Dany had the opportunity to seize the throne, by fighting Cersei [Lannister], but decided to go North instead to help Jon Snow fight the Night King.\u201d The fan went on to speculate Daenerys will die in the show\u2019s final episode, but it will be a bittersweet ending for the character?\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Daenerys Targaryen to die and reunite with Khal Drogo?\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers: Will Daenerys and Khal Drogo be happy in the afterlife together?\n\nDaenerys will join Drogo and her son by dying because she decides to go north Reddit user\n\nThey continued: \u201cSo, maybe the second part of the vision will happen in season eight and Daenerys will join Drogo and her son by dying because she decides to go north.\u201d Elsewhere, HBO may have accidentally revealed the fates of King of the North Jon and his little sister Sansa Stark (Sophie Turner). The American network released a first look at the pair in the latest offering of the fantasy drama, and it looks like there\u2019s trouble ahead for the duo. Sansa could be set to betray her older brother as the camera zooms in on the Lady of Winterfell\u2019s face and she appears incredibly tense. Viewers can see Sansa embracing her brother tightly, but as she looks over his shoulder, her face darkens and it\u2019s clear the character is hiding something.\n\nGame of Thrones season 8 spoilers:
