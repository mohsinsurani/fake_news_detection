She seems okay with [the breakup],\u201d says the source, who adds, \u201cAs soon as their long European vacation was over, they started having problems. Younes was in L.A. recently, and things were not great. He and Kourtney didn\u2019t get along. They decided to take a break but were not officially over.\u201d\n\nThen, on Monday, photos of Bendjima getting cozy with another woman in Mexico surfaced. \u201cNow with the pictures of Younes in Mexico, they are definitely not getting back together,\u201d the source says.\n\nBertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty\n\nFollowing news of their breakup, Bendjima spoke out on his Instagram Story.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not attached to this \u2018life\u2019 so you can\u2019t touch me,\u201d he wrote from Mexico as he shared photos of his getaway. \u201cI know who I am where I\u2019m from and where I\u2019m going and that bothers you. Only one opinion matter the one of my Lord Have a wonderful day.\u201d\n\nBefore his latest social media comment, Bendjima denied the situation in Mexico was romantic. \u201cThey really want me to be the bad guy. F\u2014 your Hollywood bulls\u2014, can\u2019t have fun with your friends no more,\u201d he also posted on Instagram Story.\n\nKardashian, 39, and Bendjima first met in Paris in October 2016 \u2014 just one night before her sister Kim Kardashian West was robbed at gunpoint. Bendjima, who is Algerian and speaks fluent French, acted as a translator throughout the ordeal.\n\nBy May 2017, PEOPLE confirmed that the two had started seeing each other, and they went public with their romance in Cannes later that month.\n\nVivien Killilea/Getty Images\n\nRecently, Kardashian, who is mom to sons Mason, 8, Reign, 3, and 5-year-old daughter Penelope, has been spotted on several solo outings in Los Angeles and was last seen with Bendjima in late July during their three-week European vacation.\n\nAn insider previously told PEOPLE that Bendjima was never a fan of his girlfriend\u2019s revealing photos.\n\n\u201cHe never liked that she posted sexy pictures of herself on social media,\u201d said the insider. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want his girlfriend to do that. He gets that it\u2019s her job, but wants her to post more covered-up pictures. He has always had a problem with this. This is the stuff they argue about and what made them split in the past.\u201d", "images":
