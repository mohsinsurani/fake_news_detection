Although technically no longer a member of the royal family, Sarah \u2013 who is also known as Fergie \u2013 is still aunt to Prince William and Prince Harry. It is also known Sarah still lives with Prince Andrew at the Royal Lodge in Windsor. Surprisingly, Sarah was not among the 1,900 guests at the wedding of Prince William to Kate Middleton, 36, in 2011. Yet she made the cut for Prince Harry\u2019s wedding to Meghan Markle, 36, earlier this year, which was attended by a far fewer 600 guests.\n\nSarah Ferguson was invited to Prince Harry's wedding this year but not Prince William's 2011 wedding\n\nWhy was Sarah at Prince Harry\u2019s nuptials but not Prince William\u2019s? It is known Prince Harry is close to his aunt Sarah, whom he \u201cgets on with really well\u201d, according to a source. A source who holidays at Verbier \u2013 a favourite Swiss ski resort among the royals \u2013 spoke to the publication about Harry and Sarah\u2019s \u201cadoration\u201d for each other in 2016. The source said: \u201cHarry gets on with Fergie really well. He thinks she\u2019s hilarious, and they have a mutual adoration society. \u201cHe loves being part of her redsetter mob [a Royal Family nickname for her] and they ski together, then gas over mulled wine.\u201d\n\nSarah Ferguson: She is aunt to Prince William and Prince Harry\n\nSarah Ferguson: She was not invited to the 2011 wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton\n\nHowever, there may be another reason Sarah was not invited to Prince William\u2019s wedding. A year before the 2011 wedding, Sarah was filmed selling \u201caccess\u201d to her ex husband Prince Andrew. It is commonly believed this is the reason Sarah was not invited to the wedding. After the wedding, she spoke about how \u201cdifficult\u201d it was for her not being included. \u201cI wanted to be there with my girls\u2026 to be getting them dressed and to go as a family,\u201d she said on the Oprah Winfrey show.\n\nSarah Ferguson: She attended Prince Harry's wedding to Meghan Markle earlier this year", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/750x445/997576.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/750x445/997576.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Francesca Specter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/997576/sarah-ferguson-duchess-of-york-fergie-prince-harry-prince-william", "title": "Sarah Ferguson at Prince Harry wedding but NOT Prince William's \u2013 why?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Sarah Ferguson, 58, is an aunt through marriage to Prince Harry, 33, and Prince William, 36.
