While she was there, however, she revealed that she got into a \u201creal bar fight\u201d while filming on location in Budapest after a fan responded rudely after she politely declined a selfie with him.\n\n\u201cI was drunk, which is rare,\u201d Lawrence said with a chuckle. \u201cThis guy asked me for a selfie and I was like, \u2018No. Thank you. No.\u2019 He was like, \u2018Please! My girlfriend will never believe me.\u2019 My friend was like, \u2018If your girlfriend won\u2019t believe you then she\u2019s not The One.'\u201d\n\nAfter asking the fan to go away, he had some less than savory words for her, which set into motion the bar fight.\n\n\u201cSomething in me just snapped \u2014 but it couldn\u2019t have been the alcohol,\u201d she said. \u201cI grabbed him, I took beers and I started dousing him, all over him.\u201d\n\nLawrence didn\u2019t stop there, however; she saw that the fan also had a suitcase and made quick work covering that in beer as well.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Is that your sh-t?!\u2019 I started pouring beers all over his suitcase. My friend Chris came up, grabbed me from behind and goes, \u2018Don\u2019t waste beer! Don\u2019t waste beer!\u2019 I instantly relaxed. I was like, \u2018Of course! What was I thinking?'\u201d\n\nWatch the full clip above.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence-bar-fight-budapest.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rihanna-beyonce-diamond-ball.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/washington-politics-unity.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence-bar-fight-budapest.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4943429/jennifer-lawrence-on-bar-fight/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Got Into a Bar Fight With Fan in Budapest", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence confirmed that she's still a very relatable human by telling a story of getting in a bar fight in Budapest.", "og": {"title": "Jennifer Lawrence Got Into a Bar Fight With Fan in Budapest", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4943429/jennifer-lawrence-on-bar-fight/", "description": "Of course", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence-bar-fight-budapest.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4943429/jennifer-lawrence-on-bar-fight/", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence confirmed that she's still a very relatable human by telling a story of getting in a bar fight in Budapest.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence-bar-fight-budapest.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4943429/jennifer-lawrence-on-bar-fight/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence Got Into a Bar Fight With Fan in Budapest", "description": "Of course", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jennifer-lawrence-bar-fight-budapest.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
