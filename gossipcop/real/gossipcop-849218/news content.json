Though June will be all about the next generation of Clooneys, May belongs to their dad, who turned 56 on Saturday. Thanks to Amal\u2019s surprise birthday-party-planning skills, there was plenty of fanfare\u2014Casamigos Tequila cake included\u2014to go along with her husband\u2019s birthday.\n\nWhen he arrived at the couple\u2019s London home on Saturday, George received a bit of a shock, per E! News. He was greeted by Rande Gerber atop his lawnmower\u2014while Cindy Crawford trimmed fresh flowers in a nearby garden. They were joined by a group of close friends all there to surprise George.\n\nE! reports that the whole thing was set up by a crafty Amal, who was careful not to miss any birthdays at the party. Gerber, who turned 55 on April 27, got to share in the celebration with his business partner. The cake, which followed the theme of Casamigos Tequila (George\u2019s company with Gerber) featured George and Rande cake-toppers. \u201dHappy Birthday Amigos,\u201d it read.\n\nAll important productions in the Clooney household seem to fall safely in the hands of Amal\u2014as indicated by Matt Damon\u2019s March interview with Entertainment Tonight about the couple\u2019s soon-to-be-born twins:\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s going to get prepared,\u201d Damon said. \u201cHe better figure it out, \u2019cause they\u2019re on the way. But he\u2019ll be great. He\u2019ll be a mess, but [Amal] will take care of everything.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c6abe90a144505fae9ea23/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Pregnancy-Looks-ss-3.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c6abe20a144505fae9ea21/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Pregnancy-Looks-ss-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58c6abe20a144505fae9ea20/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Amal-Clooney-Pregnancy-Looks-ss-1.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/590b43056231b140f4d5c2c3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-510547808.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63236bf7c1df471d836f1cd2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6324bef96009e759e6639150/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58dc1405a6c57958a7d862b5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/amal-clooney-barrister.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5910cbbf576b7222f90791f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amal-george-clooney-birthday-party.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5910cbbf576b7222f90791f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amal-george-clooney-birthday-party.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Hilary Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/amal-clooney-threw-george-clooney-a-birthday-party", "title": "Amal Clooney Threw George a Surprise Birthday Party\u2014and There\u2019s a Photo", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Complete with Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber, and a cake to top them all.", "id": "5910ca3a7b7ac138c1a93528", "keywords": "george clooney,amal clooney,birthday,surprise,rande gerber,casamigos tequila", "news_keywords": "george clooney,amal clooney,birthday,surprise,rande gerber,casamigos tequila", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5910ca3a7b7ac138c1a93528", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Complete with Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber, and a cake to top them all.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5910cbbf576b7222f90791f5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/amal-george-clooney-birthday-party.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5910cbbf576b7222f90791f5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/amal-george-clooney-birthday-party.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Complete with Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber, and a cake to top them all.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5910cbbf576b7222f90791f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amal-george-clooney-birthday-party.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Amal Clooney Threw George a Surprise Birthday Party\u2014and There\u2019s a Photo", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/amal-clooney-threw-george-clooney-a-birthday-party"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-08T19:50:56.834Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-08T19:50:56.834Z", "author": "Hilary Weaver"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Complete with Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber, and a cake to top them all.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5910cbbf576b7222f90791f5/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amal-george-clooney-birthday-party.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Amal Clooney Threw George a Surprise Birthday Party\u2014and There\u2019s a Photo"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494273056.834, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
