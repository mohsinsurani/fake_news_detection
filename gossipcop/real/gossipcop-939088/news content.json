It didn\u2019t show a lot of the premise of the film, but what it did show was Winnie the Pooh in live action setting. While there were people the criticised how Pooh looked, the overall thoughts were positive. Having a film that has Pooh search out an older Christopher Robin seems like the exact film we need. Then came the release of a new trailer today, and I can say it hit every emotion it needed.\n\nChristopher Robin is a film that will show an older Christopher Robin, but showing a person who\u2019s forgotten about his past. Winnie the Pooh and friends seem to never forgetting about him, which makes the trailer seem so much more tragic. Anyone who watched cartoons or films of these characters can surely feel this. The film seems to follow a timeline that will allow Christopher Robin to help Pooh, but then make Pooh and friends help Christopher Robin. This is a great concept as it seems while Christopher Robin has forgotten about his furry friends, his friends never forgotten about him. It seems the only conclusion can be a sad one.\n\nWhy should fans be excited for this film? Disney is bringing us to a place where we have been in other films, but it\u2019s different since we never saw this with Winnie the Pooh. A film that could be used as a comparison is the 1991 film, Hook, starring Robin Williams as Peter Pan. In Hook, Peter forgets about Neverland and the Lost Boys, but the longer he stayed there, the more he remembered. Christopher Robin will probably be more of a drama than Hook, as Hook was an action film.\n\nOverall, this is the perfect film for the family. The older generations that grew up with Winnie the Pooh, like myself, can enjoy this film with their families. The nostalgic factor is there, but the film doesn\u2019t seem it since this is a live action film. And with today\u2019s technology, Disney can really show us something we\u2019ve never seen before with these characters.\n\nChristopher Robin will be released on August 3, 2018, starring Winnie the Pooh, Eeyore, Piglet, Tigger and Ewan McGregor (who should be starring in an Obi Wan film soon).\n\nCheck out the trailer here!\n\nRelated\n\n1 SHARES Facebook Twitter\n\nCategory: Film, Uncategorized", "images": ["http://nerdbastards.com/adamdonaldson_s.jpg", "http://nerdbastards.com/markpoynter_s.jpg", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/SoloASWS.1.jpeg", "https://i1.wp.com/nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/r6l2bcbbdalrg0thmdnv-e1526999897130.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/themes/NerdBastards-responsive/images/Darth-Fanboy.png", "http://nerdbastards.com/rush.jpg", "http://nerdbastards.com/khaliljohnson.jpg", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/themes/NerdBastards%202011/images/logo-nb-f.jpg", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/nbtees.png", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Deadpool-2.1.jpg", "https://i1.wp.com/nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/maxresdefault-1.jpg?w=600", "https://i0.wp.com/nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/comic-congurls.png?resize=150%2C150", "https://i0.wp.com/nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Screen-Shot-2017-04-29-at-12.10.43-AM.png?resize=150%2C150", "http://nerdbastards.com/551175.jpeg", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Avengers-Infinity-War1.png", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/maxresdefault-1.jpg", "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/themes/NerdBastards-responsive/images/nb-logo.png", "http://nerdbastards.com/el-jero-1_s.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/3733894_n_vir3.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://i2.wp.com/nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Screen-Shot-2015-08-17-at-10.55.44-AM.png?resize=150%2C150"], "top_img": "http://nerdbastards.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/maxresdefault-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Posted Chris Samocki"], "canonical_link": "http://nerdbastards.com/2018/05/26/the-new-christopher-robin-trailer-hits-all-the-feels/", "title": "The New Christopher Robin Trailer Hits All The Feels", "meta_data": {"generator": "WordPress 4.8.5", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The New Christopher Robin Trailer Hits All The Feels", "url": "http://nerdbastards.com/2018/05/26/the-new-christopher-robin-trailer-hits-all-the-feels/", "description": "A few months ago, we received a teaser trailer for the upcoming Christopher Robin film.
