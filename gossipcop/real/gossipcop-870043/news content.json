The band has endorsed more than 300 memorials for the singer organized by LP fans and ambassadors across the globe.\n\nLinkin Park co-founder Mike Shinoda spoke directly to fans regarding Bennington\u2019s death in an Instagram post on Friday. In the post, he invited his followers to celebrate his bandmate locally via a Google doc at tiny.cc/lpmemorial.\n\nSome memorials have already taken place \u2014 such as the ones in Burbank and New York City \u2014 while others are expected to occur as far into the future as October. But the Linkin Park-approved services aren\u2019t only reserved for North American music lovers. Memorials have also been planned for multiple cities across Africa, Asia, Europe, Oceania, and South America. Fans can even verify their own memorials for Bennington by making a public Facebook event and subsequently messaging the band.\n\nLinkin Park previously honored their former frontman with the suicide prevention website chester.linkinpark.com.\n\nShinoda shared his message the same day Bennington\u2019s widow Talinda Bennington penned a heartbreaking statement to her followers. \u201cWe had a fairytale life and now it has turned into some sick Shakespearean tragedy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHow do I move on?\u201d\n\n41-year-old Bennington is survived by his wife and six children.\n\nIn case you or someone you know needs support, here are some resources:\n\nSuicide Prevention Lifeline: 1-800-273-TALK\n\nCrisis Text Line, the free, nationwide, 24/7 text message service for people in crisis, is here to support.
