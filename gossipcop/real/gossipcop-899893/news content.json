A spokesman for the palace said that the royal family did not fund the event and it was held on the palace's public grounds.\n\nPrince Harry and Prince William, of course, live in Kensington Palace along with the Duchess of Cambridge and several other royal figures. Interestingly, reports emerged that the princes in fact did not attend the party, despite their involvement in the film and their presence at the premiere. That means that Kate Middleton and Meghan Markel were also absent from the festivities.\n\nThose who did party hard on palace grounds included \"Star Wars\" lead actors Daisy Ridley, John Boyegea and Laura Dern, as well as UK native Andrew Garfield -- who isn't in the cast, but who would turn down such an invitation?\n\n\"At Kensington Gardens for our after party,\" Dern wrote on Instagram. \"With my gorgeous friend and mentor, Andrew.\"\n\nIt's unclear if the real-life Luke Skywalker, Mark Hamill, attended the party -- he was active on Twitter late Tuesday night, although it's possible he was just popping onto his phone every once in awhile while enjoying the evening.\n\nEarlier in the night, Prince William and Harry were beyond enchanted to meet beloved droid BB-8.
