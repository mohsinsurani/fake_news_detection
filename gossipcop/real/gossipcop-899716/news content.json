USA TODAY\n\nJada Pinkett Smith is not pleased that the Hollywood Foreign Press Association didn't nominate her Girls Trip co-star Tiffany Haddish for a Golden Globe.\n\nSmith launched a tweetstorm criticizing the HFPA and the nominations process Tuesday, saying she was \"discouraged,\" and accusing the nominating body of not having watched the movie.\n\n\"Girls Trip was one of the most successful films this summer & Tiff was hands down the funniest person on screen in 2017 and we couldn't get eyes on the film or a press conference. How could a nom happen & how much more critical acclaim must a movie have to simply get a screening?\" she tweeted.\n\nHowever, a source with knowledge of the situation not authorized to comment publicly confirmed to USA TODAY that there was an official screening on July 18 for the HFPA, and members were also invited to the premiere.\n\nHaddish's awards season chances looked golden after the breakout star earned a supporting actress win from the New York Film Critics Circle and Critics' Choice Awards nominations for Girls Trip. Yet, those precursor honors didn't translate into any Globes nods.\n\nGolden Globes 2018 biggest snubs: 'Wonder Woman,' Tiffany Haddish, 'The Big Sick'\n\nMore Tiffany Haddish: 10 of our favorite breakout stars of 2017\n\nPinkett pointed to Hollywood's long history of excluding women and people of color from its highest echelons, explaining that Haddish's snub goes beyond just \"racism.\"\n\n\"And I dare not invalidate all the many journalists and people from all walks of life who have supported this movie by defining the issue as simply... racism,\" she wrote, naming The Big Sick and Get Out as two other films starring people of color that were largely ignored at the Globes nominations. \"Hollywood has systems in place that must learn to expand its concepts of race, gender equality and inclusion in regard to its perceptions of art across the board.\"\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4bf7e251c301fe2529e3f20b305ea36dd33f25f2/c=0-0-4999-2824/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636370979299515691-AFP-AFP-QL132-92358531.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5676274488001_5676239679001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4bf7e251c301fe2529e3f20b305ea36dd33f25f2/c=0-0-4999-2824/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636370979299515691-AFP-AFP-QL132-92358531.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maeve Mcdermott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/12/13/golden-globes-held-screen-jada-pinkett-smith-blasts-golden-globes-snubbing-tiffany-haddish-girls-tri/947496001/", "title": "Golden Globes screened 'Girls Trip' in July, but Tiffany Haddish snub backlash continues", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/12/13/golden-globes-held-screen-jada-pinkett-smith-blasts-golden-globes-snubbing-tiffany-haddish-girls-tri/947496001/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Golden Globes screened 'Girls Trip' in July, but Tiffany Haddish snub backlash continues", "description": "Neither Haddish nor 'Girls Trip' were nominated for any Golden Globes this week.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4bf7e251c301fe2529e3f20b305ea36dd33f25f2/c=0-0-4999-2824/local/-/media/2017/07/31/USATODAY/USATODAY/636370979299515691-AFP-AFP-QL132-92358531.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Neither Haddish nor 'Girls Trip' were nominated for any Golden Globes this week.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513123200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
