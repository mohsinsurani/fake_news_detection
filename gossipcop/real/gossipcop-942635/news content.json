Following the news of Anthony Bourdain\u2019s death on Friday, June 8, his ex-girlfriend Paula Froelich spoke out.\n\nThe 44-year-old journalist \u2014 who dated Bourdain for several months in early 2005 according to Yahoo \u2014 took to Twitter to share her thoughts in a series of emotional tweets.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing about depression: it\u2019s a sneaky little, sticky B\u2014tch. You can be rich as hell, totally successful but still lonely AF and the \u2018you\u2019re nothing but a fraud\u2019 voice only goes away when the ambien takes effect,\u201d she wrote followed by a lengthy discussion regarding the medication and mental illness.\n\nShe concluded: \u201cBut take heart in knowing: only the best, funniest, loveliest, most empathetic, wonderful, talented people have depression. You\u2019re in a good crowd. Now. Let\u2019s go fight that black dog. Together.\u201d\n\nFroelich also posted a photo to Instagram reflecting on her former boyfriend\u2019s life and shared a sweet memory of the two.\n\n\u201cTo a good man, a great friend, a loyal love,\u201d she captioned a picture of herself with Bourdain smiling. \u201cThat\u2019s all I\u2019m going to say.\u201d\n\nThe posts came just hours after news broke that the Parts Unknown host was found dead from an apparent suicide at age 61. CNN reported during a broadcast Friday morning that he hanged himself.\n\nFroelich isn\u2019t the only one close to the TV personality who quickly took to social media to share their sadness. Bourdain\u2019s girlfriend, Asia Argento, also expressed her feelings in an emotional message on Twitter.\n\n\u201cAnthony gave all of himself in everything that he did. His brilliant, fearless spirit touched and inspires so many, and his generosity knew no bounds,\u201d the 42-year-old director wrote. \u201cHe was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated. My thoughts are with his family. I would ask that you respect their privacy and mine.\u201d\n\nChef Eric Ripert \u2014 who worked closely with Bourdain \u2014 also paid tribute to his close pal.\n\n\u201cAnthony was a dear friend. He was an exceptional human being, so inspiring and generous,\u201d he told Us Weekly in a statement Friday afternoon. \u201cOne of the greatest storytellers of our time who connected with so many. I wish him peace. My love and prayers are with his family, friends and loved ones.\u201d\n\nCNN released a heartfelt statement following the news.\n\n\u201cIt is with extraordinary sadness we can confirm the death of our friend and colleague, Anthony Bourdain,\u201d the network said. \u201cHis love of great adventure, new friends, fine food and drink and the remarkable stories of the world made him a unique storyteller. His talents never ceased to amaze us and we will miss him very much. Our thoughts and prayers are with his daughter and family at this incredibly difficult time.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paula-Froelich-bourdain.jpg?crop=0px%2C64px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paula-Froelich-bourdain.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paula-Froelich-bourdain.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anthony-bourdains-ex-paula-froelich-calls-him-a-loyal-love-after-his-death/", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's Ex Paula Froelich Calls Him a 'Loyal Love' After His Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Anthony Bourdain's ex-girlfriend Paula Froelich penned an emotional message about depression on Friday, June 8, after news of his death \u2014 see what she said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's Ex Calls Him a 'Loyal Love' in Heartfelt Post", "description": "Anthony Bourdain's ex-girlfriend Paula Froelich penned an emotional message about depression on Friday, June 8, after news of his death \u2014 see what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/anthony-bourdains-ex-paula-froelich-calls-him-a-loyal-love-after-his-death/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-08T18:36:02+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paula-Froelich-bourdain.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paula-Froelich-bourdain.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-08T18:09:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-08T18:36:02+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's Ex Calls Him a 'Loyal Love' in Heartfelt Post", "description": "Anthony Bourdain's ex-girlfriend Paula Froelich penned an emotional message about depression on Friday, June 8, after news of his death \u2014 see what she said", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Paula-Froelich-bourdain.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528481342.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
