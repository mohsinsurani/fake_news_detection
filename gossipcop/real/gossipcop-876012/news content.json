These two also teamed up for another very special project a couple months back.\n\nWell, kind of.\n\nThe Rock and dog-JLo are pretty cute together, but we gotta say, the real deal is hard to beat.\n\nWith his sweaty sheen and her gorgeous glow, these two are the ultimate #workoutgoals. Now if only we could keep up! Guess it\u2019s all about that #erryday grind, just like JLo says.
