You can see the device they put in my heart 2 years ago\u2026 on my X-ray that I got today! God is so good!!\u201d Zolciak-Biermann wrote in the caption of the photo, which she labelled \u201cMy chest X-ray and you can see the device in my heart! Crazy!!\u201d\n\nZolciak-Biermann had a stroke caused by a blood clot on Sept. 23, 2015, after flying from Los Angeles back home to Atlanta from Dancing with the Stars filming.\n\n\u201cI bent down to hug my son KJ and all of a sudden my left hand went numb,\u201d Zolciak-Biermann told PEOPLE in November of that year. \u201cIt was like a million ants were crawling over my body.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?
