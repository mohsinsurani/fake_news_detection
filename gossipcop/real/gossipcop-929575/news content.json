Levine even balanced a life-sized cardboard cutout of Corden on his chin, which led to an obvious joke or two.\n\nLater, at the track, the fellas traded in Corden\u2019s white Range Rover for a Porsche SUV. Somehow, Corden set the best race time of the day. We didn\u2019t see that coming.\n\nWatch the video above.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-Break-with-Michelle-Wolf-1.jpg",
