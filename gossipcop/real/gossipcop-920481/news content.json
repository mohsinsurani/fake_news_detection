She has such an incredible soul,' Zayn shared in a note posted earlier today.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

We wish this news would have come from us first. We love you all.'\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

I'm forever grateful for the love, time and life lessons Z and I shared. I want nothing but the best for him and will continue to support him as a friend that I have immense respect and love for. As for the future, whatever's meant to be will always be. x G.'\n\nFollowing a break-up, no one wants to see photos of their ex or family popping up on their Instagram feed, so it's understandable why the 'Pillowtalk' singer would want to remove the chance of that happening all together.\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

'He's from the same background that I'm from, him and I get along great and he's like a son to me. It's all good.\n\n'He has no family here and he's so far away so I understand that life because I lived that life. I think that I'm just a momma to him.'\n\nAll our support goes to Gigi and Zayn during this difficult time.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/640x320/landscape-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/640x319/gallery-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg?resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/09/1600x800/landscape-1519818876-zayn.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/1600x800/1521017572-gettyimages-815124310-1520969379.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/640x320/landscape-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie O'Malley", "Deputy Digital Editor", "Katie O Malley Is The Deputy Digital Editor", "At Elle Uk."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a42311/zayn-malik-unfollows-gigi-yolanda-hadid-instagram-break-up/", "title": "Zayn Malik Unfollows Gigi And Yolanda Hadid On Instagram After Break-Up", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Zayn Malik Unfollows Gigi And Yolanda Hadid On Instagram After Break-Up", "description": "The pair have split after two years of dating", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a42311/zayn-malik-unfollows-gigi-yolanda-hadid-instagram-break-up/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/640x320/landscape-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-26T17:43:28Z", "published_time": "2018-03-14T09:54:00Z", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/640x320/landscape-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Zayn Malik Unfollows Gigi And Yolanda Hadid On Instagram After Break-Up", "description": "The signer and model have called time on their relationship, with Malik unfollowing Gigi and her mother on Instagram.", "keywords": "Zayn Malik, Gigi Hadid, Yolanda Hadid, Break-Up, Instagram, split, two year relationship", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/320x320/square-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg?resize=320:*", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,Yolanda Hadid,Zayn Malik,Gigi Hadid", "sailthru.date": "2018-03-14T09:54:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/640x320/landscape-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/11/320x320/square-1521019768-screen-shot-2018-03-14-at-092850.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Zayn Malik Unfollows Gigi And Yolanda Hadid On Instagram After Break-Up", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521021240.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
