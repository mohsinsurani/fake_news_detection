Rowling\u2019s \u2018Fantastic Beasts: The Crimes of Grindelwald,\u2019 which will be released in theaters in November this year.\u201d\n\nDepp initially sued The Management Group in January 2017, accusing his former managers of \u201cself-dealing and gross misconduct.\u201d Among the misdeeds that Depp, who sought $25 million, alleged: Taking a 5 percent commission of the actor\u2019s income, \u201cin some cases regardless of whether Mr. Depp actually received any income himself or not\u201d \u2014 a commission that was \u201cexorbitant, excessive, and far outstripped the actual value of services TMG would be performing for Mr. Depp.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Johnny Depp Sued by Ex-Bodyguards Who Say They Were 'Forced to Protect' Actor 'From Himself and His Vices'\n\nThe management company subsequently filed a cross-complaint, accusing Depp of living \u201can ultra-extravagant lifestyle\u201d that he \u201csimply could not afford.\u201d\n\n\u201c[T]hroughout the entire 17-year period that TMG represented Depp, Depp lived an ultra-extravagant lifestyle that knowingly cost Depp in excess of $2 million per month to maintain, which he simply could not afford,\u201d the cross-complaint read.\n\nAmong the ill-considered extravagances alleged in the cross-complaint: Spending $75 million on 14 residences throughout the world; dropping more than $18 million to buy and renovate a 150-foot yacht; and spending $30,000 a month on \u201cexpensive wine that [Depp] had flown to him around the world for his personal consumption.\u201d", "images":
