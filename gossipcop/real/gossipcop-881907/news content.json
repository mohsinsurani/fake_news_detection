Brian is the son of George Green, a country musician. After attending high school in North Hollywood, Brian Green studied at the Hamilton High School Academy of Music.

He spent three years on the show until 1989, and during this period he also found time to appear on shows like Good Morning, Miss Bliss.\n\nIn 1990, Green's breakthrough came with a leading role in Beverly Hills 90210.

In 2016, the couple proved that their relationship still had tons of twists and turns left, and they got back together. In 2020, they announced their separation once again. Over the course of their relationship, they have had three children together.\n\nReal Estate\n\nIn 2009, Fox and Green bought a home in the Los Feliz neighborhood of Los Angeles for $2.95 million.

In 2018, Megan sued Cynthia for $5 million, alleging the seller failed to disclose a serious mold problem in the house.", "images": ["https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Brian-Austin-Green.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/thumb-900x/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Brian-Austin-Green-1.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/03/Brian-Austin-Green.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/actors/brian-austin-green-net-worth/", "title": "Brian Austin Green Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Brian Austin Green Net Worth and Salary: Brian Austin Green is an American actor who has a net worth of $8 million.
