The pair officially became co-anchors of the Today show earlier this month when Kotb replaced Matt Lauer after the longtime anchor was fired late last year.\n\nIt marks the first time in the morning show\u2019s history that there have been two female anchors.\n\n\u201cSavannah and I started anchoring together, and it was just weird,\u201d Kotb recalled on Wednesday\u2019s Tonight Show. \u201cIt was like if you\u2019ve ever met a friend and had, like, a great moment where you say to yourself, \u2018Wow, that was so much fun. It worked.\u2019 I think we had an instant thing\u201d\n\nGuthrie agreed, joking, \u201cHoda said it was like a first date, and I was like, \u2018and I\u2019m easy and desperate,\u2019 so no problem! It just clicked, and it felt so good. And we\u2019re so happy.\u201d\n\nSee photos of Hoda Kotb and Savannah Guthrie together:\n\n\n\nThe duo also touched on Lauer\u2019s sudden exit after 20 years on the show. Kotb admitted, \u201cIt was a difficult time for the show, no question.\u201d\n\n\u201cYeah, it was hard, and like everyone saw, we went through it,\u201d Guthrie added. \u201cBut something really lovely and positive has happened. And I think that\u2019s where we\u2019re focused.\u201d\n\nAnd now the ladies are teaming up for the Winter Olympics in China next month. Kotb, who recently had a life-changing moment herself thanks to her new position, remarked on how special the event can be.\n\n\u201cThe thing about the Olympics is there\u2019s no other place on earth where you can sit there and watch a kid you\u2019ve never heard of before and in that instant you get to watch their life change,\u201d she said.\n\nSee photos of Savannah Guthrie and Matt Lauer
