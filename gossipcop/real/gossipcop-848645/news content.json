The trip down memory lane, all told in flashbacks, comes at a time when things between Klaus and Marcel are at an impasse, for lack of a better term.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like any relationship,\u201d actor Charles Michael Davis tells The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWith brothers growing up, you can\u2019t really get away from each other so you got to fight your issues out or you got to talk about it. They\u2019re not the best at communicating. They\u2019re just going to have to have it out.
