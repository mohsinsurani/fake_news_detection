Manigault Newman played the recording on MSNBC to bolster her contention that Trump\u2019s loyal daughter-in-law tried to buy her silence after she was fired from the White House staff.\n\nOn the recording, Lara Trump, a senior member of the president\u2019s 2020 campaign, can be heard offering Manigault Newman a $15,000-a-month contract to work in his re-election campaign.\n\nLara Trump also discussed salary considerations and a job that didn\u2019t sound as though it had any clear responsibilities.\n\nMost questionably, Lara Trump also addressed the likelihood that Manigault Newman would have \u201csome things in the back pocket to pull out,\u201d before telling her she would be expected to only say positive things about the president, his campaign and perhaps his family.\n\n\u201cEverything, everybody, positive, right?\u201d Lara Trump asks.\n\nThe release of the recording sent Lara Trump\u2019s name into the top 10 Twitter trending topics. People made jokes: \u201cThat money is meant for silencing porn stars.\u201d But they also raised concerns about whether the Trump campaign was using donations raised from \u201cworking class\u201d supporters to fund hush money payments to disgruntled former employees.\n\nFor probably the first time as a Trump loyalist and family member, the 35-year-old former \u201cInside Edition\u201d producer and mother of one found herself in the middle of a white-hot controversy.\n\nIn a written statement to the Washington Post, she declared the recording \u201ca fraud\u201d and claimed that the snippets that were aired \u201ctook place in numerous phone calls over the course of several weeks.\u201d\n\nLara Trump also said she had felt betrayed by the former \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d villain. She referred to their time campaigning together for Trump in 2016 and said she had come to regard Manigault Newman as \u201ca friend and a campaign sister.\u201d Lara Trump concluded, \u201cI am absolutely shocked and saddened by her betrayal and violation on a deeply personal level.\u201d\n\nHaving to issue this kind of public defense probably is unfamiliar territory for Lara Trump, even though she is regarded by some as \u201cthe face\u201d of the Trump 2020 campaign. She has put herself out there as one of Trump\u2019s most reliable advocates, making regular appearances on Fox News or at rallies to tout his agenda.\n\nHer name also is affixed to a steady stream of emails that go out to supporters, in which she often solicits for donations in small amounts \u2014 $1, $5, $10 or $20.\n\nFor example, in a July 24 email, Lara Trump offered a \u201ctop patriot\u201d the chance to win a backstage VIP pass to the president\u2019s upcoming rally. All this \u201cpatriot\u201d needed to do was make one of those small money donations to have their name entered to win.\n\n\u201cMy father-in-law has tuned out the mainstream media,\u201d Lara Trump said in her email. \u201cHe cares more about knowing he has support from patriots like you.\u201d\n\nEven with all this fierce advocacy, Lara Trump has mostly remained above the political fray. She doesn\u2019t engage in belligerent Twitter fights like her brother-in-law Donald Trump Jr.. And, unlike sister-in-law Ivanka Trump, she hasn\u2019t been the subject of backlash over clumsy efforts to weigh in on issues like racism, women\u2019s rights, migrant children or the LGBTQ community.\n\nIn fact, Lara Trump doesn\u2019t often get clumsy on social media \u2014 unlike her in-laws. Her Instagram is mostly filled with what Slate called \u201cbland\u201d photos of Eric Trump, their nearly 1-year-old son Luke, their two beagles, or of her working out, showing off her slender, 5-foot-11 frame doing hardcore gym workouts.\n\nOn her Instagram and Twitter feed, she also shares political photo-ops, promos for her Fox News appearances and retweets from like-minded politicos, urging support of particular candidates or Republican causes. With regard to her political posts, she\u2019s sticks to a core message, according to Slate: \u201cThe truth is, we all know what Lara Trump\u2019s special thing is: It\u2019s that she supports her father-in-law, the president.\u201d\n\nIn April, E! News called Lara and Eric Trump the \u201cmost normal, least controversial Trump couple.\u201d Most stories that focus on Lara Trump quote her as offering pleasant accounts about how she and Eric Trump met about a decade ago. Lara Trump told \u201cFox & Friends\u201d that she and her future husband were out with friends and bonded over the fact that they were \u201c\u201dprobably the two tallest people in the room,\u201d according to E! News.\n\n\u201cI think we spotted each other across the room,\u201d Lara Trump said about Eric, who is 6-foot-5 inches and therefore towers over his siblings. \u201cI was immediately intrigued and hopefully Eric felt the same way. It took us about three months to go on a date.\u201d\n\nThey married in 2014 in grand Trump fashion \u2014 at Mar-a-Lago. As soon as her father-in-law announced his presidential aspirations, Lara Trump jumped in to help out. After the election, she joined the Trump re-election efforts with her advocacy continuing even after she gave birth to her son last September.\n\nDuring the 2016 election, Lara Trump spoke at rally in her home state of North Carolina, where she shared her excitement with voters about being part of her father-in-law\u2019s political movement.\n\n\u201cI never expected, when I moved nine years ago to New York City, that this would ever happen to me,\u201d said Lara Trump who, according to the Port City Daily, originally moved to New York City to attend culinary school. \u201c(Being a part of this campaign) is the greatest thing I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life. It\u2019s incredible.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/larat.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/themes/wp-mason/static/images/site-logo/banglogo_small.png", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/mn-logo.svg", "https://i1.wp.com/www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/AFP_18D19P.jpg?fit=620%2C9999px&ssl=1", "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/plugins/dfm-trust-indicators/static/images/Trust-Logo-Horizontal.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mercurynews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/larat.jpg?w=1024&h=683", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Martha Ross", "Features Writer", "Martha Ross Is A Features Writer Who Covers Everything", "Anything Related To Popular Culture", "Society", "Health", "Women S Issues", "Families.
