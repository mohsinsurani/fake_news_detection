The video sparked immediate backlash online, and Paul removed the video from his channel and posted two apologies in the days that followed. On January 3rd, he tweeted \u201ctaking time to reflect no vlog for now see you soon,\u201d and hasn\u2019t been heard from since \u2014 until now.\n\n\u201cI know I\u2019ve made mistakes,\u201d says Paul in his newest vlog, as mournful piano music plays behind him. \u201cI know I\u2019ve let people down.\u201d Paul says he has spent the last three weeks trying to address his ignorance about the issue of suicide and wants to share what he has learned in hopes of making a difference. The video opens with a first-person account of a suicide attempt from Kevin Hines, a man who jumped off the Golden Gate Bridge, and it features a conversation between Paul and Dr. John Draper, the director of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline. Paul also plans to donate $1 million to suicide prevention organizations.\n\nAlthough Logan has been silent on the subject until today, Jake Paul \u2014 Logan\u2019s brother and another popular influencer \u2014 addressed the controversy briefly in a video posted January 22nd. \u201cIt didn\u2019t feel right to comment on it right away,\u201d Jake says. \u201cI think what Logan did was very, very, very wrong, and he made a huge mistake,\u201d Jake says. \u201cNot only is he paying for it, but he is learning from it. I think in no way shape or form is suicide a joke or should be made fun of ... He did not mean to offend anyone.\u201d Regardless of intent, Logan\u2019s actions still had consequences. In response to negative feedback from the community, YouTube condemned Paul\u2019s video and removed the vlogger as a preferred ad partner. Paul\u2019s YouTube Red projects were also shelved.", "images": ["https://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F5FxvQemf1fO5eOpxDvRKlbUif6A%3D%2F0x0%3A3000x1997%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal(1500x999%3A1501x1000)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F10084117%2F686714226.jpg.jpg&w=2400&q=75", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F2bBhonDKKcnDQCBQaLw-ONkrEL8%3D%2F0x0%3A4898x3265%2F100x100%2Ffilters%3Afocal(2449x1633%3A2450x1634)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F22263408%2Fgamestop_stock_hero.jpg&w=2400&q=75", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d5NMXTPe1ld1GxsSEeFDZDcWiU4=/0x0:3000x1997/1200x628/filters:focal(1500x999:1501x1000)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10084117/686714226.jpg.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d5NMXTPe1ld1GxsSEeFDZDcWiU4=/0x0:3000x1997/1200x628/filters:focal(1500x999:1501x1000)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10084117/686714226.jpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Farokhmanesh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy", "title": "Logan Paul returns to vlogging after \u2018suicide forest\u2019 controversy", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@verge"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "og": {"site_name": "The Verge", "title": "Logan Paul returns to vlogging after \u2018suicide forest\u2019 controversy", "description": "\u2018It\u2019s time to start a new chapter in my life\u2019", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d5NMXTPe1ld1GxsSEeFDZDcWiU4=/0x0:3000x1997/1200x628/filters:focal(1500x999:1501x1000)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10084117/686714226.jpg.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large", "description": "After a long silence on social media, Logan Paul is finally addressing the backlash to a controversial video in which he filmed a the corpse of a suicide victim in Japan\u2019s Aokigahara forest.", "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-24T19:05:54.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-24T19:05:54.000Z"}, "author": "Megan Farokhmanesh", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Logan Paul returns to vlogging after \u2018suicide forest\u2019 controversy", "parsely-link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/1/24/16924168/logan-paul-returns-youtube-suicide-controversy", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/d5NMXTPe1ld1GxsSEeFDZDcWiU4=/0x0:3000x1997/1200x628/filters:focal(1500x999:1501x1000)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10084117/686714226.jpg.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-01-24T19:05:54.000Z", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-tags": "verge,front-page,culture,web,tech,youtube", "parsely-author": "Megan Farokhmanesh", "next-head-count": 31}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516752000.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
