He looks at me. I say, \u2018It\u2019s Jennifer.\u2019 He says, \u2018You look so beautiful.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe and I are sitting on a stone patio at Lopez\u2019s new house in Bel Air, overlooking an infinity pool and a lush green lawn with a double-size swing, which she points out is perfect for her nine-year-old twins, Emme and Max. The house is light-filled, sprawling, and warm, with wood-beamed ceilings, stone walls, plush low-slung sofas, big pillows, bowls filled with cut roses, and artwork by collagist Peter Tunney. \u201cGRATTITUD\u018e,\u201d one piece spells out. It\u2019s a portmanteau of \u201cgratitude\u201d and \u201cattitude\u201d that could define Lopez. Wearing a cropped turtleneck sweater, skinny jeans, high Christian Louboutin boots, and impressive diamond earrings, she is as startlingly beautiful at 48 as she was at 28\u2014if not more so. \u201cWe walked into this house, and I said, \u2018This is where I want my kids to grow up,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cYou have to imagine your life, and what you want to be in it, and I imagined we would be very happy here no matter what.\u201d\n\nHappy, naturally, has turned out differently from what she imagined. Just hours after Rodriguez met her in Beverly Hills, he called her, and they agreed to have dinner a few nights later. She told him that she remembered meeting him on a baseball diamond, 12 years earlier. Her then husband, Marc Anthony, had thrown out the first pitch of a New York Mets game, but the cameras captured Lopez and Rodriguez shaking hands and locking eyes. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to say you remember if you don\u2019t,\u201d she told him. \u201cShea Stadium, during a subway series,\u201d he responded.\n\nJust then, Rodriguez walks out of the house to join us on the patio. \u201cI was telling her about the tap,\u201d she says to him. \u201cBut there were two taps,\u201d he says. She turns to me. \u201cThere was another very significant tap on the shoulder,\u201d she says.\n\nBefore we get to that tap, we talk about their first date, when they met for dinner at the Hotel Bel Air. \u201cHe was sitting there in his white shirt, very confident and manly, but then he was just so talkative!\u201d she says. \u201cI think he thought I was going to be this loud person, but I\u2019m not. I just listen. So he\u2019s talking, talking about his plans, about how he had just retired from baseball, about how he saw himself getting married again, all these things you wouldn\u2019t normally talk about on a first date. I don\u2019t know if he thought it was a date. I thought it was a date. Then I knew he was nervous because he asked me if I wanted a drink. I said, \u2018No, I don\u2019t drink,\u2019 and he asked if I minded if he had one. He was nervous, and it was really cute.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t know if it was a date,\u201d Rodriguez says. \u201cMaybe we were seeing each other at night because of her work schedule. I went in uneasy, not knowing her situation.\u201d\n\nHe continues: \u201cIt would be incredibly productive for me to sit with one of the smartest, greatest women in the world, especially for a guy like me who is coming through tough times, rehabbing himself, re-establishing himself to folks out there. I thought it would be a win-win no matter what.\u201d\n\nThen: \u201cShe told me around the third or fourth inning that she was single,\u201d he says. \u201cI had to get up and go re-adjust my thoughts. I went to the bathroom and got enough courage to send her a text.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo I\u2019m sitting there and he\u2019s walking back, and I get a text,\u201d Lopez continues. \u201cIt says . . . \u201d She looks significantly at Rodriguez. \u201cYou can tell her!\u201d he says. \u201c \u2018You look sexy AF,\u2019 \u201d she tells me. They both laugh. \u201cAnd then it took a turn,\u201d Lopez says. \u201cThe fire alarm went off, and we had to evacuate.\u201d I laugh, thinking she\u2019s being metaphorical. \u201cNo, really,\u201d she says. \u201cThe fire alarm went off!\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639525b7a40d71fd1638/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6164754905b659f20bfc0b89/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6222a9bb8e2d9f0117a4967f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5847108b9dee4a361369e3fe/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Bethany_McLean.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f363955ba52f25246815cd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/618c0614fdf674f0522a9fb7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e5225b7a40d71fd1688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639540dfcc68ac21c0d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f36396ddf784604d17e8eb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62b3340bfa5c67611b2c46ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f3639616ff751cf425ef2c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jlo-arod-cover-1217-ss05.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59f73e545ba52f252468160b/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-jlo-arod-cover-1217.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Bethany Mclean", "Mario Testino", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/10/jennifer-lopez-alex-rodriguez-cover-story", "title": "J-Rod!
