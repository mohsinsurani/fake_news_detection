One of the first people celebrating the \u2018Power\u2019 star\u2019s special day was her estranged husband, Carmelo Anthony. Melo called her \u2018beautiful\u2019 and despite the split, she was still his everything.\n\nCarmelo Anthony, 33, and La La Anthony may have split, but that wasn\u2019t going to stop the New York Knicks star from celebrating La La\u2019s 38th birthday on June 26. Right after the clock turned 12:00 AM ET, Melo hit up Instagram to be one of the first to wish his estranged wife (and mother of his son) a happy day. Melo posted a picture of La La looking gorgeous, writing \u2018HAPPY BDAY\u2019 on the pic. Yet, it was the post\u2019s caption that contained his truly heartfelt message. \u201cI look at you on this birthday and it is hard to believe another year has passed. You are as beautiful now as ever before!!!\u201d Melo wrote.\n\n\u201cSending birthday wishes to MY EARTH. \u201cLove You. #AVeryPOWERFULDay.\u201d How incredibly sweet! Hopefully La La sees it when she wakes up. The Think Like A Man actress was one of the presenters at the 2017 BET Awards in Los Angeles, meaning she\u2019s a few hours behind Melo (assuming he\u2019s still in New York City.) It\u2019s messages like this that give fans hope that these two will work things out and ultimately reconcile.\n\nMelo and La La separated in April 2017, following seven years of marriage. Since breaking up, the two have reunited at least once, as they were spotted spending Mother\u2019s Day at Neta, a sushi restaurant in New York City. Despite this celebratory dinner, a source told Page Six that Melo and La La were not back together. Still, fans shouldn\u2019t give up hope, as the source says that they were still \u201ctrying to figure things out\u201d and this split could go either way. While Melo\u2019s B-day message might convince her at giving him a second chance, La La might just decide to take up Chris Rock\u2019s offer of a date.\n\nWhile La La is not pushing for a speedy divorce from Melo, a source close to The Power Playbook author EXCLUSIVELY told HollywoodLife.com that Kim Kardashian, 36, set her up with Laura Wasser, 49, a divorce lawyer that has worked with such A-listers as Angelina Jolie, 41, Johnny Depp, 53, and Kim herself. Laura annulled Kim\u2019s marriage with Kris Humphries, 32, so if and when La La does feel like she\u2019s ready to pull the plug on her marriage, she has the right professional to help her out.\n\nDo you want to see Melo and La La get back together, HollywoodLifers?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kirk-frosts-side-chick-jasmine-washington-drops-scathing-rasheeda-diss-track-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/carmelo-anthony-gushes-over-lala-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/carmelo-anthony-gushes-over-lala-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/khloe-lamar-never-take-her-back-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-sweet-tweets-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/efcdfea9db6d2663af1d2c3f29228bfc?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F06%2F26%2Fcarmelo-anthony-sends-love-la-la-birthday-message%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2658985", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/carmelo-anthony-gushes-over-lala-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Brow", "Sports Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170629152435/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/06/26/carmelo-anthony-sends-love-la-la-birthday-message/", "title": "Carmelo Anthony Gushes Over \u2018Beautiful\u2019 Ex La La On Her Birthday In Sweet Instagram", "meta_data": {"description": "Happy Birthday, La La Anthony!
