The actor via his character, Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., PhD, denied saying he was a \u201cwar vet\u201d to gain access to the former Republican vice presidential candidate, and Showtime is backing Cohen up, pointing to Sunday\u2019s premiere episode as proof.\n\n\u201cThere has been widespread misinformation over the past week about the character of Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Ph.D., performed by Sacha Baron Cohen on the SHOWTIME comedy series WHO IS AMERICA?\u201d the statement begins. \u201cBaron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere on Sunday can now attest to that. In Sunday\u2019s episode, during an interview with Senator Bernie Sanders, Baron Cohen in character as Dr. Ruddick was asked by the Senator if he is disabled, and he stated that he is not and uses a mobility scooter to conserve his energy.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s true \u2014 Sanders blatantly asked Cohen, who was in disguise, if he has \u201ca disability.\u201d Cohen replied, \u201cNo I don\u2019t. This here scooter is to conserve my body\u2019s finite energy.\u201d\n\nShowtime\u2019s statement continues, \u201cIn addition, Baron Cohen never presented himself as a veteran of the U.S. military to former Alaska Governor Sarah Palin during the booking process or during the filming of her interview, and contrary to her claims he did not appear in a wheelchair. In both the interview with Governor Palin and the interview with Senator Sanders, he did not wear military apparel of any kind.\u201d\n\nSacha Baron Cohen interviews Bernie Sanders in character as Dr. Ruddick. (Photo: Organized Speech via YouTube)\n\nPalin was so heated over her exchange with Cohen that she went on Good Morning America to bash the actor\u2019s ruse.\n\n\u201cIt was proposed to me as a legitimate interview to speak about veterans issues and our military and current events to a new audience. It was supposed to be this big-time Showtime documentary, and it was passed on to me by a speakers\u2019 bureau, which, you know, I would assume had done some vetting,\u201d she told Robin Roberts. \u201cThis \u2018comedian\u2019 is obviously very good at lying, at duping people.\u201d\n\nStory continues\n\nThe former Alaska governor said she knew something wasn\u2019t right when Cohen, posed as Dr. Ruddick, claimed Chelsea Clinton was the recipient of a government-funded sex change.\n\n\u201cIt just got worse and worse and worse as the minutes went on in this bizarre, um, really embarrassing, humiliating interview that mocked middle-class Americans. It mocked our values. It mocked the disabled. It just got worse and worse,\u201d she said.\n\nWhen informed that Cohen denied posing as a war vet, she called him a \u201cproven liar,\u201d adding, \u201cnobody can believe a word he\u2019s saying now as to his rebuttal.\u201d\n\nPalin wasn\u2019t the only political figure peeved about the whole thing. Disgraced senatorial candidate Roy Moore is threatening legal action if his segment airs.\n\nIt remains to be seen if Cohen\u2019s Who Is America? is a ratings hit, but we\u2019re sure Palin\u2019s free publicity didn\u2019t hurt.\n\n\n\n\n\nRead more from Yahoo Entertainment:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_w_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/WUACFOI_NYZVmJN6t._U9g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTUxNw--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/47ttWKK4a81LVjQ8YQFzdA--~B/aD03NTY7dz0xNDA0O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ab3fcdb84f6035f3ad8ad6b2b2e5728b", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/7JOOHnw2N_SFubWRzMV56A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTM0MjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-12/d7f38f00-340b-11eb-b7bf-540525a865da", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dT.Tk_GfYF1fv2fYeCt1.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ab3fcdb84f6035f3ad8ad6b2b2e5728b", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/QYv2d1jDDB2z1DZ0urUo0g--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTgwO2g9ODA-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2019-09/222e35f0-de29-11e9-bdbf-dab7faeea558", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/LZI9iMlBq2uVvRUNZZOzxA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTYxMQ--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/pROKKKuReRdjWmORMWZjwg--~B/aD0xMDI0O3c9MTYwOTthcHBpZD15dGFjaHlvbg--/http://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/f90da4e3977a8c203212f62f40ee0f63", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197800334&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fentertainment%2Fshowtime-fires-back-sarah-palins-claim-sacha-baron-cohen-posed-veteran-america-interview-223821192.html&c14=-1"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dT.Tk_GfYF1fv2fYeCt1.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ab3fcdb84f6035f3ad8ad6b2b2e5728b", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/showtime-fires-back-sarah-palins-claim-sacha-baron-cohen-posed-veteran-america-interview-223821192.html", "title": "Showtime fires back at Sarah Palin's claim that Sacha Baron Cohen posed as a veteran for 'Who Is America?' interview", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Sacha Baron Cohen, Sarah Palin, Showtime, Baron Cohen, Billy Wayne Ruddick Jr., Bernie Sanders, disabled\u00a0veteran", "twitter": {"title": "Showtime fires back at Sarah Palin's claim that Sacha Baron Cohen posed as a veteran for 'Who Is America?' interview", "description": "\"Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled\u00a0veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0can now attest to that,\u201d Showtime said.", "site": "@Yahoo", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dT.Tk_GfYF1fv2fYeCt1.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ab3fcdb84f6035f3ad8ad6b2b2e5728b", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dT.Tk_GfYF1fv2fYeCt1.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ab3fcdb84f6035f3ad8ad6b2b2e5728b"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"title": "Showtime fires back at Sarah Palin's claim that Sacha Baron Cohen posed as a veteran for 'Who Is America?' interview", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/showtime-fires-back-sarah-palins-claim-sacha-baron-cohen-posed-veteran-america-interview-223821192.html", "description": "\"Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled\u00a0veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0can now attest to that,\u201d Showtime said.", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/dT.Tk_GfYF1fv2fYeCt1.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD02NDY-/https://media.zenfs.com/en/homerun/feed_manager_auto_publish_494/ab3fcdb84f6035f3ad8ad6b2b2e5728b", "width": 1200, "height": 646}}, "al": {"android": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=ce00cb66-a641-3833-8ca6-7a5951838b84&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo"}, "ios": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=ce00cb66-a641-3833-8ca6-7a5951838b84&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842}}, "description": "\"Baron Cohen did not present himself as a disabled\u00a0veteran, and viewers nationwide who watched the premiere\u00a0on Sunday\u00a0can now attest to that,\u201d Showtime said.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
