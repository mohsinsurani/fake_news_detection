Despite principal photography for the film having concluded in August, scenes featuring Spacey were reshot at short notice, in order for it to be completed in time for its scheduled US release date of 22 December. The reshoots are said to have cost around $10m, a significant addition to the film\u2019s original $40m budget.\n\nAll the Money in the World tells the true story of the kidnapping of Getty\u2019s grandson John Paul Getty III in 1973, and the billionaire\u2019s refusal to pay the ransom. The film stars Michelle Williams as Getty III\u2019s mother Gail Harris and Mark Wahlberg as Fletcher Chase, the former CIA operative who tried to persuade Getty Sr to co-operate with the kidnappers\u2019 demands. Both Wahlberg and Williams are thought to have been involved in the reshoots.\n\nIn an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Scott said that he made the decision to remove Spacey as soon as he first heard the allegations made against the actor. \u201cI sat and thought about it and realised, we cannot. You can\u2019t tolerate any kind of behaviour like that,\u201d the director said. \u201cAnd it will affect the film. We cannot let one person\u2019s action affect the good work of all these other people. It\u2019s that simple.\u201d\n\nPolice in London are believed to be investigating two claims of sexual assault made against Spacey, who has been accused of misconduct by a number of men. Earlier this week, the Old Vic theatre, which employed Spacey as its artistic director between the years 2004 and 2015, said it had been contacted by 56 people about Spacey, and received 20 allegations of inappropriate conduct. The theatre apologised \u201cwholeheartedly\u201d for failing to create an environment in which people could raise concerns about Spacey\u2019s behaviour. A statement released by Spacey\u2019s former spokeswoman said he was \u201ctaking the time necessary to seek evaluation and treatment\u201d.\n\nAll the Money in the World is not the only production to have cut ties with Spacey. Last month, Netflix said that it would not release a film in which the actor played Gore Vidal, and had also dropped him from the sixth and final season of its popular drama House of Cards.\n\nAll the Money in the World is scheduled for release in the UK on 5 January 2018.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf270d356e7f738134f741a87679ad25998ed4b5/0_24_2479_1487/master/2479.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=efb76e8f5d99e64b93b5620e7e93c460", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf270d356e7f738134f741a87679ad25998ed4b5/0_24_2479_1487/master/2479.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Christopher+Plummer%2CKevin+Spacey%2CCulture%2CFilm%2CRidley+Scott%2CSexual+harassment"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf270d356e7f738134f741a87679ad25998ed4b5/0_24_2479_1487/master/2479.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=efb76e8f5d99e64b93b5620e7e93c460", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gwilym Mumford"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer", "title": "Kevin Spacey replaced by Christopher Plummer in trailer for All the Money in the World", "meta_data": {"description": "The House of Cards actor was removed from Ridley Scott\u2019s crime drama last month after being accused of multiple acts of sexual misconduct", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf270d356e7f738134f741a87679ad25998ed4b5/0_24_2479_1487/master/2479.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=efb76e8f5d99e64b93b5620e7e93c460", "height": 720}, "title": "Kevin Spacey replaced by Christopher Plummer in trailer for All the Money in the World", "description": "The House of Cards actor was removed from Ridley Scott\u2019s crime drama last month after being accused of multiple acts of sexual misconduct", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwilym-mumford", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2017-11-29T16:50:49.000Z", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2017-11-29T16:49:04.000Z", "tag": "Christopher Plummer,Kevin Spacey,Culture,Film,Ridley Scott,Sexual harassment"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2017/nov/29/kevin-spacey-christopher-plummer-all-the-money-in-the-world-trailer?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cf270d356e7f738134f741a87679ad25998ed4b5/0_24_2479_1487/master/2479.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=1bd5af15d64bd982403c33e7d7bbf243", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0EQuVfP-vXs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1511913600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
