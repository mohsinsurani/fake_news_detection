Which is to say, it won\u2019t happen.\n\nPwC, the Academy\u2019s accounting firm through about 80 years and a few name changes, had a catastrophic failure last year \u2014 but with new people in charge, new procedures in place and everybody on high alert, it\u2019s inconceivable that we\u2019ll see a repeat of last year unless it\u2019s engineered by Kimmel and crew.\n\nAlso Read: Oscars Stage Manager Details PwC Accountants' Incompetence: 'They Froze' (Exclusive)\n\nAnd make no mistake \u2014 even if the Academy and PwC didn\u2019t do anything, they could still be almost certain that it wouldn\u2019t happen again. It took a perfect storm of ineptitude to produce last year\u2019s fiasco, starting with a money-saving envelope redesign that made the category name harder to read, particularly in the dark. The mistakes went on to include a pair of presenters in their \u201970s, one of them (Warren Beatty) known for fooling around and the other (Faye Dunaway) perpetually surrounded by a certain level of chaos; a spot at the end of the show, when the wings fill up with people and things get more disorganized; a distracted and star-struck accountant (Brian Cullinan) who had been violating the rules by tweeting from backstage during the show, and who was reluctant to acknowledge that he\u2019d given Beatty the wrong envelope and correct his error when it happened; and a second accountant (Martha Ruiz) equally reluctant to do her job, which was to immediately stop the show if an incorrect winner was announced.\n\nCullinan bears the brunt of the responsibility, but the damage would have been less if he had more legible envelopes, a less chaotic backstage environment, presenters who could have figured out the problem before announcing an incorrect winner, and a partner who reacted more quickly.\n\nPwC\u2019s first move after last year\u2019s show was to apologize profusely, and its second was to guarantee that neither Cullinan nor Ruiz would ever again work an Oscars show. (They both remain gainfully employed by the company.)\n\nThey also announced a few steps to prevent a recurrence last March, and then detailed additional steps to the AP in January.\n\nAlso Read: Academy Lets PwC Keep Its Job Despite Oscars Fiasco - But With Big Changes\n\nFor starters, the team that\u2019ll replace Cullinan and Ruiz crucially includes PwC partner Rick Rosas, who served as a balloting leader of the Oscar team for 14 years (the last of those paired with Cullinan) before he relinquished his post to Ruiz in 2015. While Cullinan was known to throw an Oscar party the night before the big show, Rosas would just as soon finish counting and go play golf \u2014 because on the golf course, he once told me, \u201cnobody is around to ask me anything.\u201d\n\n(He also admitted that he \u201cgets a perverse thrill\u201d out of looking at people\u2019s predictions on Oscar morning, when only he and his partners know all the winners.)\n\nRosas\u2019 partner in the wings of the stage will be Kimberly Bourdon, a partner in PwC\u2019s Banking and Capital Markets Industry Audit Practice who has been with the firm for more than 20 years. And a third balloting leader will be stationed in the control trailer behind the Dolby Theatre with the show\u2019s director and producer: Mark Lobel, a PwC principal in the company\u2019s cyber security and privacy practice, who has worked on the Oscars detail for more than five years.\n\nAll three will have the winners memorized \u2013 and Lobel in particular will be in position to immediately notify the production team if a mistake has occurred, something that didn\u2019t happen last year.\n\nPwC\u2019s chairman and senior partner, Tim Ryan, will also attend the show and oversee the process.\n\nAlso Read: See the Backstage Oscar Photo PwC Man Tweeted Just Before Handing Out Wrong Envelope (Photo)\n\nAnd while the new team members don\u2019t sound like star-struck types \u2014 I can vouch that Rosas isn\u2019t, and I suspect that the other two wouldn\u2019t have gotten the gig if they had any Cullinan-esque tendencies \u2014 they\u2019ll also be working under a new rule designed to eliminate distractions: no electronic devices backstage.\n\nAnother new rule says the team must attend rehearsals, which isn\u2019t unusual; once the counting is done, the PwC reps typically show up at Oscar rehearsals on Saturday to check with the production team about which presenters will be entering from stage left and which from stage right. (One accountant is stationed on each side of the stage with a complete set of envelopes, so a logistical rundown tells them who is going to be giving out the envelopes to whom.)\n\nThis year, though, their rehearsal duties will also include participating in a rehearsal of how they\u2019ll handle \u201cpossible onstage issues.\u201d\n\nDuring the show, another new rule says that when the PwC rep hands an envelope to a presenter, both the presenter and the stage manager stationed on that side of the stage must confirm that it is for the correct category. Dency Nelson, a longtime Oscar stage manager who retired five years ago, routinely did this \u2013 but now it\u2019s a hard-and-fast rule.\n\nTwo other factors are as yet unknown: Whether this year\u2019s envelopes will be more readable than last year\u2019s gold-on-red design, and who\u2019ll be presenting the Best Picture award.\n\nThe Academy did not respond to TheWrap\u2019s question about whether a new envelope design would be in place this year, and show producers Michael De Luca and Jennifer Todd are unlikely to spill the beans about the final presenters ahead of time.",
