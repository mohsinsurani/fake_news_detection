In a new interview with Esquire, LaBeouf admitted to letting the rapper shop through his closet. The actor claimed that West stopped by to talk business on possible art collaborations, and asked him if he could take a look through his wardrobe.\n\n\u201cAround the same time, I took my mother to his concert,\" LaBeouf reminisces. \"She is, of course, obsessed with Kanye West. When I brought her backstage, he was a fucking sweetheart to her. And it just felt fair. So I\u2019m like, \u2018Go for it, my guy. Take everything you want.\u2019 And he did. He took all my fucking clothes.\u201d Included in this acquisition was LeBeouf's hat that he wore in 2008's Indiana Jones and the Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. 'Ye was photographed in said hat at Disneyland.\n\nKanye named dropped the actor on The Life of Pablo track \"No More Parties in L.A.\", rapping, \u201cI wish I dressed as fresh as Shia LaBeouf.\u201d Despite these strong bromance vibes, LaBeouf and West haven't talked since the rapper's rant in 2016, in which he called out Lebeouf onstage, \"Shia LaBeouf: Kid Cudi feels a way. Call him.\" When asked if he's reached out to West, the actor remarks, \u201cOf course, bro. I fucking love Kanye West. He\u2019s going through a lot. And I don\u2019t know where he\u2019s at or what he\u2019s doing.\u201d Here's hoping that the rapper is hard at work on a new album.", "images": ["https://vman.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/res/public/youtube.svg", "https://vman.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/res/public/instagram.svg", "https://vman.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/res/public/twitter.svg", "https://vman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/07/300x600px.jpeg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=20773362&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vman.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/res/public/facebook.svg", "https://vman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-14-at-4.33.31-PM.png"], "top_img": "https://vman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-14-at-4.33.31-PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://vman.com/article/shia-labeouf-donated-his-clothes-to-kanye/", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Once Gave All His Clothes to Kanye West", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "google-site-verification": "SjfHn-gKXYNiWsxt47jus1sB0qrasWGaNVwIkC6olDQ", "facebook-domain-verification": "g8zmpi0yq9725yu7kdh4y579vz2ifs", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1565323762", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Once Gave All His Clothes to Kanye West | V Man", "keywords": "shia labeouf, kanye west", "og": {"image": "https://vman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-14-at-4.33.31-PM.png", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Shia LaBeouf Once Gave All His Clothes to Kanye West - Vman", "description": "\"He took all my fucking clothes.\"", "url": "https://vman.com/article/shia-labeouf-donated-his-clothes-to-kanye/", "site_name": "Vman"}, "twitter": {"image": "https://vman.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/Screen-Shot-2018-03-14-at-4.33.31-PM.png", "card": "summary", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://vman.com/wp-content/themes/vmagazine/res/public/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "article": {"modified_time": "2018-03-14T20:39:43+00:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://vman.com", "summary": ""}
