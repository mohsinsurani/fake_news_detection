She just squeezed in and I didn't want to humiliate her in front of all the paparazzi and be like 'get out of my car,' so I was like 'whatever.' \"\n\n11 years anniversary today since the first coming of The Holy Trinity! pic.twitter.com/dxGwTLnFDv \u2014 Paris Hilton (@ParisHilton) November 27, 2017\n\n\"We went back to my house and then Britney and I just went to sleep,\" she continued. \"And then, I don't know, Lindsay probably went to another party. There was no Uber back then so she probably called a cab.\"\n\nShe added, \"Back in the day we were friends, but she's just one of those people I don't really trust. I only like to be around positive energy and good people.\"\n\nFollowing several difficult years in the public eye, Lohan is returning to the spotlight with her \"Beach Club\" reality show on MTV, set in Mykonos, Greece, and centered around the VIP club she opened and hostesses.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/20/USAT/bcdc13df-87ba-4d6b-8e5c-8374081b74d8-albums_of_2018_1.png?crop=799,599,x0,y0?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/20/USAT/bcdc13df-87ba-4d6b-8e5c-8374081b74d8-albums_of_2018_1.png?auto=webp&crop=799,447,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/20/USAT/bcdc13df-87ba-4d6b-8e5c-8374081b74d8-albums_of_2018_1.png?auto=webp&crop=799,447,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maeve Mcdermott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/12/20/paris-hilton-talks-lindsay-lohan-britney-spears-and-infamous-photo-night-out/2373702002/", "title": "Paris Hilton drags Lindsay Lohan while explaining their famous photo with Britney Spears", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/12/20/paris-hilton-talks-lindsay-lohan-britney-spears-and-infamous-photo-night-out/2373702002/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Paris Hilton drags Lindsay Lohan while explaining their famous photo with Britney Spears", "description": "Paris Hilton discussed an infamous night in 2006 when she was photographed out on the town with Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/20/USAT/bcdc13df-87ba-4d6b-8e5c-8374081b74d8-albums_of_2018_1.png?auto=webp&crop=799,447,x0,y0&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Paris Hilton discussed an infamous night in 2006 when she was photographed out on the town with Britney Spears and Lindsay Lohan.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/fBT_gtmdji0?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1545264000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
