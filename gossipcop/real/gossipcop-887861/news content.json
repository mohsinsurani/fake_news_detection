Their Instagram interactions are among the funniest things we've scrolled through, and there's no telling how epic their pranks will be when they team up with one another. For the latest social media moment between the CW costars, Cole Sprouse revealed that not even his closest costars qualify for a discount on his photography services.\n\nIn an Instagram post shared on Thursday, December 20, Cole shared that he would be taking some time to resume his photography work. \"Back home for the holidays, going to focus on portfolio work again,\" he wrote. \"Looking to scout new locations and work with new talent. Need that photographic therapy.\"\n\nThe star didn't detail whether any of his upcoming shots might include Lili Reinhart, but one Riverdale cast member inquired about working with Cole. As pointed out by the commentsbyceleb Instagram account, Mark Consuelos wrote that he needed a new headshot \"please.\" There's no word on whether his new headshot might be used in lieu of his family's hilarious Christmas card, but it seems unlikely that Cole will be stepping in as his photographer.\n\n\"I'm too expensive for you,\" Cole replied. And with that, it would seem that Mark's headshot dreams are forever crushed.\n\nCole might not be up for photographing Mark's new headshot, but we may know of two other Riverdale friends that could always do in a pinch. As KJ Apa and Casey Cott recently demonstrated, the pair are more than happy to recreate some of Cole's most notable work.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63347e804e5b2e64dd601818/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6329d08a5b0f6cb61cf8eba4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632b7d796f425e0ea0540224/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631b458509e90c916749e6f9/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5bbb6c2cd068f952d0912bad/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b65ac0ba5d5d427a04b1c1d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cole-sprouse-quit-twitter-net-neutrality-.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b65ac0ba5d5d427a04b1c1d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cole-sprouse-quit-twitter-net-neutrality-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lauren Rearick"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/mark-consuelos-asked-riverdale-costar-cole-sprouse-to-take-his-headshot", "title": "Mark Consuelos Asked \"Riverdale\" Costar Cole Sprouse to Take His Headshot", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "In another round of \"Riverdale\" social media antics, Cole Sprouse joked that costar Mark Consuelos would not be able to afford his photography services.", "id": "5c1cfbad09e1e3201ea7c8ab", "keywords": "cole sprouse,mark consuelos,riverdale", "news_keywords": "cole sprouse,mark consuelos,riverdale", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5c1cfbad09e1e3201ea7c8ab", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In another round of \\\"Riverdale\\\" social media antics, Cole Sprouse joked that costar Mark Consuelos would not be able to afford his photography services.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5bbb6c2cd068f952d0912bad/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/lede.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5bbb6c2cd068f952d0912bad/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/lede.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "There will be no discounted headshots on his watch!", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b65ac0ba5d5d427a04b1c1d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cole-sprouse-quit-twitter-net-neutrality-.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Cole Sprouse Had the Perfect Response to a Photography Request from Mark Consuelos", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/mark-consuelos-asked-riverdale-costar-cole-sprouse-to-take-his-headshot"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-12-21T20:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-12-21T20:00:00.000Z", "author": "Lauren Rearick"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "There will be no discounted headshots on his watch!", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b65ac0ba5d5d427a04b1c1d/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cole-sprouse-quit-twitter-net-neutrality-.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Cole Sprouse Had the Perfect Response to a Photography Request from Mark Consuelos"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545422400.0, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
