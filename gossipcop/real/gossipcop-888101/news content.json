Jordan Strauss / AP\n\nRobbie appeared starstruck after chatting and posing for photos with Harding, 47, who was famously implicated in a plot led by ex-husband Jeff Gillooly to injure rival skater Nancy Kerrigan so that she would not be able to compete in the 1994 Winter Olympics.\n\nTonya Harding and star Margot Robbie hit it off at the premiere of the \"I, Tonya\" movie in which Robbie portrays Harding.

Harding went on to win the U.S. championship, but finished eighth at the Olympics in Lillehammer, while Kerrigan recovered from a bruised knee to win the silver medal behind Oksana Baiul.\n\nHarding wore several memorable costumes during her career in the 1990s, which came to an end after an attack on rival Nancy Kerrigan. Alamy Stock\n\nGillooly, Stant and Eckhardt all served prison time for the attack, while Harding was given three years probation. She also was banned for life by the U.S. Figure Skating Association.\n\nThose troubles appeared to be in the distant past on Tuesday, when she received a loud ovation from the audience at the premiere at the Egyptian Theatre.\n\nFollow TODAY.com writer Scott Stump on Twitter.", "images":
