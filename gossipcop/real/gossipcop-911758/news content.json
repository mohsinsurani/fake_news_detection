The Top 20 will be revealed!\n\nRyan Seacrest: What Happened After I Was Wrongly Accused of Harassment \u2013 In November, I received a letter from a lawyer representing a former show stylist. She claimed that I mistreated her more than a decade ago when we worked together. This arrived during an unprecedented public reckoning by women in our industry and beyond, courageously coming forward to share their stories, many of them heartbreaking. These women sought to bring attention to the systemic gender inequality that has occurred for decades. I was \u2014 and am \u2014 amazed at their bravery. To have my workplace conduct questioned was gut-wrenching. I\u2019ve always aimed to treat all of my colleagues with honesty, respect, kindness and compassion. Yet, I knew, regardless of the confidence I had that there was no merit to the allegations, my name would likely soon appear on the lists of those suspected of despicable words and deeds. The pressures of our overflowing newsfeeds would insist on it. \u2013 Read more at The Hollywood Reporter\n\nDWTS members \u2018fine\u2019 after being involved in 50-car pile-up in Iowa \u2013 Cast and crew of \u201cDancing with the Stars: Live!

I was saying the other day that Simon Cowell was my favorite judge because he\u2019s very straight-to-the-point. Most people who are at home watching American Idol\u2014you know, eating food and going about their lives\u2014are thinking either, This person can sing, or, This person can\u2019t. And Simon was that kind of judge. Simon could be mean, because he\u2019s an executive and a man. But you reverse the role, and all of a sudden you\u2019re a bitch. So I\u2019m cautious. People also come in with their stories. And before they even sing one note, they\u2019ll say something like, \u201cI\u2019m homeless,\u201d and that will impact the way you perceive them. But if they really can\u2019t sing, the personal story has to come second. I hope that I don\u2019t get turned into \u201cthe bitch\u201d because of that, but I also know that the music industry does not need just another singer. \u2013 Read more at Glamour\n\nLeah LaBelle Had a \u2018God-Given Gift\u2019: Producer Andreao \u2018Fanatic\u2019 Heard Remembers Late Singer, Talks Plans for Her Unreleased Music \u2013 Heard blames \u201cthe business side of the industry\u201d for him and LaBelle ultimately parting ways. He says that Labelle was \u201ctrapped\u201d once her debut singles didn\u2019t do well and that she\u2019d given up hope on her music career. \u201cThe whole purpose of us making music is to touch people and make people feel something,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought we were able to do that with the music that we created, but then the business got in the way.\u201d \u2013 Read more at Billboard.com\n\nSinger James Arthur Opens Up About Why He\u2019s \u2018Not Just the Guy With an Acoustic Guitar\u2019 \u2013 Writing his next big hit.
