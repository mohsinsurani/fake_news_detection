Proving that romance, or the dissolution of it, is really no different for celebrities than it is for anyone else, the couple are currently in the throes of shading each other on social media. Or, at least, some people think that\u2019s the case. Let\u2019s take a look at the facts.\n\nA few days after photos surfaced of Beckham kissing model Lexi Wood, when the rest of the world had presumed he was still dating Moretz, the pair made some interesting moves on Instagram. Moretz posted a screenshot to let the world know that she\u2019s listening to Cardi B\u2018s \u201cBe Careful,\u201d perhaps the most revealing song on the rapper\u2019s recently released debut album Invasion of Privacy. In the song, which has become an anti-cheaters anthem of sorts, Cardi B addresses her fianc\u00e9 Offset\u2019s infidelity and gives him an ultimatum. \u201cPoured out my whole heart to a piece of s**t,\u201d she raps, \u201cMan, I thought you would\u2019ve learned your lesson\u2026./ Said that you was workin\u2019, but you out here chasin\u2019 culo/ And putas, chillin\u2019 poolside, livin\u2019 two lives\u2026./ Be careful with me/ Yeah, it\u2019s not a threat, it\u2019s a warnin\u2019.\u201d Moretz captioned the screenshot with two words: \u201cThe queen.\u201d\n\ninstagram.com/chloegmoretz\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Moretz liked a meme posted by a fan account of her giving the middle finger with the caption \u201cGreetings to Brooklyn Beckham from me motherf***er,\u201d as Perez Hilton later pointed out.\n\nMeanwhile, Beckham weighed in on the situation not with his own post, but instead by liking another meme that depicted him crying as a young boy next to his mother, Victoria Beckham with the caption \u201cChloe\u2019s fans are attacking Brooklyn Beckham.\u201d\n\nBut how did we get here? To recap, Moretz and Beckham first linked up in 2014 at Paris Fashion Week. They didn\u2019t officially enter into a public-facing relationship, though, until April 2016. Not long after, they called off their relationship once again, this time citing the long distance between them. (Beckham was living in London, while Moretz was Stateside.) She later talked about that breakup, saying that she just wanted to hide. \u201cThey were like, \u2018That\u2019s all great that you want to go away\u2014but you can\u2019t. You are your own person,'\u201d she said. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re going to have to deal with this sort of thing.\u2019 I felt like things were falling apart, like my head and heart weren\u2019t in the same place. Things started to change when I realized I have the power within to change them.\u201d With that knowledge, hopefully this ending will be easier on the couple.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/04/11/5ace49ba5089dc47f49724b3_Grace-Moretz-and-Brooklyn-Beckham-breakup.jpg?w=414&h=305&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/04/11/5ace4c5cba61d2511122f651_chloe-grace-moretz-cardi-b-1523305591-AGIRLh.jpg?w=374&h=713&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/5/47b5fa0f-fc48-4cb1-9604-6f5821fa832d-getty-1430611960.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5093&fp-y=0.3502", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/04/11/5ace49ba5089dc47f49724b3_Grace-Moretz-and-Brooklyn-Beckham-breakup.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/8/29/9f122c0b-8ad0-4d04-b2cf-3379547870db-tswifty.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.532&fp-y=0.228"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/04/11/5ace49ba5089dc47f49724b3_Grace-Moretz-and-Brooklyn-Beckham-breakup.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/chloe-grace-moretz-brooklyn-beckham-split-instagram-shade", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham Make Split Official with Instagram Shade", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marissagmuller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/chloe-grace-moretz-brooklyn-beckham-split-instagram-shade", "type": "article", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Are in the Subtweet Stage of Their Breakup", "description": "They're now throwing shade on social media.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/04/11/5ace49ba5089dc47f49724b3_Grace-Moretz-and-Brooklyn-Beckham-breakup.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "They're now throwing shade on social media."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
