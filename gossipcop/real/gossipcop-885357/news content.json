The actress, 61, recently revealed that she didn\u2019t want to reprise her role as Samantha Jones on the HBO series.\n\nOne commenter wrote, \u201c@Kim Cattrall, So I\u2019ve seen you doing interviews on ageism yet I see you on Instagram saying you too old to play Samantha? I\u2019m so confused.\u201d\n\nAs a response, she wrote, \u201cI\u2019ve played \u201cSam\u201d for twenty years. I\u2019m moving on and so should you,\u201d while simultaneously recommending the fan in question to watch her new show called, \u201cSensitive Skin,\u201d which is on Netflix.\n\nDear fans, because I'm \"toxic\", I'm going to negotiate a contract for 6 months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway. \u2014 Willie Garson (@WillieGarson) October 4, 2017\n\nAs you may already know, Sarah Jessica Parker, Kim Cattrall, the rest of the cast and crew, along with the Warner Brothers studios planned to make a sequel to the last installment of the legendary series but canceled it due to Kim Cattrall not wanting to return.\n\nIn response to an article which claimed she made outrageous demands that executives couldn\u2019t meet, Kim said the only request she ever made was to not return for the film, and that was way back in 2016.\n\nHowever, the studio has yet to comment on the issue. In a new interview, Cattrall said the controversy surrounding her lack of desire to come back was similar to a \u201ctoxic relationship.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWith that said, her other former co-stars don\u2019t seem to agree, as Sarah Jessica Parker and Kristin Davis both seemed genuinely disappointed that the third movie wouldn\u2019t happen. Willie Garson weighed in as well by mocking Kim\u2019s choice of words, \u201cDear fans, because I\u2019m \u2018toxic,\u2019 I\u2019m going to negotiate a contract for six months, not come to terms, then say I never wanted to do it anyway.\u201d It appears as though Willie is not too fond of Kim\u2019s decision!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wendy_williams-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Sarah-Jessica-Parker-Kim-Cattrall-Sex-And-The-City-3-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Matt-Jordan-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kim-Cattrall-Blames-Sex-And-The-City-For-Her-Not-Having-Children-She-Slams-Her-Co-Stars-Saying-That-They-Have-Never-Been-Her-Friends-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Amber-Portwood-Pregnant-With-Baby-No-2-Teen-Mom-Star-Told-Fans-She-Is-Focusing-On-Family-300x210.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Shirley-Temple-300x210.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kristin-Davis-Wikipedia--700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kim-Cattrall-Famous-People-.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tamar-Braxton-and-Vincent-Herbert-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Phaedra-Parks-Mexico-300x156.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Tamar-Braxton-Star-Magazine--700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kim-Cattrall-Famous-People-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Angie Wager", "Jamie Smith"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919/http://celebrityinsider.org/kim-cattrall-tells-her-fans-its-time-to-move-on-regarding-sex-and-the-city-franchise-74045/", "title": "Kim Cattrall Tells Her Fans It\u2019s \u201cTime To Move On\u201d Regarding Sex And The City Franchise", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, sarah jessica parker, sex and the city, Willie Garson,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Kim Cattrall, Kristin Davis, sarah jessica parker, sex and the city, Willie Garson,", "description": "Kim Cattrall is moving on from the drama surrounding the newest installment of the Sex and The City franchise which executives officially canceled.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Cattrall Tells Her Fans It\u2019s \u201cTime To Move On\u201d Regarding Sex And The City Franchise", "description": "Kim Cattrall is moving on from the drama surrounding the newest installment of the Sex and The City franchise which executives officially canceled.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919/http://celebrityinsider.org/kim-cattrall-tells-her-fans-its-time-to-move-on-regarding-sex-and-the-city-franchise-74045/", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171101192919im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kim-Cattrall-Famous-People-.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity News, Gossip -
