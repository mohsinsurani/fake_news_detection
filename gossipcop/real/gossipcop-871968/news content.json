Kylie Jenner the queen of IG teases just gave us the first look at her Kylie Cosmetics Christmas collection swatches, and it is\u2026 frosty.\n\nKylie Cosmetics fans know by now, that Kylie Jenner doesn\u2019t play by the rules when it comes to dropping new products in your typical fashion cycle. Instead the beauty mogul plays by her own calendar launching products left and right for family birthdays, best friends, and her favorite holidays\u2026 including her long awaited Kylie Cosmetics Christmas collection.\n\nKylie took to IG this week to give us the first looks at her 2018 Christmas collection, and it is a sparkling, on-trend makeup wonderland. This year\u2019s collection is one of the largest Kylie Cosmetics drops to date, consisting of 18 new pieces \u2013 including the most requested cheek color that Kylie wore on her birthday, and she\u2019s been totally hush hush about since. Boosting a color story of rose gold, cranberry, and champagne, this new launch is frosty in all the right ways. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the new Kylie Cosmetics Christmas Collection.\n\nThe Product Breakdown\n\nThe new Christmas Collection has everything a product junkie needs to create a full-face holiday look. The real superstar is the Baby Its Cold Outside 8 piece mini lip set, that features a new bright pink shade that Kylie was seen wearing on IG, and it is everything.\n\nIn addition to the stocking stuffer kit, Kylie is keeping the lip game strong this winter, launching two new lacquered glosses, a full-size four piece lip gift set, a limited edition Merry Kissmas lip kit , and four new metallic formula creme lipsticks that can be worn alone or as glittery lip toppers.\n\nAnother early fave from the Kylie Cosmetics Christmas Collection is the \u201cYou\u2019re Perfect\u201d perfecting powder. It\u2019s one of the three face powders making a debut in the collection, and is Kylie\u2019s very first translucent blurring powder. True fans know that this might be a subtle clue that the beauty chameleon might have more new complexion products to follow in later drops (Kylie foundation hint, hint?).\n\nAs expected, the collection includes a new limited edition eyeshadow palette, Chill Baby that\u2019s cool-toned metallic shades make me instantly want to add setting spray to my brush and make a look! Kylie continues to pile on the sparkle vibes with never-before-seen creme eyeshadows, and two brand new shades of her signature Ultra Glow highlighters.\n\nWhich leaves me with just one last burning question Kylie\u2026 why did you not release any eye glitters with this collection?!\n\nKylie Cosmetics Christmas Collection #Goals\n\nKylie doesn\u2019t mess around when it comes to Christmas collections. The reality starlet totally slayed last year\u2019s Christmas collection and has since made the fan fave Nice palette a mainstay on her site. We\u2019re expecting her 2018 collection to be just as popular and sell out even quicker (my money is on those Ultra Glows to be the first to go!).\n\nAre you loving this fresh metallic color story for winter?
