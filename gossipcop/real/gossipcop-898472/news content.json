He teared up and gave me the lip \ud83d\ude02,\u201d she wrote in the caption.\n\nA few minutes later, Bubby decided to try his luck again, but without much success as his mother took another photograph as evidence.\n\nGrimacing at being caught, Bubby stood in front of his family\u2019s coffee table with a present half unwrapped.\n\n\u201cCaught! This was literally 20 minutes after I posted that lip pic \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02,\u201d James Decker wrote in the caption.\n\nThe singer and her husband, Eric Decker, also share 3\u00bd-year-old daughter Vivianne Rose. The couple announced they were expecting their third child, a boy, in October.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: \u201cBump Is Out!\u201d Jessie James Decker Shows Off Growing Belly As She Starts Feeling Kicks\n\nIn November, the country-pop singer opened up to PEOPLE about her daughter\u2019s reaction to the baby\u2019s gender.\n\n\u201cI knew she wanted a baby sister \u2014 I really wanted either one because we have one of each,\u201d the Southern Girl City Lights singer said. \u201cWhen I found out it was a boy, I was so excited, but I was like, \u2018Her little heart\u2019s gonna be disappointed.\u2019 Because all she kept saying was, \u2018I want a baby sister. Jesus, I want a baby sister.'\u201d\n\nThe good news for Vivi is that she does have a close female playmate in Jessie\u2019s niece: Brooklyn Rae, the 10-week-old daughter of Jessie\u2019s sister Sydney Rae Bass.\n\n\u201cI keep telling her, \u2018You have a baby sister,'\u201d the pregnant star said of the advice she gave Vivi. \u201c\u2018You don\u2019t even realize, but [Brooklyn]\u2019s your sister. You\u2019re good. You guys\u2019ll grow up together.'\u201d", "images":
