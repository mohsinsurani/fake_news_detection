Jenna Bush Hager, a Today show anchor and daughter of President George W. Bush, posted a heartbreaking statement on Instagram to remember her grandmother.\n\nBush Hager said her grandmother was \u201cthe glue that held our family together,\u201d and that she constantly was stopped by people wanting to praise the former first lady. \u201cShe adored my Gampy, the first man she ever kissed,\u201d Bush Hager wrote. \u201cTheir love story is so engrained in the history of our family.\u201d\n\nRead her full caption below:\n\n\u201cI already miss this FORCE of a woman\u2014 the \u2018enforcer\u2019 because she was the glue that held our family together. She taught me to use my voice but also to value the opinions of others. She adored her friends and family; her loyalty was unwavering. Humor helps, she often said and it does, Gans, but I will miss your laugh terribly. She adored my Gampy, the first man she ever kissed; their love story is so engrained in the history of our family. Thinking of my Gampy tonight \u2014no doubt missing his beloved desperately. Gans, people stopped me all the time to tell me how much they loved you. I didn\u2019t mind sharing you with them. I love you more than tongue can tell, my Ganny.\u201d\n\nSome of Bush Hager\u2019s cousins, fellow grandchildren of the former first lady, have also spoken out on social media to remember Barbara Bush.\n\nJeb Bush, Jr. urged people to honor her legacy by reading a book to a child, or \u201cfinding an opinion different [than] our own.\u201d\n\nAnd George P. Bush noted that his grandmother\u2019s \u201centire life was focused on others.\u201d", "images":
