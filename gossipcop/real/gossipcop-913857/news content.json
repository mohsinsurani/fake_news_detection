It was compiled by multiplying the average ticket price in the current year by an estimate of the total number of admissions. Where the number of admissions is unknown, they are estimated by dividing the nominal gross by the average ticket price in the year of release to provide an estimate (taking re-releases into account).[5] Admissions better reflect the popularity of older films, since they are less susceptible to the effects of inflation.\n\nMany of the films on this list were released prior to the availability of home video and have had multiple releases.\n\nBackground shading indicates films playing in the week commencing 7 October 2022 in theaters around the world.\n\nFactors in determining \"adjusted gross\" [ edit ]\n\nNo one yet has calculated a truly precise and definite referential adjusted gross for a film,[original research?] since doing so would have to take into account most (or all) of the following:\n\nBox office gross on initial release\n\nrelease Ticket price at time of release, or its relative price to other commodities in a given year, [8] in relation to general inflation and gross domestic product.

However in the case of, ticket sales are a combination of the three formats of standard projection, 3D and IMAX used during its theatrical run. Since box office admissions are not tracked, the total number of admissions cannot therefore be accurately determined simply by dividing the gross receipts by the average ticket price. Box Office Mojo revised estimate - by taking account of the ticket prices for all three different formats - is thatsold 75 million tickets by April 21, 2010, by which time it had grossed $745 million of its $760 million total.An extra $15 million of sales would be equivalent to about 2 million more ticket sales, at the average 2D ticket price of $7.50 in 2009; using this revision,probably sold closer to 77,000,000 tickets.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/37/Dagger-14-plain.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png"], "top_img": "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/apple-touch/wikipedia.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_highest-grossing_films_in_the_United_States_and_Canada", "title": "List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.4", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=1000", "og": {"title": "List of highest-grossing films in the United States and Canada - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
