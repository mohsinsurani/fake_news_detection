Richie also decided to create sections for the chickens to lay eggs, which didn\u2019t seem to actually work.\n\n\u201cThey actually just lay eggs all over the place, so that was just a romantic idea I had, I guess,\u201d she said with a laugh.\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nOne of her favorite parts about the chicken coop is the return on investment. \u201cThey are the easiest animals to take care of, they are so much fun for kids and they just give me beautiful colored eggs every day,\u201d she said.\n\nAlthough it can sometimes get a little messy. \u201cIt\u2019s actually really disgusting in there,\u201d she added. \u201cI get really dirty. I have two pairs of coop shoes that I rotate and a pair of jeans I just want to take off right away, and sometimes I just put on overalls.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Why Nicole Richie is glad social media wasn't around when she was a teen\n\nArchitectural Digest\n\nBut it\u2019s not enough to keep her away. In fact, Richie said she\u2019s planning on adding three more chickens to her coop soon.\n\nSee the full story at Architectural Digest.", "images":
