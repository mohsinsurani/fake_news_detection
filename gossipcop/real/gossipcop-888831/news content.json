Luckily for those of us who don\u2019t have a personal glam squad on call, the three gorgeous sisters dish out their favorite beauty products and secrets.\n\nYou may also like: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Reveals Her Ultimate Weight Loss Secret\n\n1 / 7 Kim is known for her gorgeous olive-hued skin and flawless complexion, but she doesn\u2019t owe her year-long tan to harsh, cancerous UV rays. \u201cSPF is everything,\u201d she says. \u201cI always use moisturizers and creams with SPF in them because they don\u2019t just help prevent skin cancer, but they also help reduce blotchiness and prevent dark spots and skin discoloration. I think for a lot of young people, sun damage isn\u2019t a huge concern, but it\u2019s so important to take precautions. I have naturally pale, olive skin, but I prefer my look when I have a tan, so I use our Kardashian Sun Kissed sunless tanning products.\u201d Image: Instagram/KimKardashian\n\n2 / 7 The Kardashian girls love dry shampoo and conditioner for days when their locks are looking limp and lifeless. \u201cDry shampoo is amazing, but dry conditioner is even better! Khlo\u00e9 and I are both totally addicted to dry shampoo, but we found that while our roots were refreshed after using it, we were getting really dry ends. So when we were creating our Kardashian Beauty hair line, we wanted to include a dry conditioner too, to fix that problem. Now I wouldn\u2019t use one without the other!\u201d reveals Kim. Image: Instagram/KBeautyHair\n\n3 / 7 Kim knows her makeup look is never complete without bold, beautiful brows that make a statement. Celebrity makeup artist and Kim\u2019s personal friend, Mario Dedivanovic, has perfected Kim\u2019s brows over the years with the use of his personal beauty trick. He uses not one, but two brow pencils in a darker and lighter shade to sculpt her brows. \u201cOne trick I learned from Mario is to use two different shades on my brows,\u201d says Kim. \u201cStart at the edges with a darker pencil, because this is the area that needs the most definition, and then switch to a slightly lighter shade for the inner brow to make it look softer and more natural.\u201d Image: Instagram/KimKardashian\n\n4 / 7 If there\u2019s one beauty rule all the sisters know, it\u2019s to embrace change and try trends. Khlo\u00e9 recently ditched her iconic long locks for a new fresh and flirty golden blond bob. \u201cI\u2019ll admit I was nervous to cut my hair,\u201d our cover star reveals. \u201cI\u2019ve had long hair for as long as I can remember, but it felt like time for a change. Now that it\u2019s shorter it\u2019s a lot more manageable and has more volume. I\u2019ve been using our ceramic iron and wearing it super straight recently.\u201d\n\nImage: Instagram/KhloeKardashian\n\n5 / 7 The Kardashian\u2019s love splurging on a few expensive beauty items, but they also admire simple and inexpensive beauty products. \u201cI\u2019m a big fan of cheap, yet effective products like Vaseline,\u201d admits Khlo\u00e9. \u201cI put it on my lips, eyes, hands, even feet. I\u2019ll apply my favorite moisturizer first and then a layer of vaseline over the top. It locks in moisture while you sleep so you\u2019ll wake up with soft skin.\u201d Kourtney agrees. \u201cCheck the ingredients of your products. Good skin care comes down to good ingredients. Natural antioxidants like green tea extract and vitamin C work wonders. To me, what I put on my skin, hair and body is just as important as what I eat,\u201d she says.\n\nRemember, the price of a beauty product doesn\u2019t make it a miracle worker\u2014the ingredients do.

Khlo\u00e9 reveals a simple, but effective way to make your cheekbones glow underneath your foundation. \u201cMy makeup artist told me she always applies highlighter to the cheeks before applying foundation,\u201d she says. This step may seem backwards, but it leaves skin with a gorgeous dewy finish. Image: Instagram/KhloeKardashian\n\n7 / 7 \u201cGet what you need for your skin, hair, nails and body from within,\u201d says Kourtney. \u201cTaking the right vitamins and eating the right foods are really important. I eat as cleanly and organically as possible and love learning about different ingredients and how they can help benefit from the inside out.\u201d\n\nImage: Instagram/KourtneyKardash\n\n\n\nIt's Personal At NewBeauty, we get the most trusted information from the beauty authority delivered right to your inbox", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=OTQyOjEyNw==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTEwIDcyMCIgd2lkdGg9IjkxMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MjAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTAyOjE0NQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTc2IDU1NSIgd2lkdGg9IjU3NiIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1NTUiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=OTI2OjExOQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTEwIDcyMCIgd2lkdGg9IjkxMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MjAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTQyOjE0OA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTk3IDUzNiIgd2lkdGg9IjU5NyIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MzYiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=OTEwOjEzNA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTEwIDcyMCIgd2lkdGg9IjkxMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MjAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTUzOjE0OA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTI4IDQ4MyIgd2lkdGg9IjUyOCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI0ODMiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1572440699746061&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/76298-khairsisters.jpg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21004701&cv=2.0&cj=1", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=ODczOjEyOA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTAwMCA3NTAiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijc1MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NDg1OjE0NQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNTk4IDU5NyIgd2lkdGg9IjU5OCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1OTciIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTMwOjE1Mg==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNDc3IDUxNSIgd2lkdGg9IjQ3NyIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MTUiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NDcxOjE0Ng==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNDgxIDU1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ4MSIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1NTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=OTc2OjQwNQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTUwIDE1MCIgd2lkdGg9IjE1MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSIxNTAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NTE1OjE0OQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgNDkyIDUxOCIgd2lkdGg9IjQ5MiIgaGVpZ2h0PSI1MTgiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=NDU3OjE1OQ==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTYwIDY0MCIgd2lkdGg9Ijk2MCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI2NDAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=ODk0OjEzMA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgOTEwIDcyMCIgd2lkdGg9IjkxMCIgaGVpZ2h0PSI3MjAiIHhtbG5zPSJodHRwOi8vd3d3LnczLm9yZy8yMDAwL3N2ZyI+PC9zdmc+", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=ODU3OjExNw==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTAwMCA3NTAiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijc1MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=", "data:image/svg+xml;nitro-empty-id=ODQxOjEyOA==-1;base64,PHN2ZyB2aWV3Qm94PSIwIDAgMTAwMCA3NTAiIHdpZHRoPSIxMDAwIiBoZWlnaHQ9Ijc1MCIgeG1sbnM9Imh0dHA6Ly93d3cudzMub3JnLzIwMDAvc3ZnIj48L3N2Zz4=", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=360254031573460&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.newbeauty.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/76298-khairsisters.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Newbeauty Editors", "The Kardashian Clan Is Known For Their Long Flowing Locks", "Contoured Cheekbones", "Sun-Kissed Hollywood Glow.
