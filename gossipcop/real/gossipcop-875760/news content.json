(That\u2019s a kids TV show for the non-parents).\u201d\n\n\u201cMake sure your \u2018friends\u2019 check their facts,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAccording to Entertainment Tonight, the tweet in question allegedly read, \u201cI know people who are friends of the girls he\u2019s hooked up with/have seen him in the clubs with girls who are not Jessie.\u201d\n\nEric and Jessie married in 2013. They share three kids together: daughter Vivianne Rose, 4, and sons Eric Jr., 3, and Forrest, 6 months.\n\nWhile Jessie didn\u2019t respond to the Twitter rumors, she has made it all-too clear what would happen if Eric did stray.\n\n\u201cSometimes I like to send pictures to Eric with little reminders of what would happen if he ever cheated,\u201d the 30-year-old country star wrote on Instagram nearly 2 years ago, captioning a photo of a big knife and chopped sausages. \u201cHope everyone has a good day.\u201d\n\nAll teasing aside, Jessie has previously raved about the strength of her bond with her husband, telling PEOPLE in September 2017 that they \u201chave grown together\u2026beautifully.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe just like each other and we always have and it continues to strengthen,\u201d Jessie said. \u201cI think we\u2019re such great parents together \u2014 I could not have picked a better partner to have kids with. We parent so well together and besides parenting well together, we both just are still madly in love with each other and we genuinely enjoy each other\u2019s company.\u201d\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty\n\nTo keep the romance sizzling in their relationship, Jessie said she\u2019s intentional about flirting with Eric.\n\n\u201cBesides being super attracted to each other, I think there\u2019s a sense of flirting with each other and still keeping that spice alive,\u201d Jessie shared with PEOPLE. \u201cI think women sometimes stop flirting with their husbands and you can\u2019t. Men want to feel good \u2014 they want to feel like their women love them. When they come home from work, don\u2019t start nagging them with questions. Go up to them and give them a big kiss and ask them how their day was.\u201d\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer/ACMA2017/Getty Images\n\nShe continued: \u201cLittle things like that go such a long way and I think sometimes women forget that. But also, I know he appreciates a nice physique, so I try to work out for him because I know that fitness is important to him, obviously in his field. And he will shave his beard once in a while for me, so we try to work on that.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Eric and Jessie James Decker Welcome Son Forrest Bradley\n\nMeanwhile, Eric and Jessie will have plenty of time for workouts and date nights now that he\u2019s retired from the NFL after an eight-season career.\n\nThe athlete announced his retirement on Aug. 26 after playing for the Denver Broncos, New York Jets, Tennessee Titans and signing a one-year contract with the New England Patriots.\n\n\u201cIt has been my childhood dream and my passion to play the game of football. I was very fortunate and blessed to have had the opportunity to have those dreams fulfilled and to have played with such extremely talented and hard-working teammates, coaches and staff,\u201d the former wide receiver wrote on Instagram. \u201cThis has been a passion inside of me since I was a little boy but I know now it is time to hang my helmet up and start a new chapter in my life.\u201d\n\nEric added: \u201cI love football and I always will. It will continue to be a part of my life. I\u2019m looking forward to spending more time with my wife and kids.\u201d", "images":
