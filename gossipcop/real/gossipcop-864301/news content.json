Alex Rodriguez revealed during The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon that he often gets mistaken for Jennifer Lopez\u2019s bodyguard.\n\n\u201cThis is one of the most humbling experiences of my life,\u201d Rodriguez, 41, said on Thursday, June 29. \u201cWhen I was on the Yankees and we won the world championship you wear the pinstripes and you think you\u2019re pretty cool. But then you hang out with Jennifer and they confuse me for the security guard all the time.\u201d\n\nRodriguez and Lopez, 47, who began dating a couple of months ago, often are photographed together in NYC. The athlete joked that he was shooed away be paparazzi when the couple made their red carpet debut in May.\n\n\u201cI promise you. We were at the Met Gala and the paparazzi were screaming at me \u2014 not even in English \u2014 saying \u2018Get the hell out of the way! Get out of the way! We want a picture.'\u201d\n\nThe Shades of Blue actress, meanwhile, gushed over Rodriguez during her own late-night interview in May. \u201cHe\u2019s the best. You would love him,\u201d she told James Corden on The Late Late Show at the time. \u201cHe\u2019s a great guy. He\u2019s fun. He\u2019s awesome. \u2026 I am happy.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-6d96d3b4-258a-43a2-abf8-2716327ec4ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1615px%2C848px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-6d96d3b4-258a-43a2-abf8-2716327ec4ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1615px%2C848px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/alex-rodriguez-i-get-mistaken-for-jennifer-lopezs-security-guard-w490562/", "title": "Alex Rodriguez: I Get Mistaken For Jennifer Lopez\u2019s Security Guard", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Alex Rodriguez revealed that he gets mistaken for Jennifer Lopez's security guard during an appearance on 'The Tonight Show' \u2014 watch the video!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "A-Rod: I Get Mistaken For Jennifer Lopez's Security Guard", "description": "Alex Rodriguez revealed that he gets mistaken for Jennifer Lopez's security guard during an appearance on 'The Tonight Show' \u2014 watch the video!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/alex-rodriguez-i-get-mistaken-for-jennifer-lopezs-security-guard-w490562/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:54:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-6d96d3b4-258a-43a2-abf8-2716327ec4ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1615px%2C848px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-6d96d3b4-258a-43a2-abf8-2716327ec4ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1615px%2C848px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-06-30T14:21:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:54:45+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "A-Rod: I Get Mistaken For Jennifer Lopez's Security Guard", "description": "Alex Rodriguez revealed that he gets mistaken for Jennifer Lopez's security guard during an appearance on 'The Tonight Show' \u2014 watch the video!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/alex-rodriguez-jennifer-lopez-6d96d3b4-258a-43a2-abf8-2716327ec4ae.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1615px%2C848px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498832498.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
