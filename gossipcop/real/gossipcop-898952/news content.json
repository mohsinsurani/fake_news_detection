Who\u2019s the singer who goes out with Justin Bieber? Selena Gomez!\u201d said Smith, who was a guest with his costar Claire Foy.\n\n\u201cYou love Selena Gomez,\u201d Foy, 33, quipped before Smith double-downed on his decision saying, \u201cShe\u2019s playing Meghan Markle!\u201d\n\nRELATED GALLERY: See Meghan Markle Through the Years: From California Girl to Future Royal!\n\nTommaso Boddi/WireImage; Robert Viglasky/Netflix/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\nOn Nov. 27, Meghan and fianc\u00e9 Prince Harry announced their engagement followed by the news that their wedding will be in May at St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\n\u201cWe love it that they\u2019re getting married, it\u2019s amazing,\u201d Foy told host Andy Cohen. \u201cShe\u2019s an actress so that\u2019s great,\u201d she added before Smith jokingly argued, \u201cWell she\u2019s not anymore, her life is over.\u201d\n\nOne day after the royal engagement news, it was announced that Meghan would officially no longer be portraying fan favorite Rachel Zane on the hit USA legal drama, Suits. In addition, Meghan confirmed she would be retiring from acting to focus on her royal duties.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Crown\u2019s Matt Smith on Meghan Markle\u2019s Transition into Royalty: \u2018I Feel Sorry for Her\u2019\n\nEarlier this month, Smith expressed that he \u201cfeels sorry\u201d for Markle as she will be forced to adhere to tradition and royal custom, something his The Crown character, Prince Philip, was familiar with as he struggled with the same transition Markle is about to confront when he married Queen Elizabeth II (played by Foy).\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for her,\u201d Smith said during a talk at the 92nd Street Y in New York City. \u201cIt\u2019s such a transition in her life, and it\u2019s such a huge thing to take on. Life as she knows it is gone. But hey, she\u2019s marrying the prince of Britain \u2014 how exciting for her.\u201d\n\nSeason two of The Crown starts streaming on Netflix from Dec. 8.", "images":
