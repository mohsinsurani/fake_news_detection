He was just 16.\n\nKenworthy, 26, was by his friend\u2019s side at the time along with two of their other friends. The pals has piled on the back of the snowcat to get to the top of the mountain, which was closed at the time.\n\nThe tragic loss left Kenworthy questioning whether he wanted to continue with skiing.\n\nGus Kenworthy\n\nThings were made more complicated as Kenworthy, who is openly gay, had just understood his own sexual orientation and had not yet come out. He felt so guilty about being gay, he wished he had been the one to die, he said.\n\n\u201cI know for myself, especially I was in the closet at the time, I mean hadn\u2019t told anybody that I was gay. And when Hoot passed away, I remember wishing and feeling like had it been me that died instead,\u201d Kenworthy said. \u201cEveryone would have just remembered me in this great way and no one would have ever had to know this secret, that I thought was like a dark secret. So I think I felt guilt that he had died and not me and he didn\u2019t deserve to and I did..\u201d\n\nGus Kenworthy\n\nHenry helped Kenworthy feel free from that guilt, telling the Olympian he made the right choice in continuing to pursue his dreams.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s so proud of you in all that you\u2019ve been able to do,\u201d Henry said. \u201cHe\u2019s book closing and you\u2019re book opening.\u201d\n\n\u201cJust so much appreciation, so much appreciation and what\u2019s so interesting is he\u2019s showing the symbology of handing you a torch and you\u2019re taking the torch and you\u2019re running with it,\u201d Henry added. \u201cAnd I feel like this is his time now to give you that torch and to help be with you and he is.\u201d\n\nKenworthy wiped away tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve wanted to hear some of those things for 12 years,\u201d the Olympic silver medalist said. \u201cHe was a huge part of my life. When I was kid he was one of my best friends. We had the same dreams and ambitions. Since he passed, even though I was young, I did make it my life\u2019s mission for skiing to do it in a big way in his honor and not let it be something like he did it in vain.\u201d\n\nHollywood Medium With Tyler Henry premiers Feb. 28 (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_w_entertainmentv2.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197800334&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fentertainment%2Fgus-kenworthy-tears-over-tragic-200711312.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/sBFgWsaKmCNDHZvlyqeYzA--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk0O2g9NDg-/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/6f273c70-2b81-11eb-b77f-515addbbc249", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/eAMPTF2aSC2HEnvN9ZWsgg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTU0MA--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/aKXxJQ1Ah9nsT3jGs2UcgQ--~B/aD01NjI7dz0xMDAwO2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/b4fdcf0ce7b75d18eb6b62256f2dc430", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/6NlUEdl6n7wiKPJd0LFCFQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTE0Mzk-/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/uXHtuJR1hplc6VQkdQKeMw--~B/aD0xMDAwO3c9NjY3O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/http://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/fb40d0c5059615a77475c7809606fb43", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SuIbOtTZNZlr.oauJtEF.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNzk5/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/e5840417e4246601542d43767cb94b79"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SuIbOtTZNZlr.oauJtEF.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNzk5/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/e5840417e4246601542d43767cb94b79", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Quinn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/gus-kenworthy-tears-over-tragic-200711312.html", "title": "Gus Kenworthy Tears Up Over Tragic Death of His Best Friend: 'I Felt Guilt He Died and Not Me'", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Tyler Henry, Telluride Ski Resort", "twitter": {"title": "Gus Kenworthy Tears Up Over Tragic Death of His Best Friend: 'I Felt Guilt He Died and Not Me'", "description": "Gus Kenworthy Remembers Late Friend Brooks 'Hoot' Brown", "site": "@Yahoo", "dnt": "on", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SuIbOtTZNZlr.oauJtEF.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNzk5/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/e5840417e4246601542d43767cb94b79", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SuIbOtTZNZlr.oauJtEF.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNzk5/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/e5840417e4246601542d43767cb94b79"}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"title": "Gus Kenworthy Tears Up Over Tragic Death of His Best Friend: 'I Felt Guilt He Died and Not Me'", "url": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/gus-kenworthy-tears-over-tragic-200711312.html", "description": "Gus Kenworthy Remembers Late Friend Brooks 'Hoot' Brown", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/SuIbOtTZNZlr.oauJtEF.Q--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDA7aD0xNzk5/https://media.zenfs.com/en-US/homerun/people_218/e5840417e4246601542d43767cb94b79", "width": 1200, "height": 1799}}, "al": {"android": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=4427a58b-1c61-3070-b77c-8a1af6bd2b5b&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "package": "com.yahoo.mobile.client.android.yahoo"}, "ios": {"url": "yahoo://article/view?uuid=4427a58b-1c61-3070-b77c-8a1af6bd2b5b&src=web", "app_name": "Yahoo", "app_store_id": 304158842}}, "description": "Gus Kenworthy Remembers Late Friend Brooks 'Hoot' Brown", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.yahoo.com", "summary": ""}
