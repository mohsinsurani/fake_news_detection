I was not a writer or a producer or a director on that show. I had nothing to do with casting. I was an actor and only an actor.\u201d\n\nThe actor, who starred as Doug Ross on the series for five seasons, denied having any influence on casting the show or on Marquez\u2019s career. \u201cIf she was told I was involved in any decision about her career then she was lied to,\u201d he said. \u201cThe fact that I couldn\u2019t affect her career is only surpassed by the fact that I wouldn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'ER' Actress Says George Clooney Helped 'Blacklist' Her After 'P--- Grabber' Complaint\n\nMarquez accused the cast and producers of \u201cER\u201d of conspiring to have her blacklisted after she reported being sexually harassed and being discriminated against on the basis of race.\n\n\u201cB.S.\u201d she tweeted in response to Clooney\u2019s condemnation of Harvey Weinstein last week. \u201cClooney helped blacklist me when I spoke up [about] harassment on ER. \u2018Women who don\u2019t play the game lose career\u2019 I did.\u201d\n\nMarquez, who portrayed Nurse Wendy Goldman in 27 episodes of the series between 1994 and 1997, accused Eriq La Salle and a camera operator of being \u201cp\u2014\u2013 grabbers,\u201d which she said she reported to showrunner John Wells and to the show\u2019s production company, Warner Bros. Reps for La Salle, John Wells and Warner Bros. have not responded to TheWrap\u2019s request for comment.\n\nAlso Read: George Clooney Says Harvey Weinstein Scandal Is 'Disturbing on a Whole Lot of Levels'\n\nHer accusation came after Clooney spoke out against Weinstein, the powerhouse producer who has been accused of sexual harassment and rape by multiple women, in an interview with The Daily Beast.
