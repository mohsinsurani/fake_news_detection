For everyone else, including the millions who tuned in across the world, this was an electrifying affair that will live long in the memory.\n\nConvention was broken almost from the start. After ascending the 20 or so steps to the chapel\u2019s West Door, the bride entered to a traditional fanfare by the State Trumpeters. But then, instead of the customary rousing organ voluntary \u2013 Bach or Wagner, perhaps \u2013 Meghan set off down the aisle to a haunting and ethereal cantata composed by Handel for the birthday of Queen Anne in 1714.\n\nIn a striking image, the outspoken biracial American divorc\u00e9e walked unescorted, followed by her 10 bridesmaids and page boys.\n\nAlmost every part of the ceremony made a statement. Meghan\u2019s elegant white dress with an open bateau neckline was by British designer Clare Waight Keller, the first female artistic director for the Givenchy fashion house. The 16-foot-long veil was held in place by a diamond bandeau tiara lent to her by the Queen.\n\nMeghan walks down the aisle in St George's Chapel.

Even then, he stepped back. There was no one needed to \u201cgive her away.\u201d\n\nHarry, flanked by his brother and best man Prince William, looked emotional as he waited for Meghan, dressed in the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals. As she reached his side, Harry appeared to say: \u201cYou look amazing. I missed you.\u201d\n\nHarry and Meghan exchange vows.

Extemporising in the custom of American episcopalianism, Curry invoked the civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. to deliver a powerful ode to love.\u201dWe must discover the power of love, the power, the redemptive power of love,\u201d he thundered. \u201cAnd when we do that, we will make of this whole world a new world. But love, love is the only way.\u201d\n\nHis impassioned preaching style was a marked departure from the usually conservative tone of a British royal wedding. Harry could be seen saying \u201cWow\u201d to Meghan as Curry\u2019s speech ended. Other members of the royal family looked decidedly bemused.\n\nIt was followed by a performance of the Ben E. King classic \u201cStand by Me\u201d by The Kingdom Choir, a group of 20 gospel singers, another of the elements that gave the ceremony an air of diversity that has been almost entirely absent from any royal wedding that has gone before.\n\nOnly with the couple\u2019s marriage vows did the ceremony come closer to resembling a traditional state occasion \u2013 but even then the language was unconventional for a royal ceremony. Harry and Meghan chose the colloquial texts of Common Worship, the standard Church of England liturgy published in 2000, over the distinctly more austere phrasing of the 1662 Book of Common Prayer used for the marriage of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge in 2011.\n\nThere was no promise by Markle to \u201cobey\u201d her husband. Rather, she pledged to \u201clove him, comfort him, honor and protect him.\u201d Harry chose to wear a wedding ring, unlike his brother.\n\nMeghan was all smiles as she said her vows and gave Harry his wedding ring. The crowd could be faintly heard cheering outside as the couple were proclaimed husband and wife by the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, the most senior cleric in the Church of England.\n\nHarry and Meghan kiss outside the West Door.

The ceremony ended with the Etta James version of \u201cAmen/This Little Light of Mine,\u201d a gospel song that became synonymous with the US civil rights movement.\n\nAfter their joyful kiss on the steps, the couple \u2013 now the Duke and Duchess of Sussex \u2013 then set off on a procession through the streets of Windsor in an open carriage drawn by four Windsor Grey horses.\n\nThey were waved off by a bridal party that included Harry\u2019s nephew and niece, Prince George and Princess Charlotte, as well as the couple\u2019s godchildren and the children of their closest friends.\n\nPrincess Charlotte waves after the wedding.

Matt Cardy/Getty Images\n\nMore than 100,000 people thronged the streets to cheer the couple as they passed, authorities said. Some had camped out for days to get the best possible spot, while others rose before dawn to make their way to Windsor amid a party atmosphere.\n\nThe biggest cheers were reserved for Meghan and Harry, though Princess Charlotte drew some \u201cawwws\u201d after appearing on the big screen. As people began to disperse and head towards the exits, it began to dawn that an event that so many had looked forward to for so long was over. \u201cMummy, can we do it all again tomorrow?\u201d one little girl asked.\n\nFrom the Commonwealth and beyond: Thank you to the amazing crowds in Windsor for the incredible reception for the newly-married Duke and Duchess of Sussex #RoyalWedding pic.twitter.com/VMpBUTr39T \u2014 The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) May 19, 2018\n\nAmong the host of famous guests who witnessed the ceremony were Oprah Winfrey, George and Amal Clooney \u2013 dressed in an eye-catching yellow dress and hat \u2013 tennis star Serena Williams, actor Idris Elba and singer James Blunt.\n\nThe Queen, wearing a lime silk dress, was accompanied by Prince Philip. Hours before the ceremony, Elizabeth conferred the titles of Duke of Sussex, Earl of Dumbarton and Baron Kilkeel on Prince Harry, making Meghan the first-ever Duchess of Sussex.\n\nA host of other royals were also present, including the Princess Royal, Prince Andrew and his daughters, Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. Catherine\u2019s sister Pippa Middleton and their parents also attended.\n\nGuests from Markle\u2019s side included her mother, Doria Ragland, who watched with tears in her eyes as her daughter walked down the aisle.\n\nAlso present were cast members from \u201cSuits\u201d \u2013 the legal drama in which she made her name \u2013 including Abigail Spencer, Sarah Rafferty, Gina Torres and Gabriel Macht.\n\nAmal and George Clooney arrive on Saturday. GARETH FULLER/AFP/Getty Images\n\nThe presence of Harry\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, was also subtly felt at the ceremony. \u201cGuide me o thou great redeemer\u201d was sung at Diana\u2019s funeral, at her memorial service in 2007 and at Kate and William\u2019s wedding in 2011, and again on Saturday.\n\nHarry\u2019s aunt Lady Jane Fellowes, Diana\u2019s sister, gave the reading from the Book of Solomon.\n\nMeghan\u2019s father, Thomas Markle Sr., was supposed to attend until health concerns ruled him out. But in remarks to the US celebrity website TMZ, he said his daughter looked \u201cbeautiful\u201d and described her wedding as \u201cemotional and joyful.\u201d\n\nAll 600 of the guests were invited to an afternoon reception hosted by the Queen at Windsor Castle\u2019s St. George\u2019s Hall, at which Elton John \u2013 who was a friend of Princess Diana \u2013 performed.\n\nThe guests were also to enjoy the famously non-traditional lemon and elderflower sponge cake chosen by Harry and Meghan.\n\nThe wedding cake is to be served at the Reception. It was designed by Claire Ptak and features elderflower syrup made at The Queen\u2019s residence in Sandringham from the estate\u2019s own elderflower trees, as well as a light sponge cake uniquely formulated for the couple. #royalwedding pic.twitter.com/kt5lE4tEn9 \u2014 The Prince and Princess of Wales (@KensingtonRoyal) May 19, 2018\n\nOnly 200 of the couple\u2019s closest friends and family will celebrate with them into the night at a second, evening reception hosted by Prince Charles at Frogmore House, south of Windsor Castle. In one last departure from custom, the bride will give a speech.\n\nMeghan, who began the day as a TV star, will end it by Harry\u2019s side as the newly minted Duchess of Sussex, whose thoroughly modern wedding broke the royal mold.\n\nTimeline: From blind date to \u2018I will\u2019", "images":
