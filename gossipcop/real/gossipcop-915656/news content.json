Others \u2013 mostly on the right \u2013 viewed it as a vile, hate-filled address that was neither funny nor appropriate.\n\nMost journalists in the room \u2013 and I was among them \u2013 were largely quiet during Wolf\u2019s speech, particularly the second half when she got very personal about Sanders. (No, this does not mean journalists are humorless or can\u2019t laugh at themselves \u2013 so save it.)\n\nI took a bunch of my notes on my phone during Wolf\u2019s speech. I thought I\u2019d share them \u2013 and expand on them \u2013 here. These are in no order other than how they occurred to me. (You can watch the whole speech yourself here.)\n\nWolf had zero interest in playing to the room\n\nIntroducing the \u201cDaily Show\u201d comic, White House Correspondents\u2019 Association President Margaret Talev praised Wolf as someone who was very much not part of the world of Washington. That was seen as a good thing, given that the criticism of Washington and its denizens since the election of Trump is that they/we are deeply out of touch with normal Americans. (A coastal comedian is not exactly \u201cregular\u201d people, but whatever.) I wonder whether Talev thought Wolf\u2019s I-could-care-less-about-any-of-you approach was such a great idea after the comedian\u2019s speech.\n\nMost comedians who speak at the correspondents\u2019 dinner take a fair number of shots at the attendees in the room. But they also play along with theme of the night, which attempts to be a celebration of the free and independent media as well as a chance to shine a light on some of the best journalists in the country.\n\nWolf didn\u2019t do that. She wanted to napalm the room. And she did. Unapologetically.\n\nWolf went for lots of low-hanging fruit\n\nThere are LOTS of way to go after Sanders. I personally think that she is overly antagonistic to the reporters who cover the White House and misleads on the regular. But to make fun of Sanders\u2019 makeup? (\u201cI think she\u2019s very resourceful, like she burns facts and then she uses that ash to create a perfect smokey eye. Maybe she\u2019s born with it, maybe it\u2019s lies,\u201d said Wolf.) Like, really?\n\nI know lots of liberals will \u2013 and already have via Twitter \u2013 painted the attacks on Sanders as the press secretary getting what she deserved. I don\u2019t subscribe to that idea. Sanders showed up, sat on the dais and played along. She knew she was likely to get made fun of. But she would have no reasonable expectation that Wolf would go after her looks and refer to her as an \u201cUncle Tom, but for white women who disappoint other white women.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m stunned that Sanders sat five feet away from Wolf and just took it.\n\nBeing funny is one thing. Bullying people because you can is another. And Wolf\u2019s treatment of Sanders was bullying.\n\nAnd, yes, by the way, Trump is a massive bully. Making fun of a disabled reporter, stereotyping ethnic groups, attacking reporters for how they look \u2013 all of that stuff is totally and completely unacceptable. And he knows exactly what he is doing, which makes it worse.\n\nBut two wrongs don\u2019t make it right. Because Trump bullied a disabled reporter doesn\u2019t mean Wolf should be able to bully Sarah Sanders. Bullying is bullying. And it\u2019s wrong. Always.\n\nWolf\u2019s criticism of the media was (generally) on point\n\nThe most powerful line of Wolf\u2019s speech, which will inevitably get overshadowed by what she said about Sanders, was this on the media and Trump:\n\n\u201cHe has helped you sell your papers and your books and your TV. You helped create this monster and now you are profiting from him.\u201d\n\nThe first sentence there is 100% right. It is absolutely beyond debate that Trump has been good for the news business. The amount of news he creates coupled with the number of people who consume news about him has made cable news and print media more relevant (and profitable) than ever before.\n\nThe second sentence I take some issue with. Yes, cable ran Trump\u2019s primary speeches because he said and did things that no one else would do \u2013 and that people would watch. And, yes, when I was at The Washington Post, I wrote about Trump regularly because he said and did things that no one else did.\n\nBut that, to me, is different than \u201ccreating\u201d Trump. Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy was formed and sharpened by an angry and embittered GOP electorate who was sick of their own party, of Washington, of the media, of everything. He was rising whether the media covered him wall to wall or not; he was the angry id of the GOP. The media didn\u2019t create that.\n\nThe abortion stuff was beyond the pale\n\nHere\u2019s Wolf\u2019s joke about Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s opposition to abortion: \u201cHe thinks abortion is murder which, first of all, don\u2019t knock it \u2018til you try it \u2014 and when you do try it, really knock it. You know, you\u2019ve got to get that baby out of there.\u201d\n\nDoes anyone think this joke is funny? You can hate abortion and think it is murder. You can feel as though it\u2019s not the government\u2019s business what you do with your body and how you handle your own life. But, does anyone celebrate abortion \u2013 even jokingly?\n\nWolf got exactly what she wanted\n\nDon\u2019t be fooled: Wolf knew exactly what she was doing on Saturday night. She knew that the speech \u2013 at least in parts \u2013 was likely to go over like a lead balloon in the room. And that it would stir huge amounts of controversy in its wake.\n\nTHAT WAS THE POINT.\n\nAsk yourself this: Did the average person know who Wolf was before Saturday night? (I will admit, I did not. And, yes, I know Wolf had never heard of me either.) Search interest in her soared last night and continued to spike Sunday morning, according to Google Trends. She is the talk of every Sunday talk show. She will be a regular topic on cable TV \u2013 and late-night TV \u2013 this week.\n\nOn a related note, her Netflix series, \u201cThe Break With Michelle Wolf\u201d \u2013 comes on May 27. She couldn\u2019t buy better publicity for that show than she got with her speech on Saturday night.", "images":
