Thanks to social media, the annual event has become a #Blackmoment, where everywhere comes dressed in their Sunday best. And whether you\u2019re there or not, you\u2019ll spend a lot of time just scramming through the gram, getting your life from these looks. And honestly, the flicks are amazing. There\u2019s a bit of church, a dash of brunch, and a whole lot of Black excellence. Hands down, it\u2019s the best place to catch some dope fashion looks while sitting out on the lawn, sipping on your champagne. And I love any event that turns into a Black family reunion! If you need some fashion inspo for the summer, just look at these fire fits spotted this weekend at the Veuve Clicquot Polo Classic sponsored by Hublot.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bjih2KJg1-KjNmZLmKLcfiQetNBeieZ4HXLXHQ0/ This stylista gave us a case for all pink this summer in this fabulous pantsuit, paired with sneakers to keep it calm and casual-yet-glam on the lawn. Oh, and these cheetah sunglasses? Fierce!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjinwvKBf12/?tagged=vcpoloclassic This stylista gave us floral-themed goodness for the day, pairing a beautiful purple floral dress with some pink flowers.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlAihhAmbP/?tagged=vcpoloclassic This fashion-savvy duo popped out in frills and a two-piece set (which is also by the poppin\u2019 Black designer, Fenoel.) Which is your favorite look? I can\u2019t choose!\n\nView this post on Instagram Drink Good, Live Well\u2122\ufe0f . . . #VCPoloClassic #CliquotStyle #Ros\u00e9Garden #DrinkGoodLiveWell A post shared by Maxine Lee (@livegoodwithmax) on Jun 3, 2018 at 7:26am PDT I LOVE PINK. This hot pink number has a low plunging neckline and a thigh slit, perfect for a summer night out with your friends or even date night with your boo. This dress is a lewwwwk.\n\nView this post on Instagram #VeuveClicquotPoloClassic \ud83c\udf7e A post shared by The Non-Influencer (@jaidus) on Jun 2, 2018 at 4:46pm PDT This green pantsuit looked so chic and dapper on this fashionisto, who gave us color for the summer and spring. I never thought I\u2019d like a green pantsuit as much as this, but I am diggin\u2019 this vibe.\n\nView this post on Instagram \ud83c\udfc7\ud83c\udffe\ud83e\udd42 A post shared by \u2654Jamaican Canadian\u2654 (@winnieharlow) on Jun 2, 2018 at 3:52pm PDT Oh, and don\u2019t get it twisted: Celebs come out to the function as well! The beautiful Winnie Harlow was spotted in New York, sporting off those long legs in this dope fit. Winnie never disappoints!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlCwuCH0FK/ This boss babe wore this beautiful pastel, off-the-shoulder flowy dress, decked out with some nude heels and a matching nude purse.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjlMAJgHb_h/ Even the men came out in their full fits for the polo event! This all-white fit is absolutely dapper, and paired with an orange linen blazer? Yes, Black king. YAAASS.\n\nView this post on Instagram Today was a beautiful day at the polo! \ud83d\udc0e\ud83c\udfd1\ud83c\udfc6 A post shared by faroukjames (@faroukjames) on Jun 3, 2018 at 10:11am PDT Even the kids came to slay! Farouk James came in this dapper polo fit, and with all that flowy hair? This is a model pose.

This all-white LV-esque fit is fire, but also this two-piece set is giving me everything for that beautiful, green lawn. Also everyone had one of these fab yellow umbrellas, and now I\u2019m wondering where I can get one.\n\nView this post on Instagram Champagne & Polo #veuveclicquotpoloclassic #vcpoloclassic A post shared by The Artisan Unique (@amorunique__) on Jun 3, 2018 at 7:45am PDT This look is honestly something so unexpected to me, and that\u2019s why I love it! Who says you can\u2019t pair metallics with non-metallics, or that something with a bit of gold can\u2019t go with silver? Fashion is whatever you want it to be, shine girl!\n\nView this post on Instagram A lovely day to visit the grounds. #VCpoloclassic #goodvibes #summertime A post shared by Brie (@briepyt) on Jun 3, 2018 at 6:51am PDT How mesmerizing is this African-print sundress? Not only is it a super simple fit that can easily be dressed up and down, but it\u2019s just\u2026such an understated statement-maker. This Queen brought it home!\n\nView this post on Instagram Bubble gum \ud83c\udf6d \ud83c\udf6c #vcpoloclassic #fashion A post shared by J'Lysa (@jlysa_monet) on Jun 2, 2018 at 6:13pm PDT I promise, no more pink suits, but I told y\u2019all it\u2019s a vibe! This longline linen pantsuit is a look that you can wear with the blazer, or you can pair the blazer with some nude heels and wear it as a dress (or maybe some pants underneath.) Love everything about the pink suits coming out to play!\n\nView this post on Instagram Brown Sugar Champagne Mam\u00ed x Clicquot Ros\u00e9 \u2728\ud83c\udf7e\ud83d\udc95 #VCPoloClassic #VeuveClicquotPoloClassic A post shared by Brittany \ud83d\udc51 (@britshaniece) on Jun 2, 2018 at 5:55pm PDT Last but certainly not least, this curvy stylista gave the gram BODY in this super cute yellow two-piece frilly set.
