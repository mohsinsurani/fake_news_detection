And if in a year or two years they come back into my life and I feel okay... okay. But I can't be like homies with my ex,\" Scheana explained to E! News.\n\nThen, when asked if fans should anticipate a future reunion with Rob, Scheana exclaimed, \"Hell no!\"\n\nAlso during her interview with E! News, Scheana said fans of Vanderpump Rules should expect to see her undergo a number of changes with her friendships with her co-stars. That said, rumors of a feud with her best friend Ariana Madix are false.\n\n\"You'll see some friendship changes, like positive. Positive! I said that the other day and then it was like, 'Scheana and Ariana, not friends anymore,' That's not what I said. No, I just said there's changes drastically in the friendships,\" she explained.\n\nIn Scheana Marie's latest two Instagram photos, she was seen with Ariana Madix and a number of other cast members of Vanderpump Rules.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Scheana-Marie-Talks-Rob-Valletta-Split.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4b4ada48-86be-4e4b-bb9c-5533d3708ba6.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/28fd1ecd-acc0-48fc-be3b-21a0f5ef3d90.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Scheana-Marie-Talks-Rob-Valletta-Split.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5195383/scheana-marie-dishes-on-potential-reunion-with-rob-valletta-plus-did-she-and-ariana-madix-have-a-falling-out/", "title": "Scheana Marie Dishes On Potential Reunion With Rob Valletta, Plus Did She And Ariana Madix Have A Falling Out?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scheana Marie Dishes On Potential Reunion With Rob Valletta, Plus Did She And Ariana Madix Have A Falling Out?", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5195383/scheana-marie-dishes-on-potential-reunion-with-rob-valletta-plus-did-she-and-ariana-madix-have-a-falling-out/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Scheana Marie Dishes On Potential Reunion With Rob Valletta, Plus Did She And Ariana Madix Have A Falling Out?", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Scheana-Marie-Talks-Rob-Valletta-Split.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-12-05 12:17:30Z", "section": "Celebrities"}, "description": "Scheana Marie Dishes On Potential Reunion With Rob Valletta, Plus Did She And Ariana Madix Have A Falling Out?", "keywords": "Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GirlWithGossip"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1544012250.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
