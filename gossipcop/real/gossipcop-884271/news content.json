I\u2019m just sitting in the back of the car with Jason and my second child,\u201d Mollen, 38, said in the first of a series of clips shared on Instagram Stories Thursday, showing herself and Biggs in a car with their newborn son.\n\nAddressing her husband after panning the camera to their new little guy, situated between his parents in his car seat, Mollen says, \u201cBaby, you have two boys now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI know, WTF,\u201d Biggs, 39, replies. (The couple also share 3\u00bd-year-old Sid.)\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Biggs replies jokingly, \u201cWas I supposed to sign [discharge] papers or pay or anything?\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna go home and eat my placenta,\u201d says Mollen, with Biggs adding, \u201cI\u2019m excited to try it.\u201d\n\nShortly after, Mollen posted a video to Instagram of herself in a hospital bed, gazing at a golden pineapple-shaped ur on a chair. \u201cObviously had to bring Teets for moral support\u2026. #babybiggs,\u201d she wrote, referring to her beloved dog who died in March 2016.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Baby No. 2 on the Way for Jason Biggs and Jenny Mollen \u2013 See Their Hilarious Announcement\n\nMollen and Biggs leveraged their signature silly sides to share their pregnancy news with the world in April, sharing a photo to Instagram showing the actress and author using a NoseFrida snot sucker on her husband.\n\nSince announcing Baby No. 2 on the way, the couple revealed they were having a second son, with Mollen being hilariously open about the realities of parenting while pregnant \u2014 and dealing with placenta previa.\n\n\u201cIt actually hasn\u2019t been a big deal so far because I\u2019m so early,\u201d Mollen told PEOPLE in June. \u201cI had a c-section the first time because I never dilated, so I\u2019m not that concerned because I expected to have to be cut open again.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Biggs explained that Sid wasn\u2019t quite sure what was in store for him with a new sibling on the way. \u201cWhile it\u2019s still safely tucked away and he doesn\u2019t have to actually physically deal with someone else in his space, he loves it,\u201d the Orange Is the New Black star told PEOPLE.\n\nPlacenta previa and juggling a toddler and impending second-time motherhood aren\u2019t the only challenges Mollen faced throughout her pregnancy. In early September, the Angel alum shared her experience with what she described as \u201cprepartum\u201d depression in an Instagram post and Story.\n\n\u201cI could already be in a depression,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI\u2019m planning on eating my placenta, but I\u2019m also anticipating a major emotional dive. I think that it\u2019s chemical. I think people don\u2019t talk about it enough.\u201d\n\nThe following day, Mollen clarified that she was \u201ctotally fine\u201d after receiving an influx of concerned emails. \u201cThis is normal \u2014 that\u2019s what I\u2019m trying to say,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat it\u2019s not weird \u2026 I would be more freaked out if I weren\u2019t freaking out.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Former Bachelorette Ashley Hebert Rosenbaum Opens Up About Her Sibling Rivalry Fears\n\n\n\nRELATED GALLERY: The Jenny Mollen and Jason Biggs Hilariously Honest Guide to Parenting\n\nOver the past six months, Mollen has been extremely open about her changing body, posting a variety of nude mirror selfies and joking, \u201cCan I keep the boobs?\u201d in the caption of one recent before-and-after shot.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s official! I\u2019ve outgrown the mirror,\u201d wrote the Live Fast Die Hot author on another naked snap, taken in a bathroom at 38 weeks pregnant.", "images":
