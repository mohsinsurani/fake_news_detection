Kris Jenner married Robert Kardashian in 1978 and they had four children before they divorced in 1991: Kourtney, Kim, Khlo\u00e9 and Robert Jr. She married Bruce Jenner (now identified as Caitlyn Jenner) that same year and started managing the family franchise. The couple had two daughters, Kendall and Kylie. In 2007, Keeping Up with the Kardashians aired, giving rise to several spin-offs and making the family multi-millionaires.\n\nEarly Years Jenner was born Kristen Mary Houghton on November 5, 1955, in San Diego, California. Her father, Robert Houghton, was an aircraft engineer. Jenner has one younger sister named Karen. When Jenner's parents divorced in 1962, her mother sold the family home in the Point Loma area of San Diego. Jenner, her mom and sister then moved to Clairemont, California, where Jenner attended Longfellow Elementary School. A year after her parents' divorce, Jenner developed a cancerous bone tumor. Fortunately, the cancer did not spread. After undergoing surgery to remove the tumor, Jenner was given a clean bill of health. A few years later, Jenner's mother remarried to businessman Harry Shannon. Three months after moving to Oxnard, California, Shannon's business partner ran off with all the company's money. As a result, the family moved back to San Diego. When Jenner graduated from Clairemont High School, she was far more interested in becoming a wife and mother than going to college.", "images":
