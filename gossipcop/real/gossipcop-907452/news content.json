Justin Timberlake gushed about having more children with wife Jessica Biel during an interview with Beats 1\u2018s Zane Lowe.\n\n\u201cI want to have as many kids as we can, if I\u2019m being honest,\u201d the \u201cFilthy\u201d singer, 36, said. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt more inept my life. You wake up and all of a sudden there\u2019s this human being you\u2019re responsible for.\u201d\n\nTimberlake and Biel, who tied the knot in Italy in 2012, are parents of son Silas, 2.\n\n\u201cEverybody tells you that your life is going to change and you\u2019re like, \u2018Whatever, I got it.\u2019 My wife and I \u2014 when we have a night off and we get into bed and we sit down and watch a movie or something, we\u2019re like, \u2018What did we do before this? Did we go out to dinner? Were we at a bar? What did we do before this?\u2019\u201d he adds. \u201cI feel like the success of parenthood is feeling like I failed all day today, but I get to wake up tomorrow and do it again \u2026 and hopefully they turn out to be a good human being.\u201d\n\nThe musician named his latest album, Man of the Woods, after his baby boy. As Us Weekly previously reported, the couple have always wanted to raise him out of the spotlight.\n\n\u201cJessica sees herself as a mom of boys, so it worked out perfectly,\u201d a source told Us shortly after they became first-time parents. \u201cJustin is so excited, he doesn\u2019t know what to do with himself!\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber", "Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/justin-timberlake-wants-as-many-kids-as-he-can-with-jessica-biel/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Wants \u2018as Many Kids\u2019 as He Can With Jessica Biel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Justin Timberlake opened up about fatherhood and wanting more kids with wife Jessica Biel \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Wants 'as Many Kids' as He Can With Jessica Biel", "description": "Justin Timberlake opened up about fatherhood and wanting more kids with wife Jessica Biel \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/justin-timberlake-wants-as-many-kids-as-he-can-with-jessica-biel/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-19T15:16:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-19T13:35:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-19T15:16:19+00:00"}, "author": "Stephanie Webber", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Timberlake Wants 'as Many Kids' as He Can With Jessica Biel", "description": "Justin Timberlake opened up about fatherhood and wanting more kids with wife Jessica Biel \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-kids.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516368905.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
