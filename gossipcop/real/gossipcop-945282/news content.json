While shooting The Late Late Show across the pond, Corden staged an Andrew Lloyd Webber-themed edition of the segment, featuring songs from some of the composer\u2019s best-known musicals.\n\n\u201cSo we\u2019re back. We\u2019re on home shores,\u201d says Corden, introducing the segment. \u201cThere are really only two events that everyone in Britain circled on their calendar this year. One, the royal wedding, which, you know, happened, and two, this: Crosswalk the Musical.\u201d\n\n\u201cGather around everyone. Gather around,\u201d Corden tells his theater troupe. \u201cTo commemorate our return to this greatest of isles, Great Britain, we will be celebrating the work and career of one of the true legends of the stage. None other than Mr. the Lord Lloyd Andrew Lloyd Webber.\u201d\n\nThe performers then crowd the legendary composer before Corden yells at them. He then curtsies in front of Lloyd Webber, who asks, \u201cWhat are you doing down there? Get up.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have Lloyd Andrew Lloyd Webber choose us to help him celebrate his 70th year is the icing on the icing on the cake. It\u2019s a cake with two icings, which sounds incredible,\u201d says Corden.\n\nHe explains that the group will perform a medley of songs from the composer. The host then realizes that he may have been saying Lloyd Webber\u2019s name wrong. \u201cI feel like I\u2019m saying it wrong. Is it Lloyd Lord Andrew Lloyd Webber?\u201d he asks. The composer responds, \u201cLord Lloyd.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo be honest, when James asked me if he could perform my musicals at the crosswalk I couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d says Lloyd Webber while Corden pushes a huge ball of red yarn as he trains the performers. \u201cI thought the production could use some youth and energy, so I\u2019ve asked the cast of my School of Rock musical to come by. I think James is going to absolutely love it.\u201d\n\nAfter watching the young cast perform, Corden appears unimpressed. \u201cYeah, we had to let them go. Attitude problems,\u201d he says.\n\nCorden later gives Lloyd Webber the opportunity to read the cast list, which reveals that Corden has been cast in all the main roles.\n\nThe first musical number the ensemble performs is from Evita. Corden wears a strapless white dress as he takes on the role of Eva Peron. Lloyd Webber can be seen watching the performance and holding a playbill on the sidewalk. The composer throws a bouquet of roses to the cast after the performance, at which Corden screams, \u201cHe\u2019s throwing them to me.\u201d\n\n\u201cPatti LuPone, Madonna, Elaine Paige and I don\u2019t want to say it, but I think James Corden is now top of that list, \u201d says Corden of his place among well-known actresses that played Eva Peron. Lloyd Webber later says, \u201cYeah, well, he\u2019s definitely bottom of the list.\u201d\n\nThe theater group then takes on a musical number from Cats. While preparing for the performance, they easily get distracted by a pedestrian\u2019s dog.\n\nThe group then performs a number from Phantom of the Opera. \u201cWhere\u2019s my Christine?\u201d asks Corden, who is dressed as the phantom. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a Christine. Who is playing Christine?\u201d\n\nIn desperate need of an actor for Christine, Corden calls in a favor. Josh Gad then shows up to help out. \u201cYou know, once you\u2019ve appeared in one Crosswalk the Musical, you become like a member of the company for life. We\u2019re like theatrical Navy SEALs,\u201d says the star of Crosswalk the Musical: Beauty and the Beast.\n\nFollowing the number, Lloyd Webber praises Gad\u2019s performance. \u201cJosh, you\u2019re gorgeous and marvelous,\u201d he says. A jealous Corden tells Gad he can leave.\n\nThe final performance by the group is \u201cAny Dream Will Do\u201d from Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat. The elaborate performance draws a positive review from Lloyd Webber. The group, including the composer, then take their final bow and receive a round of applause from the people stuck in traffic.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crosswalk_the_musical_andrew_lloyd_webber_classics_screen_shot-h_2018_0.jpg?w=768", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crosswalk_the_musical_andrew_lloyd_webber_classics_screen_shot-h_2018_0.jpg?w=768", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/james-corden-stages-andrew-lloyd-webber-themed-crosswalk-musical-london-1121396/", "title": "James Corden Stages Andrew Lloyd Webber-Themed \u201cCrosswalk the Musical\u201d in London", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "James Corden and Josh Gad staged an Andrew Lloyd Webber-themed edition of \"Crosswalk the Musical\" \u2014 performing songs from 'Evita,' 'Cats,' 'Phantom of the Opera' and 'Joseph and the Amazing Technicolor Dreamcoat' \u2014 during the 'Late Late Show's' return to London.", "news_keywords": "Andrew Lloyd Webber, international, James Corden, Late-Night TV, London Theater, The Late Late Show", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1121396, "title": "James Corden Stages Andrew Lloyd Webber-Themed \"Crosswalk the Musical\" in London", "published_at": "2018-06-19 12:38:06", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/crosswalk_the_musical_andrew_lloyd_webber_classics_screen_shot-h_2018_0.jpg?w=768", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The Late Late Show", "topics": "TV News", "body": "James Corden has brought \"Crosswalk the Musical\" to London.
