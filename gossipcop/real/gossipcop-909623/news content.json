The crew awarded include director Allen Hughes and producers Sarah Anthony, Fritzi Horstman, Broderick Johnson, Gene Kirkwood, Andrew Kosove, Laura Lancaster, Michael Lombardo, Jerry Longarzo, Doug Pray & Steven Williams.\n\nIn a year rife with quality music documentaries and series, the bar has been set high for this dynamic category. The Defiant Ones is a four-part HBO documentary telling the story of an unlikely duo taking the music business by storm seems better suited for fantastical pages of a comic book, but for engineer-turned-mogul Jimmy Iovine and super-producer Dr. Dre, it's all truth.The Defiant Ones recounts their histories, their tribulations and their wild success. These include first-hand accounts from those who were there in Iovine's early days, such as Bruce Springsteen and U2's Bono, as well as those on board when Dre and Iovine joined forces, such as Snoop Dogg and Eminem.\n\nThe competition was stiff as the category was filled with compelling films such as One More Time With Feeling, Two Trains Runnin', Soundbreaking, and Long Strange Trip.\n\nAttention Music Fans: Take The GRAMMY Challenge NOW On KIK And Facebook Messenger", "images": ["https://cdn.media.amplience.net/i/naras/grammy_award_logo.webp?w=175", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/facebook-icon", "https://cdn.media.amplience.net/i/naras/RA_Logo_black", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/twitter-icon", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/youtube-icon", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/search", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-870327426.jpg.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/2022-grammy-nominations-livestream-backgroundimage.jpg", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/2022-new-membership-class-recording-academy-announcement-updated", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/instagram-icon", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/glenn-danzig.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/grammys_setup-4434.jpg", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/show_photogallery_backstage_v01.jpg.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://naras.a.bigcontent.io/v1/static/connected", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-124702464.jpg.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/show_categoryarticles_bestmusicfilm.jpg.jpg?w=821&sm=c"], "top_img": "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-870327426.jpg.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.grammy.com/news/kelly-clarkson-dave-chappelle-more-present-2018-grammys", "title": "The Grammys", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index,follow", "googlebot": "index,follow", "description": "As the world&#039;s leading society of music professionals, the Recording Academy is dedicated to celebrating, honoring, and sustaining music&#039;s past, present, and future.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": {"identifier": "@RecordingAcad", "id": 17243213}, "url": "https://www.grammy.com/news/kelly-clarkson-dave-chappelle-more-present-2018-grammys"}, "og": {"title": "Kelly Clarkson, Dave Chappelle, More To Present At 2018 GRAMMYs", "description": "Tony Bennett, Alicia Keys, Nick Jonas, John Legend, Eve, Jim Gaffigan, Sarah Silverman also among those to present on Music's Biggest Night on Jan. 28", "url": "https://www.grammy.com/news/kelly-clarkson-dave-chappelle-more-present-2018-grammys", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://i8.amplience.net/i/naras/gettyimages-870327426.jpg.jpg?w=821&sm=c", "alt": "Kelly Clarkson", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "bingbot": "index,follow", "keywords": "undefined, grammy news, GRAMMY.com", "next-head-count": 24}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.grammy.com", "summary": ""}
