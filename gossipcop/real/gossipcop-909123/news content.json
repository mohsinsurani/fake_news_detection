Fifty Shades of Grey (2015) 'Most of your fear is in your head.' - Christian Grey (Fifty Shades of Grey) Click To Tweet\n\nChristian Grey: Business is about people, and I\u2019ve always been good at people. What motivates them, what incentivizes them, what inspires them.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Maybe you\u2019re just lucky.\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019ve always found that the harder I work, the more luck I seem to have. The key to my success has been in identifying talented individuals and harnessing their efforts.\n\nAnastasia Steele: So you\u2019re a control freak?\n\nChristian Grey: Oh, I exercise control in all things, Miss Steele.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Is that something that you feel passionate about? Feeding the world\u2019s poor?\n\nChristian Grey: It\u2019s smart business. You don\u2019t agree?\n\nAnastasia Steele: I don\u2019t know enough about it. I just wonder if perhaps your heart might be a bit bigger than you want to let on.\n\nChristian Grey: There\u2019s some people that say I don\u2019t have a heart, at all.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Why would they say that?\n\nChristian Grey: Because they know me well.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Are you gay? It\u2019s written here, I\u2019m just\u2026\n\nChristian Grey: No, Anastasia. I\u2019m not gay.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I apologize, Mr. Grey, Kate can be a little\u2026\n\nChristian Grey: Intrusive?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Curious\n\nChristian Grey: Why don\u2019t you ask me something that you want to know?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Earlier you said that there are some people who know you well. Why do I get the feeling that that is not true?\n\nChristian Grey: [moviequotesandmore.com] I would like to know more about you.\n\nAnastasia Steele: There\u2019s really not much to know about me.\n\nChristian Grey: You said you\u2019re an English major? Tell me, was it Charlotte Bront\u00eb, Jane Austen, or Thomas Hardy, who first made you fall in love with literature?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Hardy.\n\nChristian Grey: I would\u2019ve guessed Jane Austen.\n\nChristian Grey: We offer an excellent internship program.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I don\u2019t think I\u2019d fit in here. Look at me.\n\nChristian Grey: I am.\n\nKate: So? What was he like?\n\nAnastasia Steele: He was fine.\n\nKate: Fine? Just fine?\n\nAnastasia Steele: He was really polite, and he was courteous, and very formal, and clean.\n\nKate: Clean?\n\nAnastasia Steele: I mean, he was very, you know, smart, and intense. It was kind of intimidating. I can understand the fascination.\n\nKate: You have to admit, he\u2019s ridiculously hot.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I\u2019m sure if you are attracted to that sort of human, then\u2026\n\nKate: The hot type of human?\n\nAnastasia Steele: I asked him if he was gay. That was in your questions. Why would you do that to me?\n\nKate: Because whenever he\u2019s in the society pages, he\u2019s never been photographed with a woman. So, naturally\u2026\n\nAnastasia Steele: Well, maybe he just wants to keep his private life private, Kate.\n\nKate: And now you\u2019re defending him.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I\u2019m terminating this conversation.\n\nKate: Too bad we don\u2019t have some original stills of your hot, clean, twenty-seven year-old billionaire. The camera loves him almost as much as you do.\n\nChristian Grey: [moviequotesandmore.com] I thought it was you.\n\nAnastasia Steele: What the\u2026?\n\nChristian Grey: What a pleasant surprise, Miss Steele.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Just Ana. Just Ana. You\u2019re in here.\n\nChristian Grey: I was in the area on business, needed to pick up a few things. Are you free?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Yeah. What can I help you with?\n\nChristian Grey: Do you stock cable ties?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Cable ties, yes, we do. I can show you, if you want.\n\nChristian Grey: Please, lead the way, Miss Steele.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Just Ana.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Are you redecorating?\n\nChristian Grey: No.\n\nAnastasia Steele: We have two inch, and one inch. But the truly self-respecting handyman will have both in his tool box.\n\nChristian Grey: Of course he will.\n\nAnastasia Steele: It\u2019s rare to find a connoisseur these days. Do you want anything else?\n\nChristian Grey: Yes, rope.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Okay. Rope, tape, cable ties.

No.\n\nChristian Grey: I saw the way he was smiling at you.\n\nAnastasia Steele: No, Jose is more like family.

No!\n\nChristian Grey: [at the coffee shop] You seem nervous.\n\nAnastasia Steele: I find you intimidating.\n\nChristian Grey: You should.

She\u2019s an incurable romantic.\n\nChristian Grey: Are you?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Am I a romantic? Well, I study English Lit. So I kind of have to be.\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019m sorry, I can\u2019t.\n\nAnastasia Steele: What?\n\nChristian Grey: I\u2019ll walk you out.\n\nAnastasia Steele: Do you have a girlfriend, is that it?\n\nChristian Grey: I don\u2019t do the girlfriend thing.\n\nAnastasia Steele: What does that even mean?\n\nChristian Grey: [moviequotesandmore.com] I\u2019m not the man for you. You should steer clear of me. I have to let you go.\n\nAnastasia Steele: [feeling hurt] Goodbye, Mr. Grey.\n\nChristian Grey: [answers phone] Anastasia?\n\nAnastasia Steele: Yeah, this is me.

What\u2019s it called?\n\nAnastasia Steele: I don\u2019t know. I got to go though.\n\nChristian Grey: Which bar, Ana?\n\nAnastasia Steele: [ends the call, to the girl in line] I told him.
