The Honolulu-born Australian actress and Oscar winner, most recently nominated for her supporting role in \u201cLion,\u201d and the platinum-selling New Zealand-born country music superstar purchased the almost 36-acre, two-parcel spread in two 2007 transactions that totaled $2.45 million.\n\nA long drive meanders through a pristine stand of woods and swoops across an open field as it makes its way to the front of a red-brick residence with four bedrooms and four full and two half bathrooms in not quite 5,100 square feet. The traditional exterior belies the clean-lined, open-plan and decidedly modern interior spaces that include a steeply pitched vaulted and skylight-pierced ceiling in the living room, a stainless steel-accented fireplace in the family room and a window-lined dining room that flows into a galley-style kitchen with speckled granite counters on stainless steel cabinets.\n\nBedrooms are well separated for privacy, and include a top-floor master suite that comprises a sitting room, separate bedroom, luxury bathroom and immense walk-in closet perfect for a couple of frequent red-carpet walkers.
