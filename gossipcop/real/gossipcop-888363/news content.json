The foursome visited Universal Studios\u2019 Halloween Horror Nights on October 15.\n\n\u201cKylie and Kendall were both really loving and cuddly with their boyfriends,\u201d an onlooker told Us at the time. \u201cBoth couples were almost always holding hands or had their arms around each other.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time Kendall has been spotted at a Clippers game \u2014 she also sat courtside at the Staples Center on October 19.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re legit. They\u2019re a full-on couple,\u201d an insider told Us last month. \u201cKendall has been going to a lot of his games and they have been enjoying time at home when Blake is in town. They\u2019re good.\u201d\n\nKendall was previously linked to rapper A$AP Rocky, while Griffin and his fianc\u00e9e Brynn Cameron split in July. The exes share two children, son Ford, 4, and Finley, 14 months.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kendall-jenner-blake-griffin-clippers.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kendall-jenner-blake-griffin-clippers.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kendall-jenner-blake-griffin-clippers.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kendall-jenner-cheers-on-blake-griffin-at-clippers-game-in-l-a/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Cheers on Blake Griffin at Clippers Game in L.A.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kendall Jenner cheered on Blake Griffin at a Clippers game in L.A. on Saturday, November 4 \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kendall Jenner Cheers on Blake Griffin at Clippers Game in L.A.", "description": "Kendall Jenner cheered on Blake Griffin at a Clippers game in L.A. on Saturday, November 4 \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kendall-jenner-cheers-on-blake-griffin-at-clippers-game-in-l-a/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:12:23+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kendall-jenner-blake-griffin-clippers.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kendall-jenner-blake-griffin-clippers.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-05T23:19:41+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:12:23+00:00"}, "author": "Kathy Campbell", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kendall Jenner Cheers on Blake Griffin at Clippers Game in L.A.", "description": "Kendall Jenner cheered on Blake Griffin at a Clippers game in L.A. on Saturday, November 4 \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kendall-jenner-blake-griffin-clippers.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509923981.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
