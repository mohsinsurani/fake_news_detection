The actress took to Instagram to casually drop a cute AF Christmas photo on us all, showing off her love, Chris Adkins. \"Happy Holidays\" she simply wrote in the caption of the picture she shared where the couple looks oh so in love, smiling from ear to ear cuddling up next to each other in front of a Christmas tree.\n\nHow precious! The grown-ish star then took to her Instagram story to share a cute video of the pair hanging out in the snow together.\n\nSeriously so in love! So who is this lucky guy? Well, Chris happens to be a cinematographer on the show black-ish, and since grown-ish is the spinoff series of the ABC comedy series, it's only natural Francia and Chris met through their mutual connections, namely Yara Shahidi, who apparently helped the two get together. A source told E! News the pair has been dating for a few months now and added, \"she is very happy with him.\"\n\nFrancia had a rather intense 2017 since underwent surgery and donated one of her kidneys to her dear friend Selena Gomez. While recovering from the procedure, she has been busy working and now the premiere of grown-ish is right around the corner. So while she was saving her bestie's life and slaying the acting game, she managed to find love too. And if anyone deserves to have a great guy by her side, it's Francia. Who knows, maybe they'll go on double dates with Sel and Justin Bieber now. We can only hope, tbh.\n\nLove J-14?
