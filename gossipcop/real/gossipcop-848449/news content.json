He was engaged to real estate broker Danielle Piro, whom he\u2019d been with for six years.\n\nA family friend told us that Adam would \u201clight up a room, make everyone laugh and was always in for a good time,\u201d and that he and Jamie, 33, had always been very close and he\u2019d always been very supportive of her acting career.\n\nThe friend added that Adam was an \u201cincredible uncle and was loved by all his nieces and nephews. There was no one sweeter, kinder and more full of energy and spirit. There will be a hole in all our lives forever. Anyone who had the chance to be around Adam should be considered lucky.\u201d\n\n\u201cJamie-Lynn, along with her family, is thankful for everyone\u2019s love and support.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re told that Adam\u2019s death was sudden and he had shown no previous signs of health problems. He was found at home by his fianc\u00e9e after suffering the hemorrhage.\n\nThe friend added that the whole Sigler family was with Adam during his coma and at his bedside when he passed. A private family funeral will be held Sunday on Long Island.\n\nJamie-Lynn, who is engaged to Cutter Dykstra, with whom she has a 1-year-old son, Beau Kyle, reportedly changed her private Facebook photo to a picture of herself and Adam earlier this week.\n\n\u201cMy thoughts and prayers are with you and your family, Jamie,\u201d one commenter wrote, according to Us Weekly.\n\nAnother friend added: \u201cHolding you and your family close to my heart. Adam will always be a part of you.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/11/jamie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/11/jamie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=680", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2014/11/jamie.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=680", "keywords": [], "authors": ["November"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2014/11/13/jamie-lynn-siglers-brother-dies-after-brain-hemorrhage/", "title": "Jamie-Lynn Sigler\u2019s brother dies after brain hemorrhage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
