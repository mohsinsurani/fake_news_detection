The emperor of Bachelor Nation made a not-so-cryptic declaration about who won\u2019t be the next Bachelor, and things aren\u2019t looking good for the runner-up of The Bachelorette Season 13. On Thursday, Bachelor creator Mike Fleiss tweeted, \u201cDo we really want a Bachelor who isn't ready to settle down with a woman he loves? Hmmm. Not what #thebachelor is all about.\u201d Uh-oh. By \u201cisn\u2019t ready to settle down,\u201d does Fleiss mean \u201cisn\u2019t ready to propose at the end of a season of a dating competition series\u201d? Did Fleiss just rule out the possibility of Peter Kraus being the next Bachelor? Sure seems like it.\n\nFleiss wouldn\u2019t be the first person affiliated with the franchise to state that Kraus isn\u2019t a good fit for the program. On the finale of The Bachelorette Season 13, Rachel Lindsay said the following to Kraus: \u201cI just don't think this world, this show, is for you.\"\n\nWhy, oh why would Lindsay say such a thing? Probably because Kraus told Lindsay, like, a thousand times that he would not be ready to propose at the end of the season. And probably because the season finale proposal is a huge component of The Bachelor/ette.\n\nOutside of The Bachelor/ette universe, Kraus's refusal to propose isn't that weird; getting engaged to someone after only a few one-on-one dates could seem rushed. However, this is The Bachelor/ette, a program that ramps up to a proposal every season. Much like the phrase \"Can I steal you for a second?\" and group dates that involve performing choreography in front of a crowd, the possibility of a proposal is part of what contestants sign up for. It would sort of be like getting to the Project Runway finale, only to be like, \u201cEh, you know what? I\u2019m not ready for Fashion Week. I need more time. So, uh, you can cancel my runway show.\u201d\n\nAssuming Fleiss's tweet is indeed about Kraus, it seems like the show creator isn't raring to nominate the Wisconsin native for The Bachelor Season 22. On the bright side, there are a lot of other solid candidates for The Bachelor, including the darling Dean Unglert or the wonderful Eric Bigger. My TV set would happily give either of those gents a rose.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/17/2c784c49-ef25-44bf-8640-ecfb2e098d66-screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-30051-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/3/3de56b0e-adf0-4513-8559-4775d762203c-sierra-michael-header001.jpeg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/4/0c4a197a-7d19-46be-a461-81b263dcd152-164090_3997.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/4/1212d7a1-1506-4709-80a5-0059d5a9cc8c-peter-kelley-display001.jpeg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/5/e161b174-c882-4c81-8f46-3b1cc0867ade-163674_1140.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/17/2c784c49-ef25-44bf-8640-ecfb2e098d66-screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-30051-pm.png?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/8/17/2c784c49-ef25-44bf-8640-ecfb2e098d66-screen-shot-2017-08-17-at-30051-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/p/the-next-bachelor-wont-be-peter-kraus-if-this-tweet-is-to-be-believed-77356", "title": "The Next 'Bachelor' Won't Be Peter Kraus If This Tweet Is To Be Believed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@bustle", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bustledotcom"}, "og": {"site_name": "Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/p/the-next-bachelor-wont-be-peter-kraus-if-this-tweet-is-to-be-believed-77356", "type": "article", "title": "The Next 'Bachelor' Won't Be Peter Kraus If This Tweet Is To Be Believed", "description": "Red alert, Peter stans, because there is a potentially discouraging development regarding the next season of The Bachelor.
