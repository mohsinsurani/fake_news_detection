Read at your own risk!\n\nThe cliffhanger that\u2019s had Riverdale fans on edge all summer was finally answered in the season premiere: Luke Perry\u2019s Fred Andrews survived his gunshot wound. The father of Archie (KJ Apa) was touch-and-go for much of the episode but pulled through in the final moments. Not so lucky was Miss Grundy (Sarah Habel): Archie\u2019s music teacher and lover was shockingly killed in the final moments by the Black Hood.\n\nEW talked to Perry about surviving to season 2 and what Hiram\u2019s arrival means for Fred.\n\nENTERTAINMENT WEEKLY: When did you first learn Fred would be shot?\n\nLUKE PERRY: We were about three or four days into the episode and what [show creator and EP Roberto Aguirre-Sacasa] wanted to have happened at the end of the season, for various reasons, he wasn\u2019t able to get it together and had to come up with a new ending. He had to come up with something else and he came to me and he goes, \u201cThis is what I\u2019m thinking is going to be compelling.\u201d And I said, \u201cAlright!\u201d\n\nHe told me that he was planning on introducing Hiram but they couldn\u2019t find the right actor.\n\nYep, that was what it was. I was like, \u201cHey I know how this works: I saw Game of Thrones and people get their heads cut off on TV! You can\u2019t scare me! I\u2019m not afraid of that s\u2014, Roberto!\u201d That\u2019s what I said.\n\nDid he tell you that you would still be alive though?\n\nI didn\u2019t want him to tell me. I wanted him to leave the door open for what he creatively thought was best and if that means one thing then that\u2019s what it means and if it means something else then that\u2019s what it means. I like to take the creative chance and I don\u2019t like to operate from a place of fear. I was like, \u201cLet\u2019s see where this goes.\u201d\n\nHow did they keep this a secret in getting you on set? You have so much paparazzi now.\n\nThey\u2019ve been disguising me as Madelaine [Petsch, who plays Cheryl Blossom]. Long red wigs and stuff like that. I told them [the hair] needed to be long enough to cover the beard so we went with Mads.\n\nA Kiss Before Dying Credit: Dean Buscher/The CW\n\nThis whole episode reminded me of an old Beverly Hills, 90210 episode when Dylan crashed his Porsche and had all these weird dreams in the hospital. Was that an homage?\n\nI don\u2019t know. I never know with Roberto. He has such a comprehensive knowledge of television and the history thereof. It very well could have been. That episode was called \u201cThe Dreams of Dylan McKay\u201d \u2014 I remember that. It was like all his bad dreams were coming true for him.\n\nSo now that we know Fred is alive and awake, how will this change him?\n\nI think Fred is traumatized. I really do. I think he\u2019s sort of going through the motions and he hasn\u2019t connected back into what his life is. I can only imagine if something like that were to happen to you, you hit the pause button in your life and it makes you think about a lot of different things. He definitely comes out of it a different guy.\n\nWhat\u2019s his relationship going to be like with Hermione (Marisol Nichols) now that Hiram (Mark Consuelos) is back?\n\nWell you know with triangles they get a little pointy! That\u2019s what happens. We\u2019re gonna start digging into that here pretty soon. She\u2019s the one with the problem \u2014 she was the one who was married. I didn\u2019t do anything wrong.\n\nDo you know what the Black Hood\u2019s endgame is? He\u2019s clearly targeting people in the Andrews\u2019 circle based on Fred and the murder of Miss Grundy.\n\nI do not. Harkening back to a question you asked me earlier about how do we keep everything such a secret, Roberto keeps it a secret from us! I think again, with all the technologies and opportunities to have your story blown up today, he\u2019s protective over his material.\n\nRiverdale airs Wednesdays at 8 p.m. ET on The CW.", "images":
