Biv back into your wardrobe after a winter of greys and blacks. So why not move the color party north and opt for some brightly hued eyeliners for your peepers? Not too long ago, MObama herself embraced the colorful bounty of spring and lined her eyes in a steely blue. To help the Cut team realize their eyeliner shade soul mate, Sarah Jessica Parker\u2019s makeup artist, Leslie Lopez, swung by our office and painted up lids using liquid, cream, and pencil liners in all the colors of the rainbow. Read on to see who was plesantly surprised (and turned off) by this Crayola adventure.\n\nPhoto: Melissa Hom\n\nUrban Decay 24/7 Waterproof Liquid Eyeliner in Woodstock ($19)\n\nLeslie Lopez: \u201cAdding black pencil liner around the eye adds a bit more intensity and drama to the pink, which is a great way to wear this color.\u201d\n\nEmily Shornick, photo editor: \u201cOh, that\u2019s a lot of pink.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Melissa Hom\n\nMake Up For Ever Aqua Liner in 10 Iridescent Red ($23)\n\nLopez: \u201cThis is my least favorite color.\u201d\n\nAmelia Diamond, contributing fashion editor: \u201cUgh, it\u2019s a Halloween color. I was a devil one year and this is the color I would\u2019ve worn; I look like a member of the Volturi.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Melissa Hom\n\nMake Up For Ever Aqua Cream in 10 Orange ($23)\n\nLopez: \u201cI see brunettes wearing this color, that\u2019s why I chose it for her.\u201d\n\nVeronica Gledhill, senior market editor: \u201cI probably wouldn\u2019t rock this but it\u2019s not bad. I\u2019m a little surprised; it brings out the gold in my hazel eyes.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Melissa Hom\n\nMake Up For Ever Aqua Cream in 24 Yellow ($23)\n\nLopez: \u201cTo make the color pop more, apply the yellow shade just above your black liner. This is a nice way to wear colored liner if you\u2019re afraid to give up the black.\u201d\n\nTanzy Alfred, beauty intern: \u201cI like it, it reminds me of Nicki Minaj. It\u2019s not as scary as I thought it was going to look.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Melissa Hom\n\nNYX Slide On Pencil in SL06 Esmeralda ($8)\n\nLopez: \u201cThis is my favorite color so far. She has similar colored eyes so it actually looks almost like a neutral on her but it\u2019s a becoming color on anyone.\u201d\n\nRebecca Ramsey, fashion editor: \u201cI wouldn\u2019t normally pick it but it makes my eyes look bluer. It could be fun for a night out.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Melissa Hom\n\nEstee Lauder Pure Color Intense Kajal Eyeliner Duo ($23)\n\nLopez: \u201cIt\u2019s a very flattering color and can work on everyone.\u201d\n\nJulie Ma, assistant: \u201cIt looks really mod. It\u2019s definitely not a color I would\u2019ve ever picked up on my own but it\u2019s a refreshing pop of color for spring.\u201d\n\nPhoto: Melissa Hom\n\nMake Up For Ever Aqua Liner in 8 Iridescent Electric Purple ($23)\n\nLopez: \u201cThis is universal shade for all skin tones but especially for Charlotte, it makes the green come out in her hazel eyes.\u201d\n\nCharlotte Cowles, senior editor: \u201cI didn\u2019t notice it right away, it\u2019s weirdly subtle.\u201d", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/bdb/d5f/142952de626b61c1e5737f733c94db1113-02-eyeliner-orange.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1a5/2d1/3f096505a82ef24ac8d94a955064836f07-02-eyeliner-yellow.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/baf/c40/5d828d8eec98ade5df0b77fa3253ca7a82-02-eyeliner-red.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/313/d74/f9a955085a7abe36648f88cc09643741b2-02-eyeliner-purple.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3cb/961/1810c7e3b549ca5f5c502e70cd2b8bb121-02-eyeliner-blue.h473.w710.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/539/f6b/f776c635609037c0908414d67b24f29418-02-eyeliner-gif.rsquare.w700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/539/f6b/f776c635609037c0908414d67b24f29418-02-eyeliner-gif.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cca/620/59ae790166cb882715b6a339b91a0b29c6-02-eyeliner-green.h473.w710.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/231/100/00158681ba59782bbb62e783ed8810884e-02-eyeliner-pink.h473.w710.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/539/f6b/f776c635609037c0908414d67b24f29418-02-eyeliner-gif.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2013/04/try-a-rainbow-of-colored-eyeliners-for-spring.html", "title": "A Rainbow of Colored Eyeliners to Try for Spring", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "beauty, colored eye liner, urban decay, make up for ever, liquid eye liner, estee lauder, nyx, michelle obama, mobama, featuretype:feature", "og": {"title": "A Rainbow of Colored Eyeliners to Try for Spring", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2013/04/try-a-rainbow-of-colored-eyeliners-for-spring.html", "description": "Take a break from the browns and blacks with the staff of the Cut", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/539/f6b/f776c635609037c0908414d67b24f29418-02-eyeliner-gif.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "A Rainbow of Colored Eyeliners to Try for Spring", "description": "Take a break from the browns and blacks with the staff of the Cut", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/539/f6b/f776c635609037c0908414d67b24f29418-02-eyeliner-gif.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "description": "Take a break from the browns and blacks with the staff of the Cut", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "article": {"tag": "beauty, colored eye liner, urban decay, make up for ever, liquid eye liner, estee lauder, nyx, michelle obama, mobama", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "sailthru.tags": "beauty, colored eye liner, urban decay, make up for ever, liquid eye liner, estee lauder, nyx, michelle obama, mobama", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
