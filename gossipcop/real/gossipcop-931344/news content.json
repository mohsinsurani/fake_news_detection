Now, they\u2019re back together \u2014 and Patridge can\u2019t help but gush about rekindling her romance with the musician.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019m the happiest I\u2019ve ever been right now,\u201d she told PEOPLE on Sunday at Shiseido\u2019s summer kick-off event in Malibu. \u201cYou know, things are going really good.\u201d\n\nJennifer Johnson\n\nAudrina Patridge kicked off summer with the new Shiseido Sun products at the Shiseido Sun Beach House in Malibu on June 2.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re just having fun. Nothing is forced,\u201d she continued. \u201cYou know, great things happen when it\u2019s not forced, and things are naturally just happening. And that\u2019s what it is. We just have the best time together.\u201d\n\nSo what\u2019s a typical date night like for the couple?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t really have a lot of date nights, because I\u2019m always with [my daughter] Kirra, and Ryan is touring a lot,\u201d she explained. \u201cBut we just do a lot of group things and hang out.\u201d\n\nCabo Pictures\n\nAudrina Patridge and Ryan Cabrera\n\nPatridge, 33, and Cabrera, 35,reconciled eight months after she filed for divorce from estranged husband Corey Bohan, 36, whom she married in Hawaii in November 2016. They share daughter Kirra Max, who will turn 2 later this month.\n\nPatridge requested a temporary restraining and child abduction prevention orders against the professional BMX biker on Sept. 18; she filed for divorce two days later. A judge granted the former reality star full custody of Kirra. Bohan was given visitation rights, with drop-offs to occur at a police station and conversations between the parents to be held through the communication service Talking Parents.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Audrina Patridge Granted Full Custody of Daughter Kirra Max After Split from Corey Bohan\n\nOn Sunday, Patridge told PEOPLE that she\u2019s waiting for her ex to sign the divorce papers.\n\n\u201cHe won\u2019t sign them,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t know. We\u2019ll see what happens. It is what it is. The best thing that came from that was Kirra, and I\u2019m so thankful for that.\u201d\n\n\u201cKirra is so amazing,\u201d Patridge continued. \u201cShe talks so much, she understands everything. I got her into dance and tumbling, she loves it.\u201d\n\nThis summer, the reality TV alum said she plans on spending plenty of time at the beach with her little one \u2014 and expect her to pile on the Shiseido sunblock. (Her favorite product is the Clear Stick UV Protector WetForce SPF 50+.)\n\n\u201cWhenever I go surfing at the beach or I go to the river and you\u2019re in and out of the water all day, you don\u2019t have to reapply makeup or sunblock \u2014 it literally just stays on,\u201d she said. \u201cPlus, Kirra loves the beach, so we\u2019ve already been a few times.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe has to get used to the sand,\u201d she added. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t like it at first, and then she loves it. She builds sandcastles. We just bring a bunch of toys and balls and she runs in and out of the water.\u201d", "images":
