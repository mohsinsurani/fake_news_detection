Over the course of the week, the organization has rescued over 200 dogs, cats and other pets, working to find them food and shelter.\n\nThe effort began on Monday, when trucks from the foundation left for Houston to start the rescue mission.\n\n\"It was important to our AMAZING founder, @mirandalambert that we do our part for her home state!\" MuttNation Foundation wrote on Instagram.\n\nLambert joined the team to help with relief efforts, and has posted social media updates throughout the week.
