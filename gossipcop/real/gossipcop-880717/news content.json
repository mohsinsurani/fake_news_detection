Jessica Simpson bragged about her husband, Eric Johnson, while wishing him a happy birthday on Instagram on Tuesday, Sept. 15.\n\nIn honor of the former football player's 36th birthday, the songstress-turned-fashion-designer-turned-mogul, 35, posted a black and white snap of her man looking sexy in a white linen button-down with the caption: \u201cMy husband is hotter than yours! Happy Birthday Eric Maxwell Johnson! You forever make me lust.\u201d\n\nThe parents to daughter Maxwell Drew, 3, and son Ace, 2, first stepped out together in May 2010 and got engaged that November. In July 2014, the two tied the knot in an intimate wedding at San Ysidro Ranch in Montecito, Calif.\n\nDuring an interview with Matt Lauer in September 2014, the businesswoman gushed that she\u2019s more in love than ever with Johnson.\n\n\"I just think we're a little bit more addicted to each other,\" Simpson said of married life. \"I just think there is a level of love that has reached the highest of high.\"\n\n\"Eric and I have both been married before, so we took our time finding the right person,\u201d she explained, referring to her ex-husband, Nick Lachey. \u201cWhen we found each other, we knew it had to be forever.\"", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1442367078_eric-johnson-jessica-simpson-zoom.jpg?w=1600&h=900&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1442367078_eric-johnson-jessica-simpson-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1442367078_eric-johnson-jessica-simpson-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-brags-about-hot-husband-eric-johnson-in-birthday-post-2015159/", "title": "Jessica Simpson Brags About Hot Husband Eric Johnson in Birthday Post", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Just Like Us", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jessica Simpson bragged about her hot husband, Eric Johnson, while wishing him a happy birthday on Tuesday, Sept. 15 \u2014 see her post", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jessica Simpson to the World: \"My Husband Is Hotter Than Yours!\"", "description": "Jessica Simpson bragged about her hot husband, Eric Johnson, while wishing him a happy birthday on Tuesday, Sept. 15 \u2014 see her post", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jessica-simpson-brags-about-hot-husband-eric-johnson-in-birthday-post-2015159/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T05:44:02+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1442367078_eric-johnson-jessica-simpson-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1442367078_eric-johnson-jessica-simpson-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2015-09-16T02:12:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T05:44:02+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jessica Simpson to the World: \"My Husband Is Hotter Than Yours!\"", "description": "Jessica Simpson bragged about her hot husband, Eric Johnson, while wishing him a happy birthday on Tuesday, Sept. 15 \u2014 see her post", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/1442367078_eric-johnson-jessica-simpson-178.jpg?w=300&h=178&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1442369559.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
