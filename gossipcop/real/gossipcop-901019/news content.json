Well, she only does one impression, but it's really, really good.\n\nThe starlet stopped by The Tonight Show to talk about the latest installment in the Pitch Perfect movie franchise, when host Jimmy Fallon brought up the subject of her one killer impression.\n\n\"I do one impression, and it's the weirdest impression, too. I should have like a Christopher Walken or something, and I have a Kristen Stewart. I don't why,\" Kendrick told Fallon. \"I love her and I\u2019ve done it to her and she was like 'oh yeah, I do that with my mouth.'\"\n\nGrinning, Fallon requested that Kendrick do an impression of the Twilight actress while explaining the plot of Pitch Perfect 3.\n\n\"Um you know, there\u2019s like. The Bellas are out of college, and um, you know,\" Kendrick as Kristen says out of the corner of her mouth while brushing her hair out of her face nervously. \"Uh, they go on a USO tour and there\u2019s like, you know, hilarity ensues... so.\"\n\nWatch Kendrick's uncanny Kristen Stewart impression in the video above.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121817-anna-kendrick.jpg?itok=U16e4le8", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/12/121817-anna-kendrick.jpg?itok=C899GT2D", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121817-anna-kendrick.jpg?itok=U16e4le8", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meghan Overdeep"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852/http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kendricks-kristen-stewart-impression", "title": "Anna Kendrick's Impression of Kristen Stewart Is So Spot-On", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "News,Celebrity,TV Shows,Anna Kendrick,Jimmy Fallon", "news_keywords": "anna kendrick, anna kendrick tonight show, anna kendrick jimmy fallon interview, anna kendrick kristen stewart impression", "description": "Anna Kendrick stopped by The Tonight Show\u00a0to talk about the latest installment in the Pitch Perfect movie franchise, when host\u00a0Jimmy Fallon\u00a0brought up the subject of her Kristen Stewart impression.", "og": {"title": "Anna Kendrick's Impression of Kristen Stewart Is So\u00a0Spot-On", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852/http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kendricks-kristen-stewart-impression", "description": "Nailed it!", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121817-anna-kendrick.jpg?itok=U16e4le8"}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kendricks-kristen-stewart-impression", "description": "Anna Kendrick stopped by The Tonight Show\u00a0to talk about the latest installment in the Pitch Perfect movie franchise, when host\u00a0Jimmy Fallon\u00a0brought up the subject of her Kristen Stewart impression.", "media": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121817-anna-kendrick.jpg?itok=U16e4le8"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kendricks-kristen-stewart-impression", "title": "Anna Kendrick's Impression of Kristen Stewart Is So\u00a0Spot-On", "description": "Nailed it!", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121817-anna-kendrick.jpg?itok=U16e4le8"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171222115852if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/azVAxbETWmk?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
