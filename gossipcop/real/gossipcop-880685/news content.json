Brown has become a household name in the past few years thanks to his work in high-profile projects like \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d \u201cThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story\u201d and \u201cBlack Panther.\u201d\n\nBut to hear the 41-year-old star talk about his 10-year marriage to fellow actor Ryan Michelle Bathe, you realize he\u2019s also been lucky in love for a long time.\n\nListed below are seven things you might not have known about this adorable couple.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BN68v4JjOgf/?taken-by=sterlingkbrown\n\n1. They Met In College\n\nBoth Bathe and Brown were in the same year at Stanford, and even lived in the same dorm as freshmen, according to The Stanford Daily! They were also friends who performed in campus productions together before they started dating.\n\nWhen they got to know each other at college they discovered they were both from St. Louis, Missouri, and had even been born at the same hospital. Small world! The pair went on to grad school together at New York University.\n\nGetty Images | Frazer Harrison\n\n2. She Was Hard To Get\n\nAccording to what Brown told \u201cThe Talk,\u201d he and Bathe \u201cdated off and on\u201d for a while before breaking up for more than three years at one point. When Brown decided to finally try to win her back, he did things including chasing after her while she was jogging so he could convince her she was the love his life.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OsGff2p0kdI\n\n3. They Have Two Cute Kids\n\nLike his character, Randall Pearson, from NBC\u2019s \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d Brown has two kids with his college-sweetheart wife. But, instead of two girls, they have two boys: 6-year-old Andrew and 2-year-old Amare. Bathe and Brown have shared cute stories about their sons, like how Andrew wants to be a scientist and has quite a personality. Just check out his moves below in a video Brown shared on Instagram!\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYM-T-UHETO/?utm_source=ig_embed\n\n4. She Gave Birth At Home\n\nAccording to Brown, when Andrew came, Bathe had such a quick labor that she ended up just giving birth at home, with him helping her deliver their son. They told the story on the red carpet at the 2018 Golden Globe Awards and it\u2019s pretty hilarious.\n\n5. They Both Love Their Jobs\n\nBrown may be the breakout star of \u201cThis Is Us,\u201d but Bathe also has had a recurring role on the hit show. In the first season, she played Yvette, a black woman who first appeared in a memorable flashback scene at the public pool, advising Randall\u2019s adoptive mother Rebecca on how to properly take care of his hair.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t the first time the couple appeared onscreen together. Brown played the only male military spouse among the main cast of Lifetime\u2019s \u201cArmy Wives.\u201d And, in the show\u2019s sixth season, Bathe played the partner of an active duty soldier. They also appeared together in an episode of \u201cHarry\u2019s Law.\u201d However, the two apparently avoid rehearsing together, as they\u2019ve told E!.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve learned that there are certain minefields and pitfalls in our relationship that, like a slalom, we just move right on past them,\u201d Bathe told the network in 2017. \u201cAnd rehearsing together is one of those things.\u201d\n\nGetty Images | Mike Coppola\n\n6. They Laugh A Lot\n\nBrown told Essence that a key to their marriage is that he and Bathe \u201ccrack each other up constantly!\u201d Brown is apparently a pretty funny guy when he\u2019s not making us cry \u2026 which is basically all the time.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZFw-C0HJWf/?taken-by=sterlingkbrown\n\n7. They Surround Themselves With Support\n\nBrown told ABC News that its key for his marriage that they have a community of people around them that supports he and Bathe. \u201cOne thing that I\u2019ve learned for any relationship to be successful is the people who are part of your life, they have to champion your union,\u201d he said. \u201cNot just you, not just her. They have to champion y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nGetty Images | Dimitrios Kambouris\n\n8. They Clearly Admire One Another\n\nBrown says the sweetest things about Bathe in his award acceptance speeches. For example, at the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards, he gave a speech where he said, \u201cI love actors so much, I decided to marry one. Ryan Michelle Bathe, you\u2019re the best scene partner a brother\u2019s ever had.\u201d\n\nAnd when he was loudly played off the stage at the 2017 Emmys before finishing his speech, he made sure he thanked Bathe backstage.\n\nAnd Bathe seems like she couldn\u2019t be prouder of Brown\u2019s accomplishments.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BKg8OJYhOiI/?taken-by=ryanmichelleb\n\nSo put Bathe and Brown up there with celebrity couples who make marriage look pretty darn good.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20998'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/902324134_sterling-k-brown-e1520473478261-750x484.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_59499035-120x120.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-905422902.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_15907096-120x120.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ic_scripps.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20110'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/908541874_ryan-michelle-bathe.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/908548770_bathe-brown.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20750%20484'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201000'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AdobeStock_197077261-120x120.jpeg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cropped-cropped-simplemost_logo550new.png"], "top_img": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/GettyImages-905422902.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.simplemost.com/inside-sterling-k-brown-ryan-michelle-bathes-marriage/", "title": "Inside Sterling K.
