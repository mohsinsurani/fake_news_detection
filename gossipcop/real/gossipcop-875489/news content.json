Artisan hand-baked clay tiles as a kitchen backsplash and a bathroom exhaust fan that turns on and off through a sensor.\n\nA barn door on the master bedroom closet and upper kitchen cabinets that lower to the counter with the touch of a button, eliminating the need for a step stool.\n\nRustic-tech chic is hot, particularly with millennials who like the yin and yang approach to home decorating.\n\nEvery year, interior designers, architects, real estate professionals and home builders pour into Las Vegas to view the latest trends at the International Builders Show, the Kitchen and Bath Industry Show and the Consumer Electronics Show.\n\nWhile they\u2019re checking out ideas for the future, these industry pros attempt to match what they see to the personality of their local market and to upcoming home buyers, particularly millennials.\n\nSome of the design trends seen around the country that particularly resonate with millennials may seem contradictory: these buyers want modern, sleek lines in their homes, yet they also love rustic looks. Millennials love natural materials such as wood and stone but are also drawn to coloured lights that can turn a shower into purple rain. Smart home technology is revered, but so are artisanal items that can add a curated look to their homes.\n\nBarn doors seem to crop up more and more often in new or remodelled homes, sometimes as sliding doors to define spaces but allowing them to be entirely open and other times in smaller iterations such as a closet or pantry door.\n\n\u201cFarmhouse sinks and mix-and-match faucet handles were everywhere at the Kitchen and Bath show,\u201d says Stacy DeBroff, a brand strategist and chief executive of Influence Central in Boston. \u201cOne company at the intersection of rustic style and innovation is Stikwood, which takes recycled wood and turns it into peel-and-stick natural wood siding.\u201d\n\nSusan Matus, director of project development at Case Design/Remodeling in Bethesda, Maryland, says Stikwood could be used on one wall as a focal point or in a mudroom or laundry room.\n\n\u201cThat kind of rustic look is turning up unexpectedly in places where you want to mix textures such as natural wood next to something shiny and sleek,\u201d Matus says.\n\nJulia Walter, showroom manager at Boffi Georgetown, an Italian luxury kitchen and bath designer, says Boffi displays rustic wood shelves with a modern shape, metal sinks and big mirrors.\n\nThe new generation of homeowners are remodelling spaces with classic features, such as a fireplace (Geoffrey Hogdon)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a trend to combine reclaimed wood with a contemporary steel frame,\u201d Walter says. \u201cIt\u2019s an interesting play between old and new. People like contemporary lines, but they want the warmth of bringing in an older element into their home, especially the kitchen where people have an emotional connection with their childhood kitchen.\u201d\n\nOn the opposite end of the spectrum from natural wood are coloured LED lights, which are turning up in gas fireplaces, kitchens and even bathrooms.\n\n\u201cColoured lights that you can control with an app were everywhere at the Vegas shows from gas fireplaces to above-kitchen cabinets to around the rim of a shower,\u201d DeBroff says. \u201cThey had shower heads with lights so that you can take a purple shower or a red shower on a whim. Essentially, you can make a space really cool that isn\u2019t otherwise all that interesting.\u201d\n\nWhile shower heads with coloured lights are already available on Amazon, DeBroff says that high-end toilets are being designed with a built-in night light that illuminates the water in the bowl. She anticipates that in a year or so consumers will be able to find an attachment that adds that feature to regular toilets.\n\nPops of colour are turning up in the kitchen, too, with small household appliances and pots and pans manufactured in a wide range of colours. Larger kitchen appliances in bright colours and pastels are available from manufacturers, says Danielle Procopio, a real estate agent and certified home staging consultant with Coldwell Banker Residential Brokerage in Hinsdale, Illinois. But she doesn\u2019t see that as much of a trend yet, in part because they are much costlier than appliances with standard finishes.\n\n\u201cThe most popular colour schemes in the kitchen right now are dark cabinets with a light counter top,\u201d Procopio says. \u201cAt the Kitchen and Bath show, they were showing bright green and blue cabinets, but most people are sticking with standard colour palettes.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne client has a house with a very simple, clean white kitchen but with a bright yellow oven, but that\u2019s very unusual,\u201d Walter says. She says she\u2019s seeing more use of warm colours in the kitchen such as olive green and different shades of beige in combination with wood.\n\nHandmade items or artistic features bring in an element of personalisation that appeals to many millennials, DeBroff says.\n\nIntroducing a unique piece of art to your home decor can be costly, but DeBroff found affordable tempered glass bowls from MR Direct that can transform an ordinary bathroom into a museum-quality space.\n\n\u201cThese hand-blown glass bowls cost $79 (\u00a357) or $119 if you buy a faucet with them, but they look far more expensive and are a budget-friendly way to personalise your space,\u201d DeBroff says.\n\nMatus says manufacturers are making more multidimensional tiles with a pyramid-type shape or with a wave pattern for visual interest.\n\n\u201cThere are lots of interesting ways to use tile now, including making a rustic wall in your kitchen from artisan hand-baked clay tiles that have kind of ancient character but can look very modern,\u201d Walter says. \u201cYou can also find mosaic tiles that can be installed by the sheet.\u201d\n\nMillennials love natural materials but are also drawn to coloured lights and smart home technology (Stacy Debroff)\n\nColourful and artistic touches can be used to relieve the sea of grey and white in new homes, but millennials still want most of their homes to have clean lines and modern style.\n\nLarge tiles for your floors and walls allow you to have a cleaner look with less grout, Walter says. In some cases, the tiles are so large they can be seamlessly installed to look like one monolithic floor.\n\nMatus says younger buyers still like crown mouldings, but they prefer simple streamlined styles near the ceiling and opt not to include chair rail mouldings or wainscoting.\n\n\u201cIn homes with an open floor plan, a lot of buyers want an extremely clean-looking kitchen with less visible sinks, faucets and appliances,\u201d Walter says. \u201cMost appliances in these homes are fully integrated and look built-in. Part of having an open kitchen is treating that area like furniture so that you have an overall connection with the living area.\u201d\n\n\u201cMillennials definitely like a clean look that\u2019s more transitional or modern than traditional,\u201d says Michael Merschat, design studio manager and architect with Wentworth Inc in Chevy Chase, Maryland. \u201cIf you show them a cabinet with mouldings on it they\u2019ll ask how to clean it and then choose something with a cleaner, sleeker look.\u201d\n\nWhile stainless-steel appliances continue to be popular, new variations with a matte finish or slightly darker tone make them easier to keep clean and free of fingerprints, Procopio says. The good news is that the new stainless-steel appliances blend with older stainless finishes so you don\u2019t have to replace everything at once.\n\nAnother innovation that keeps your kitchen looking less cluttered is the installation of an electrical outlet strip hidden under your cabinets that includes USB ports as well as standard outlets, Judy says.\n\n\u201cTechnology can be used to simplify the way your home functions and looks,\u201d Matus says. \u201cEven the new door locks that can be operated remotely from your phone are starting to look more beautiful instead of like a big clunky keypad. Things like Sonos wireless speakers can be used to keep your rooms clear of clutter, and they\u2019re portable for entertaining outside.\u201d\n\nTechnology can simplify your life, too, Matus says, with items such as new bathroom exhaust fans from Panasonic that are controlled by a sensor that turns them off and on according to the steam in the room.\n\nThe Nest thermostat, which \u201clearns\u201d your pattern of using heat and air conditioning, is at the intersection of technology and sustainability that appeals to millennials, Judy says.\n\n\u201cMillennials are looking for highly efficient appliances to reduce their energy use and want to use sustainable and natural materials everywhere they can,\u201d he says.\n\nCounters made of engineered stone or recycled materials such as quartz and Caesarstone are environmentally friendly and yet also easy to maintain, both aspects of which appeal to millennials.\n\nA priority that transcends generations is the desire for an organised home with plenty of storage (Geoffrey Hogdon)\n\n\u201cMillennials consider sustainability in every sense of the word,\u201d Merschat says. \u201cEnvironmental impact is driving the selection of materials, but they are also concerned about durability and functionality of the things they buy. For example, a lot of people love the way Cararra marble counters look, but they realise that it stains easily, so they are willing to turn to man-made materials that are similarly beautiful but are a better fit for their lifestyle.\u201d\n\nOne home priority that transcends generations is the desire for an organised home with efficient and abundant storage space.\n\n\u201cMillennials are likely to be intrigued by the new kitchen designs that come with a complete built-in organisation system so there\u2019s a place for knives, spices and every speciality kitchen gadget,\u201d DeBroff says. \u201cAnother cool innovation are cupboards that lower down to the counter with the push of a button so you don\u2019t need a step stool to reach everything.\u201d\n\nDeBroff says that with the advent of Pinterest and Instagram, millennials have high expectations for their organised spaces to be visually beautiful.\n\nProcopio says automated shelving and stacked drawers that slide back to reveal a second layer are particularly appealing to young people who may be buying a smaller home in the city or inner suburbs.\n\nNewly built homes, particularly small but costly condos, feature built-in closet organisers and extra storage in unexpected spaces such as a handful of built-in drawers next to a laundry closet.\n\n\u201cA lot of city homes have smaller bathrooms, so we offer solutions like integrated or hidden cabinets that have storage space but don\u2019t interrupt the clean lines of the room,\u201d Walter says. \u201cIn the kitchen, we have three- or four-feet-wide cabinets with pocket doors as a designated breakfast prep area so you can close it off and not see the coffee maker, toaster and juicer out on the counter.\u201d\n\nThe open floor plan popular with many buyers today leads some to want a more organised kitchen, since that space is frequently on display to guests and to the family when they are eating or relaxing in the adjacent living and dining area.\n\n\u201cA lot of families want a family command centre or tech space near the kitchen but a little separate since those spaces can be messy,\u201d Matus says. \u201cIf there\u2019s space, they want a highly organised mudroom or laundry room on the first floor. If you live in a smaller place, the key is to have extremely well-organised closets with shelves and cubbies in your bedrooms, your bathrooms, your home office and your kitchen.\u201d\n\nIn larger homes, millennials opt for personalised storage solutions when remodelling a home. For example, Merschat recently built a wall of cabinets, including an L-shaped bench for storage and seating and a special cabinet for riding boots for a family that enjoys equestrian activities.\n\n\u201cMost millennials don\u2019t want an old-school mudroom with a washer and dryer,\u201d Merschat says. \u201cThey want a more organised space for the entire family, including lower hooks for their kids to hang up their own jackets and backpacks.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Washington Post", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/18/10/washington-post.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/18/10/washington-post.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/18/10/washington-post.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michele Lerner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/millennials-interior-trends-home-design-top-wood-stone-purple-rain-a8160916.html", "title": "The top interior design trends for millennials", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "From hand-baked clay tiles to LED lights that can turn your shower into purple rain, a yin and yang approach to home decorating is favoured by Generation Y", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-01-19T00:00:01.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The top interior trends for millennials", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/millennials-interior-trends-home-design-top-wood-stone-purple-rain-a8160916.html", "type": "article", "description": "From hand-baked clay tiles to LED lights that can turn your shower into purple rain, a yin and yang approach to home decorating is favoured by Generation Y", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/18/10/washington-post.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/18/10/washington-post.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-19T00:00:01.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-19T00:00:01.000Z", "section": "News", "author_name": "Michele Lerner", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 2056, "image_count": 4, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2018-01-19T00:00:01.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "The top interior trends for millennials", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "From hand-baked clay tiles to LED lights that can turn your shower into purple rain, a yin and yang approach to home decorating is favoured by Generation Y", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/18/10/washington-post.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "interior design,Millennials,Homes,Washington Post"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516320001.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
