Harry Styles gave James Corden a kiss during a Christmas-themed \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segment on The Late Late Show on Monday, December 11.\n\nThe late-night host, 39, enlisted several of his Carpool Karaoke guests from the past year \u2014 including Pink, Miley Cyrus, Bruno Mars, Sam Smith, Kelly Clarkson and Fifth Harmony \u2014 to sing a fun-filled rendition of the Christmas classic \u201cSanta Claus Is Comin\u2019 to Town.\u201d\n\nThe holiday sketch kicked off with Corden and musician Reggie Watts, who leads the Late Late Show\u2019s house band, cruising around Los Angeles. \u201cThe great thing about this time of year is I feel like it\u2019s the only time we\u2019re not judged for driving to work dressed like this,\u201d quipped the British star, who was clad in a red Santa hat and a Christmas sweater.\n\nAfter singing the tune with his many guests, Corden turned to Styles, 23, and said, \u201cHappy Christmas, Harold.\u201d The former One Direction singer initially stayed silent but smirked slightly. He then leaned in to kiss Corden on the lips, placing one of his hands on the comedian\u2019s cheek and wrapping the other around his head.\n\n\u201cWow, I did not expect that for Christmas,\u201d the TV personality said with a laugh.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the fellow Brits have locked lips. During a 2013 episode of the U.K. game show A League of Their Own, the \u201cKiwi\u201d singer gave Corden a lengthy smooch on the lips during a scripted kiss cam segment.\n\nThe Late Late Show With James Corden airs on CBS weeknights at 12:35 a.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/james-corden-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/james-corden-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/harry-styles-kisses-james-corden-in-christmas-carpool-karaoke/", "title": "Harry Styles Kisses James Corden in Christmas \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Holidays With Us", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Harry Styles gave James Corden a kiss on the lips in the late-night host\u2019s Christmas-themed \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019 segment on Monday, December 11 \u2014 watch", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Harry Styles Kiss James Corden in Christmas \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019", "description": "Harry Styles gave James Corden a kiss on the lips in the late-night host\u2019s Christmas-themed \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019 segment on Monday, December 11 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/harry-styles-kisses-james-corden-in-christmas-carpool-karaoke/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:10:54+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/james-corden-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/james-corden-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-12T14:31:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:10:54+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch Harry Styles Kiss James Corden in Christmas \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019", "description": "Harry Styles gave James Corden a kiss on the lips in the late-night host\u2019s Christmas-themed \u2018Carpool Karaoke\u2019 segment on Monday, December 11 \u2014 watch", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/james-corden-zoom1.jpg?crop=0px%2C45px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513089065.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
