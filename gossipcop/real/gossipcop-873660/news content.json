(The two singers have some bad blood.)\n\nKandyba said he did practice sketching Swift ahead of time, but it can be more difficult creating a still image in his mind of a person who is moving around.\n\n\"It's hard. Some people are just much easier to draw than others,\" Kandyba said. \"If you give me somebody with a beard and glasses \u2014 bingo \u2014 got it.\"", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5cc327b3b14bf47f1119f04a?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Acuna"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/taylor-swift-courtroom-sketches-too-pretty-2017-8", "title": "Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible", "datePublished": "2017-08-15T16:27:52Z", "dateModified": "2017-08-15T16:27:55Z", "news_keywords": "Taylor Swift, Courtroom, Taylor Swift trial, Sketches, Kirsten Acuna", "description": "The artist behind the courtroom sketches of Taylor Swift says it's difficult to draw a person who has \"perfectly proportioned dimensions on the face.\"", "author": "Kirsten Acuna", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Insider", "og": {"title": "Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible", "description": "The artist behind the courtroom sketches of Taylor Swift says it's difficult to draw a person who has \"perfectly proportioned dimensions on the face.\"", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-courtroom-sketches-too-pretty-2017-8", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d17?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Here's why those Taylor Swift courtroom drawings were so terrible", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-15", "sailthru.tags": "Taylor Swift, Courtroom, Taylor Swift trial, Sketches, Kirsten Acuna", "sailthru.description": "The artist behind the courtroom sketches of Taylor Swift says it's difficult to draw a person who has \"perfectly proportioned dimensions on the face.\"", "sailthru.author": "Kirsten Acuna", "sailthru.verticals": "insider", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d18?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5993212b0dafe82dba3b9d18?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"bii-imgalt": "taylor swift sketch courtroom"}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/taylor-swift-courtroom-sketches-too-pretty-2017-8?fbia"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"newsletter-email-input": "control"}, "ii-split-test": {"bii-media-show-lock": "variant", "ii-finance-email-lock": "variant", "ii-retail-show-lock": "variant"}, "viking-id": "5993212d0dafe82dba3b9d1d", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2021-08", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502751600.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
