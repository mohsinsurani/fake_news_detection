(Season six wraps Thursday with the series on the verge of electing Bellamy Young\u2019s former first lady Mellie Grant as its new president.)\n\n\u201cI do think that audiences, especially fans and Gladiators, who are as loyal to Scandal as they have been, are going to want the story to end in the way that Shonda intended to,\u201d said Dungey. \u201cThat was a decision she felt really good about, and we support wholeheartedly.\u201d\n\nAn episode count for Scandal, which returns in the fall, has not yet been determined.\n\n\u201cDeciding how to end a show is easy,\u201d said Rhimes in a statement Tuesday following the press call. \u201cDeciding when to finish is quite simple when the end date is years away. But actually going through with it? Actually standing up to say: \u2018This is it?\u2019 Not so much. So, next year we are going all out. Leaving nothing on the table. Creating this world in celebration. We are going to handle the end the way we like to handle the important things in our Scandal family: all together, white hats on, Gladiators running full speed over a cliff.\u201d\n\nRhimes always envisioned Scandal as a show that did not have a long lifespan \u2014 her Grey\u2019s Anatomy is heading into its 14th season in the fall \u2014 and always saw it as a seven-season show. Ahead of the fourth season opener, Rhimes always envisioned Scandal as a show that did not have a long lifespan \u2014 her Grey\u2019s Anatomy is heading into itsseason in the fall \u2014 and always saw it as a seven-season show. Ahead of the fourth season opener, told THR that the drama inspired by the life of fixer Judy Smith wasn\u2019t a \u201c10-season or eight-season show.\u201d\n\nIn its sixth season, Scandal has had to reinvent itself following the surprising November election that sent Republican and former reality TV personality Donald Trump to the White House. Suddenly, Rhimes\u2018 show about the insane things that politicians do didn\u2019t seem so insane. (Producers had to scrap a planned storyline about Russians hacking the show\u2019s presidential election when reality hit too close to home, for example.) During an oral history interview with THR in April pegged to the landmark 100th episode of Scandal, Rhimes was vocal about the show\u2019s uncertain future in the country\u2019s current political climate.\n\n\u201cAny of the stories we planned now just feel like we\u2019re copying what\u2019s happening in reality, which is insane,\u201d she said. \u201cI used to know how it ended, and then Donald Trump was elected. We had a destination, and I don\u2019t know if that\u2019s our destination anymore.\u201d\n\nStill, Scandal will leave an incredible legacy behind when it closes up shop for good during the 2017-18 broadcast season. The drama helped usher in a new era of diversity on the small screen when Rhimes cast Washington as fixer Olivia Pope. Washington picked up her first Emmy nomination in 2013 and became the first African-American to be nominated for best drama actress in the past 18 years and fifth overall.\n\nThe series also further solidified Rhimes as one of television\u2019s most powerful showrunners and helped ABC bolster its Thursday lineup. With Scandal sandwiched between Grey\u2019s Anatomy at 8 p.m. and the Rhimes-produced How to Get Away With Murder at 10 p.m., ABC created a \u201cTGIT\u201c-branded night consisting of three Rhimes-produced dramas.\n\nNext up for Rhimes is the long-awaited launch of Romeo and Juliet drama Still Star-Crossed. And while sophomore drama The Catch was canceled after two seasons, Shondaland \u2014 Rhimes\u2018 production company with longtime producing partner Betsy Beers \u2014 scored a series pickup for For the People, which has been described as a legal version of Grey\u2019s Anatomy. All told, Rhimes will enter next season with four shows on the air again: Grey\u2019s, Scandal, Murder and People, with a renewal for Still Star-Crossed having the potential to make it five for the second season in a row.\n\nScandal returns in the fall as part of ABC\u2019s TGIT lineup.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/146063_1429-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/146063_1429-h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/146063_1429-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/why-scandal-is-ending-season-7-1004113/", "title": "\u2018Scandal\u2019: Why ABC (and Shonda Rhimes) Decided Season 7 Was the End", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey explains the decision to wrap up the Kerry Washington starrer.", "news_keywords": "Scandal", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1004113, "title": "'Scandal': Why ABC (and Shonda Rhimes) Decided Season 7 Was the End", "published_at": "2017-05-16 09:26:50", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/146063_1429-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Scandal", "topics": "TV News", "body": "ABC has officially confirmed that Shonda Rhimes political thriller Scandal \u2014 the drama that helped usher in an era of programming that better reflects society \u2014 would end with its previously announced seventh season.\r\nChanning Dungey, entertainment president at ABC, spoke with reporters about the decision during her pre-upfronts press call with reporters Tuesday and noted that Rhimes always envisioned seven seasons for the fast-paced Washington, D.C.-set soap.\r\n\r\n\t\"I had conversions with Shonda Rhimes where she has had for a while a sense of how she wanted the story to end,\"\u00a0Dungey told reporters Tuesday ahead of ABC's upfront presentation to ad buyers. \"She said, 'Look, I really feel like season seven is where I want to wrap up this story, because I always prefer to end a show where you're feeling on top as opposed to letting things fizzle out.'\"\u00a0\r\n\r\n\t\u00a0\r\n\r\n\tSeason seven will again feature a short number of episodes as Olivia Pope (Kerry Washington) and outgoing President Fitzgerald Grant (Tony Goldwyn) inch closer to their Vermont dreams.
