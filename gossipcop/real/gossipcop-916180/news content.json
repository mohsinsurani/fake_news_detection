News, \u201cChalamet arrived around 9:30 p.m. with a male pal and had dinner. Gomez walked in with a few girlfriends about two hours later. Chalamet chatted with her on the phone before she arrived and the two found each other inside. They sat next to each other at a table and appeared to enjoy a friendly chat over drinks. Gomez had a martini, while Chalamet was seen with a Jack and Coke.\u201d\n\nThe two met and became friends last year while filming A Rainy Day In New York, in which they play a romantic couple. It\u2019s been speculated that the film, written and directed by Woody Allen, may not get much by way of a theatrical release, since public sentiment has largely turned on the alleged child molester and confirmed daughter-marrier. The sporadic Timoth\u00e9e-and-Selena sighting may be as close as we get to seeing the film.\n\nSince completing production, Chalamet has publicly disavowed the project, announcing on Instagram that he would be donating his salary to charity.\n\nGomez has addressed the Woody Allen issue less directly, telling Billboard that she auditioned for the roject multiple times and that the allegations were \u201csomething, yes, I had to face and discuss. I stepped back and thought, \u2018Wow, the universe works in interesting ways.'\u201d On an Instagram Live, they described the film as a \u201cromantic comedy\u201d and also chatted about their mutual love of hip-hop.\n\nNow, a romantic comedy about a young dramatic actor stealing a the most followed girl on Instagram away from her Canadian bad boy-turned-super-Christian boyfriend, on the other hand, would definitely get a wide release.\n\nRelated: Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet Is Worried He\u2019ll Never Outlive That Peach Scene", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d3e9cff16a6c3be3cc_bella.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d3a74669666cd41180_blanca.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/25/5a92d5fca74669666cd411a7_GettyImages-857648234.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/28/7a3f0c1f-f605-48ba-a124-fdf346739758-gettyimages-1389379651.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5507&fp-y=0.2764", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d4e9cff16a6c3be3ce_greta.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d418e4a660ead6f78e_izabel.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/25/5a92d5fca74669666cd411a7_GettyImages-857648234.jpg?w=414&h=274&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d40c19a36a4142970e_doutzen.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d4083515626e0d7d37_edward.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d5083515626e0d7d3b_vittoria.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/8/29/9f122c0b-8ad0-4d04-b2cf-3379547870db-tswifty.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.532&fp-y=0.228", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d4c4b644559ddfa953_lui.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d3083515626e0d7d35_donatella.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/23/5a9090d4083515626e0d7d39_natasha.jpg?w=375&h=500&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/25/5a92d5fca74669666cd411a7_GettyImages-857648234.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/timothee-chalamet-selena-gomez-reunion-hollywood-woody-allen", "title": "Pre-Oscars Week, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet And Selena Gomez Reunited Over Martinis", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/timothee-chalamet-selena-gomez-reunion-hollywood-woody-allen", "type": "article", "title": "Pre-Oscars Week, Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet And Selena Gomez Reunited Over Martinis", "description": "The two young stars were spotted at Sunset Tower.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/02/25/5a92d5fca74669666cd411a7_GettyImages-857648234.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "The two young stars were spotted at Sunset Tower."}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/9y6TdwvkNQ0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
