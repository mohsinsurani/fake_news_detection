Renee Zellweger\u2019s team is denouncing allegations that she had inappropriate encounters with Harvey Weinstein in order to escalate her career.\n\nThe claims came to light in a class-action lawsuit that six unnamed women recently filed against Weinstein, alleging that Zellweger, 48, and Charlize Theron both ascended in their professional endeavors by performing \u201csexual favors\u201d for Weinstien, 65.\n\n\u201cIf Harvey said that, he\u2019s full of shit,\u201d a rep for the Bridget Jones actress, who has starred in several films produced by the former studio exec, including Cold Mountain which she won an Oscar for in 2004, told Us Weekly in a statement on Wednesday, December 7.\n\nWeinstein responded to the claims in a statement to Us on Monday, December 11: \u201cMr. Weinstein vehemently denies these accusations and has never stated he slept with any of them. It\u2019s ridiculous that anyone would believe these talented women, Academy Award winners, provided sexual favors in exchange for roles they earned based on their talent and brilliant work. It\u2019s simply not true.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the former Miramax producer made headlines in October after nearly 30 years of sexual assault and abuse allegations came to light in expo\u015bes published by The New York Times and The New Yorker. North of 60 women have accused Weinstein of misconduct to date and he has since been faced with several lawsuits and expelled from the Television Academy. The filmmaker spent a brief period of time in a sexual rehabilitation facility in Arizona after the allegations surfaced in October. The scandal has inspired more women to come forward with their own alleged accounts of sexual abuse in Hollywood.\n\nWeinstein\u2019s wife, Georgina Chapman, announced she was leaving him one week after NYT published its story. Alyssa Milano, who costarred as a judge alongside Chapman on Project Runway: All Stars, gave an update on the British fashion designer, 41, during an appearance on Megan Kelly Today on Wednesday, December 6.\n\n\u201cGeorgina is doing very well. She\u2019s an amazing mother. She\u2019s an amazing woman,\u201d the Charmed alum, 44, said. \u201cI think her priority right now is focusing on how to raise those two children to the best of her capacity, given the situation. She goes through very dark times. She\u2019s very sad. This is not easy for her, but I have no doubt that not only will she come out on the other side of this, but she deserves to. She\u2019s a good woman.\u201d\n\nChapman shares two children, India, 7, and Dashiell, 4, with Weinstein, who she wed in 2007.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/renee-zellweger-says-harvey-weinstein-is-full-of-shit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/renee-zellweger-says-harvey-weinstein-is-full-of-shit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/renee-zellweger-says-harvey-weinstein-is-full-of-shit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/renee-zellweger-slams-harvey-weinstein-sexual-favors-claim/", "title": "Renee Zellweger's Rep Slams Harvey Weinstein \u2018Sexual Favors\u2019 Claim", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Renee Zellweger's rep didn\u2019t hold back when responding to claims that she gave Harvey Weinstein \u2018sexual favors\u2019 in order to advance her career \u2014 see more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Renee Zellweger's Rep Calls Harvey Weinstein \u2018Full of S--t' Over \u2018Sexual Favors\u2019 Claim", "description": "Renee Zellweger's rep didn\u2019t hold back when responding to claims that she gave Harvey Weinstein \u2018sexual favors\u2019 in order to advance her career \u2014 see more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/renee-zellweger-slams-harvey-weinstein-sexual-favors-claim/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:52+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/renee-zellweger-says-harvey-weinstein-is-full-of-shit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/renee-zellweger-says-harvey-weinstein-is-full-of-shit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-07T18:23:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:52+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Renee Zellweger's Rep Calls Harvey Weinstein \u2018Full of S--t' Over \u2018Sexual Favors\u2019 Claim", "description": "Renee Zellweger's rep didn\u2019t hold back when responding to claims that she gave Harvey Weinstein \u2018sexual favors\u2019 in order to advance her career \u2014 see more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/renee-zellweger-says-harvey-weinstein-is-full-of-shit.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512671030.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
