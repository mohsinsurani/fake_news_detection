She paired the look with Aquazzura shoes.\n\nJane Fonda was a total showstopper in a dusty blue tulle Marchesa gown with floral embroidery, while Amanda Seyfried stunned in a floral Alexander McQueen frock.\n\nMatt Damon also made several red carpet appearances with his gorgeous wife Luciana alongside him. Of course, Luciana stole the spotlight from her husband of 12 years not once, but twice! She donned a Atelier Versace gown in a bright red hue for her first red carpet. Days later, she dazzled in a emerald green Marchesa gown.\n\nThe annual film festival is going on through September 9, so there are definitely more red carpet looks to come! Check out the slideshow for the best Venice Film Festival ensembles so far.\n\nRELATED: The best of beauty at the Venice Film Festival:\n\n", "images":
