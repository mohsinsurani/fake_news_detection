Farrah Abraham revealed to Us Weekly that she hasn\u2019t repaired her relationship with her Teen Mom OG costars Amber Portwood, Maci Bookout and Catelynn Lowell.\n\nWhile celebrating her 26th birthday at NYC\u2019s Beautique Restaurant on Saturday, June 3, Abraham said that the season 7 reunion \u2014 which was taped that day \u2014 was \u201cemotional,\u201d but she\u2019s still not on speaking terms with the other ladies. \u201cI do not share my stage,\u201d she says.\n\nThe My Teenage Dream Ended author once again slammed Portwood and her fianc\u00e9, Matt Baier, for trying to emulate her. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t give a s\u2013t about either of them, and I\u2019m sick of them trying to be like me. They\u2019re obsessed with me,\u201d she claims. \u201cI sent them a cease and desist so they need to leave me out of their books, out of their interviews, and I don\u2019t want anything to do with them.\u201d (A source close to Portwood and Baier says the couple never received a cease and desist letter.)\n\nAbraham claims that the couple are \u201cjust jealous or envious\u201d of her. \u201cI\u2019ve tried to be friends with them over the years, and I\u2019m just not anymore. And it\u2019s just unhealthy,\u201d she tells Us. \u201cI\u2019m just making healthier choices for my 26th.\u201d\n\nThe mom of Sophia, 8, previously accused Portwood and Baier of trying to copy her when the couple confirmed that they received a sex tape offer from Vivid Entertainment and are considering it. \u201cThey hope to follow in footsteps of mine, the envy of them wanting to be me never fails,\u201d she told Us in May. \u201cI doubt doing a sex tape at 26 is the right direction. It\u2019s sad how hard Amber tries to be me.\u201d\n\nHowever, Baier told Us that his Vivid Entertainment meeting helped him gain respect for Abraham. \u201cDespite our differences with Farrah \u2014 and I can only speak for myself \u2014 our disagreements with Farrah have nothing to do with the decision she made to do an adult film,\u201d he said last month. \u201cI can tell you from getting that offer it\u2019s not an easy decision to make either way. There\u2019s a semblance of respect there that she put herself out there like that. That\u2019s the one thing I can say that we agree with Farrah on.\u201d\n\nAbraham has had a long-standing feud with Portwood and her fellow costars. The drama peaked when Abraham\u2019s now ex-boyfriend Simon Saran wrote on Twitter that Baier looks like a \u201cpedophile.\u201d Portwood confronted Abraham on the season 6 reunion, and the Indiana native attempted to hit the erotic book author.\n\nTeen Mom OG airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-amber-portwood-3b05be67-680b-45ea-a9f7-fa185c0166f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-amber-portwood-3b05be67-680b-45ea-a9f7-fa185c0166f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/farrah-abraham-i-sent-amber-portwood-a-cease-and-desist-w486140/", "title": "Farrah Abraham: I Sent Amber Portwood a Cease and Desist", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Farrah Abraham claimed to Us Weekly that she sent Amber Portwood and Matt Baier a cease and desist letter to stop talking about her \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Farrah Abraham: I Sent Amber Portwood a Cease and Desist", "description": "Farrah Abraham claimed to Us Weekly that she sent Amber Portwood and Matt Baier a cease and desist letter to stop talking about her \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/farrah-abraham-i-sent-amber-portwood-a-cease-and-desist-w486140/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:00:20+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-amber-portwood-3b05be67-680b-45ea-a9f7-fa185c0166f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-amber-portwood-3b05be67-680b-45ea-a9f7-fa185c0166f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-06-07T16:20:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:00:20+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Farrah Abraham: I Sent Amber Portwood a Cease and Desist", "description": "Farrah Abraham claimed to Us Weekly that she sent Amber Portwood and Matt Baier a cease and desist letter to stop talking about her \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-amber-portwood-3b05be67-680b-45ea-a9f7-fa185c0166f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496852400.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
