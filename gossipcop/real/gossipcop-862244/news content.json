She shuns \u201cprocessed, packaged\u201d foods and instead opts for \u201cwhole foods\u201d like fruits, vegetables, seeds and whole grains, she told PEOPLE.\n\nAnd the Tia Mowry At Home star, 38, is thrilled with the results, which she recently shared on Instagram. The mom posted an image of herself wearing leggings and lifting up her t-shirt to reveal her abs, \u201cI\u2019ve lost 20 pounds! Many asked how? Diet and cooking out of my cook book #wholenewyou,\u201d she captioned the photo.\n\nAlthough she mostly sticks to clean eating, Mowry will still indulge in the occasional treat. Prior to posting her weight loss photo, the star took to Instagram to share a picture of herself licking an ice cream cone. \u201cIce cream didn\u2019t stand a chance,\u201d she wrote.\n\nMowry didn\u2019t always have such a healthy relationship with food. In her cookbook, she reveals she developed poor eating habits on the set of Sister Sister, where she would snack on candy, cookies and potato chips. She then tried to counteract the junk food by taking diet pills.\n\nFROM PEN: Christie Brinkley\u2019s Girls Alexa and Sailor Reveal How They\u2019ve Conquered Bullies and Body Shamers\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t feel fat, but the pressure of being on television and wanting to look sexy and beautiful took over,\u201d she wrote in her book. \u201cI\u2019m not proud of it. I got skinny, true, but the pills caused my heart to race, and I knew in my gut that I was hurting myself.\u201d\n\nNow the star is focused on her healthy lifestyle. Her daily food log might include gluten-free pancakes, kale and almond fried rice for lunch, and a light fish with veggies for dinner. \u201cWhat I eat and what I put into my body is extremely important to me,\u201d she wrote.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/VfyIM8KHJ6DIfAgLfjvHw7hnnHg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(299x0:301x2)/kelly-clarkson-7bacae19467846a99d3cdcdcfb00a4cb.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/H1zWlOtzBp0CwQurx8gCa91lWBs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x0:736x2)/christie-brinkley-1-0448ebcc1b2840c4ab12264f5cfda88c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/551hrdTuMGYK5elWQX9SswPRQYs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(419x390:421x392)/adrienne-bailon-f7f7daab99434d40bf64d2d35d7f7207.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8cJmVZc7Ok6w5_4Wwxc14qmMsU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_generic-1885945d8bd544778fbbf4be88a63f00.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7h18okyNJB-76F8tpHrt-VeP_3Y=/1306x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/tia-mowry1-5ccfc32163ae4ed68dde8d6980493ca6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/27NyYsvjAgwVMGdBmwB7zS6wL2M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/lexlee-hudson-3-4aa47286eac44830814cd3e1f2bdff3e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BRJR5e1CQvnTuJgq8PepkzzEY7M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(574x0:576x2)/rebel-wilson-bebf6c81f72d48f297ac73d9aaa29515.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2EdJ8SKkfT0Vl5zYWtouVO7hv3I=/900x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(652x0:654x2)/tia-mowry1-5ccfc32163ae4ed68dde8d6980493ca6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/GroLHGROwOdN-KSad-03yhQMN78=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/tia-mowry-3167781966754919bb24ae1d91261625.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/yBFP4Pcu_frJZkXqkLwjdCZwz7o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/amy-schumer-1-2000-113d4349bdd74a219ca8cf580265b0ea.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/k3ua0qy5i3aa1hBHq2kBch33RpI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Katie-Maloney-Schwartz-tout-a8d33e63ffc444f1b856abb43506fbe3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BwRkIxRle4SaFXt-UEwR-46hOik=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/vinny-guadagnino-a81a10b00c57490eadd469e67b54f7d6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/fWxwdmNZVVmEy0OOAZ-c0bn1YrU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(646x0:648x2)/kim-kardashian12-1-aeaa75b383e44d8d96d7eb0fe84b42ab.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Dt9cUmh4v_6v0n0KFHvil-aSEXU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x280:721x282)/vanessa-1000-lb-best-friends-8111fa42bf0445feae546229afb8e4df.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kgZ5-9nry5vki5XbN5i5VGOiaJA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(460x0:462x2)/screen-shot-2017-07-12-at-12-29-51-pm-2616d1799f824d67b56a4c342b3396ee.png", "https://people.com/thmb/mI6g0x1vEmFGcN6PqRghL75aG0Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/tia-mowry1-3ec00d08a4534670bebf536ca5708277.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/7h18okyNJB-76F8tpHrt-VeP_3Y=/1306x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/tia-mowry1-5ccfc32163ae4ed68dde8d6980493ca6.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Ward Trainor"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/tia-mowry-weight-loss-photo-instagram/", "title": "Tia Mowry Shows Off Her Toned Stomach After 20-Lb.
