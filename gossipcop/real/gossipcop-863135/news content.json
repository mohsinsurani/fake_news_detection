Blue Ivy and her newly-welcomed siblings will be living large at the rental this summer, especially with a \"kiddie-friendly wading pool.\"\n\nThe first thing guests see when entering the lavish 10 bedroom and 14 bathroom home, is a foyer fit for Queen Bey, decked in colored tiles, golden fixtures and a wrought iron staircase.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nThere are plenty of living rooms to lounge in, including this one with open-air waterfront views. The cream-colored couches and antique accessories make for a modern take on a classic home.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nPlus, the baby grand piano is a necessary fixture for a family of music royalty.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nExquisite paintings and chandeliers hang in rib vault hallways, like this one, which leads to a dreamy garden overlooking the beach\u2014manicured hedges and fountain included.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nWhen the kids are hungry, they'll probably have a meal in this all-white kitchen, where the wooden details on the cabinets balance with the marble countertops for a rustic charm. In the next room over, the Carters might enjoy a sitting around the table in front of a floor-to-ceiling window, where they can look out on the blue tides while having breakfast.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nIn the $54.5 million estate, dinner for the family of five won't be an issue. Their dining room seats 10, leaving room for multiple guests.\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nOutside, the 16,107-square-foot La Villa Contenta has more sitting areas for relaxation, work and watching the tots play. The home includes lounge space in and out of the sun, a large lawn perfect for a jungle gym and much more.\n\n\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia\n\nCourtesy Trulia", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-09-1498507643.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-08-1498507623.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.499xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-arriving-for-lunch-at-the-abbey-of-san-news-photo-1665070515.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0551xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665155826.jpg?crop=0.984xw:1.00xh;0.00962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2478974-012-1665067784.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-11-1498506712.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-06-1498507426.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-07-1498508021.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-01-1498508046.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-03-1498507047.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2479931-003-1665162992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0192xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665151779.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-02-1498506839.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-10-1498507875.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-12-1498506667.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-05-1498507172.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-04-1498507154.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image003-1665237979.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0674xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-and-gisele-b-c3-bcndchen-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1664907170.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-del-castillo-teresa-mendoza-lrds3-tlmd-2-1664910940.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0566xh&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-beyonce-jayz-home-00-index-1498505652.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a10224058/beyonce-jay-z-malibu-rental/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z Have Bought a 400k A Month Rental In Malibu", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 and JAY-Z Have Bought a 400k A Month Rental In Malibu -
