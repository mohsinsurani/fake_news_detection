On Tuesday, she retweeted Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 video of her first appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show in 2010.\n\n\u201cHappy #KardashianWeek, @KimKardashian! Remmber your first appearance on my show?\u201d the daytime talk show host wrote.\n\nKim replied, \u201cI\u2019m really baffled how my voice has changed so much!\u201d\n\nIn the clip, Kim\u2019s voice certainly sounds younger as she\u2019s talking about her love of Twitter and noting that DeGeneres had more followers than her.\n\nI\u2019m really baffled how my voice has changed so much! https://t.co/mOcgfi2UTY \u2014 Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) July 24, 2018\n\nI'm so confused how our voices have changed. I miss my 2007 voice lol https://t.co/qi1NSmjalb \u2014 Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) September 25, 2017\n\nAnother thing that\u2019s changed is Kim\u2019s adoration for Taylor Swift! While playing a game of \"Who wrote that tweet?\" on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, she was able to name the \u201cGorgeous\u201d singer just from hearing a tweet about jogging. \u201cI follow her!\u201d she proudly declared.\n\nKim and her husband, Kanye West, had a falling out with Swift in 2016, which the pop star seemed to highlight on in her new album, Reputation, and subsequent world tour.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the 37-year-old reality star has called attention to her vocals. In 2017, she also tweeted: \u201cI\u2019m confused how our voices have changed. I miss my 2007 voice lol.\u201d\n\nHere's more with Kim:\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West Go Glam Up for Pusha T's Wedding This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nAriana Grande, Kim Kardashian & More Celebs Send Well Wishes to Demi Lovato Following Drug Overdose\n\nKim Kardashian Talks North\u2019s \u2018Cheetah Girls\u2019 Obsession, Jokes Adrienne Bailon Was Almost Her Aunt\n\nIs Kim Kardashian Bringing Back the Wallet Lanyard We Used to Wear in Elementary School? -- See the Pic!\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-08/GettyImages-1240426139.jpg?h=05c564aa&itok=Dkqb34Us", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/GettyImages-1243560296.jpg?h=27af8da9&itok=n9B1yPno", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=bmq0O6gX", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2016-10/kim_kardashian_611275100.jpg?itok=IoMN3SoM", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-07/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=73wGBQkw"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=bmq0O6gX", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-kardashian-is-baffled-by-how-much-her-voice-has-changed-after-watching-an-old-clip-of-herself", "title": "Kim Kardashian Is \u2018Baffled\u2019 by How Much Her Voice Has Changed After Watching an Old Clip of Herself", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "The difference is definitely apparent.", "keywords": "News, Kim Kardashian", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-kardashian-is-baffled-by-how-much-her-voice-has-changed-after-watching-an-old-clip-of-herself", "title": "Kim Kardashian Is \u2018Baffled\u2019 by How Much Her Voice Has Changed After Watching an Old Clip of Herself", "description": "The difference is definitely apparent.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=bmq0O6gX", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The difference is definitely apparent.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Kim Kardashian Is \u2018Baffled\u2019 by How Much Her Voice Has Changed After Watching an Old Clip of Herself", "creator": "Rachel McRady\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-kardashian-is-baffled-by-how-much-her-voice-has-changed-after-watching-an-old-clip-of-herself", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/kim-kardashian-getty.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=bmq0O6gX"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
