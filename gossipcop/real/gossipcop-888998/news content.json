Scare me twice, well, still shame on you.\n\nEllen DeGeneres had a little Halloween-themed fun at musician Sam Smith\u2019s expense during his segment on The Ellen Show on Tuesday, scaring him twice in less than a minute. In between the first and second scares, the \u201cToo Good at Goodbyes\u201d singer noted that he thought a scare was coming from inside the box next to him, which then occurred just moments later.\n\n\u201cI thought it was going to come out of this,\u201d he joked, pointing at the box. \u201cI was waiting for it to come out of this.\u201d He could hardly finish the second sentence before the box sprung open, sending Smith into the corner of his chair in fright.\n\nThe scares came in the midst of the British pop star discussing his current residence, a house that he believes to be haunted. Despite his suspicions, he noted that he doesn\u2019t allow it to affect his sleep schedule.\n\n\u201cI have a good relationship with the ghosts. Sometimes at night, I get up and I\u2019m like \u2018Leave me alone,'\u201d he said, clapping his hands for emphasis. \u201cAnd they do. I feel like if you talk to it and you\u2019re like, \u2018Please, I just need to sleep.'\u201d\n\nWatch the full clip from The Ellen Show above to see the scares and all of Smith\u2019s comments about his haunted house.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F10%2Fsam-smith1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F08%2Frozman_20170320_14123_1123r-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F10%2Fsam-smith1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Glicksman", "October", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/24/ellen-degeneres-scares-sam-smith/", "title": "Watch Ellen DeGeneres scare the crap out of Sam Smith in Halloween prank", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres had a little fun at Sam Smith's expense on Tuesday's episode of 'The Ellen Show', scaring him twice in under a minute.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Watch Ellen DeGeneres scare the crap out of Sam Smith in Halloween prank", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/24/ellen-degeneres-scares-sam-smith/", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres had a little fun at Sam Smith's expense on Tuesday's episode of 'The Ellen Show', scaring him twice in under a minute.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F10%2Fsam-smith1-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/24/ellen-degeneres-scares-sam-smith/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F10%2Fsam-smith1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/24/ellen-degeneres-scares-sam-smith/", "title": "Watch Ellen DeGeneres scare the crap out of Sam Smith in Halloween prank", "description": "Ellen DeGeneres had a little fun at Sam Smith's expense on Tuesday's episode of 'The Ellen Show', scaring him twice in under a minute.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F10%2Fsam-smith1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/24/ellen-degeneres-scares-sam-smith/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/DBWf1EZ9xxQ"], "publish_date": 1508799600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
