It ain't me.\"\n\nApparently they both lied to us, because Jelena is alive and active once more.\n\nThe two recently reunited lovebirds were last seen at Justin's hockey game.\n\nSplash\n\nSelena arrived to the L.A. rink last night wearing all black under a denim jacket, then watched from the stands while her not-so-ex ex-boyfriend skated around the ice rink like the Canadian that he is.\n\nSplash\n\nWhen Selena left, the \"Fetish\" singer had shed her denim shell for Justin's number eight jersey.\n\nSplash\n\nIf you needed more evidence that these two are totally back on, they drove off together to reportedly head back to Selena's place.\n\nSplash\n\nI don't know about you, but I definitely wouldn't wear a sweat-soaked jersey for anyone I wasn't making out with on the regs. Just sayin'.\n\nKelsey is the assistant style editor at Seventeen.com.
