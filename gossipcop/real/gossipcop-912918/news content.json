disorder following a suicide bombing that killed 22 people at her concert in Manchester, United Kingdom, last year.\n\n\u201cI know those families and my fans, and everyone there experienced a tremendous amount of it as well,\u201d said Grande of suffering the symptoms of PTSD, in an interview with British Vogue to be released on Friday.\n\n\u201cI feel like I shouldn\u2019t even be talking about my own experience \u2013 like I shouldn\u2019t even say anything,\u201d added the 24-year-old American, who appears on the cover of the magazine\u2019s July edition.\n\nPTSD is a form of anxiety disorder that occurs when intrusive memories linked to fear from a traumatic event become consolidated in a person\u2019s mind by them visualizing the event in a loop until it becomes locked in their brain.\n\nGrande said she didn\u2019t think she\u2019d ever be able to talk about the attack at Manchester Arena in May 2017 \u201cand not cry.\u201d\n\nAttacker Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of Grande\u2019s concert, as people were leaving the packed arena.\n\nMany of the victims were teenage fans, the youngest among them 8-year-old Saffie Rose Roussos from Leyland, north of Manchester.\n\nInside the July issue, @ArianaGrande shares details of her difficult and transformative past year with Vogue: https://t.co/FociKiCJnD pic.twitter.com/teENfb8HfQ \u2014 British Vogue (@BritishVogue) June 4, 2018\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s hard to talk about because so many people have suffered such severe, tremendous loss,\u201d Grande told Vogue during the interview at her home in Beverly Hills.\n\n\u201cTime is the biggest thing,\u201d she said of recovering from the trauma.\n\nOne year on: remembering the victims\n\nFollowing the first anniversary of the attack, Grande last month revealed a bee tattoo beneath her ear in commemoration of the tragedy.\n\nThe worker bee is often used as an emblem for Manchester, representing the city\u2019s industrial past and appearing in its crest.\n\nServices were also held across Manchester to mark the anniversary of the attack, with Prince William and Prime Minister Theresa May among the dignitaries attending.", "images":
