So, it\u2019s more important than ever to save some money where you can by taking advantage of holiday sales events.\n\nLabor Day, which is on Sept. 5, 2022, is one of the best times of year to score massive discounts on these more expensive items. All weekend long, major retailers like The Home Depot, Best Buy, Wayfair, and Walmart will be offering Labor Day sales on some of the most popular items from well-known brands like GE, LG, Nectar, Casper, and more. Of course, you have the option to shop sales in-person at these stores open on Labor Day, but with so many retailers offering free shipping and quick delivery for the holiday, it might make more sense to order online ASAP.\n\nLabor Day Appliance Sales\n\nMost major appliance stores, like The Home Depot, Lowe\u2019s, and Best Buy, are running competitive Labor Day sales for the holiday weekend. Here are the best ones we\u2019ve found.\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nThe Home Depot has cut prices on all types of appliances through Sept. 7. This includes big-ticket items like refrigerators, washers and dryers, cooktops, ranges, and range hoods, as well as smaller appliances such as vacuums, coffee makers, and toaster ovens. You\u2019ll see lots of familiar brand names, including LG, Samsung, Frigidaire, KitchenAid, and GE, among the sale items. Free delivery is also included for most large appliances.\n\nLowe\u2019s\n\nLowe\u2019s has one of the biggest appliance selections out there, and many highly rated models are on sale for Labor Day. You\u2019ll find discounts on major appliances from name brands like LG, Whirlpool, Haier, Bosch, and Maytag, as well as savings on smaller items like ice makers, robot vacuums, air conditioners, and air purifiers. You\u2019ll also get free local delivery with purchases of $396 or more.\n\nWayfair\n\nWayfair has become a go-to for home decor, but the retailer has a ton of appliances too. You can find washers and dryers, gas and electric ranges, refrigerators, dishwashers, and smaller items like microwaves and air conditioners. While the online retailer\u2019s sale section isn\u2019t as extensive as what you\u2019d find at Lowe\u2019s, The Home Depot, or Best Buy, there are plenty of items from brands like GE, Samsung, and Forno on sale for up to 30% off.\n\nBest Buy\n\nBest Buy\u2019s Labor Day sale includes deals on all major appliances, including refrigerators, dishwashers, microwaves, washers and dryers, and electric and gas ranges, from brands like Samsung, Insignia, LG, Maytag, Amana, GE, and Whirlpool. You may also get additional rebates on specific eligible items as well. Keep in mind that while some items are in stock and can be delivered in five days, others may take several weeks for delivery.\n\nWalmart\n\nWalmart doesn\u2019t carry all of the major appliance brands, but you\u2019ll find Labor Day deals on more budget-friendly names like Avanti, RCA, Midea, Arctic King, and Danby mixed in with some options from Frigidaire, Whirlpool, and GE. If you\u2019re looking for smaller-size appliances, including refrigerators and dishwashers, Walmart\u2019s Labor Day sale may be a good bet to get one at a great price.\n\nSamsung\n\nIf you buy directly from Samsung\u2019s site this Labor Day weekend, you\u2019ll get up to $1,200 off refrigerators, up to $450 off ranges, 35% off washers and dryers, and up to 60% off appliance bundles.
