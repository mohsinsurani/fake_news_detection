Who knew?\n\nOn Tuesday, Cyrus stopped by New York radio station WKTU to chat with Cubby and Carolina Bermudez about her new single, \u201cMalibu.\u201d Although \u201cMalibu\u201d is currently competing with Perry\u2019s \u201cBon App\u00e9tit\u201d in the music charts, the singers themselves have a more collaborative relationship.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s been a friend of mine for a really long time,\u201d Cyrus told WKTU\u2019s Cubby and Carolina Bermudez. \u201cWe were actually just realizing the other day that next year, we\u2019ll have been friends for 10 years.\u201d\n\nWhen reflecting on their friendship, Cyrus explained that Perry is, in fact, her oldest friend in the industry. \u201cI think that\u2019s my friend that I\u2019ve known the longest. Which is really, really weird!\u201d\n\nThe two pop stars have been friends since 2008, and according to Cyrus, \u201cthat\u2019s like a really long time\u201d in Los Angeles.\n\n10 years of a friendship is a really long time in any city, but in Hollywood, it\u2019s basically forever.\n\n\u201cWhen she came out with \u2018I Kissed a Girl,\u2019 I was doing the Hannah Montana movie, and I heard her on the radio. They said, \u2018Who did you write that about?\u2019 She said me!\u201d Cyrus recalled.\n\n\u201cI screamed and started freaking out, and then she asked me to go to the VMAs with her. That\u2019s when I started doing my whole VMA controversy,\u201d she continued. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019ll go with Katy Perry!\u2019 So, that\u2019s how we met and we just stayed friends.\u201d\n\nThis is such a fun story!\n\n2008\n\nThe \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d singer posed with her new BFF and Hannah Montana alum at the MTV Video Music Awards in September 2008. Can you believe how young they both look?\n\n2009\n\nAt the 2009 Grammy Awards, Cyrus and Perry hung out with Taylor Swift and Kelly Clarkson. Talk about a throwback picture!\n\n2013\n\nThese two singers can\u2019t stay away from one another when it comes to the Grammy Awards. Oh, and we love that they always make goofy faces when they are reunited.\n\n2014\n\nFriends who selfie together, stay together, clearly.\n\n2015\n\nThe Voice coach threw up a peace sign at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards Show alongside her longtime friend and Nicole Richie.\n\nOf course, this duo posed together at the 2015 Grammy Awards in Los Angeles as well. As always, they kept it real and couldn\u2019t stop laughing together.\n\nWe just love this friendship and look forward to seeing it continue to grow!", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/mtv-awards-2008-cyrus-perry.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='600'%20height='400'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/mtv-awards-perry-cyrus-friends.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='500'%20height='750'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/perry-cyrus-sam-hunt-award-show.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/cyrus-perry-best-friends.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/swift-cyrus-clarkson-perry.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/perry-cyrus-bffs.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/miley-cyrus-katy-perry-friendship.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/miley-cyrus-katy-perry-friendship.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/cyrus-perry-nicole-richie.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/05/16/miley-cyrus-katy-perry-friendship.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Johnni Macke"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/miley-cyrus-reveals-that-katy-perry-is-her-most-ride-or-die-and-oldest-friend-in-hollywood/", "title": "Miley Cyrus revealed that Katy Perry is her oldest and most loyal friend in Hollywood - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Miley Cyrus and Katy Perry have been BFFs for nearly 10 years!
