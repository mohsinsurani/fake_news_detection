Is that true?\u201d Harrison said in a PEOPLE exclusive clip of the interview when asked by Lopez on the radio if he thought the split was expected. \u201cYou\u2019re breaking news to me. I really did not know that.\u201d\n\nDavid Livingston/Getty\n\n\u201cApparently I did not see that coming. I love them both. They are really two of my favorite people we\u2019ve ever had on the show and Ben is a really good friend,\u201d said Harrison, 45, who firsthand watched the couple meet, fall in love and get engaged on Higgins\u2019 season 20 of the ABC reality series, which premiered in January 2016.\n\nAfter the couple\u2019s time on the show wrapped, they continued to appear in front of cameras on the Freeform series, Ben & Lauren: Happily Ever After?, which gave audiences an inside look at their life together post-Bachelor.\n\nValorie Darling\n\n\u201cI know that they have struggled with the show and then kind of continuing on and doing their reality show and kind of where the show stopped and then where life began,\u201d Harrison continued.\n\n\u201cSo I know they were fighting through a bunch of stuff,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ll reach out to them. I\u2019m very sorry to hear that because I do care about them very much.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, 29-year-old Higgins \u2014 who will be launching a podcast with iHeartRadio next week alongside Bachelor alum Ashley Iaconetti \u2014 and Bushnell revealed their breakup in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we announce our decision to go our separate ways,\u201d they told PEOPLE in a statement. \u201cWe feel fortunate for the time we had together, and will remain friends with much love and respect for one another. We wish nothing but the best for each other, and ask for your support and understanding at this time.\u201d", "images":
