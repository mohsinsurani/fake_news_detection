For her self-titled album, see Taylor Swift (album)\n\nTaylor Alison Swift (born December 13, 1989) is an American singer-songwriter. Her discography spans genres and her narrative songwriting\u2014often inspired by her personal life\u2014has received critical praise and widespread media coverage. Born in West Reading, Pennsylvania, Swift moved to Nashville, Tennessee at age 14 to pursue a career in country music. She signed a songwriting deal with Sony/ATV Music Publishing in 2004 and a recording contract with Big Machine Records in 2005. Her 2006 self-titled debut album made her the first female country artist to write or co-write every song on a US platinum-certified album.\n\nSwift's next albums, Fearless (2008) and Speak Now (2010), explored country pop. The former's singles \"Love Story\" and \"You Belong with Me\" were the first country songs to respectively top the US pop airplay and all-genre airplay charts. She experimented with diverse rock and electronic styles on Red (2012), which features her first US Billboard Hot 100 number-one song, \"We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\", and recalibrated her identity from country to pop with her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989 (2014), supported by the chart-topping singles \"Shake It Off\", \"Blank Space\", and \"Bad Blood\". Media scrutiny on her life inspired the urban-flavored Reputation (2017) and its number-one single \"Look What You Made Me Do\". It made Swift the first act to have four albums each open with a million copies sold.\n\nDeparting from Big Machine and signing with Republic Records in 2018, Swift released her seventh studio album, Lover (2019), followed by the autobiographical documentary Miss Americana (2020). Her artistic input during the COVID-19 pandemic resulted in the indie folk and alternative rock albums, Folklore and Evermore (2020), which incorporated escapism and fictional narratives; their lead singles \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\" debuted atop the Hot 100. She began re-recording her Big Machine catalog after a public dispute over the ownership to the albums' masters, re-releasing two in 2021\u2014Fearless (Taylor's Version) and Red (Taylor's Version). The latter's \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\" became the longest song to top the Hot 100. Besides music, Swift has played supporting roles in films and directed the music films Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) and All Too Well: The Short Film (2021).\n\nHaving sold over 200 million records worldwide, Swift is one of the best-selling musicians of all time. Her accolades comprise 11 Grammy Awards\u2014including three Album of the Year wins, 34 American Music Awards\u2014the most for an artist, 29 Billboard Music Awards\u2014the most for a woman, and an Emmy Award. She has featured on rankings such as Rolling Stone's 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time (2015), Billboard's Greatest of All Time Artists (2019), the Time 100 and Forbes Celebrity 100. Honored with titles such as Artist of the Decade and Woman of the Decade, Swift is an advocate for artists' rights and women's empowerment. Her albums have been credited with influencing a generation of singer-songwriters.\n\nLife and career\n\n1989\u20132003: Early life and education\n\nTaylor Alison Swift was born on December 13, 1989,[1] at the Reading Hospital in West Reading, Pennsylvania.[2] Her father, Scott Kingsley Swift, is a former stockbroker for Merrill Lynch;[3] her mother, Andrea Gardner Swift (n\u00e9e Finlay), is a former homemaker who previously worked as a mutual fund marketing executive. Her younger brother, Austin, is an actor.[5] She was named after singer-songwriter James Taylor,[6] and has Scottish[7] and German heritage. Her maternal grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, was an opera singer.[8] Swift spent her early years on a Christmas tree farm that her father purchased from one of his clients.[9][10] Swift identifies as a Christian.[11] She attended preschool and kindergarten at the Alvernia Montessori School, run by the Bernadine Franciscan sisters,[12] before transferring to The Wyndcroft School.[13] The family moved to a rented house in the suburban town of Wyomissing, Pennsylvania,[14] where she attended Wyomissing Area Junior/Senior High School.[15]\n\nAt age nine, Swift became interested in musical theater and performed in four Berks Youth Theatre Academy productions.[16] She also traveled regularly to New York City for vocal and acting lessons.[17] Swift later shifted her focus toward country music, inspired by Shania Twain's songs, which made her \"want to just run around the block four times and daydream about everything.\"[18] She spent weekends performing at local festivals and events.[19][20] After watching a documentary about Faith Hill, Swift felt sure she needed to move to Nashville, Tennessee, to pursue a career in music.[21] She traveled with her mother at age eleven to visit Nashville record labels and submitted demo tapes of Dolly Parton and The Chicks karaoke covers.[22] She was rejected, however, because \"everyone in that town wanted to do what I wanted to do. So, I kept thinking to myself, I need to figure out a way to be different.\"[23]\n\nWhen Swift was around 12 years old, computer repairman and local musician Ronnie Cremer taught her to play guitar. He helped with her first efforts as a songwriter, leading her to write \"Lucky You\".[24] In 2003, Swift and her parents started working with New York-based talent manager Dan Dymtrow. With his help, Swift modeled for Abercrombie & Fitch as part of their \"Rising Stars\" campaign, had an original song included on a Maybelline compilation CD, and attended meetings with major record labels.[25] After performing original songs at an RCA Records showcase, Swift, then 13 years old, was given an artist development deal and began making frequent trips to Nashville with her mother.[26][27][28] To help Swift enter into the country music scene, her father transferred to Merrill Lynch's Nashville office when she was 14 years old, and the family relocated to Hendersonville, Tennessee.[9][29] Swift initially attended Hendersonville High School[30] before transferring to the Aaron Academy after two years, which better suited her touring schedule through homeschooling. She graduated one year early.[31]\n\n2004\u20132008: Career beginnings and first album\n\nIn Nashville, Swift worked with experienced Music Row songwriters such as Troy Verges, Brett Beavers, Brett James, Mac McAnally, and the Warren Brothers[32][33] and formed a lasting working relationship with Liz Rose.[34] They began meeting for two-hour writing sessions every Tuesday afternoon after school.[35] Rose thought the sessions were \"some of the easiest I've ever done. Basically, I was just her editor. She'd write about what happened in school that day. She had such a clear vision of what she was trying to say. And she'd come in with the most incredible hooks.\" Swift became the youngest artist signed by the Sony/ATV Tree publishing house,[36] but left the Sony-owned RCA Records at the age of 14 due to the label's lack of care and them \"cut[ting] other people's stuff\". She was also concerned that development deals may shelve artists,[28][20] and recalled: \"I genuinely felt that I was running out of time. I wanted to capture these years of my life on an album while they still represented what I was going through.\"[37]\n\nAt an industry showcase at Nashville's Bluebird Cafe in 2005, Swift caught the attention of Scott Borchetta, a DreamWorks Records executive who was preparing to form an independent record label, Big Machine Records. She had first met Borchetta in 2004.[39] She was one of Big Machine's first signings,[28] and her father purchased a three-percent stake in the company for an estimated $120,000.[40][41] She began working on her eponymous debut album with producer Nathan Chapman, with whom she felt she had the right \"chemistry\".[20] Swift wrote three of the album's songs alone, and co-wrote the remaining eight with Rose, Robert Ellis Orrall, Brian Maher, and Angelo Petraglia.[42] Taylor Swift was released on October 24, 2006.[43] The album peaked at number five on the U.S. Billboard 200, where it spent 157 weeks\u2014the longest stay on the chart by any release in the U.S. in the 2000s decade.[44] It made Swift the first female country-music artist to write or co-write every track on a U.S. platinum-certified album.[45]\n\nBig Machine Records was still in its infancy during the June 2006 release of the lead single, \"Tim McGraw\", which Swift and her mother helped promote by sending copies of the CD single to country radio stations.[46] As there were not enough furniture at the label yet, they would sit on the floor to do so.[46] She spent much of 2006 promoting Taylor Swift with a radio tour, television appearances, and opening for Rascal Flatts on select dates during their 2006 tour[47] after they fired their previous opening act, Eric Church, for playing longer than his allotted time.[48] Borchetta said that although record industry peers initially disapproved of his signing a 15-year-old singer-songwriter, Swift tapped into a previously unknown market\u2014teenage girls who listen to country music.[46][9] Following \"Tim McGraw\", four more singles were released throughout 2007 and 2008: \"Teardrops on My Guitar\", \"Our Song\", \"Picture to Burn\" and \"Should've Said No\". All appeared on Billboard's Hot Country Songs, with \"Our Song\", and \"Should've Said No\" reaching number one. With \"Our Song\", Swift became the youngest person to single-handedly write and sing a number-one song on the chart.[49] \"Teardrops on My Guitar\" reached number thirteen on the U.S. Billboard Hot 100.[50] Swift also released two EPs, The Taylor Swift Holiday Collection in October 2007 and Beautiful Eyes in July 2008.[51][52] She promoted her debut album extensively as the opening act for other country musicians' tours throughout 2006 and 2007, including George Strait,[53] Brad Paisley,[54] and Tim McGraw and Faith Hill.[55]\n\nSwift won multiple accolades for Taylor Swift. She was one of the recipients of the Nashville Songwriters Association's Songwriter/Artist of the Year in 2007, becoming the youngest person to be honored with the title.[56] She also won the Country Music Association's Horizon Award for Best New Artist,[57] the Academy of Country Music Awards' Top New Female Vocalist,[58] and the American Music Awards' Favorite Country Female Artist honor.[59] She was also nominated for Best New Artist at the 50th Annual Grammy Awards.[60] She opened for the Rascal Flatts on their 2008 summer and fall tour.[61] In July of that year, Swift began dating singer Joe Jonas that ended three months later.[62][63]\n\n2008\u20132010: Fearless and acting debut\n\nHannah Montana: The Movie.

The singles, in that order, were \"Cardigan\", \"Betty\", and \"Exile\" from Folklore, and \"Willow\", \"No Body, No Crime\", and \"Coney Island\" from Evermore.[220] Swift became the first artist to debut a U.S. number-one album and a number-one song at the same time with Folklore's \"Cardigan\" and Evermore's \"Willow\".[221] Folklore was 2020's best-selling album in the U.S. with 1.2 million copies.[222] It won Album of the Year at the 63rd Annual Grammy Awards, making Swift the first woman to win the award thrice.[223] At the 2020 American Music Awards, Swift won three awards, including Artist of the Year for a record third consecutive time.[224] She was 2020's highest-paid musician in the U.S., and the world's highest-paid solo musician.[225]\n\n2021\u2013present: Re-recordings and Midnights\n\nFollowing the masters dispute, Swift released two re-recorded albums in 2021, adding \"Taylor's Version\" to their titles. The first, Fearless (Taylor's Version), peaked atop the Billboard 200, becoming the first re-recorded album to do so.[226] It was preceded by the three tracks: \"Love Story (Taylor's Version)\", \"You All Over Me\" with Maren Morris, and \"Mr. Perfectly Fine\",[227] the first of which made Swift the second artist after Dolly Parton to have both the original and the re-recording of a single reach number one on the Hot Country Songs chart.[228] The second re-recording Red (Taylor's Version) was released on November 12.[229] Its final track, \"All Too Well (10 Minute Version)\"\u2014accompanied by the namesake short film directed by Swift\u2014debuted at number one on the Hot 100, becoming the longest song in history to top the chart.[230] She was the highest-paid female musician of 2021,[231] and both her 2020 albums and the re-recordings were ranked among the 10 best-selling albums of the year.[232] In May 2021, Swift was awarded the Global Icon Award by the Brit Awards[233] and the Songwriter Icon Award by the National Music Publishers' Association.[234] Swift further released \"Wildest Dreams (Taylor's Version)\" on September 17, 2021, and \"This Love (Taylor's Version)\" on May 6, 2022.[235][236] Outside her albums, she featured on four songs from 2021 to 2022: \"Renegade\" and \"Birch\" by Big Red Machine,[237] a remix of Haim's \"Gasoline\"[238] and Ed Sheeran's \"The Joker and the Queen\".[239] In 2022, Swift released \"Carolina\" as part of the soundtrack of mystery drama film Where the Crawdads Sing,[240] and starred in a minor role in period comedy film Amsterdam.[241]\n\nShe won three awards at the 2022 MTV Video Music Awards on August 28, 2022, including the Video of the Year (for All Too Well: The Short Film) for a record-breaking third time.[242] In her acceptance speech, she announced that her upcoming tenth studio album is releasing on October 21, and later revealed the title as Midnights.[243][244]\n\nArtistry\n\nInfluences\n\nOne of Swift's earliest memories of music is listening to her grandmother, Marjorie Finlay, sing in church. As a child, she enjoyed Disney film soundtracks: \"My parents noticed that, once I had run out of words, I would just make up my own.\"[245] Swift said she owes her confidence to her mother, who helped her prepare for class presentations as a child.[246] She also attributes her \"fascination with writing and storytelling\" to her mother.[247] Swift was drawn to the storytelling aspect of country music,[248] and was introduced to the genre listening to \"the great female country artists\" of the 1990s\u2014Shania Twain, Faith Hill, and the Dixie Chicks.[249][250] Twain, both as a songwriter and performer, was her biggest musical influence.[251] Hill was Swift's childhood role model, and she would often imitate her.[252] She admired the Dixie Chicks' defiant attitude and their ability to play their own instruments.[253] \"Kiss Me\" by Sixpence None the Richer was the first song Swift learned to play on the guitar.[254] Swift also explored the music of older country stars such as Patsy Cline, Loretta Lynn, Tammy Wynette, and Dolly Parton,[19] the last of whom she believes is exemplary to female songwriters,[255] and alt-country artists like Patty Griffin[256] and Lori McKenna.[9] As a songwriter, Swift was influenced by Joni Mitchell, citing especially how Mitchell's autobiographical lyrics convey the deepest emotions; \"I think [Blue] is my favorite because it explores somebody's soul so deeply.\"[257]\n\nSwift has also been influenced by various pop and rock artists. She lists Paul McCartney, Bruce Springsteen, Bryan Adams,[258] Emmylou Harris, Kris Kristofferson, and Carly Simon as her career role models.[9][259] McCartney, both as a member of The Beatles and a soloist, makes Swift feel \"as if I've been let into his heart and his mind [...] He's out there continuing to make his fans so happy.\"[260] She likes Springsteen for remaining musically relevant for a long time.[261] As she grows older, Swift aspires to be like Harris and prioritize music over fame.[262] She says that Kristofferson \"shines in songwriting\",[263] and praised Simon for being emotional but \"strong\" at the same time.[264] Her synth-pop album 1989 was influenced by some of her favorite 1980s pop acts, including Peter Gabriel, Annie Lennox, Phil Collins, and Madonna.[265][266] She has also cited Keith Urban's musical style[267] and Fall Out Boy's lyrics as major influences.[268]\n\nMusical styles\n\n\"If there's one thing that Swift has proven throughout her career, it's that she refuses to be put in a box. Her ever-evolving sound took her from country darling to pop phenom to folk's newest raconteur.\" \u2014The Recording Academy, 2021[269]\n\nSwift self-identified as a country music artist until 2012, when she released her fourth studio album, Red. Her albums were promoted to country radio, but music critics noted wide-ranging styles of pop and rock.[272] After 2010, they observed that Swift's melodies are rooted in pop music, and the country music elements are limited to instruments such as banjo, mandolin, and fiddle, and her slight twang;[273][274] some commented that her country music identity was an indicator of her narrative songwriting rather than musical style.[275][276] Although the Nashville music industry was receptive of Swift's status as a country musician, critics accused her of abandoning the legitimate roots of country music in favor of crossover success in the mainstream pop market.[278] Red's eclectic pop, rock, and electronic styles intensified the critical debate, to which Swift responded, \"I leave the genre labeling to other people.\"\n\nMusic journalist Jody Rosen commented that by originating her musical career in Nashville, Swift made a \"bait-and-switch maneuver ... planting roots in loamy country soil, then pivoting to pop\".[280] She abandoned her country-music identity in 2014, when she released her synth-pop fifth studio album, 1989, which she described as her first \"documented, official pop album\". Her albums Reputation (2017) and Lover (2019) have an upbeat pop production; the former incorporates hip hop and trap elements.[282][283] Although reviews of Swift's pop albums were generally positive, critics lamented that the pop music production indicated Swift's pursuit of mainstream success, which eroded her authenticity as a songwriter nurtured by her country music background. Musicologist Nate Sloan remarked that Swift's pop music transition was rather motivated by her need to expand her artistry.\n\nSwift eschewed mainstream pop in favor of alternative styles like indie rock with her 2020 studio albums, Folklore and Evermore.[286][287] Clash said her career \"has always been one of transcendence and covert boundary-pushing\", reaching a point at which \"Taylor Swift is just Taylor Swift\", not defined by any genre.[288]\n\nVoice\n\nSwift possesses a mezzo-soprano vocal range, and a generally soft timbre.[290] During her career as a country singer, her vocals were criticized by some as weak and strained compared to those of her contemporaries. Swift admitted her vocal ability often concerned her in her early career, and has worked hard to improve.[292] After transitioning from country to pop music in 2014, reviews of Swift's vocals remained mixed; critics complained that she lacks proper vocal technique but appreciated her usage of her voice to communicate her feelings to her audience, prioritizing \"intimacy over power and nuance\". They also praised her for refraining from correcting her pitch with Auto-Tune. Los Angeles Times music critic Ann Powers remarked in 2010 that Swift's defining vocal feature is her attention to detail to convey an exact feeling\u2014\"the line that slides down like a contented sigh or up like a raised eyebrow\".[295]\n\nReviews of Swift's later albums were more appreciative of her vocals, which they found less nasal, richer, and more resonant.[274][296] In Folklore and Evermore, music critics complimented her sharp and agile yet translucent and controlled vocals.[297][298][299] Pitchfork's Sam Sodomsky noted that Swift remains a \"versatile, expressive vocalist\".[300] Music theory professor Alyssa Barna said Swift's timbre is \"breathy and bright\" in the upper register and \"full and dark\" in the lower.[217] With her 2021 re-recorded albums, critics began to praise the mature, deeper and \"fuller\" tone of her voice.[301][302][303] Kate Solomon, writing in i, said Swift's voice is \"leagues better now\" with her new-found vocal furniture.[304] The Guardian highlighted \"yo-yoing vocal yelps\" and passionate climaxes as the trademarks of Swift's voice,[305] and that her country twang has faded away.[306]\n\nSongwriting\n\nSwift has been referred to as one of the greatest songwriters of all time and the best of her generation by several publications.[307][308][309] She told The New Yorker in 2011 that she identifies as a songwriter first: \"I write songs, and my voice is just a way to get those lyrics across.\"[9] Swift's personal experiences were a common inspiration for her early songs, which helped her navigate the complexities of life.[310][311] Her \"diaristic\" technique began with identifying an emotion, followed by a corresponding melody.[312][313] On her first three studio albums, recurring themes were love, heartbreak, and insecurities, from an adolescent perspective.[314][315] She delved into the tumult of toxic relationships on Red,[316] and embraced nostalgia and positivity after failed relationships on 1989.[317] Reputation was inspired by the downsides of Swift's fame,[318] and Lover detailed her realization of the \"full spectrum of love\".[319] Besides romance, other themes in Swift's music include parent-child relationships, friendships,[320][321] alienation, self-awareness and tackling vitriol, especially sexism.[247][322]\n\nSwift's confessional songwriting received generally positive reviews from critics;[323][9][324] they highlighted its vivid details and emotional engagement, which they found uncommon in a pop musician.[325][326][327] Critics praised her melodic songwriting; Rolling Stone described Swift as \"a songwriting savant with an intuitive gift for verse-chorus-bridge architecture\".[328][329] Although reviews of Swift are generally positive, The New Yorker stated she was generally portrayed \"more as a skilled technician than as a Dylanesque visionary\".[9] Critic Ann Powers remarked that although Swift's songs were \"not that literary or that wise\", they offered emotional engagement because \"the wit and clarity of her arrangements turn them from standard fare to heartfelt disclosures\".[329] Because of her confessional narratives, tabloid media often speculated and linked the subjects of the songs with ex-lovers of Swift, a practice reviewers and Swift herself criticized as sexist.[325][330][331][332] Aside from clues in album liner notes, Swift avoids talking about the subjects of her songs.[333]\n\n\"I love songwriting so much because there's an element to it that is still really mysterious\u2014like I think any songwriter will tell you, when you get an idea you're not quite sure where it floated down from, but if you can grab onto that idea and turn it into something, a piece of music, that's where craftsmanship comes in; that's where you have the opportunity to learn and to nurture that craft.\" \u2014Swift on the art of songwriting, Variety[334]\n\nOn her 2020 albums Folklore and Evermore, Swift was inspired by escapism and romanticism to explore fictional narratives.[335] Without referencing her personal life, she imposed her emotions onto imagined characters and story arcs, which liberated her from the mental stress caused by tabloid attention and suggested new paths for her artistry.[312] In a feature for Rolling Stone, Swift explained that she welcomed the new songwriting direction after she stopped worrying about commercial success.[335] According to Spin, Swift explored complex emotions with \"precision and devastation\" on Evermore.[336] Consequence stated her 2020 albums provided a chance to convince skeptics of Swift's songwriting ability, noting her transformation from \"teenage wunderkind to a confident and careful adult\".[337]\n\nSwift's bridges have been underscored as one of the best aspects of her songs[338][337] and earned her the title \"Queen of Bridges\" from Time.[339] Awarding her with the Songwriter Icon Award in 2021, the National Music Publishers' Association remarked that \"no one is more influential when it comes to writing music today\" than Swift.[340] The Week deemed her the foremost female songwriter of modern times,[341] and the Nashville Songwriters Association International named her Songwriter-Artist of the Decade in 2022.[342] Carole King considers Swift her \"professional grand daughter\" and has thanked Swift for \"carrying the torch forward.\"[343] Swift has also published two original poems: \"Why She Disappeared\" and \"If You're Anything Like Me\".[344]\n\nVideo and film\n\nSwift emphasizes visuals as a key creative component of her music making process.[345] She has collaborated with different directors to produce her music videos, and over time she has become more involved with writing and directing. She developed the concept and treatment for \"Mean\"[346] and co-directed the music video for \"Mine\" with Roman White.[347] In an interview, White said that Swift \"was keenly involved in writing the treatment, casting and wardrobe. And she stayed for both the 15-hour shooting days, even when she wasn't in the scenes.\"[348]\n\nFrom 2014 to 2018, Swift collaborated with director Joseph Kahn on eight music videos\u2014four each from her albums 1989 and Reputation. Kahn has praised Swift's involvement in the craft.[349] She worked with American Express for the \"Blank Space\" music video (which Kahn directed), and served as an executive producer for the interactive app AMEX Unstaged: Taylor Swift Experience, for which she won a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Interactive Program in 2015.[350] Swift produced the music video for \"Bad Blood\" and won a Grammy Award for Best Music Video in 2016.[351]\n\nHer production house, Taylor Swift Productions, Inc., is credited with producing all of her visual media starting with her 2018 concert documentary Reputation Stadium Tour.[352] She continued to co-direct music videos for the Lover singles \"Me!\" with Dave Meyers, and \"You Need to Calm Down\" (also serving as a co-executive producer) and \"Lover\" with Drew Kirsch[353]\u2014but also ventured into sole direction with the videos for \"The Man\" (which won her the MTV Video Music Award for Best Direction), \"Cardigan\" and \"Willow\".[354] Folklore: The Long Pond Studio Sessions (2020) marked her directorial debut as a filmmaker, followed by All Too Well: The Short Film, which won her the award for Best Direction for the second time.[355] Swift has cited Chloe Zhao, Greta Gerwig, Nora Ephron, Guillermo del Toro, John Cassavetes and Noah Baumbach as her filmmaking influences.[345]\n\nOther activities\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nSwift is well known for her philanthropic efforts.[356] She was ranked at number one on DoSomething's \"Gone Good\" list,[357] and has received the \"Star of Compassion\" accolade from the Tennessee Disaster Services,[358] The Big Help Award from the Nickelodeon Kids' Choice Awards for her \"dedication to helping others\" as well as \"inspiring others through action\".[359] In 2008, she donated $100,000 to the Red Cross to help the victims of the Iowa flood.[360] Swift has performed at charity relief events, including Sydney's Sound Relief concert.[361] In response to the May 2010 Tennessee floods, Swift donated $500,000 during a telethon hosted by WSMV.[362] In 2011, Swift used a dress rehearsal of her Speak Now tour as a benefit concert for victims of recent tornadoes in the U.S., raising more than $750,000.[363] In 2016, she donated $1 million to Louisiana flood relief efforts and $100,000 to the Dolly Parton Fire Fund.[364][365] Swift donated to the Houston Food Bank after Hurricane Harvey struck the city in 2017.[366] In 2020, she donated $1 million for Tennessee tornado relief.[367]\n\nSwift is a supporter of the arts.

Red lips are generally regarded as one of her signature looks.[427] Swift onin 2012. Red lips are generally regarded as one of her signature looks.\n\nMedia outlets describe Swift as a savvy businessperson.[428] Inc. describes her as an \"incredible flywheel\" of social media buzz and virtual word-of-mouth.[429] The Ringer writer Kate Knibbs said Swift is not just a popstar, but an omnipresent \"musical biosphere unto herself\", having achieved the kind of success \"that turns a person into an institution, into an inevitability.\"[323] Swift is also known for her traditional album roll-outs, consisting of a variety of promotional activities.[430] Rolling Stone describes it as an inescapable \"multimedia bonanza\".[431] Publications have described Swift's works collectively as a musical or cinematic \"universe\", which incorporates easter eggs that are analysed by media outlets and fans.[432][433][434] She maintains an active presence on social media and a close relationship with her fans, to which many journalists attribute her success.[435][436] YouGov surveys ranked her as the world's most admired female musician in 2019\u20132021.[437]\n\nThough Swift is reluctant to publicly discuss her personal life\u2014believing it to be \"a career weakness\"[438]\u2014it is a topic of widespread media attention and tabloid speculation.[439] Clash described Swift as a lightning rod for both praise and criticism.[440] The New York Times asserted in 2013 that her \"dating history has begun to stir what feels like the beginning of a backlash\" and questioned whether she was in the midst of a \"quarter-life crisis\".[441] Critics have highlighted the misogyny and slut-shaming Swift's life and career have been subject to.[442][443] Glamour opined Swift is an easy target for male derision, triggering \"fragile male egos\".[444] The Daily Telegraph said her antennae for sexism are crucial for the industry and that she \"must continue holding people to account\".[445]\n\nSwift's fashion appeal has been picked up by publications

Evermore.[458]\n\nImpact\n\nSwift, as one of the leading music artists of the 21st-century, has impacted the music industry in many aspects.[459][436] She helped shape the modern country music scene.[460] Rosen said Swift is the first country act whose fame reached the world beyond the U.S.[280] Her chart success extended to Asia and the U.K., where country music had previously not been popular.[460][280] She is one of the first country acts to use technology and online marketing techniques such as MySpace to promote their work.[28][46] According to Entertainment Weekly, the commercial success of her debut helped the infant Big Machine go on to sign Garth Brooks and Jewel.[46] Following Swift's rise to fame, country labels became more interested in signing young singers who write their own music.[461] With her autobiographical narratives revolving around romance and heartbreak,[280] she introduced the genre to a younger generation that could relate to her.[459] Critics have since noted Swift's sound resonating in various albums released by female country singers like Kacey Musgraves, Maren Morris and Kelsea Ballerini.[462] Rolling Stone listed Swift's country music as one of the biggest influences on 2010s pop music,[463] and ranked her 80th in their 100 Greatest Country Artists of All Time list.[464]\n\nHer onstage performances with guitars contributed to the \"Taylor Swift factor\", a phenomenon to which upsurge in guitar sales to women, a previously ignored demographic, is attributed.[465][466] Pitchfork opined, Swift changed the contemporary music landscape forever with her \"unprecedented path from teenage country prodigy to global pop sensation\" and a \"singularly perceptive\" discography that consistently accommodates both musical and cultural shifts.[467] Clash stated Swift's genre-spanning career encouraged her peers to experiment with diverse sounds.[288] Billboard credited her with influencing artists to take creative ownership of their music and said she \"has the power to pull any sound she wants into mainstream orbit\".[468] Music journalist Nick Catucci wrote, in being personal and vulnerable in her lyrics, Swift helped make space for later pop stars like Billie Eilish, Ariana Grande, and Halsey to do the same.[469] According to The Guardian, Swift leads the rebirth of poptimism in the 21st-century with her ambitious artistic vision.[470]\n\nPublications consider Swift's million-selling albums an anomaly in the streaming-dominated industry following the end of the album era in the 2010s.[471][472] For this reason, musicologists Mary Fogarty and Gina Arnold regard her as \"the last great rock star\". Swift is the only artist to have four albums sell over a million copies in one week since Nielsen SoundScan began tracking sales in 1991.[471] To New York magazine, her sales figures prove that she is \"the one bending the music industry to her will\".[472] The Atlantic notes that Swift's \"reign\" defies the convention that the successful phase of an artist's career rarely lasts more than a few years.[474] She is regarded as a champion for independent record shops,[421][475] and contributed to the 21st-century vinyl revival.[476][477] Variety dubbed Swift the \"Queen of Stream\" when she set multiple records on music streaming platforms as well.[478]\n\nSwift has influenced numerous mainstream and indie music artists,[note 5] authors, screenwriters and filmmakers.[note 6] According to Billboard,[523] Business Insider,[482] and The New York Times, her albums have inspired an entire generation of singers and songwriters.[286] Journalists note how her actions have fostered debate over reforms to music streaming and prompted awareness of intellectual property rights among younger musicians, praising her ability to bring change in the industry.[524][525] Various sources deem Swift's music to be representative and paradigmatic of the millennial generation, owing to her success, musical versatility, social media presence, shows, and corporate alliance.[526] Vox called her the \"millennial Bruce Springsteen\" for telling the stories of a generation through her songs.[527] She was named Woman of the Decade for the 2010s by Billboard,[528] became the first woman to earn the title Artist of the Decade (2010s) at the American Music Awards,[529] and received the Brit Global Icon Award \"in recognition of her immense impact on music across the world\".[530]\n\nShe is also a subject of academic study;[531] University of Texas at Austin,[532] New York University,[533] and Queen's University at Kingston offer courses on Swift's discography and impact in literary and sociopolitical contexts.[534] Some of her popular songs like \"Love Story\" are studied by evolutionary psychologists to understand the relationship between popular music and human mating strategies.[536] Highlighting a 2017 Association for Psychological Science report that said usage of nature-themed words is declining in popular culture, conservation scientist Jeff Opperman opined in The New York Times that Swift's songs are \"filled with the language and images of the natural world\", bringing back nature into contemporary culture.[537] In 2022, entomologists named a new millipede species, Nannaria swiftae, in her honor.[538]\n\nAccolades and achievements\n\nSwift has won 11 Grammy Awards (including three for Album of the Year\u2014tying for the most by an artist),[539] an Emmy Award,[540] 34 American Music Awards (the most won by an artist),[541] 29 Billboard Music Awards (the most won by a woman),[542] 58 Guinness World Records,[543] 14 MTV Video Music Awards (including three Video of the Year wins\u2014the most by an act),[243] 12 Country Music Association Awards (including the Pinnacle Award),[544] eight Academy of Country Music Awards,[545] and two Brit Awards.[160] As a songwriter, she has been honored by the Nashville Songwriters Association,[56][546] the Songwriters Hall of Fame, and the National Music Publishers' Association and was the youngest person on Rolling Stone's list of the 100 Greatest Songwriters of All Time in 2015.[547][548] At the 64th BMI Awards in 2016, Swift was the first woman to be honored with an award named after its recipient.[549]\n\nFrom available data, Swift has amassed over 50 million album sales, 150 million singles sales,[550][551][552] and 114 million units in album consumption worldwide, including 78 billion streams.[233][530] She has the most number-one albums in the United Kingdom and Ireland for a female artist in this millennium,[553][554] and earned the highest income for an artist on Chinese digital music platforms\u2014RMB 159,000,000.[555] She is the only female act to have received more than 100 million global streams on Spotify in a day, with over 122 million streams on November 11, 2021.[556] She has the most entries and the most simultaneous entries for an artist on the Billboard Global 200, with 69 and 31 songs, respectively.[557] Swift's Reputation Stadium Tour (2018) broke the record for the highest-grossing North American tour ever,[558] with her being the world's highest-grossing female touring act of the 2010s.[559] Beginning with Fearless, all of her studio albums sold over a million units globally in their opening weeks.[560]\n\nIn the U.S., Swift has sold over 37.3 million albums as of 2019,[552] when Billboard placed her eighth on its Greatest of All Time Artists Chart.[561] Eight of her songs have topped the Billboard Hot 100.
