Britney Spears, the era\u2019s reigning queen of pop, married Kevin Federline. (It was her second wedding that year.) Paris Hilton gallivanted with Nicole Richie on \u201cThe Simple Life.\u201d Barbie came out with a Juicy Couture line, or vice versa. And the Simpson sisters, Ashlee and Jessica, faced the respective indignities of being caught lip-synching on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and endorsing George W. Bush for re\u00eblection. With these spray-tanned glamazons dominating the land, it\u2019s no wonder that a character like Regina George sprang from the mind of Tina Fey, whose screenplay for \u201cMean Girls\u201d gave 2004 something to crow about: a witty and withering comedy for the ages.\n\nInspired by Rosalind Wiseman\u2019s nonfiction book \u201cQueen Bees and Wannabes,\u201d \u201cMean Girls\u201d told the Faustian tale of Cady (Lindsay Lohan, truly great), a homeschooled math whiz who relocates from Africa to Illinois, where she must navigate the wilds of an American high school. At first, she falls in with a jaded, alt girl-boy duo, who persuade her to infiltrate the Plastics: a cabal of popular girls ruled by the glossy tyrant Regina (Rachel McAdams, also brilliant), whose first name gives away her unimpeachable stature. Only too late does Cady realize that she\u2019s adopted the catty behavior she was sent to undermine. Trained in the ways of the jungle, she sees girl world as a lion\u2019s den like any other, and it\u2019s up to the school\u2019s beleaguered math teacher\u2014played by Fey\u2014to set things right. As in \u201cAll About Eve\u201d (1950), the urtext of cinematic female backbiting, our heroines get beaten up but turn out the wiser for it, just as a newer model arrives to take their place.\n\n\u201cMean Girls\u201d is now a Broadway musical, at the August Wilson Theatre, with an updated script by Fey and music by her husband, Jeff Richmond. (The lyrics are by Nell Benjamin.) The show\u2019s awareness of the ways in which teen life has changed since 2004 is evident from the preshow announcement, which asks us to turn off our phones, because \u201cInstagram is a thirst trap and Snapchat is over.\u201d In 2004, Snapchat wasn\u2019t even a glimmer in a programmer\u2019s eye, and TheFacebook.com was newly hatched. Thankfully, the musical doesn\u2019t overload the story with social-media references, but there are a couple of well-placed additions. Now when Regina humiliates herself at the Christmas talent show, Twitter erupts with GIFs of her derri\u00e8re, and her subsequent run-in with a bus also goes viral. The script accounts for a few other post-Bush-era novelties, among them the poop emoji, the Left Shark meme, and \u201cbasic AF.\u201d In the taxonomy of cafeteria cliques, Fey has wisely traded \u201cUnfriendly Black Hotties\u201d for \u201cWoke Seniors.\u201d\n\nSadly, we don\u2019t hear much from the Woke Seniors, who these days would be taking their cues not from Paris Hilton but from Emma Gonz\u00e1lez. There are a few pointed suggestions of the resurgent feminism of 2018, and only one mention of the Mean Boy in the White House, who we\u2019re told has blocked Regina on Twitter. Who can blame him? As played by Taylor Louderman, she\u2019s a fearsome presence. In her first number, she barely needs to open her mouth to be heard\u2014the Broadway-belting equivalent of vocal fry\u2014as a teen chorus hoists her up to the lunch table. Cady (Erika Henningsen) quickly identifies her as the \u201capex predator\u201d and joins her coterie, which includes the insecure Gretchen (Ashley Park) and the bubble-headed Karen (Kate Rockwell, an absolute scene-stealer). The cast is all-around good, but special credit goes to Kerry Butler, who does triple duty in the adult roles originally played by Fey, Ana Gasteyer, and Amy Poehler. Also convincing are the \u201cart freaks,\u201d Janis (Barrett Wilbert Weed) and the \u201ctoo gay to function\u201d Damian (Grey Henson), who in Fey\u2019s rewrite function as narrators. Damian tap-dances with abandon, while Janis is unflappably deadpan, which is exactly how this pair would respond to being in a Broadway musical\u2014unlike Regina, who would roll her eyes if she only knew.\n\n\u201cMean Girls\u201d is far from the only film comedy from the aughts to reach Broadway\u2014we\u2019ve had \u201cLegally Blonde,\u201d \u201cSchool of Rock,\u201d \u201cBring It On,\u201d and \u201cElf,\u201d to name a few\u2014but it\u2019s one of the sturdiest. Fey\u2019s screenplay is so taut and quotable that the addition of songs seems almost gratuitous, and Richmond\u2019s music has the interchangeable pop-anthem sound that\u2019s become standard on Broadway. But who needs Tina Fey to reinvent musical comedy? She does just fine with the help of Casey Nicholaw, the director and choreographer, previously responsible for \u201cThe Book of Mormon.\u201d In moments of pure fan service, we get the one-liners we\u2019ve been waiting for, like \u201cOn Wednesdays, we wear pink\u201d\u2014sung twice, for good measure. Members of the audience, some of whom were barely sentient when Amanda Seyfried first uttered the line, lap it up.\n\nIf \u201cMean Girls\u201d has anything new to tell us, fourteen years after its original iteration, it\u2019s that meanness can be just as morally ambiguous as niceness. Fey has added a poignant scene, late in Act II. Regina, now in a spinal halo, meets Cady, now contrite, in the bathroom at the Spring Fling. \u201cI know I was harsh,\u201d Regina says. \u201cAnd people say I\u2019m a bitch. But you know what they would call me if I was a boy?\u201d \u201cStrong?\u201d Cady guesses. \u201cReginald,\u201d Regina answers. During this moment of sisterhood, I thought about another teen hero on Broadway, the titular geek of \u201cDear Evan Hansen.\u201d Like Cady, he\u2019s a social underdog who uses fraud to work his way to the top, only to learn a valuable lesson about authenticity. Both are awkward outsiders who become complicit in the pursuit of status\u2014appropriate for an era in which the alpha blonde is no longer Britney Spears but Ivanka Trump. As for Fey, I suspect that there\u2019s a little bit of both Cady and Regina in her\u2014on \u201c30 Rock,\u201d she managed to play the hapless heroine while literally running the show. And why not? She\u2019s the boss. After all, sometimes a Mean Girl is just a Nasty Woman in training.", "images": ["https://media.newyorker.com/photos/59095b2b6552fa0be682d8c7/1:1/w_270%2Cc_limit/schulman.png", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_360%2Cq_80%2Cw_480/v1519330810/thenewyorker_teens-lead-fight-for-gun-reform.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ab421560a0c3835c789a75c/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/Tolentino-Teen-Boss-Magazine.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ac794b31018e26bd33e48c4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Schulman-Mean-Girls-Musical.jpg", "https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo.f1893bac6dafe13d6d5bad671a5bee2345efa44d.svg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ac794b31018e26bd33e48c4/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Schulman-Mean-Girls-Musical.jpg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/631a4a96e5204f6cca594df5/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo-reverse.f915b516b6ca9c0c2a9bdf9b749519365b2b2e4a.svg", "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5a90489568dffb7f58f4f091/4:3/w_480%2Cc_limit/Schulman-The-Spring-Awakening-of-the-Stoneman-Douglas-Theatre-Kids.jpg", "https://www.newyorker.com/verso/static/the-new-yorker/assets/logo-header.6e34c81346bc43475ffd572e6c2eb3e125927148.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ac794b31018e26bd33e48c4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Schulman-Mean-Girls-Musical.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Michael Schulman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/tina-feys-mean-girls-is-now-a-fetch-broadway-musical", "title": "Tina Fey\u2019s \u201cMean Girls\u201d Is Now a Fetch Broadway Musical", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Michael Schulman writes about Tina Fey's \"Mean Girls,\" now a musical on Broadway.", "id": "5ac78d833ceaa266c39ee9c5", "keywords": "broadway musicals,mean girls,teen-agers", "news_keywords": "broadway musicals,mean girls,teen-agers", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ac78d833ceaa266c39ee9c5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Michael Schulman writes about Tina Fey's \\\"Mean Girls,\\\" now a musical on Broadway.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ac794b31018e26bd33e48c4/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Schulman-Mean-Girls-Musical.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ac794b31018e26bd33e48c4/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Schulman-Mean-Girls-Musical.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The beloved teen movie has made its way to the New York stage, teaching us that meanness can be just as morally ambiguous as niceness.", "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ac794b31018e26bd33e48c4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Schulman-Mean-Girls-Musical.jpg", "site_name": "The New Yorker", "title": "Tina Fey\u2019s \u201cMean Girls\u201d Is Now a Fetch Broadway Musical", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.newyorker.com/culture/culture-desk/tina-feys-mean-girls-is-now-a-fetch-broadway-musical"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-04-09T02:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-09T02:00:00.000Z", "author": "Michael Schulman"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@NewYorker", "description": "The beloved teen movie has made its way to the New York stage, teaching us that meanness can be just as morally ambiguous as niceness.", "domain": "https://www.newyorker.com", "image": "https://media.newyorker.com/photos/5ac794b31018e26bd33e48c4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Schulman-Mean-Girls-Musical.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@NewYorker", "title": "Tina Fey\u2019s \u201cMean Girls\u201d Is Now a Fetch Broadway Musical"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1147169538698836, "pages": 9258148868}, "google-signin-client_id": "275906274807-b4eqbdqr511u9msdpj8mh0pf77fcciv7.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523239200.0, "source": "https://www.newyorker.com", "summary": ""}
