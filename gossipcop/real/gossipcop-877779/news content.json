Khahsa. Previously on the show, Unglert disclosed that his mother died during his teen years and his father \u201cabandoned\u201d him and later converted to Sikhism. He hadn\u2019t seen his father in two years before their TV reunion, during which Khahsa barked during their emotional conversation, \u201cYou didn\u2019t feel love from your father? Is that what you are saying? You\u2019ve still got one fucking foot stuck in the past!\u201d\n\nIn front of a live TV audience and 17 of his fellow castmembers, Unglert continued to reflect on the eye-opening experience. \u201cHad I not gone there with Rachel,\u201d he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think that I ever would have addressed the feelings that I had suppressed for so long.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to The Hollywood Reporter following the taping, Unglert said he hopes the real takeaway from his hometown experience is religious tolerance. Some viewers criticized ABC for sensationalizing Sikhism via dramatic previews leading up to the episode\u2019s airdate. In response, Unglert took to social media days before the episode to urge viewers not to criticize his father \u201cfor his appearance or his beliefs because by doing so we are disparaging an entire faith and culture.\u201d\n\nHe elaborated further to THR on set: \u201cI hate that it even has to be a topic, to be honest. I think that the real takeaway for America is just a thought of tolerance and to not be too quick to judge anyone just because they look a certain way. There\u2019s a lot of people, whether it be in America or somewhere else, that dress like that for religious purposes, so it\u2019s sort of unfair to the whole culture.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelorette castoff revealed Monday that he gave show producers his father\u2019s phone number after realizing Lindsay could be the one. \u201cI saw myself getting to the point where I could propose to Rachel. I would never ask someone to marry me without them having full knowledge of my family dynamic,\u201d Unglert explained.\n\nThough his time with Lindsay during the special was brief, Unglert elaborated further to THR that he \u201cdefinitely received closure\u201d from her, but that processing the breakup was initially challenging.\n\n\u201cIt was definitely different than every other breakup because you\u2019re so invested in the relationship,\u201d he says. \u201cIn a normal relationship, you\u2019re also invested in, like, work and friends, but [on The Bachelorette] you\u2019re only invested in that one person. So, I think initially it\u2019s very, very difficult. But once your friends are there to help you through it, it definitely helps you cope.\u201d\n\nUnglert was one of four men who met Lindsay ahead of her official season premiere during Nick Viall\u2019s Bachelor: After the Final Rose special. He received some backlash for his pickup line (\u201cI\u2019m ready to go black and I\u2019m never going back\u201d), but it appears Lindsay was not turned off by it, as the Californian made the final four. She broke up with Unglert directly after his dramatic hometown date, but asserted during Men Tell All that she was in fact \u201cfalling in love\u201d with him. Before wrapping the special, Unglert made it clear \u201cshe\u2019s always going to have a piece of my heart.\u201d\n\nUnglert confirmed Monday he will have another opportunity to find love on the franchise, when Bachelor in Paradise season four debuts with a two-night premiere on Aug. 14 and Aug. 15. The spinoff series based in Sayulita, Mexico, was initially set to bow Aug. 8, but filming was temporarily suspended after a producer filed a misconduct allegation over a sexual encounter between two of the contestants, Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson, the latter of whom was also present at Men Tell All. Producers continued filming once the internal investigation found no signs of misconduct. Unglert offered no hints of his Paradise experience, other than a wide smile from ear-to-ear during Harrison\u2019s announcement. A week ago, Unglert posted a video on Instagram of him and confirmed Paradise castmember Raven Gates.\n\nThe rest of Unglert\u2019s on-set chat with THR follows.\n\nDeMario Jackson has been in the public eye on and off TV in the wake of the Bachelor in Paradise investigation. What did you think of the way he was today on set in comparison to how he usually was in the house?\n\nDeMario tonight was very exemplative of what he typically is. He\u2019s got a big heart. He\u2019s in a rebellious phase right now, I would say.\n\n#DeanForBachelor was trending after your elimination. Have you thought about being the next Bachelor?\n\nI\u2019d say I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet, at this point in my life. Of course, I would never immediately dismiss any offer, but I think I\u2019d really have to sit down and really think about it.\n\nThe Lee Garrett vs. Kenny King feud and the topic of racism was discussed frequently on the show and again during the Men Tell All reunion. Yet, Rachel said she didn\u2019t want race to dictate her season. How do you feel about the spotlight that was put on race, not just tonight, but throughout the entire season?\n\nI think it was pretty inevitable. I thought about this a little beforehand. There are two schools of thought you can have going into it: either celebrate Rachel\u2019s proud African-American heritage, or you can completely disregard it and just treat it as a regular season. So there\u2019s really no right or wrong answer to that question, I guess. But the spotlight that the whole Lee situation put on it was definitely unfair to Rachel because it took away from her experience and Kenny\u2019s. I feel for them more so than anything else.\n\nHow do you feel about the fact that there was so much time devoted to it during the Men Tell All, especially in regards to Lee?\n\nI think the fact that we spent so much time talking about it as we did tonight was good. It was a very difficult topic, but at the end of the day, it needs to be talked about. There\u2019s a lot of people that feel the same way that Lee does, and until those conversations are able to stop being had then it\u2019s worth talking about.\n\nDid any of those heavy conversations while filming ever make you feel uncomfortable or overwhelmed?\n\nNo, I mean I\u2019m always uncomfortable. So the conversation about race doesn\u2019t affect me whatsoever. We\u2019re all people at the end of the day.\n\nIs there anything you would change this season if you could go back in time?\n\nI\u2019d probably pack more clothes.\n\nThe Bachelorette returns Aug. 7 for its three-hour season finale. In a franchise first, three (instead of two) suitors will continue vying for Lindsay\u2019s heart during the final episode.\n\nSydney Odman contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/147165_2873-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/147165_2873-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Schoellkopf"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelorettes-dean-unglert-says-hes-not-ready-be-next-bachelor-1025680/", "title": "\u2018Bachelorette\u2019 Star Dean Unglert on Being the Next Bachelor: \u201cI Don\u2019t Think I\u2019m Ready Yet\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Unglert will once again compete for love on this summer's 'Bachelor' spinoff series 'Bachelor in Paradise.'", "news_keywords": "ABC, Bachelor In Paradise, The Bachelor, The Bachelorette", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Christina Schoellkopf", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1025680, "title": "'Bachelorette' Star Dean Unglert on Being the Next Bachelor: \"I Don\u2019t Think I'm Ready Yet\"", "published_at": "2017-08-01 07:10:52", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/147165_2873-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The Bachelorette", "topics": "TV News", "body": "Monday's The\u00a0Bachelorette: Men Tell All special was a big night for fan-favorite Dean Unglert.\r\nThe 26-year-old startup recruiter from Venice addressed the ABC reality franchise's portrayal of his\u00a0controversial hometown date\u00a0and came face-to-face with Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay for the first time since she broke up with him on TV.\r\n\"That was the realest and most raw moment that I've had throughout the entire experience,\" he told host Chris Harrison during the annual cast reunion show.\r\nTwo weeks ago, Bachelorette viewers met his father, Harold Unglert, who now goes by the chosen name of\u00a0Paramroop S.
