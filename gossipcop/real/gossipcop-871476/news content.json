{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cobra_Kai", "text": "American martial arts comedy-drama television series\n\nCobra Kai is an American martial arts comedy-drama television series and a sequel to the original The Karate Kid films by Robert Mark Kamen.[2] The series was created by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg, and is distributed by Sony Pictures Television. The series was released on YouTube Red / YouTube Premium for the first two seasons, before moving to Netflix starting with the third. The series stars Ralph Macchio and William Zabka, who reprise their roles as Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence from the 1984 film The Karate Kid and its sequels, The Karate Kid Part II (1986) and The Karate Kid Part III (1989).\n\nThe first season launched on YouTube Red on May 2, 2018, with a second season following on April 24, 2019. After production of season three was completed, YouTube decided to stop producing scripted original programming, leaving the show without a home. Netflix acquired the series in June 2020, and therefore, began releasing new seasons on their platform. The third season was released on January 1, 2021.[3] Netflix renewed the series for a fourth season, which was released on December 31, 2021 and a fifth, which was released on September 9, 2022.[6][7]\n\nSet 34 years later, Cobra Kai continues the original Karate Kid saga, last seen in The Next Karate Kid (1994). In particular, it re-examines the \"Miyagi-Verse\" narrative from Johnny's point of view, his decision to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo, and the rekindling of his old rivalry with Daniel.[8] Cobra Kai also stars Courtney Henggeler, Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, Tanner Buchanan, Mary Mouser, Jacob Bertrand, Gianni DeCenzo, Peyton List, Vanessa Rubio and Dallas Dupree Young, with Martin Kove and Thomas Ian Griffith also reprising their roles from the films.\n\nThe series attained high viewership on both YouTube and Netflix, and has received critical acclaim for its writing, performances, action sequences, humor, character development, and homage to the previous films. It has received numerous awards and nominations, with the third season being nominated for Outstanding Comedy Series at the 73rd Primetime Emmy Awards.\n\nSummary\n\nThirty-four years after being defeated by Daniel LaRusso in the 1984 All-Valley Karate Tournament in The Karate Kid (1984), Johnny Lawrence, now in his 50s, works as a part-time handyman and lives in an apartment in Reseda, Los Angeles, having fallen far from the wealthy lifestyle in Encino that he had been accustomed to growing up, due to suffering from depression and alcoholism after being traumatized by John Kreese's assault against him in The Karate Kid Part II (1986). He has an estranged son named Robby from a previous relationship, whom he has abandoned.\n\nDuring the first season, after losing his job due to an argument with one of his clients, a down-and-out Johnny uses karate to defend his new teenage neighbor Miguel Diaz from a group of bullies. Initially reluctant, Johnny agrees to train Miguel in karate and decides to reopen the Cobra Kai karate dojo as a chance to recapture his past; however, this act reawakens his rivalry with Daniel, who was a 2-time All Valley champion and is now the owner of a highly successful car dealership chain, is married to co-owner Amanda, and has two children: Samantha and Anthony. Daniel is finally living the wealthy lifestyle he envied as a kid when he lived in Reseda. However, after his friend and mentor Mr. Miyagi died, Daniel's struggle to meaningfully connect with his children has disrupted the balance in his life. Meanwhile, Johnny's dojo attracts a group of bullied social outcasts who find camaraderie and self-confidence under his tutelage, a marked contrast to the kind of students Johnny and his friends were when training in the original Cobra Kai run by Kreese. Johnny develops a bond with Miguel in a manner that resembles the relationship between Daniel and Mr. Miyagi. Cobra Kai's philosophy, however, remains mostly unchanged, though Johnny tries to infuse it with more honor than Kreese did. On the other hand, Robby gets a job at Daniel's car dealership to get back at Johnny for abandoning him. Later, he develops a rivalry with Miguel reminiscent of the rivalry between Daniel and Johnny.\n\nIn the second season, following Cobra Kai's victory at the 2018 All-Valley Karate Tournament, Kreese returns and his efforts to restore the dojo to its former glory begin to interfere with Johnny's attempts to reform it. Meanwhile, Daniel reopens the Miyagi-Do dojo with Robby and Sam as his students in response to Cobra Kai's success, sparking a massive rivalry between the two dojos. After a brutal school brawl on the first day of school at the end of season two, Johnny is kicked out of the Cobra Kai dojo by Kreese, and agrees to partner with Daniel to bring down the dojo.\n\nThe third and fourth seasons revolve around their efforts to finish off Kreese once and for all by preparing for the next All-Valley Karate Tournament. However, things are complicated when Kreese brings in Terry Silver, his old partner and friend from The Karate Kid Part III (1989), who proves to be a more dangerous and insidious enemy than Kreese himself.\n\nThe fifth season continues Daniel and Johnny's efforts to bring down Cobra Kai, which is now run by Silver following a cheated victory at the 2019 All-Valley Karate Tournament and Kreese being arrested after Silver frames him for attempted murder. Daniel also brings in his former rivals Chozen Toguchi and Mike Barnes for help. The story's development revolves around these primary relationships, which lead to conflicts that began with Daniel and Johnny's inability to let go of the past.\n\nCast and characters\n\nMain cast\n\nSupporting cast\n\nThe following characters only appear via archival footage from the film series:\n\nEpisodes\n\nSeason Episodes Originally released Network 1 10 May 2, 2018 ( ) YouTube Red 2 10 April 24, 2019 ( ) YouTube Premium 3 10 January 1, 2021 ( ) Netflix 4 10 December 31, 2021 ( ) 5 10 September 9, 2022 ( )\n\nProduction\n\nThe thematic genesis for Cobra Kai began with two works of pop culture. First, the 2007 music video for the song \"Sweep the Leg\" by No More Kings stars William Zabka (who also directed the video) as a caricature of himself as Johnny, and features references to The Karate Kid, including cameo appearances by Zabka's former Karate Kid co-stars.[10][11] In a 2010 interview, Zabka jokingly discussed this video in the context of his vision that Johnny was the true hero of the film.[12] Then, in 2013, Macchio and Zabka made guest appearances as themselves in the television sitcom How I Met Your Mother (\"The Bro Mitzvah\"). In the episode, Macchio is invited to Barney Stinson's bachelor party, leading to Barney shouting that he hates Macchio and that Johnny was the real hero of The Karate Kid. Towards the end of the episode, a clown in the party wipes off his makeup and reveals himself as Zabka.[13]\n\nDevelopment\n\nCobra Kai was greenlit on August 4, 2017, with ten half-hour episodes, written and executive produced by Josh Heald, Jon Hurwitz, and Hayden Schlossberg. Although the series received offers from Netflix, Amazon, Hulu, and AMC, it ultimately ended up on the subscription service YouTube Red.[14][15] The trio was joined by executive producers James Lassiter and Caleeb Pinkett of Overbrook Entertainment in association with Sony Pictures Television.[16] YouTube Premium released the first season on May 2, 2018, and the second season on April 24, 2019. The creators of the series explored moving to another platform ahead of the season two premiere, but the deal did not go through.[17]\n\nThe third season was produced for YouTube and was initially set for a 2020 release.[18][19] However, on May 28, 2020, Deadline Hollywood announced that the series would be leaving YouTube and moving to another streaming platform, ahead of its third-season premiere. As YouTube was not interested in renewing the series for a fourth season, the producers wanted to find a streaming venue that would leave that option open.[20]\n\nOn June 22, 2020, it was announced that the show would be moving to Netflix, taking the third season with them.[21] Netflix released the first two seasons from YouTube on August 28, 2020, and the new third season on January 1, 2021.[3] On October 2, 2020, Netflix announced an early renewal for a fourth season, prior to season 3 being released.[22] As part of a video and letter to its shareholders in April 2021, Netflix's co-chief executive officer and chief content officer, Ted Sarandos confirmed that the fourth season of Cobra Kai would appear sometime in Q4 2021.[23][24] On August 27, 2021, ahead of the fourth season premiere, Netflix renewed the series for a fifth season, which premiered on September 9, 2022.[6][7]\n\nMiyagi-Verse\n\nCharacters from the original four films The Karate Kid (1984), The Karate Kid Part II (1986), The Karate Kid Part III (1989), The Next Karate Kid (1994) comprise the Miyagi-verse that shapes Cobra Kai. Thus, after the launch of season 1, Elisabeth Shue (Ali Mills) from The Karate Kid,[25][26] Tamlyn Tomita (Kumiko) and Yuji Okumoto (Chozen Toguchi) from The Karate Kid II,[26] and Robyn Lively (Jessica Andrews)[27] and Thomas Ian Griffith (Terry Silver) from The Karate Kid III, all discussed whether or not they would like to appear in the series.[28] Sean Kanan (Mike Barnes)[29] (also from Karate Kid III) stated in a 2021 interview (when asked if Barnes will appear in the series) that \"you probably haven't seen the last of him.\"[30] Finally, although Hilary Swank (who as Julie Pierce replaced Daniel as Mr. Miyagi's student in The Next Karate Kid), has neither confirmed nor denied her interest, she did acknowledge that it would be a chance to have a \"showdown\" with Ralph Macchio.[31] In December 2020, the series' co-creators stated that: \"In our writers' room we speak about literally every character that has appeared in the Miyagi-verse, so it's obvious that we've spoken about Julie Pierce. As to whether or not she'll return to the series, that's something you'll just have to wait to find out.\"[32]\n\nIn 2020, Jon Hurwitz clarified that the \"Karate Kid cartoon is not canon. But there is an Easter egg from it in season 3,\" in response to the question as to whether \"the Karate Kid animated series [is] official within the Karate Kid universe?\" The Easter egg was \"the Miyagi-Do shrine, briefly seen at Chozen Toguchi's dojo in Okinawa halfway through the season. The artifacts were recovered by Daniel LaRusso and Mister Miyagi in the short-lived Karate Kid animated series, which ran for thirteen episodes in 1989.\"[34]\n\nIn a 2021 interview with Slashfilm, the writers noted that they will not be using characters from the 2010 film The Karate Kid, as they are not a part of the \"Miyagi-verse\": \"We've ruled that out completely. Jackie Chan is mentioned in season 1 of the show as an actor, so I think in our world, Jackie Chan is an actor and a performer. If the characters on our show have seen a movie called The Karate Kid, they've seen that one.\"[35]\n\nCasting\n\nIn season 1, Ralph Macchio and William Zabka revived their Karate Kid characters, Daniel LaRusso and Johnny Lawrence. Additional Karate Kid actors included Randee Heller, who reprised her role as Lucille LaRusso (Daniel's mother),[36] and Martin Kove, who revived his role as John Kreese.[37] The cast list for season 1 was announced on October 24, 2017, and included Xolo Maridue\u00f1a, Mary Mouser, Tanner Buchanan, and Courtney Henggeler. Ed Asner was cast in a guest role as Johnny's verbally abusive step-father, Sid Weinberg.[38][39] On December 19, 2017, Vanessa Rubio joined the cast as Miguel's mother.[40]\n\nIn season 2, Ralph Macchio, William Zabka, Xolo Mariduena, Tanner Buchanan, Mary Mouser, and Courtney Henggeler all returned,[37] with Jacob Bertrand, Gianni DeCenzo, and Martin Kove being promoted to series regulars and newcomers Paul Walter Hauser and Peyton List joining the cast.[41][42] Actors from The Karate Kid, Rob Garrison (Tommy), Ron Thomas (Bobby), Tony O'Dell (Jimmy), and Randee Heller (Lucille LaRusso) made guest appearances during this season.\n\nIn season 3, Ralph Macchio, William Zabka, Xolo Mariduena, Tanner Buchanan, Mary Mouser, and Courtney Henggeler all returned. Actors from The Karate Kid and The Karate Kid II, Elisabeth Shue (Ali Mills), Ron Thomas (Bobby), Tamlyn Tomita (Kumiko), Traci Toguchi (Yuna), and Yuji Okumoto (Chozen Toguchi) all made guest appearances during this season.\n\nIn season 4, Vanessa Rubio and Peyton List were promoted to series regulars,[43] while Dallas Dupree Young and Oona O'Brien were cast in recurring roles.[43] In addition, Thomas Ian Griffith reprised his role as Terry Silver from The Karate Kid III,[44] and actors from The Karate Kid and The Karate Kid II, Yuji Okumoto (Chozen Toguchi)[45] and Randee Heller (Lucille LaRusso), made guest appearances.\n\nIn season 5, Yuji Okumoto had a recurring role as Chozen Toguchi.[46] In addition, Sean Kanan reprised his role as Mike Barnes and Robyn Lively reprised her role as Jessica Andrews from The Karate Kid III.[47] Alicia Hannah-Kim also joined the cast as Kim Da-Eun. Dallas Dupree Young, who joined the show in season four as Kenny Payne, was upgraded to a series regular.[48]\n\nFilming\n\nPrincipal photography for the first season began in October 2017 in Atlanta, Georgia. Filming took place at various locations throughout that month at places including Union City, Marietta, and the Briarcliff Campus of Emory University.[49] In November 2017, shooting moved to locales such as the North Atlanta Soccer Association Tophat fields in East Cobb.[50] In December 2017, the production was working out of Marietta and Conyers.[51] Various exterior shots were also filmed in parts of Los Angeles such as Tarzana and Encino.[52] Exterior locations included Golf N' Stuff in Norwalk and the South Seas Apartments in Reseda, both of which were originally featured in The Karate Kid.[53]\n\nPrincipal photography for the second season began in September 2018 in Atlanta, Georgia. In October 2018, production continued around Atlanta with shooting also occurring in Marietta.[54] In November 2018, the series was filming in Union City.[55] In December 2018, shooting transpired at the closed Rio Bravo Cantina restaurant in Atlanta.[56]\n\nPrincipal photography for the fourth season began in February 2021 and ended in April 2021 in Atlanta, Georgia.[57]\n\nFilming for the fifth season began in September 2021, and finished in December 2021.[58]\n\nRelease\n\nMarketing\n\nIn January 2018, the series was promoted at the annual Television Critics Association's winter press tour where YouTube's global head of original content Susanne Daniels described the show saying, \"It is a half an hour format but I would call it a dramedy. I think it leans into the tone of the movies in that there are dramatic moments throughout. I think it's very faithful really in some ways to what the movie set about doing, the lessons imparted in the movie if you will. It's next generation Karate Kid.\"[59]\n\nThe first trailer was released on February 15, 2018,[60] the second on March 1, 2018,[61] and the third a week later.[62] The final official trailer was released on March 21, 2018, and included the announcement that the show would premiere on May 2, 2018.[63]\n\nOn April 17, 2019, YouTube Premium released a six-minute commercial parodying ESPN's 30 for 30, featuring the main cast members and select ESPN personalities analyzing the 1984 match between Daniel and Johnny.[64][65] It was nominated for a Clio Award.[66]\n\nPremiere\n\nThe series held its world premiere on April 24, 2018, at the SVA Theatre in New York City, New York, during the annual Tribeca Film Festival. Following the screening, a discussion was held with writers, directors, and executive producers Hayden Schlossberg, Jon Hurwitz, and Josh Heald, in addition to series stars and co-executive producers William Zabka and Ralph Macchio.[67]\n\nOn April 25, 2018, YouTube partnered with Fathom Events for special screenings of the first two episodes of the series at around 700 movie theaters across the United States. The event also included a screening of the original film.[68][69]\n\nReception\n\nCritical response\n\nCritical response of Cobra Kai Season Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic 1 100% (49 reviews) 72 (11 reviews) 2 90% (31 reviews) 66 (7 reviews) 3 90% (51 reviews) 72 (15 reviews) 4 95% (37 reviews) 70 (8 reviews) 5 100% (35 reviews) 78 (7 reviews)\n\nAll five seasons of Cobra Kai have received positive critical reviews.
