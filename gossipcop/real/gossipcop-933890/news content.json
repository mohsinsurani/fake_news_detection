Groff starred in HBO\u2019s Looking and he also returned to Broadway to play King George III in the smash hit Hamilton, receiving a second Tony nomination.\n\nLester Cohen/WireImage\n\nSince announcing her engagement to Reich last month, Michele revealed that she had no idea Reich\u2019s romantic Hamptons proposal was coming.\n\n\u201cI was so surprised,\u201d she explained during an appearance on Watch What Happens Live last week.\n\n\u201cI kept saying, \u2018Stop joking around. Stop joking around,\u201d she continued. \u201cBut it was so great.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

previously told PEOPLE that when she\u2019s not busy working, she likes to spend as much time as possible hanging out at home with Reich.\n\n\u201cWhen I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m at home with my cat, with my family, with my boyfriend, with the people that I love \u2014 and that\u2019s how I reset, and that\u2019s how I center myself,\u201d Michele said. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to tune out the noise and the unnecessary, and just focus on the people that you love because they know you better than anyone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very happy and I think that you can tell,\u201d she added. \u201cI don\u2019t really talk a lot about my personal life, but I\u2019m also the kind of person where I always say, \u2018You will see how happy I am just by looking at my face.\u2019 I can\u2019t hide it.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/BxLfGSIRdtKQyvXGAnsTJVYxvHM=/1656x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/lea-michele-1b15809675ff4abbbce607f55b1d5f13.jpg",
