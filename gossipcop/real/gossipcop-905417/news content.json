I really wonder, now that I have the time to think about it, how I did seven years of that show because just the legal dialogue alone. My mind was never still.\u201d\n\nMargulies said that right after she taped the last episode, she got sick. \u201cI have been really actually wondering how I just kept going. So the exhaustion when it all finally ended, hit me with a bout of the chickenpox for two weeks. I felt like, sort of my body having to shut down and shed seven years of great hard work and start anew. I really took it that way.\u201d\n\nRelated Link: \u2018The Good Wife\u2019 series finale reaches a frustrating verdict\n\nMargulies, who has won two Emmy Awards for her work on \u201cThe Good Wife,\u201d admitted that she was surprised the hit show wasn\u2019t nominated this year.\n\n\u201cI thought this season was our strongest season, to be honest,\u201d Margulies said. \u201cIt\u2019s someone else\u2019s turn. I\u2019ve won plenty and I\u2019ve been nominated plenty.\u201d\n\nMargulies didn\u2019t pause long before for taking on a new role. She\u2019ll play Richard Gere\u2019s wife in the upcoming movie, \u201cThe Three Christs of Ypsilanti.\u201d The film is already in production and Margulies said she\u2019s enjoying her new gig.\n\n\u201cOh, it\u2019s heaven,\u201d she said. \u201cHe is genuine, he\u2019s not fussy [Gere]. After our first day, it was as if we had been married for 10 years already. He\u2019s just lovely, I mean honestly, he\u2019s truly a dream.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160523194121-22-netflix-amazon-hulu-itunes-june.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_843,w_1498,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160803111041-julianna-margulies-ace.jpg?q=x_27,y_19,h_1628,w_2893,c_crop/h_270,w_480"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160523194121-22-netflix-amazon-hulu-itunes-june.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_843,w_1498,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/03/entertainment/julianna-margulies-the-good-wife/index.html", "title": "Julianna Margulies on life after 'The Good Wife'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Julianna Margulies on life after 'The Good Wife': I got the chickenpox | CNN", "description": "Julianna Margulies isn't missing \"The Good Wife,\" just yet.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160523194121-22-netflix-amazon-hulu-itunes-june.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_843,w_1498,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2016/08/03/entertainment/julianna-margulies-the-good-wife/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Julianna Margulies on life after 'The Good Wife': I got the chickenpox | CNN", "description": "Julianna Margulies isn't missing \"The Good Wife,\" just yet.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160523194121-22-netflix-amazon-hulu-itunes-june.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_843,w_1498,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Julianna Margulies isn't missing \"The Good Wife,\" just yet.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2016-08-03T16:31:51Z", "modified_time": "2016-08-03T16:32:49Z", "tag": "chicken pox, diseases and disorders, health and medical, infectious diseases", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "chicken pox, diseases and disorders, health and medical, infectious diseases", "author": "Chloe Melas", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1470178800.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
