The Honest Company was just getting going when\n\nher younger daughter, Haven, was a baby, so she joined Alba there, too. Now, it's Hayes' turn to be\n\nthe office baby at the Honest Company.\n\n\"I just cart them along and bring them along with me. It's kind of my way of doing it. I don't know\n\nif it's the right way, but it's kind of how I figured it out to try and get those moments in and\n\nstill feel like I have a presence in their lives,\" she explains. \"I get to bring him to work, and I\n\nhave in my office a little playmat and a Pack N' Play. He can nap here, and we have a portable high\n\nchair.\"\n\nOwning your own baby-centric company certainly has its perks, not the least of which is having\n\naccess to all your own products. The Honest Company is just launching a new,\n\n\n\nmore absorbent diaper with new fall prints\n\n\n\n, and of course Hayes was the first baby to rock them.\n\n\"I have been trying the diapers really since Hayes was born because we had them,\" says Alba, who\n\nsays that, like her kids, the company has really grown over the last six years and the experience\n\nis noticeable in the new diaper designs. \"They're awesome, when it comes to the softness you can\n\nreally feel the difference.\"", "images": ["https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ARTICLE-HERO-Sand-Background-2022-10-06T092756.435-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/motherly-logo.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20450%20360'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1106024069411107&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ARTICLE-HERO-Sand-Background-2022-10-05T103722.356-450x360.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/ARTICLE-HERO-Sand-Background-2022-10-07T123554.197-450x360.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20273%20487'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/themes/motherly/assets/svg/hero-flower-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids-featured-e1644525528694.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Marcoux"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/jessica-alba-life-with-3-kids/", "title": "Real talk with Jessica Alba: Bedtime might be the most challenging part of having 3 kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "Jessica Alba also opens up about the perks of her kids' age gap and what she and husband Cash Warren do to help each child feel special.
