Meredith was a beacon I had to reach for.\u201d\n\nMcNamara died in April 2016, leaving the comedian to care for their 8-year-old daughter, Alice.\n\nBut Oswalt, Salenger and their closest friends and family strongly believe it was McNamara who orchestrated their meeting from above.\n\nJeff Vespa/Vespa Pictures\n\n\u201cWhen I first starting talking with Patton on Facebook, it was just sort of witty banter,\u201d says Salenger, 47. \u201cThere was nothing to it, but as I started getting to know him better, I looked up Michelle on Facebook and I saw that we had like 15 mutual friends. One of them was my best friend since 7th grade. I called her and was like, \u2018Tell me about Michelle.\u2019 She was best friends with Michelle after college. She was like, \u2018I loved her. She\u2019s amazing. She\u2019s so funny and smart.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe adds, \u201cWhen I met Patton and Alice, it just felt so, so right. I never thought I\u2019d get married, but then I fell madly in love.\u201d\n\nJordan Strauss/Invision/AP\n\nOswalt felt blessed that his new wife was able to bond with McNamara\u2019s family as well.\n\n\u201cIt just felt like worlds were connecting and everything was okay again,\u201d says Oswalt. \u201cWe\u2019re still floating on this other level that we\u2019ve been on since the day we met.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve only ever felt that level of joy once before in my life, and it was so profound and perfect it felt greedy to ever wish for it again,\u201d he says. \u201cBut I did, so now all I can do is show Meredith a level of gratitude and love that\u2019s greater than the joy she\u2019s brought me, and my daughter Alice. Because this is a new level of joy, and a new life, and I\u2019ll always strive to deserve it.\u201d", "images":
