Currently at 96% with 23 reviews on Rotten Tomatoes, \u201cStranger Things\u201d seems to have captured the same spooky magic in its sophomore season.\n\nFor those who need a recap, here\u2019s where the first season left off (spoiler alert!): Mike, Lucas, and Dustin successfully brought their friend Will back from the alternate dimension known as the Upside Down. Unfortunately, their psychic friend and ex-government lab rat Eleven vanishes while protecting her friends from the monstrous Demogorgon, leaving audiences to wonder if she died or was sucked into the Upside Down. Life seems to return to normal for the young heroes \u2014 however, Will coughs up a black, worm-like creature into his sink, indicating that he\u2019s not out of the woods yet.\n\nHere\u2019s what the critics are saying about the new season:\n\nVariety\u2018s Maureen Ryan:\n\n\u201cUntil \u2018Stranger Things 2\u2019 really gets going \u2014 and that takes a while \u2014 it trails an air of self-consciousness that veers into strained fan service at times. The good news is, the show\u2019s core cast remains an extremely versatile and effective ensemble, and once the story kicks into a higher gear about halfway through the nine-episode season, a lot of the old magic returns.\u201d\n\nUproxx\u2019s Alan Sepinwall:\n\n\u201cThe whole thing could very easily fall prey to all the worst symptoms of sequelitis, but despite some bumps along the way \u2014 one bad storytelling choice in particular \u2014 \u2018Stranger Things 2\u2019 largely justifies its existence. The first season\u2019s epilogue left me with no interest in returning to this world, yet I had an enormous smile on my face for a lot of the new episodes, and particularly the last two, which turn out to be a tighter and more exciting climax than we got last time around.\u201d\n\nUSA Today\u2019s Kelly Lawler:\n\n\u201cOverall, the new season has a stronger character focus, and some of the supporting roles from Season 1 are fleshed out to great effect, particularly Lucas, Dustin and Steve (Joe Keery), who may end up being the fan-favorite breakout of the year (sorry, Barb)\u2026 Season 2 is still a mostly satisfying binge-watch that makes good use of a talented multi-generational cast and an intriguing mythology. \u2018Stranger\u2019 is right there in the series\u2019 title, and it would be stronger by branching into strangeness in more than just its monsters.\u201d\n\nTV Line\u2019s Matt Webb Mitovich:\n\n\u201cIn the parlance of Mike Wheeler and friends, \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 2 is the \u2018Empire Strikes Back\u2019 to the first season\u2019s \u2018Star Wars,\u2019 in that it\u2019s a highly anticipated follow-up where the stakes are higher for a band of unlikely heroes. But also because just as Luke Skywalker spent much of that sequel on his own journey, so does Eleven here \u2014 which is perhaps the otherwise engaging sophomore season\u2019s only shortcoming.\u201d\n\nRolling Stone\u2019s Rob Sheffield:\n\n\u201cThe new season is darker \u2013 it\u2019s a genuine horror show \u2013 but it still has that same emotional power and a mundanely empathetic sense of grief and loss\u2026Everybody in this story has seen people die or disappear for no good reason, and no matter how bravely they search for answers, sometimes the answers don\u2019t come. That\u2019s the real power of \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 \u2013 once you come into contact with the monsters, even if you escape from the Upside Down, you might not be able to come all the way back home.\u201d\n\nIndiewire\u2019s Ben Travers:\n\n\u201c\u2018Stranger Things 2\u2019 is big. Everything about it is big. Its story is big, its emotions are big, its music cues, homages, and characters are all big, big, big. With an additional episode, a handful of new faces, more money in the budget and inflated ideas to match, the sequel season to Netflix\u2019s breakout original series is a conscious move to broaden its scope and lengthen its story. Season 2 takes a while to get going, and there are more growing pains other than additional setup, but the first season\u2019s lively spirit perseveres for a largely thrilling adventure that\u2019s hard not to enjoy.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Beast\u2019s Kevin Fallon:\n\n\u201cDespite its awards-show attention and popularity, it\u2019s safe to say that last season, \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 wasn\u2019t exactly the best show on television. But it was unequivocally the most fun. That\u2019s where fans can breathe easy. There are nits to pick about the new season\u2019s plots and pacing. But in the end, it\u2019s still a hell of a lot of fun to watch.\u201d\n\nCollider\u2019s Allison Keene:\n\n\u201cThe Duffer Brothers have again managed to wield their particular alchemy and create a follow-up worthy of the hype created by its predecessor. \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 is not reinventing television, but it does once again provide a highly entertaining, extremely bingeable, and even surprisingly heartwarming viewing experience.\u201d", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eleven.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eleven.jpg?w=1000", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eleven.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Fernandez"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/stranger-things-season-2-reviews-1202597112/", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 2 Reviews: What the Critics Are Saying", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Stranger Things 2\" expands on the horror of its world and the charm of its characters, though it suffers a few story missteps.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202597112, "author": "Matt Fernandez", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-10-23T15:38:24"}, "pmc-tag": "Netflix,Stranger Things", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 Season 2 Reviews: What the Critics Are Saying", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Matt Fernandez", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "application-name": "Variety", "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/stranger-things-season-2-reviews-1202597112/?ia_markup=1"}, "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202597112, "title": "'Stranger Things' Season 2 Reviews: What the Critics Are Saying", "published_at": "2017-10-23 15:38:24", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/eleven.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 6, "tags": "Stranger Things", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "As Halloween draws near, so does the debut of the second season of Netflix's \"Stranger Things.\" Will it live up to the hype after Season 1 ended up becoming a surprise hit?\r\n\r\nThe show took 2016 by storm, drawing audiences in with its '80s nostalgia, lovable cast, and eerie story, and fans have waited for more than a year to binge watch their way back to Hawkins, Ind.
