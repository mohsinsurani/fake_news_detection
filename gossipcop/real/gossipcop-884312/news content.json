{"url": "https://people.com/music/tom-petty-cardiac-arrest-hospitalized/", "text": "Tom Petty was found unconscious and not breathing in his Malibu home Sunday night after suffering a full cardiac arrest, TMZ reports. Law enforcement officials tell the outlet that the 66-year-old rock legend was rushed to UCLA Santa Monica Hospital where he was put on life support and his pulse returned. Later the decision was reportedly made to remove him from life support after it was found that he was lacking brain activity.\n\nLos Angeles County Fire Department officials confirm to PEOPLE that they were dispatched to the Malibu home of an unconscious male around 10:45 p.m. on Sunday night and transported him to a local hospital. The Blast confirmed a 66-year-old man was transported from an address matching Petty\u2019s.\n\nThough his current condition is unknown, he was found in critical condition.\n\nFellow music star Sheryl Crow tweeted her well wishes to Petty, saying \u201cI love you so much. You are in my prayers.\u201d\n\nPetty first burst onto the music scene in 1976 with his group, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers. The band scored a string of hits over several decades, including \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d \u201cFree Falin\u2019,\u201d \u201cRefugee\u201d and \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down.\u201d He was also a member of the supergroup collective the Traveling Wilburys in the late \u201980s alongside Bob Dylan, George Harrison, Roy Orbison and Jeff Lynne.\n\nAngela Weiss/Getty\n\nLast Monday, Petty concluded his extensive recent tour\u2014which kicked off on April\u2014at the Hollywood Bowl. In December he admitted to Rolling Stone that the trek, done to honor the 40th anniversary of the Heartbreakers\u2019 debut, would likely be \u201cthe last big one.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all on the backside of our 60s,\u201d he continued. \u201cI have a granddaughter now I\u2019d like to see as much as I can. I don\u2019t want to spend my life on the road. This tour will take me away for four months. With a little kid, that\u2019s a lot of time.\u201d", "images":
