The British soulman returns with \u201cToo Good At Goodbyes,\u201d his first release since 2015\u2019s \u201cWriting\u2019s On The Wall\u201d from Spectre, which became the first James Bond theme to hit No. 1 on the Official U.K. Singles Chart.\n\nWritten with longstanding collaborator Jimmy Napes and Stargate, \u201cToo Good At Goodbyes\u201d builds into a gospel chorus and showcases Smith\u2019s exceptional range. The torch track is \u201cabout a relationship I was in and it\u2019s basically about getting good at getting dumped,\u201d says Smith. \u201cIt\u2019s been a long while since I\u2019ve put any music out and I feel that this first single sets the tone of what is to come.\u201d\n\nOn it, Smith sings \u201cEvery time you hurt me, the less that I cry / And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry / And every time you walk out, the less I love you / Baby, we don\u2019t stand a chance, it\u2019s sad but it\u2019s true,\u201d hitting high notes which suggest he\u2019s put behind him the vocal cord injury which plagued him in 2015.\n\nSmith is coming off a spectacular start to his recording career. His debut album In The Lonely Hour was a smash, hitting No. 1 in the U.K. and shifting more than 12 million units worldwide. He\u2019s gone on to collect an Academy Award, a Golden Globe, three Brit Awards, three Billboard Music Awards and four Grammys.\n\nIn support of his new release, Smith will play four dates later this month at venues yet to be confirmed.
