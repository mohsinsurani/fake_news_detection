Miller also took $120,000 worth of Australian currency into the United States without reporting it, to which she also pleaded guilty in 2016.\n\nAfter her initial jail time, she faces two years of supervised probation. She was additionally fined US$40,000 and ordered to pay back the US$120,000.\n\nProsecutors said she tried to cheat her creditors by hiding US$775,000 worth of income and deserved to spend time in prison. Miller\u2019s lawyers argued for probation, saying her creditors were made whole after the fraud was discovered.\n\nAccording to the prosecutors, Miller hid the money in secret bank accounts. With the US$120,000, she split the money up into separate bags and had friends carry them in their luggage in the summer of 2014. (By law, all travellers carrying in excess of US$10,000 must declare it at customs. Miller failed to do so.)\n\nREAD MORE: Abby Lee Miller of \u2018Dance Moms\u2019 is going to jail\n\nMiller took to Instagram last December to share that she passed her real estate class.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cFeeling extremely proud of myself!!\u201d she wrote to her followers. \u201cPassed my Real estate class and my got my Personal finance class diploma. #itsnevertoolate #aldc #abbyleemiller #dancemoms.\u201d\n\nBefore leaving to serve her prison term, she sat down with The View co-host Jedidiah Bila for one last interview in July, for her tell-all Lifetime special, Dance Moms: Abby Tells All Exclusive.\n\nThe former Dance Moms star said she\u2019s made lots of mistakes but \u201cthe number one mistake being, trusting other people with my money.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Abby Lee Miller speaks out about Cheryl Burke reportedly replacing her on \u2018Dance Moms\u2019\n\nShe said she was afraid of what prison would be like. \u201cI\u2019ve been told not to talk about it because once they know, when they see this and they know, that\u2019s what they\u2019ll go after,\u201d Miller said of what she\u2019s fearful might happen to her in prison. \u201cI\u2019m petrified.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nOn the fears that she could be physically abused in prison, Miller admitted that \u201cit\u2019s definitely something that I\u2019m terrified of, yes.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope it won\u2019t be as bad as I imagine,\u201d she said, but admitted, \u201cif a whole gang of people wants to kill you, they\u2019re going to do it.\u201d Tweet This Click to share quote on Twitter: \"I hope it won't be as bad as I imagine,\" she said, but admitted, \"if a whole gang of people wants to kill you, they're going to do it.\"", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/alert-red.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-morty.svg", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/author-placeholder.jpg", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-text.svg", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/morty.svg", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-696118852.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/shield.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/shield-blue.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/alert.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/ad-choices.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-mobile.svg", "https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80"], "top_img": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/gettyimages-696118852.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Scott", "Global News"], "canonical_link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/4108764/abby-lee-miller-leaves-prison-moves-into-halfway-house/", "title": "\u2018Dance Moms\u2019 star Abby Lee Miller leaves prison, moves into halfway house -
