Jordan shook up the Marvel movie villain pantheon with Black Panther\u2019s Killmonger, they jumped in the ring together to reboot the Rocky franchise with 2015\u2019s Creed. (And before that, they chronicled the story of Oscar Grant\u2019s death in the indie Fruitvale Station, a movie you owe it to yourself to see.)\n\nCreed recast the underdog boxer saga with Jordan as Adonis Johnson, son of Rocky\u2019s legendary foe, Apollo Creed. The role fit like a glove; the actor was a swole, slick and ferocious foil to Sylvester Stallone\u2019s weathered Rocky, now dying of cancer. With that chemistry, and Tessa Thompson countering Adonis with female energy, it\u2019s no surprise that Coogler\u2019s sequel was a hit \u2014 but was it franchise material?\n\nAllow the trailer for Creed II to answer that question. Written by Stallone, produced by Coogler, and directed by Steven Caple Jr., who, like Coogler, broke out at Sundance with his film The Land, the film continues the personal-vs-professional drama at the heart of Adonis\u2019 career, this time pitting him against another legacy figure: Viktor Drago, son of Dolph Lundgren\u2019s Ivan Drago, the villain of Rocky IV. Sounds hokey on paper, but such is the power of Michael B. Jordan.\n\nHere\u2019s the official synopsis from Warner Bros. Pictures:\n\nLife has become a balancing act for Adonis Creed. Between personal obligations and training for his next big fight, he is up against the challenge of his life. Facing an opponent with ties to his family\u2019s past only intensifies his impending battle in the ring. Rocky Balboa is there by his side through it all and, together, Rocky and Adonis will confront their shared legacy, question what\u2019s worth fighting for, and discover that nothing\u2019s more important than family. Creed II is about going back to basics to rediscover what made you a champion in the first place, and remembering that, no matter where you go, you can\u2019t escape your history.\n\nCreed II hits theaters on Nov. 21, 2018, when we\u2019ll know for sure if the original was lightning in a bottle or the start of a series with stamina.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71470383/jbareham_210927_ecl1085_grids_6up_master.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71469165/wolf_pack.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71470876/CREDIT_MATT_GRACE_PRIME_VIDEO_00338_R5_1.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71470814/BLOODLINEDOBLADE2023001_Cover_copy.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTI5OSZlX-isrf6qHsuCx-3ZPOo=/0x0:1117x585/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11570063/Screen_Shot_2018_06_20_at_8.42.26_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71469185/JTR0120_101_comp_ZOI_v0002_r709.00144084.6.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71470829/Death_of_Superman_Ivan_Reis.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/OTI5OSZlX-isrf6qHsuCx-3ZPOo=/0x0:1117x585/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11570063/Screen_Shot_2018_06_20_at_8.42.26_AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matt Patches", "Zosha Millman", "Susana Polo", "Zach Rabiroff", "Toussaint Egan", "Pete Volk", "Leah Marilla Thomas", "Jun"], "canonical_link": "https://www.polygon.com/2018/6/20/17482602/creed-2-trailer", "title": "Michael B.
