To be happy, down-to-earth, and well-adjusted to the real world, most of us would say. Turns out that\u2019s exactly what the Duchess and Duke of Cambridge would say too.\n\nRaising them her way\n\nMum Kate Middleton is definitely taking a no-nonsense approach to parenting, according to RadarOnline.com\u2019s palace sources. Far from being spoilt by attention, 3-year-old Prince George and 2-year-old Princess Charlotte \u201chave absolutely no idea that they\u2019re royals\u201d.\n\n\u201cThey might look like perfect tots in photos, but at home they play in the mud, fall off ponies, and have screaming tantrums!\u201d That\u2019s a description that no mum of toddlers would be surprised at.\n\nThe plucky mum is making sure her tots are raised with all the discipline and levelheadedness that normal children receive \u2014 royal tradition be damned. Kate shields her babies from the public as much as possible, according to one source. She has also told palace aides that \u201cher kids will be raised her way\u201d.\n\n\u201cIt would absolutely horrify Elizabeth. But Kate insists the kids should be allowed to be normal children. Never in royal history have the children in direct line to the throne been raised in such a modern way.\u201d\n\nKate is clearly drawing lessons from her own middle-class upbringing \u2014 her mum Carol was an air hostess with British Airways while her father Michael was a flight dispatcher.\n\nAnd the dauntless mum is proving that she isn\u2019t shy about defying centuries of royal tradition, all for the sake of her kids. Kate and William have reportedly enrolled little George in a normal middle-class school in suburban London.\n\nA more orthodox choice would have been William\u2019s first school, Wetherby Prep \u2014 a much more \u201cposh\u201d school.\n\nIn today\u2019s fast-changing world, many of us worry about how to prepare our kids for success. Sounds like Kate is taking charge of her little ones\u2019 futures early on!\n\nParenting rules Kate and William live by\n\nAll parents aspire to bring up humble, well-mannered children, and Kate and William certainly have a tougher job than most. So far, it\u2019s been amazing to see the couple\u2019s dedication to making sure their kids will grow up down-to-earth and gracious \u2014 royal or not.\n\nHere are some great insights that the royal mum and dad have given into their parenting approach over the years:\n\nTaking a break\n\n\u201cTime out\u201d is a common method of discipline that parents turn to \u2014 Kate calls it \u201ctaking a break\u201d instead. When little George does something naughty, he sits in a corner of his room and plays with a special calming toy or fuzzy book.\n\nPlaying music\n\nWhen prince George throws a royal screaming fit, his parents play his favourite African drumming music. Sounds like a great way to calm down wailing toddlers without exhausting yourself!\n\nImitating his tantrums\n\nKate has an even more creative solution to little George\u2019s tantrums. When he throws a tantrum on the floor, the Duchess doesn\u2019t hesitate to get down and scream along. (Which mum hasn\u2019t been tempted to do that?) George finds this hilarious and it calms him right down.\n\nHelping to clean up\n\nLike all parents, Kate and William are no stranger to mealtime battles \u2014 flinging food on the floor, barfing sounds, the works. If George does this, the rule is that he must help clean up and won\u2019t get a replacement meal, only milk.\n\nLess things, please\n\nPrince William refused to divulge what gifts three-year-old Prince George received on his birthday in 2016, \u201cI am not telling, he got too many things, he\u2019s far too spoiled.\u201d\n\nWhile they certainly have the means to pamper their tots with material goods, the royal parents are clearly determined that George and Charlotte will grow up to value more important things in life.\n\nGiving them a normal life\n\nSpeaking to GQ last month, William revealed how dearly he valued normalcy for his children. \u201cI want George to grow up in a real, living environment, I don\u2019t want him growing up behind palace walls, he has to be out there. The media make it harder but I will fight for them to have a normal life.\u201d\n\nLike all parents, family is the centre of his world for this dad. \u201cI could not do my job without the stability of the family. Stability at home is so important to me. I want to bring up my children in a happy, stable, secure world.\u201d\n\nBeing a Modern Old-Fashioned Mom\n\nOne of Kate\u2019s go-to parenting guides is apparently The Modern Mother\u2019s Handbook: How To Raise A Happy, Healthy, Smart, Disciplined and Interesting Child, Starting From Birth. The anonymous author calls herself a Modern Old-Fashioned Mom, and her book offers no-nonsense tips for raising kids from bubs to teens.\n\nSome gems include \u201cset a good example and then stand back and watch\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t force your kids to do things\u201d. Definitely a page-turner if you\u2019re wondering how to square up traditional values with modern changes for your little ones.\n\nALSO READ: Princess Charlotte, Prince George got up to mischief at Pippa\u2019s wedding!", "images": ["https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=700,quality=10/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/rsz_1prince_william.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=700,quality=10/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/rsz_prince_george.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=700,quality=10/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/rsz_kate_middleton_playing.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=700,quality=10/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/Webp.net-resizeimage-3.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=700,quality=10/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/kate-middleton-feature.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/tap-assets/default.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=10/tap-assets/article-bottom-app-download-widget/App-Download-Article-Bottom-Widget.png", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=700,quality=10/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/rsz_kate_middleton_and_george.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/tap-assets/glass-featured-prime-block.png", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/themes/tap-redesign/logos/TAP_Thickerlogo.png", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/width=700,quality=10/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/rsz_kate_middleton_window.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/tap-assets/country-sprites3.png", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/kate-middleton-feature-1.jpg", "https://s3.theasianparent.com/cdn-cgi/image/height=250/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/kate-middleton-lead-1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://s3.theasianparent.com/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2017/06/kate-middleton-feature-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jolene Hee"], "canonical_link": "https://sg.theasianparent.com/kate-middleton-raising-kids", "title": "Kate Middleton is set on raising her kids HER way: Here's how!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=5", "theme-color": "#3498db", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s3.theasianparent.com/tap-assets-prod/wp-content/uploads/sites/12/2016/02/cropped-default-2-270x270.png", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "theAsianparent", "application-name": "theAsianparent", "description": "Kate Middleton ditches royal tradition when it comes to parenting.
