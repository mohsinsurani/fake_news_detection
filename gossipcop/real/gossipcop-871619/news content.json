In Paradise, we were basically camping for three weeks. It was 90-degree weather, and there was no escape. Everything was melting off, so the first week, when it was in the hundreds, I was such a slacker. But by week two, during the day I would do foundation and a little mascara, highlighter, and obviously lips. At night, I'd do eye makeup with contour.\n\nHow about hair?\n\nI didn't touch my hair with an iron at all. Because of the humidity, the most I ever did was use texture spray. I went for the beachy look. I'm more of a makeup girl.\n\nTake us through the process of getting ready.\n\nThe lighting in the mansion was really bad for makeup, so I did mine on the balcony every day. It was my moment to get away and be alone. There were maybe four mirrors in the house of 23 girls because mirrors make it hard for the camera guys. [For Paradise], I got an amazing makeup kit that has really good lighting.\n\nBecause you are so good at your own makeup, did you ever help any of the other girls?\n\nI taught Mackenzie [Deonigi] how to fill in her eyebrows, and she's been obsessed ever since. I would also contour some of the girls' faces. If they wanted me to do their makeup, I was totally cool with that.\n\nWas there any beauty-related drama that went down?\n\nMy lash extensions were falling out rather quickly on Paradise\u2014faster than usual because I was in the ocean. I had the handlers get me individual lashes from Target, and I glued them into the little bald spots.\n\nDid you have acrylic nails on the show?\n\nOn The Bachelor, I had tips, but they looked gross by week three. On television, they looked fine, though. In Paradise, I thought I'd do the same thing. I cry a lot, so my hands are on my face a lot, which means it's important that they look good. But on the second week, a few broke off, so I had to take them off completely. If you look very closely on Paradise, you'll notice one week where my nails are all different sizes.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/633d9dc13a56bbe75a4ba3d2/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c41b42bebdf1fd177c06e/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6334a3859d15067b97832fe1/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/624493d6b5d3d31ccdd63da0/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/devon%2520headshot.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c4a0360c6adbac3e921a3/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/632a2d1f8937d070d147384b/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/630f7e0000654a4765531b3a/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/589cfc0eb02f3ebc310e2e2a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/pinnable-Bachelor-Beauty-Confessions.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6318effabee049732c2e1782/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Devon Abelman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/bachelor-contestant-beauty-secret-confessions", "title": "These 5 Bachelor Beauty Secrets From Former Contestants Will Kinda Blow Your Mind", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "We chatted with some of our favorite ladies from past seasons to learn some Bachelor beauty secrets and tips.", "id": "577199b82554df47220a5779", "keywords": "celebrity trends,celebrities,catherine giudici,ashlet iaconetti,jillian harris,sarah herron,courtney robertson,olivia caridi,pinterest,the bachelor,the bachelorette", "news_keywords": "celebrity trends,celebrities,catherine giudici,ashlet iaconetti,jillian harris,sarah herron,courtney robertson,olivia caridi,pinterest,the bachelor,the bachelorette", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "577199b82554df47220a5779", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"We chatted with some of our favorite ladies from past seasons to learn some Bachelor beauty secrets and tips.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd1b4d8952dae4dc100f9/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-18%20at%203.33.54%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd1b4d8952dae4dc100f9/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-01-18%20at%203.33.54%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "All we needed was a one-on-one date with some of our favorite ladies.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "These Beauty Secrets From Past Bachelor Contestants Are Actually Jaw Dropping", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/bachelor-contestant-beauty-secret-confessions"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2015-07-27T00:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-01-19T14:00:00.000Z", "author": "Devon Abelman"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "All we needed was a one-on-one date with some of our favorite ladies.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/587fd4f529e1b43b4607296f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/bachelor-contestants.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "These Beauty Secrets From Past Bachelor Contestants Are Actually Jaw Dropping"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1437955200.0, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
