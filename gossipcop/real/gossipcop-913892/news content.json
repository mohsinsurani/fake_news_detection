Likening the situation to Griffin\u2019s new NBA reality, signing a lucrative contract with the Clippers in June before being dealt to Detroit less than a year later, Cameron alleges the 6-foot-10 athlete traded her in for a newer model after breaking off their engagement.\n\n\u201cGriffin himself, however, knows very well what breaching promises is all about. After all, Griffin had no problem trading Brynn Cameron, his former fiancee, and the mother of his 2 children, for reality television star Kendall Jenner,\u201d the docs state. Cameron, who played basketball at USC, also has a child with former Trojans star quarterback Matt Leinart.\n\nGriffin and Jenner have been linked together since last summer and are believed to still be dating.\n\nCameron also included love letters from \u201cBlakey\u201d in the suit, in which she claims Griffin, 28, pledged his support in response to her dropping prior business obligations.\n\n\u201cSometimes I take you and everything you do for granted but please know that I am constantly blown away by the mother, friend, daughter, sister, aunt, person, and partner you are to me and everyone that is lucky enough to call you even one of those things,\u201d Griffin allegedly wrote in an undated note.\n\nThe NBA star\u2019s one-time flame also claims she \u201cstrengthened\u201d the bond between Griffin and his Clippers teammates, and \u201callowed the organization to see a different side of his personality rather than the hard-partying man-child Griffin had been prior to their cohabitation.\u201d\n\nThough its unclear how much Cameron is seeking from Griffin, the mother of two claims she is now strapped for cash as her ex\u2019s wallet widens.\n\n\u201cWhile Griffin is continuing to earn millions from his NBA and endorsement deals, Cameron and their children are homeless and cash-strapped,\u201d the suit states. \u201cIn Griffin\u2019s absence, Cameron\u2019s brother [Jordan, a former NFL tight end] has had to provide Cameron and the children with financial support.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/mark-cannizzaro1.png?w=76", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/Free-People-Feature-Image.png?w=260", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6&comscorekw=sports", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/newspress-collage-24152610-1665088896729.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1665074843&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/mike-vaccaro.png?w=76", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/podcast_nypsports_ny_post_sports_sidebar_widget_image_520x280_b.jpg?quality=90&strip=all", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/kendall.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/brynn-cameron-blake-griffinq.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/brynn-cameron-blake-griffinq.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Jaclyn Hendricks", "Contact The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/02/14/blake-griffins-ex-sues-him-over-kendall-jenner-fawning/", "title": "Blake Griffin\u2019s ex sues him over Kendall Jenner \u2018fawning\u2019", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
