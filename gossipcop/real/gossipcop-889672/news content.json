He is requesting joint legal and physical custody of their 16-month-old daughter, Kirra, and spousal support from the Hills alum, according to documents obtained by Us Weekly.\n\nThe BMX pro, 35, is also asking the court to terminate the ability to award support to Patridge, 32. In addition, he wants her to pay for his attorney\u2019s fees.\n\nThe reality star obtained a temporary restraining order against Bohan on September 18 over claims that he was violent. Two days later, she filed for divorce after 10 months of marriage. \u201cAudrina\u2019s No. 1 priority is her daughter right now,\u201d her rep told Us at the time. The Orange County District Attorney\u2019s office later confirmed to Us that Bohan would not be charged with domestic violence due to a lack of evidence.\n\nEarlier this month, Patridge and the athlete reached an agreement that she would get full legal and physical custody of Kirra, while he was granted visitation rights on Mondays, Wednesdays and Sundays. A Los Angeles Police Department PIO confirmed to Us that Bohan was also ordered to move out of their family home by noon on October 13.\n\nThe former couple began dating in 2008. They tied the knot in Hawaii in November 2016.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/516440998_audrina-patridge-corey-bohan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/516440998_audrina-patridge-corey-bohan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/516440998_audrina-patridge-corey-bohan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/audrina-patridge-divorce-corey-bohan-seeks-joint-custody/", "title": "Audrina Patridge Divorce: Corey Bohan Seeks Joint Custody", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Audrina Patridge's estranged husband, Corey Bohan, is seeking joint custody of their daughter, Kirra, and spousal support from the 'Hills' alum \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Audrina Patridge's Estranged Husband Seeks Joint Custody", "description": "Audrina Patridge's estranged husband, Corey Bohan, is seeking joint custody of their daughter, Kirra, and spousal support from the 'Hills' alum \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/audrina-patridge-divorce-corey-bohan-seeks-joint-custody/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/516440998_audrina-patridge-corey-bohan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/516440998_audrina-patridge-corey-bohan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-10-27T00:02:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:22:08+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Audrina Patridge's Estranged Husband Seeks Joint Custody", "description": "Audrina Patridge's estranged husband, Corey Bohan, is seeking joint custody of their daughter, Kirra, and spousal support from the 'Hills' alum \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/516440998_audrina-patridge-corey-bohan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509062539.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
