But there are strict rules against the use of drugs in the lips, or shaved or clipped body parts.\n\n\n\nThis year, a dozen camels were banned after a vet was caught performing plastic surgery on them. Camels were also given Botox-type injections at his clinic, according to Saudi media.\n\n\u201cThey use Botox for the lips, the nose, the upper lips, the lower lips and even the jaw,\u201d Ali al-Mazrouei, the son of an Emirati camel breeder, told the UAE daily the National.\n\n\u201cIt makes the head more inflated so when the camel comes it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, look at how big that head is. It has big lips, a big nose.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the ban was imposed, the chief judge of the show, Fawzan al-Madi, told Reuters: \u201cThe camel is a symbol of Saudi Arabia. We used to preserve it out of necessity, now we preserve it as a pastime.\u201d\n\nThe month-long festival is the biggest in the Gulf and involves up 30,000 camels.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Saudi+Arabia%2CAnimals%2CMiddle+East+and+north+Africa%2CWorld+news%2CPlastic+surgery", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854506283d1afcc7f29011755530550af775afc0/0_83_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3fa35d19c6e6302214326f076baf491"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854506283d1afcc7f29011755530550af775afc0/0_83_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3fa35d19c6e6302214326f076baf491", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matthew Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats", "title": "12 camels disqualified from Saudi beauty contest in 'Botox' row", "meta_data": {"description": "Twelve animals disqualified from Saudi show after receiving injections to improve their pout", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854506283d1afcc7f29011755530550af775afc0/0_83_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=a3fa35d19c6e6302214326f076baf491", "height": 720}, "title": "12 camels disqualified from Saudi beauty contest in 'Botox' row", "description": "Twelve animals disqualified from Saudi show after receiving injections to improve their pout", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/matthewweaver", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-01-24T22:00:44.000Z", "section": "World news", "published_time": "2018-01-24T11:08:21.000Z", "tag": "Saudi Arabia,Animals,Middle East and north Africa,World news,Plastic surgery"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats", "iphone": "gnmguardian://world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://world/2018/jan/24/saudi-camel-beauty-contest-judges-get--hump-botox-cheats?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/854506283d1afcc7f29011755530550af775afc0/0_83_4800_2879/master/4800.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=eef7b40fe420e65bec6c027ca70bc93d", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516752000.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
