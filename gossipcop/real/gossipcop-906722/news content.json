And that they are enough to change things.\u201d\n\nFarrow, now 32, sat down with \u201cThis Morning\u201d co-host Gayle King on Monday to discuss the alleged abuse, which she claims happened in an attic in 1992 when she was just 7 years old.\n\nThe interview isn\u2019t scheduled to air until Thursday, but CBS released a short preview online Tuesday.\n\nFarrow has never given an interview on camera about the accusations against her adoptive father \u2014 which he has repeatedly denied \u2014 nor has she spoken about the #MeToo and \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d movements that have taken Hollywood by storm recently. She is expected to talk about both during the sit-down.\n\nWhile numerous stars have denounced Allen in light of what\u2019s going on in the country, several have chosen to stick by his side.\n\nAlec Baldwin defended the scandal-plagued director on Twitter this week, saying: \u201cWoody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed\u2026The renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose. But it\u2019s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.\u201d\n\nSelena Gomez\u2019s mother, Mandy Teefey, described the star\u2019s support for Allen while responding to a fan on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI had a long talk with her about not working with him and it didn\u2019t click,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no fall person here. No one controls her. She makes all her own decisions. No matter how hard you try to advise. It falls on deaf ears.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/dylan-farrow_ap.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/dylan-farrow_ap.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/01/16/dylan-farrow-i-am-telling-the-truth-about-woody-allen/", "title": "Dylan Farrow: \u2018I am telling the truth\u2019 about Woody Allen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
