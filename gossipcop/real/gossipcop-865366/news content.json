Earlier this year, the 5\u20199.5\u2033 teen signed with professional modeling agency Women Management.\n\nShe also works to help preserve the legacy and passion of her father, who died in a car crash in 2013.\n\nIn 2015, on what would have been Paul\u2019s 42nd birthday, Meadow founded the Paul Walker Foundation, which aims to protect the oceans and wildlife and provide grants and scholarships to marine science students and researchers.\n\nSource : Internet", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/frontend/2016/11/topbanner.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/meadow-650x330.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/frontend/2016/08/icon-entertainment.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/frontend/2016/11/advert_lsymedia-650-x-250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/paul-walker-daugher.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/pluber-310x165.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/bonny-310x165.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/5994a3b52200002d001a6561-310x165.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/frontend/2016/11/advert_sweetlove-650-x-250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/meadow-ig.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/horse-meets-with-dying-owner-310x165.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/daeuge-310x165.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/meadow.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308im_/http://oneappsgroup.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/meadow-650x330.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914141308/http://oneappsgroup.com/meadow-walker-returns-instagram-beautiful-adult/", "title": "Meadow Walker Returns to Instagram as a Beautiful Adult", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Meadow Walker Returns to Instagram as a Beautiful Adult - OneApps", "type": "article", "description": "Friday, 07 July 2017 : \u00a0The 18-year-old returned to Instagram Wednesday after an almost year-long hiatus from the social media network and posted a photo of herself, showing her wearing a white tank top and blue jeans while sitting front of a window outside a building and shielding her eyes from the sun.
