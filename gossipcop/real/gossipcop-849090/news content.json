However, it appears Phaedra was just lying and starting trouble!\n\n\n\n\n\nPorsha let it be known on the last reunion episode that Phaedra was the one that told her Kandi and her husband Todd Tucker were allegedly trying to drug her for sex. Kandi was obviously shocked and hurt by the accusations, which she vehemently denied.\n\n\n\n\n\nAll eyes were on Phaedra to explain her actions and reasons for making up the lies. Instead, she sat there acting unbothered and tried to play it off. Parks even dared to tell Williams, \"Maybe you heard me wrong.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWilliams was shocked when Parks shot down Porsha's claims that Phaedra heard the drugging rumor directly from Kandi. She said, \"I'm sorry. I shouldn't have repeated it. I mean I'm sorry. [Expletive], I didn't know if it was true or not.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nPorsha was obviously hurt that Phaedra refused to own up to her huge part in the ordeal. She began to realize that she was probably being used by Parks as a pawn against Kandi. Porsha broke down into tears.\n\n;\n\n\n\n\n\nKandi became emtional as she confronted Phaedra, explaining how the rumors have hurt her brand. Burruss appears to feel that was Parks' goal in the first place.\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nKandi got emotional as she said, \"It's like to me, it's one thing to say 'Oh she messed with this person. She did that.' It's like whatever, whatever, we throw shade. Whatever. But drugs? And you would believe and go back and repeat that I would try and drug somebody.\"\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThat wasn't the only issue between Parks and Burruss. The ladies also discussed the lawsuit by Johnnie Winston, Kandi's former employee, that Phaedra was encouraging to sue her cast mate. Kandi considered Phaedra's actions 'vindictive'. We would have to agree at this point!\n\n\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170511170314im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=919924581406141&ev=PixelInitialized",
