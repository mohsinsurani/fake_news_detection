That's why fans revolted when Disney recast Kimberly J. Brown's Marnie without reason in the fourth movie and fans refuse to acknowledge the movie's existence to this day.\n\nThese days, fans are desperate for a fifth movie starring the original Marnie, and apparently, that wish isn't too far out of the realm of reality.\n\nSheri Singer, the executive producer of the series, chatted EOnline about the prospect of a fifth movie and she's beyond down for the cause.\n\n\"I'd have to get Disney Channel to get on-board, but I would like to,\" Sheri said. \"I have ideas of how I would do it. There was some talk about a year and a half ago but then it didn't happen.\"\n\nSince Halloweentown premiered in 1998, Sheri would have loved to do something for the movie's 20th reunion next year, but time is running short to make that happen.\n\n\"We would have already needed to get started in order to do that, so I don't know,\" she admitted.\n\nShe's not giving up, though \u2014 even if a 20 year reunion reboot isn't in the cards.\n\n\"I think it's a really good idea. There's nothing to say that I won't drive [Disney Channel] crazy and ask them again!\" she said.\n\nSheri even has some ideas on what the fifth installment would be about. \"I think it could be done as a musical,\" she said. \"There\u2019s also ways to do a prequel. It\u2019s not something I haven\u2019t brought up before.\u201d\n\n\n\nWell, I say ixnay on the requelpay unless Kimberly J. Brown can star as a young Aggie Cromwell. Because she's more than down to reclaim her rightful place as the star of the series (yes, despite Disney Channel's grave recasting mistake).\n\n\u201cI\u2019m open to anything at this point,\u201d she shared with E!Online. \u201cI think it\u2019s so cool that fans still want to see where the story would go. I think that\u2019s so cool. I would say I\u2019m open to anything. It\u2019s cool that that\u2019s even a question people are asking these days.\u201d\n\n\n\nIt's not a question, Kimberly. It's a demand! Bring on Halloweentown 5 Disney Channel!\n\nRelated Story Kimberly Brown Talks Recasting in \"Halloweentown\"\n\nNoelle Devoe is the Entertainment Web Editor at Seventeen.com.
