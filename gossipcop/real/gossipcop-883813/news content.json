Its central couple wasn\u2019t a will-they won\u2019t-they romance, but a fiercely close friendship between gay lawyer Will (Eric McCormack) and his straight best friend Grace (Debra Messing). It even dared to include yet another gay man as a lead character in Sean Hayes\u2019s melodramatic Jack (Sean Hayes). Meanwhile, Megan Mullally\u2019s boozy Karen, the kept wife of an unseen husband, eventually revealed that she cared less about the gender of the people she slept with than what they could do for her \u2014 but her primary role on the show was to pop pills, make off color jokes, and keep things weird.\n\nWill & Grace would run for eight seasons, ending in 2006 as LGBTQ representation in media slowly but surely started to change. But from the very moment it premiered, the series has been both lauded as revolutionary and dismissed as an instant relic. It\u2019s been credited with shifting a nation\u2019s consciousness toward greater tolerance of gay people, as Joe Biden said in 2012 when coming out in support of gay marriage, and condemned for perpetuating tired stereotypes, as some critics have been saying for years.\n\nEither way, the show was a hit for the better part of a decade, drawing an overall average of 14 and a half million viewers per episode throughout its run. And now, 11 years after its initial series finale, Will & Grace has returned to the air for a super hyped revival, which premiered on September 28 after an equally nostalgic and enthusiastic promotional tour.\n\nNBC is apparently so thrilled to have the show back \u2014 not least because of its stellar main cast, who are all reprising their original roles \u2014 that the network ordered two full seasons months before the revival premiered (season one has a 16-episode order, while the second is slated for 13). And in the leadup to its launch, both NBC and creators David Kohan and Max Mutchnick repeatedly promised Will & Grace\u2019s longtime fans that the new show would be identical in spirit to its original flavor.\n\nThey said it so often, however, that their soundbites almost transcended reassurance to become something more like defiance. While the show had earned much acclaim and many viewers over the years, it also drew backlash for what some called indulgence of stereotypes (especially regarding Jack\u2019s more flamboyant characterization) and bluntly insensitive jokes (especially regarding anyone who wasn\u2019t a white gay man).\n\nFor industry observers, the narrative that ultimately took shape was that NBC and the show\u2019s creators were all too aware that many people saw no need for Will & Grace to return to the air in 2017, as part of a TV landscape that has changed vastly and significantly since it was last present in the primetime lineup. They just didn\u2019t especially care, as long as they could make the old fans laugh again.\n\nBut in order to understand why and how Will & Grace earned such an unstable and contentious reputation, let\u2019s flash back to the moment when America first met Will and Grace and their co-dependence, almost 20 years ago.\n\nWill & Grace premiered in an incredibly different media landscape than the one we have now \u2014 one almost completely bereft of gay people\u2019s lives\n\nThe very first episode of Will & Grace \u2014 which aired in September 1998 \u2014 plays games with audience expectations right off the bat. It opens with Will seemingly trying to lure Grace over to his apartment for some raunchy fun, before revealing that she\u2019s in bed with her boyfriend; he just wants someone to watch E.R. with.\n\nRight from the jump, the show leaned into the fact that McCormack\u2019s square-jawed Will seems exactly like the kind of leading man viewers were used to seeing on sitcoms, exploiting that familiarity to add more impact to the fact that Will is gay, and the most important woman in his life is the best friend he used to date in college before he realized as much.\n\nEverything about Will & Grace\u2019s basic premise was a twist on the usual sitcom formula \u2014 and in that respect, the show\u2019s historical context is crucial to understanding why it was so noteworthy. Bear in mind that Will & Grace premiered barely a year after Ellen DeGeneres\u2019s character on her ABC sitcom Ellen came out, and only a couple months after that show ended following the subsequent backlash. (Laura Dern, who played Ellen\u2019s love interest, revealed in April that she couldn\u2019t find work for a good year after the two-part coming out episode aired.) Also, and not insignificantly, Bill Clinton had signed the Defense of Marriage Act, which legally confirmed that the federal government strictly defined marriage as the union between a man and a woman, just two years before.\n\nBut Will & Grace was a show that not only prominently featured gay men, but took their lives and feelings into real consideration \u2014 an unusual and important step.\n\n\u201c[When Will & Grace premiered], LGBTQ representation in the media was largely abysmal, both in quantity and quality,\u201d says Sarah Kate Ellis, president and CEO of GLAAD. \u201cTo have one of the major networks airing a show like this in primetime and standing behind it with advertising dollars was very important in sending a message to the country that LGBTQ stories are valid, important, and worth telling.\u201d\n\nEarly reviews of Will & Grace were largely positive. But today, it\u2019s pretty depressing to look back at how many of them hedged around whether or not the show had \u201can agenda\u201d other than making people laugh. The Philadelphia Inquirer, for example, heartily recommended the show \u2014 under a headline that simultaneously breathed a sigh of relief that it was about \u201cfriendship, not the gay lifestyle.\u201d\n\nEven if you put aside the questionable \u201cgay lifestyle\u201d distinction, this description fails to take into account that Will & Grace\u2019s backbone is a very specific kind of close friendship that can\u2019t be divorced from its participants\u2019 sexualities.\n\n\u201cThe bond between gay men and straight women is often treated as a punchline,\u201d says Carlos Maza, a longtime Will & Grace fan, Vox multimedia producer, and self-described \u201cgay wonk.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut those relationships are also incredibly important sources of love, affirmation, and emotional support, a safe haven where you're not afraid of parental, societal, or sexual rejection. Will & Grace was my first exposure to popular culture that took that relationship really seriously.\u201d\n\nAnd when I put out a call on Twitter and Facebook asking people to share what Will & Grace meant to them, I heard many similar sentiments about watching the show and experiencing dual surprise and gratitude. Even with frequent caveats that many elements of the show are now pretty dated, most of the people who responded maintained that they were thankful to have the show around at all, given how relatively few options they had to choose from.\n\nKathleen Bryant, who\u2019s 17 years old and identifies as a lesbian, told me she found Will & Grace reruns on TV when she was younger and credits it with showing her a world in which being gay wasn\u2019t a problem, but just an intrinsic part of life. \u201cWill & Grace showed that you could be gay and happy,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd gay and sad. And gay and funny. And gay with friends. You could be gay and a million other things too.\u201d\n\nIn short, there\u2019s no denying that a major broadcast network like NBC airing a primetime sitcom that not only starred two gay characters but treated their intimate lives as nuanced and complicated was a huge deal in 1998 (though to be frank, the same is largely true today). Where things get complicated is in the way the show portrayed those characters while ignoring many others on the LGBTQ spectrum, consequently sparking a particularly heated debate.\n\nThe way Will & Grace twisted sitcom conventions \u2014 especially when spotlighting Will and Jack \u2014 was the show\u2019s greatest strength and most controversial attribute\n\nWill & Grace\u2019s diametric portrayals of Will and Jack\u2019s expressions of what it means to be a gay man were, and still are, immediately contentious. First of all, even though the show was created and largely written by gay men, Will and Jack were both played by straight men as far as the press and public knew; McCormack is married to a woman, and Hayes only felt comfortable coming out as gay in 2010, four years after the show wrapped.\n\nIn particular, the writing of Jack\u2019s character was criticized as playing on a whole host of flailing gay stereotypes, while Will\u2019s relative chasteness came off to some as neutering his sexuality. Perhaps due to some combination of Will & Grace\u2019s own comfort level and outside expectations, the show didn\u2019t even feature a same-sex kiss until its second season, and even then it was a stunt between Will and Jack.\n\n\u201c[Will] approaches asexual,\u201d wrote the LA Times in its wary initial review of the 1998 premiere, \u201chis gayness appearing to exist solely as a device to give him the moral authority to repeatedly ridicule the mincing manner of his bandanna-wearing homosexual friend, Jack, without being labeled homophobic.\u201d\n\nWill and the rest of the Will & Grace cast cracked constant jokes about Jack\u2019s melodramatic flapping about, which Jack habitually responded to with an indignant flourish or defiant dance move. As far as the show was concerned, it was laughing with Jack, not at him \u2014 but it couldn\u2019t control how people interpreted its character portrayals. As Joe Reid points out in a 2013 retrospective, some LGBTQ viewers became nervous that straight viewers enjoyed Jack\u2019s one-man show because it confirmation all their suspicions about who gay men were, with some fearing that his characterization \u201chad a touch of the minstrel to it.\u201d\n\nAmong many people I spoke to, Jack came up several times as both an inspiration and a cautionary tale. On the one hand, seeing someone confidently embrace his flamboyance with zero apologies could be refreshing. And Hayes vehemently defends Jack as realistic to his own experiences, saying he finds it \u201cridiculous\u201d to scrutinize \u201cJack\u2019s level of gay ... How can you be too gay?\u201d\n\nBut on the flip side, Jack made some gay Will & Grace fans worry that straight viewers would associate his demeanor with the LGBTQ community at large. Scott Simpson, who describes his relationship with the show as \u201cvery conflicted,\u201d recalled that evangelical parents used both the show and Jack to affirm their own biases about what gay men were like. \u201cThe very few clips of Will & Grace they witnessed were in large part responsible for their views on homosexuality,\u201d he told me. \u201cTo them gay men equaled Jack, [which] equaled super effeminate vapid queens.\u201d\n\nAs Reid explained in his retrospective, such associations make sense, but also put a ton of pressure on Jack to represent an entire community while ignoring the fact that Will & Grace did demonstrate a certain level of self-awareness regarding its two gay leads. Even that first season explicitly examines Will\u2019s instinct to downplay his gayness versus Jack\u2019s refusal to ever do the same, and the tension that could arise between the two as a result.\n\nOne of the show\u2019s most memorable episodes on this front is \u201cWill Works Out,\u201d which revolves around Will being embarrassed of Jack when Jack brings his sashaying exercise techniques to Will\u2019s gym.\n\nThat episode \u2014 Will & Grace\u2019s 19th overall \u2014 aired in 1999. But the clash of Will\u2019s \u201cmasc\u201d personality against Jack\u2019s more \u201cfemme\u201d one is still reflective of a prominent and enduring conflict in the gay community today, almost two decades later.\n\nHowever, for all its nuance with regard to Will and Jack, Will & Grace\u2019s depiction of gay life was incredibly narrow overall \u2014 a point that has come back to haunt it as the revival steps into a far different media landscape.\n\nOutside the \u201cG\u201d in LGBTQ, the original Will & Grace was never the most inclusive show. How much will \u2014 or should \u2014 that matter in 2017?\n\nAs has been pointed out countless times, Will & Grace\u2019s go-to way of acknowledging anyone outside the white gay male experience on the LGBTQ spectrum \u2014 most especially lesbians and trans people \u2014 was to refer to them in passing, often as the butt of a careless joke. And even though the New York Times wrote as recently as last week that the show was \u201conce seen as the epitome of diversity,\u201d it rarely invited anyone but white cis gay men to be in on the jokes at all. (GLAAD confirmed to Vox that it\u2019s spoken with NBC about the revival, but would not comment on whether the discussion included guidance on updating such jokes for 2017.)\n\nAs Will & Grace prepared to make a comeback 11 years after its final bow, the show\u2019s creators were all too aware that it would now going to be airing in an era where people are much quicker to call out shows for a lack of inclusion and intersectionality. Kohan even acknowledged to the New York Times that \u201cthere will probably be a bit more blowback.\u201d But he also defended Will & Grace\u2019s sense of humor by emphasizing that \u201csaying the most un-P.C. things has always been part of what makes the show funny, so I\u2019m hoping we get away with it.\u201d\n\nThis is a frustrating statement to hear for any viewer who might exist on the LGBTQ spectrum outside the \u201cG\u201d of it all. When I talked through my own complex feelings on the revival with Vice editor Pilot Viruet, they pointed out that its jokes about anyone who isn\u2019t a white cis gay man are a little more questionable when the show rarely included the subjects to be part of the joke rather than just its punchline. \u201cI'm not mad they're making fun of lesbians,\u201d Viruet said. \u201cI'm mad they're doing it without including lesbian characters that are named and aren't just the butt of jokes. It's not that it's un-PC ... it's that they think that's the problem, not their lack of intersectionality.\u201d\n\nThat might not have been a pressing concern in 1998, but it frankly should be in 2017. While Will & Grace was once a rarity for featuring an openly gay character at all, it\u2019s now returning having missed over a decade of news and rapid developments affecting the LGBTQ community, both in the real world and on TV. It\u2019s coming back in a world several years removed from Glee, a world in which networks are taking chances on happily queer shows like Amazon\u2019s Transparent, the Carmen Esposito and Rhea Butcher comedy Take My Wife (formerly of Seeso), and even Cartoon Network\u2019s Steven Universe. It\u2019s coming back at a time when queer creators are being met with more encouragement to tell queer stories and explore different LGBTQ perspectives than ever before.\n\nYou could theoretically argue that it\u2019s unfair to hold 2017\u2019s Will & Grace to a higher standard than any of the hundreds of other roughly reboots that have reemerged as hollow shells of their former selves. But by virtue of its premise and its history, Will & Grace has never been in the same class as, say, a deliberately bland Fuller House. If it wants to be truly prescient today, it can\u2019t stay the same as it ever was \u2014 and to the revival\u2019s credit, it seems to know that, since the best moments in its first three episodes see the characters confronting their age and supposed irrelevance.\n\nComing back in 2017 gives Will & Grace a unique opportunity to address some of the very real issues it struggled with the first time around. If it doesn\u2019t, well, it\u2019ll probably do just fine with the people who already loved it. But if it can find a way to adjust its clever, powerful voice and ground it in a world that\u2019s evolved since its inception, Will & Grace could use its second chance to not just entertain the fans it already has, but inspire a whole generation of new ones.", "images": ["https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUUI-goqBNMJJtaw3cErxDyJa2o=/29x80:761x463/fit-in/1200x630/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9352479/NUP_177367_1732.JPG", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56660407/fall_tv.0.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PI5LiK9LhokU5VvnlbgVYb6cR78=/29x80:761x625/1200x800/filters:focal(366x145:526x305)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/56909939/NUP_177367_1732.0.jpeg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71466750/GettyImages_1243654244.0.jpeg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9352231/jack_today_show_will_kiss.gif", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/vu2yrp-_dZ_wJVfpwmN3g9--x0w=/0x0:1000x667/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1000x667):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9352493/NUP_179312_3379.JPG", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71471010/1243811254.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71468545/1243767428.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71467244/VDC_VBD_012_THUMB_SYN.0.jpeg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71469964/GettyImages_1055017430a.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71466958/GettyImages_1241762727.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn0.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ZUUI-goqBNMJJtaw3cErxDyJa2o=/29x80:761x463/fit-in/1200x630/cdn3.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9352479/NUP_177367_1732.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Framke", "Nicole Narea", "Rebecca Leber", "Jonathan Guyer", "Christophe Haubursin", "Andrew Prokop", "Umair Irfan", "Sep"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/fall-tv/2017/9/29/16360962/will-and-grace-history-controversy", "title": "Will & Grace is back, and so is the debate over its place in LGBTQ history", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2017-09-29T10:30:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-09-29T10:30:02-04:00"}, "author": "Caroline Framke", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/ff4dfa009ef17ae1c4f5b58aee1eab98/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "Is the series revolutionary or a relic?
