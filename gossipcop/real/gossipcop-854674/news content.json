Between my surgeries and hormonal intervention, I was disease-free. That doesn\u2019t mean it can never return, but for now, once my sutures have been removed and my bruises have changed from blue to yellow to green to gone, I will be healthy.\u201d\n\nBut her condition took a turn after the Met Gala, and she thanked fans for their support after her hospital stay.\n\n\u201cThank you for all the love & concern that\u2019s been pouring in since Tuesday,\u201d Dunham wrote on Instagram. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m much healthier than I was a year ago, complications arose from my most recent endometriosis surgery.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll always be proud of those Met Gala pics \u2014 not just because I felt beautiful, surrounded by art and magic, hugging my best friend tightly, but because they\u2019re evidence that women contain steely multitudes.\u201d", "images":
