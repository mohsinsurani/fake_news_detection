I\u2019m bold. I don\u2019t want to cause pain, you guys,\u201d Curry, 61, told Stephen Colbert on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d on Monday.\n\nWhile the former \u201cToday\u201d anchor giggled at \u201csomewhere Ann Curry\u201d memes and tweets, her guilt got the best of her enjoying Lauer\u2019s comeuppance.\n\n\u201cThe truth is that I was raised Catholic by a Buddhist,\u201d she said. \u201cSo think about the Catholic guilt, mixed with the karma, worries, the intensity of that. It was like, all of a sudden my brain \u2014 think \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 \u2014 the wall, it went up. There was this whole wall of, \u2018Uh-uh, you can\u2019t talk like that. You can\u2019t think like that.\u2019 So I didn\u2019t, actually, get to enjoy it.\u201d\n\nColbert pointed out that Lauer\u2019s ouster may be karma for his allegedly forcing her out of \u201cToday.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, that\u2019s a good point,\u201d Curry, who was rather unceremoniously sent off on the morning show in 2012, admitted, but added of his accusers, \u201cAlso you have to think about the pain. You know, a lot of people have suffered. So I haven\u2019t had a chance to celebrate for a lot of reasons.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that we\u2019re not really done fixing the problem. We are a long way from fixing the problem,\u201d she said of sexual misconduct in the workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s more than a conversation. It\u2019s about action and it\u2019s about not just telling people they can\u2019t do certain things. It\u2019s about changing the dynamic, the power balance within companies so that women are not seen as people who could never rise to the top. Once we figure that out, we might have a chance to figure this out.\u201d\n\nLast week, Curry told \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d that sexual harassment was \u201cpervasive\u201d at NBC News and subtly shaded her former co-anchor.\n\n\u201cI know what it\u2019s like to be publicly humiliated,\u201d she said. \u201cI never did anything wrong to be publicly humiliated, and I don\u2019t want to cause that kind of pain to somebody else.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/01/23/why-ann-curry-didnt-celebrate-matt-lauers-firing/", "title": "Why Ann Curry didn\u2019t celebrate Matt Lauer\u2019s firing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
