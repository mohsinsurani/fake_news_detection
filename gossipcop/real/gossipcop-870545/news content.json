J. Abrams to discuss following in her mother\u2019s Princess Leia footsteps by playing the lead in Episode VII of the galaxy far, far away saga.\n\n\u201cJ.J. Abrams called me to come in for Star Wars because he couldn\u2019t find someone for the lead,\u201d she explained, referring to the role of Rey. \u201cHe ended up finding Daisy Ridley, who\u2019s an incredible actress \u2014 so talented! But I went in and he ended up giving me this tiny role with a couple lines. I was super excited.\u201d\n\nLourd also spoke about how much it meant to her to act alongside Fisher \u2014 who passed away in December at the age of 60 after suffering a heart attack \u2014 as a Resistance fighter in the film. \u201cIt was incredible,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a big believer in things happening for a reason and I think I ended up in that movie for a reason. It was really incredible for us to have that experience together.\u201d\n\nWatch the full clip below.\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jj-abrams.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/washington-politics-unity.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/billie-lourd.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=397&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/billie-lourd.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=397&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4940100/star-wars-carrie-fisher-daughter-billie-lourd-rey/", "title": "Star Wars: Carrie Fisher's Daughter Almost Played Rey", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Carrie Fisher's daughter did make an appearance in The Force Awakens, but apparently not in the role she was initially gunning for.", "og": {"title": "Princess Leia's Daughter Almost Played This Star Wars Role", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4940100/star-wars-carrie-fisher-daughter-billie-lourd-rey/", "description": "Billie Lourd was in the running for this character in The Force Awakens", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/billie-lourd.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=397&crop=1", "width": 594, "height": 397}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4940100/star-wars-carrie-fisher-daughter-billie-lourd-rey/", "description": "Carrie Fisher's daughter did make an appearance in The Force Awakens, but apparently not in the role she was initially gunning for.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/billie-lourd.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=397&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4940100/star-wars-carrie-fisher-daughter-billie-lourd-rey/", "title": "Princess Leia's Daughter Almost Played This Star Wars Role", "description": "Billie Lourd was in the running for this character in The Force Awakens", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/billie-lourd.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=397&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mp6Ty0mOFa0"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
