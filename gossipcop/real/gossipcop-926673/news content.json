Teri didn\u2019t. There was no bad blood, I think that was just the way it was.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Teri Hatcher Is Desperate For A \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Revival\n\nDuring the same interview, Longoria also denied that her friendship with former \u201cHousewives\u201d co-star Nicollette Sheridan was impacted when she sued series creator Marc Cherry in a high-profile wrongful-termination lawsuit.\n\n\u201cWe were pretty removed from the court case,\u201d added Longoria. \u201cBut Nicollette is great, she is a great girl. She\u2019s just a fun girl to hang out with.\u201d", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1131311335.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1428861897.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1428861897.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/christian-bale-feature-gq.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/rhf5frkhcm-wx9b8tkdjg/ETCRAWBlingEmpireS3KaneKellyKim.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC100622MELCNAMEGAME_2_YOUTUBE.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kanye-west-gigi-hadid-getty.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1192256157.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC10722STEPUP3CHRISITINA.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/GlobalTV/GLOB0056780470000000/GLOB0056780470000011_1_thumbnail.jpeg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5b7753aa-7d67-4aee-a43e-ade8290ecb41.jpg?quality=80&strip=all", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/149178_1844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/x1r6adcqgy-bska8otyjs/image.jpeg.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_editorial_13447937j.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ford_CCMA_ETC_Country_Club_340x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/web-MYSTIC-RAISIN-BRICK-340x150-co-brand.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/149178_1844.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=720&h=480&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brent Furdyk", "Published", "Last Updated"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/317711/eva-longoria-is-still-friends-with-her-desperate-housewives-co-stars-with-one-exception/", "title": "Eva Longoria Is Still Friends With Her \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Co-Stars \u2014 With One Exception", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "theme-color": "#0060b6", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ET Canada", "application-name": "ET Canada", "title": "Eva Longoria Is Still Friends With Her \u2018Desperate Housewives\u2019 Co-Stars \u2014\u00a0With One Exception", "author": "Brent Furdyk", "description": "Rumours of friction among the cast of \"Desperate Housewives\" were rampant throughout the series' eight-season run, and according to one of the show's stars, those rumours\u00a0had a bit of truth to them.
