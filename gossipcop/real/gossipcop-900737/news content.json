More info\n\nKate Middleton and Prince William , both 36, delighted royal fans today, as they released an official photograph of themselves with their three children, Prince George, five, Princess Charlotte, three, and Prince Louis, aged seven months. The family were all pictured grinning as they stood in the countryside, with the Duchess of Cambridge holding her youngest child in her arms. Meanwhile, the older two children stood beside their parents, standing on a horizontal part of a tree. The royals are often admired for their style choices, so where did the family get their outfits from for the latest picture?\n\nWhy Prince Louis is really wearing tights in new Christmas card photo\n\nKate Middleton\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge opted for a pair of blue jeans for the rural-themed photoshoot.\n\nWhile the exact brand is currently unknown, Kate has worn jeans a number of times before.\n\nFor instance, in the past, the mother-of-three has been spotted wearing J Brand jeans in the past - specifically the 811 Mid-Rise Skinny Leg in navy twill - which retailed at $158 (\u00a3126) on the website nordstrom.com.\n\nShe teamed the look with a pale checked shirt, as well as a pale khaki coloured jumper.\n\nExcept for the slightly different shade, the sweater looked strikingly similar to the \u00d6vik Re-Wool Sweater by the company Fj\u00e4llr\u00e4ven - costing $150 (around \u00a3120).\n\nKate wore the jumper in October this year, after returning to her royal duties following her time on maternity leave.\n\nThe Duchess finished off the look with a pair of sparkling oak leap earrings from Asprey - which come in at a whopping \u00a35,000.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/12/750x445/1058962.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/12/750x445/1058962.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jess Sheldon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/style/1058962/Kate-Middleton-Prince-William-Christmas-card-prince-george-trousers-outfits-news", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Christmas card: Royal Family outfit details REVEALED", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "KATE MIDDLETON and Prince William, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, released the 2018 edition of their annual family Christmas card today.
