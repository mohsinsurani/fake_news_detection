A source told Fox News that \"it's not heroin.\" According to the outlet, no drugs were found at the scene and no charges pressed.\n\nPeople magazine reported that Lovato and her group of friends were prepared for their night of partying.\n\n\u201cShe and her \u2018friends\u2019 were on a binger the entire night,\u201d an insider told the outlet. \u201cThey keep Narcan on hand for such situations \u2013 they were prepared for this. The people she has been hanging around lately aren\u2019t her real friends \u2013 they don\u2019t have her best interests at heart. She\u2019s pushed her true friends away.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cShe had to find creative and sneaky ways to get drugs because her team and those that really care about her really try to keep a close watch on her.\u201d\n\nLovato's long-time band guitarist, Mike Manning, spoke out about the singer's new group of friends saying that he planned to expose all of those who were involved in Monday night's \"binger\" and added, \"I almost lost my sister today.\"\n\n\"Anybody who was with Demi last night and actually calls themselves a friend should actually be disgusted with themselves. SICK,\" Manning said according to the Daily Mail.\n\nHe added, \"You can never trust anyone. Never can know if your \"friends\" are truly on your side or not.\"\n\nAccording to TMZ, Lovato's longtime team attempted to stage an intervention to get help for the troubled singer but she \"blew them off.\" The news follows the departure of Lovato's long-serving manager, Phil McIntyre, who was reportedly a part of the intervention.\n\nLovato had been preparing for a months-long string of performances set to start Thursday night in Atlantic City, N.J., and take her to venues as far as Mexico, Chile, Argentina and Brazil. The singer's Atlantic City concert has since been canceled.\n\nSigns of trouble began in the days leading up to the overdose when a video of the singer forgetting the lyrics to her song \"Sober,\" surfaced online. Lovato wrote the single, released in late June, about relapsing after celebrating six years of sobriety.\n\nLovato's profound \"Sober\" lyrics read, \u201cMama, I\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m not sober anymore/And Daddy, please forgive me for the drinks spilled on the floor. To the ones who never left me/We\u2019ve been down this road before/I\u2019m so sorry, I\u2019m not sober anymore.\u201d\n\nThough Lovato has been vocal about her struggles throughout the years, another insider revealed to People that Lovato\u2019s period of sobriety was full of ups and downs.\n\n\u201cDemi was never really clean and sober from all of her demons. She has been fighting depression and anxiety for quite some time \u2014 and is still in such a dark place. She was sober for a while, but not completely sober for six years.\u201d\n\nThe star, who is \"in stable condition\" and with her family at the hospital according to a statement from her rep, has also found support from her ex-boyfriend, former \"That 70's Show\" star Wilmer Valderrama.\n\nValderrama, who dated Lovato for six years before their break up in June 2016, was reportedly \u201cshocked\u201d after hearing the news that Lovato was hospitalized on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe knew she was going through a tough time but he wasn\u2019t prepared for this,\u201d a source told People. \u201cHe saw her through so many ups and downs and was her rock through some of her darkest moments. To see her back in such a sad and vulnerable place is heartbreaking for him.\u201d\n\nThe source added that Valderrama, \u201calways cared deeply\u201d for Lovato and even after they split the two have remained friends.\n\nSo much so that Valderrama paid his ex a visit on Wednesday, according to People. The 38-year-old star visited Lovato in the hospital following her apparent overdose yesterday afternoon.\n\n\u201cDemi always hoped they would end up back together in the future,\u201d a source revealed to the magazine. \u201cHe\u2019s the love of her life and vice versa.\u201d\n\nLovato remains in the hospital.", "images":
