So it\u2019s sad. But I always think that what ties us together is this singular experience. It was a professional experience but it became personal because it was years and years of our life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hoping that that sort of eclipses anything that\u2019s been recently spoken \u2014 that that lingers,\u201d Parker added of SATC, which also starred Cynthia Nixon and Kristin Davis. \u201cThat many years spent doing something, that people had a connection with it is such a privilege.\u201d\n\nBryan Bedder/Getty\n\nParker first revealed in September that SATC 3 had been scrapped despite eight years of encouragement from fans and a \u201cbeautiful, funny, heartbreaking, joyful, very relatable script and story\u201d ready for filming.\n\n\u201cIt was damn good,\u201d she spilled to Cohen.\n\nThough sources told PEOPLE Cattrall made \u201coutrageous demands\u201d to re-board the big screen franchise, she later denied that her requests had anything to do with the scrapping of the film and claimed she had never agreed to board SATC 3 in the first place \u2014 even refuting an offer to do it back in 2016.\n\n\u201cI never asked for any money, I never asked for any projects. To be thought of as some kind of diva is absolutely ridiculous,\u201d the 61-year-old actress told Piers Morgan in October, saying Parker \u2014 who would have been a producer on the film \u2014 \u201ccould have been nicer.\u201d\n\nCattrall then admitted that she had never been close with the other three costars. \u201cWe\u2019ve never been friends,\u201d Cattrall said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been colleagues and in some way, it\u2019s a very healthy place to be.\u201d\n\nKim Cattrall, Sarah Jessica Parker, Cynthia Nixon, and Kristin Davis in 2010\u2019s Sex and the City movie. Craig Blankenhorn/Warner Bros/Courtesy Everett Collection\n\nAs the story unfolded, Parker said she wanted to speak out about it in the press but was told to remain quiet.\n\n\u201cWhen all that stuff was happening with Sex and the City, which I know is meaningless in the world, but when it\u2019s happening and you\u2019re caught up in any of the muscle of that stuff, it\u2019s so painful because all you want to do is respond. All you want to do is say, \u2018Are you kidding me!? This is everything I know. This is everything that happened over the last six months. These are the conversations. These are the emails. These are the conversations with lawyers and agents and studio heads,\u2019\u201d she recalled to The Daily Beast. \u201cBut you\u2019re counseled time and time again, \u201cDon\u2019t do it. You\u2019re going to get in the weeds. It\u2019s a nowhere road.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just kept saying, \u2018This was an experience I loved. I love those women. We shared this experience. It was a privilege. If that\u2019s what we\u2019re left with, those memories, there are only four of us who\u2026\u2019 You know?\u201d she added.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Cattrall Slams Sarah Jessica Parker as Tensions Surrounding SATC 3 Revealed: \u2018Kim Killed the Movie,\u2019 Says Source\n\n\n\nShe\u2019s been more vocal recently though, talking about the possibility of trying the project again on the Golden Globes red carpet and even jokingly offering Cattrall\u2019s role to Stephen Colbert, Ellen DeGeneres and Cohen.\n\nSo what changed? Turns out the bevy of sexual misconduct allegations plaguing Hollywood allowed Parker to put the SATC 3 allegations into perspective.\n\n\u201cThe world shifted,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018Oh this is ridiculous.\u2019 I was afraid to talk about these allegations, and now there are real allegations in the world. And all of a sudden I was like, \u2018I think I\u2019m going to answer the question about the Sex and the City movie.\u201d\n\n\u201cFor so long I was told to be quiet about all of that stuff. And all of a sudden I\u2019m like, \u2018If people are being encouraged to come forward and talk about really difficult, painful, potentially criminal things that they were part of or witnessed, I think I can talk about the Sex and the City 3 movie,\u2019\u201d she added, laughing. \u201cI think it\u2019s okay! I\u2019m a grown freaking woman.\u201d\n\nJenny Anderson/WireImage\n\nParker has also become more outspoken about her marriage to Matthew Broderick recently. The couple will celebrate their 21st anniversary in May \u2014 and all those years together, plus the years and years of split rumors, have created a deep bond between the two.\n\n\u201cRelationships are hard. I always felt that I wanted to invest more. I love him and I think he\u2019s brilliant. And I\u2019m sure I annoy him. He annoys me sometimes, but I\u2019m enormously proud of the person he is,\u201d she revealed during a candid interview with the Girlboss Radio podcast. \u201cI think the longer you can last, the more invested you just are. And so their triumphs are yours, their disappointments are yours. And the more you feel those things and experience them, the more it\u2019s hard to imagine not being part of their life.\u201d\n\nThe secret to the pair\u2019s long union? Time apart.\n\n\u201cWe have lives that allow us to be away and come back together,\u201d said Parker, who shares son James Wilkie, 15, and twin daughters, Loretta and Tabitha, 8, with Broderick. \u201cHis work life takes him here, and mine takes me there. In some ways, I think that that\u2019s been enormously beneficial because we have so much to share, in a way.\u201d\n\nWatch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen airs Sunday-Thursday (11 p.m. ET) on
