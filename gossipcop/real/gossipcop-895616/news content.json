And, Kim says \"that\u2019s where Kenya made a f***ing big mistake.\" The Daily Dish spoke to Kim about the epic face-off, and she shared what exactly went down that led to the women arguing at the Chateau Shere\u00e9 unveiling.\n\n\"That\u2019s one thing you don\u2019t do is come for my husband or children \u2014 two of which she wished she had. Kroy doesn\u2019t really get as heated to respond in the manner that I do. I\u2019m pretty fiery. For him, he wasn\u2019t really actually around me at that time when Kenya started popping off at me at the mouth. We prefer to have a lot less drama in our lives,\" Kim said. \"We\u2019re pretty easy moving. It was definitely good to get out of the house and see some of them. I just need to make sure that Kenya stays in her lane. I don\u2019t know why she feels the need to talk s***.\"\n\nWondering what caused the argument? Well, Kim took us inside the moments that led to the confrontation.\n\n\"I was in Shere\u00e9\u2019s room. She was kind of giving me a tour, or what have you. I was in her room, and we were kind of sitting on her bed, catching up. Somebody came to her door and was like, 'There\u2019s somebody walking around in your basement. I don\u2019t know who it is!' Shere\u00e9 is kind of like, 'Who is it?' And she opened the door and, of course, it was Kenya,\" she recalled. \"I was like, 'Kenya, that\u2019s rude.' I had only met her one other time in my life. But I said, 'That\u2019s kind of rude. This is Shere\u00e9\u2019s house and you know damn well that the party\u2019s not in the f***ing basement.' She was just like, 'Shere\u00e9, I have that light. Sheree, I have that headboard too.' I haven\u2019t really followed Housewives to know that she was building her house as well.\"\n\nThat's when it turned personal for Kenya and Kim. \"She just started popping off at the mouth like, 'You probably have to worry more about Kroy not working,' and all that s*** started. I was like, 'No, you did not. My husband made more money than you\u2019ll ever make in your life so, goodbye.' Looking like a f***ing train wreck. It\u2019s gross, it\u2019s gross. To me, it\u2019s so f***ing gross,\" Kim said. \"She called me octomom. Like really, bitch? Octomom. That\u2019s very disrespectful. I have 6 children, and you wish that you had my life. That\u2019s the bottom line. She wishes that she had my life and she doesn\u2019t. So she can be miserable.\"\n\nHowever, Kim \u2014 having spent nearly five seasons on RHOA \u2014 had an intuition that things could get heated and tense. \"I\u2019m not dumb. I knew that there was a possibility that there may be a little crazy. I figured, 'No, who doesn\u2019t grow in 5 years?' Marlo and I, the last time I saw her, we were in an argument in the reunion and we got along great. It was so great to see her. People grow. I don\u2019t know how the hell this woman hasn\u2019t. After 38 years, it\u2019s time to grow up. I figured by now, people kind of grow up,\" she said. \"On one hand, I did know there was a possibility of something, but I didn\u2019t know and haven\u2019t been around these ladies in 5 years, so what could they be possibly popping off at the mouth at? Obviously Kenya follows me to know that Kroy decided not to play football this season. So I have no idea what the f*** she\u2019s doing. I don\u2019t know what any of them are doing.\"\n\nSo, would Kim have anything to say to Kenya should they cross paths again in the future? \"I just wouldn\u2019t even talk to her. I seriously wouldn\u2019t even waste my breath. I feel like she\u2019s just a dark cloud, walking around. Just very unhappy. For someone to come at you talking about your children, your husband. You haven\u2019t seen me in so long. I was sticking up for, of course, my friend Shere\u00e9. I always will. I just feel like she\u2019s a dark cloud,\" the mom of six said. \"I don\u2019t even need to waste my breath on her, and apparently a lot of other people feel the same way, according to my Instagram. I\u2019m such an asshole. I\u2019ve never seen such positive feedback with my Twitter and Instagram social media comments, etc that I did. I don\u2019t know with Kenya, if she just pisses of the ladies on the show or what. I\u2019m ready.\"\n\nStill, Kim isn't set on making any more cameos on RHOA in the near future. \"I love filming Don\u2019t Be Tardy. I love filming with my family. It\u2019s a lot of fun. I\u2019m motivated by money. I\u2019d be lying if I didn\u2019t tell you that. We\u2019ll see. It was definitely, like I said, good to see some of the ladies. I definitely enjoyed reconnecting with them and it was good to get out of the house,\" she said. \"Who knows what the future will hold? But I do enjoy filming Don\u2019t Be Tardy, for sure.\"\n\nStay tuned for more fireworks when the RHOA finale kicks off Sunday, April 16 at 8/7c.
