Like a reception class version of The Hobbit, there are elves, one of whom is Ben, and fairies, one of whom is Princess Holly. The elves don\u2019t like magic and blow trumpets every time they announce themselves while the fairies love magic, often with disastrous results that involve floods of jelly. Add to this their friendship with the human Lucy and vibrant characters such a Ben\u2019s pet ladybird Gaston, who thinks he\u2019s a dog, and it makes for a magical package.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for the grown ups? There are really two words to sum this up \u2013 Nanny Plum. Brilliantly voiced by Sarah Ann Kennedy, Nanny Plum is housekeeper to Princess Holly\u2019s parents, King and Queen Thistle. Often sarcastic, often casting spells that invariable go wrong (to replace a priceless frozen bird sculpture she uses the spell \u201cMake me a bird, ice thingy\u201d) and frequently hilarious, Plum is the highlight of Ben & Holly. The writing in the show is so tight that there\u2019s often some very funny, sitcom-style bantering going on between the adult characters and it\u2019s never better than when Nanny Plum is involved. King Thistle probably adds the most entertainment next as the hapless and grumpy king who is happy as long as he can get his bath. The creators of Ben & Holly have produced a show that while enthralling for children, has all the hallmarks of a great British comedy. A delight for adult viewers too was this trailer, which ran ahead of recent episodes and paid tribute to Game of Thrones.\n\nCharlie & Lola\n\nWhy kids love it: Based on Lauren Child\u2019s books, which she began writing in 2000, imagination and sibling love/frustration are the key themes of this great brother and sister show. As Charlie informs us at the beginning of every episode \u201cI have this little sister Lola. She is small and very funny\u201d. Lola then invariably gets up to something or has an idea about something she wants to do, and Charlie has to guide her. As Lola is four years old, she\u2019s immediately identifiable for the kids watching the show as she\u2019s discovering many of the same things as her audience. Like boys and girls her age too, she often doesn\u2019t understand the consequences of her actions but learns through her imaginative adventures.\n\nWhat\u2019s in it for the grown ups? Charlie and Lola is very funny. The good-natured battles between the two characters are highly amusing for anyone who has grown up with brothers and sisters. The episode in which Lola ruins Charlie\u2019s Birthday party by opening all his presents is bound to stir some memories for many people. The show is so well-observed that you really do feel like you\u2019re watching a genuine sibling relationship. It also delivers a great deal of humour from the perspective of a parent. A lot of the things Lola says, or can\u2019t believe, are familiar to what our own children come out with, and being a parent can be the funniest thing in the world.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adventure_time_1.jpg?fit=640%2C380", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adventure_time_1.jpg?resize=640%2C380"], "top_img": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adventure_time_1.jpg?fit=640%2C380", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Glen Chapman", "James Stansfield", "Nick Harley", "Juliette Harrisson", "Kirsten Howard", "Billy Grifter", "Chris Longo", "Kayti Burt", "Louisa Mellor", "John Saavedra"], "canonical_link": "https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/10-great-tv-shows-for-geek-parents-to-watch-with-their-kids/", "title": "10 great TV shows to enjoy with your kids", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#d23226", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "p": {"domain_verify": "1893a020468964417f83c6a42b6791cf"}, "description": "From Adventure Time to Old Jack's Boat, James and Glen talk us through ten modern kids' TV shows that geek parents can enjoy too...", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "10 great TV shows to enjoy with your kids", "description": "From Adventure Time to Old Jack's Boat, James and Glen talk us through ten modern kids' TV shows that geek parents can enjoy too...", "url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/10-great-tv-shows-for-geek-parents-to-watch-with-their-kids/", "site_name": "Den of Geek", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adventure_time_1.jpg?fit=640%2C380", "width": 640, "height": 380, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2014-02-26T07:00:00+00:00"}, "author": "jbindeck2015", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Glen Chapman, James Stansfield", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "15 minutes"}, "parsely-title": "10 great TV shows to enjoy with your kids", "parsely-link": "http://www.denofgeek.com/tv/10-great-tv-shows-for-geek-parents-to-watch-with-their-kids/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/adventure_time_1.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-02-26T07:00:00Z", "parsely-section": "TV", "parsely-author": "James Stansfield", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/favicon.geek_.purple.swirl_-1.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1393398000.0, "source": "https://www.denofgeek.com", "summary": ""}
