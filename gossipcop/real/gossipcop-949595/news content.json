We go to bars, mixers, singles events and church groups\u201d in that area, he explains. \u201cWe also go on every dating site you could possibly think of \u2013 OkCupid, Match.com, Tinder, Hinge. We also go on Facebook, talk to family and friends and try to make the pool as big as possible.\u201d\n\nAnother pool of possible participants includes those who \u201chave seen the show and applied specifically and want to be considered as a candidate,\u201d says Coelen.\n\nSeason 1 received less than 1,000 applicants, season 2 received more than 7,000 applicants and season 3 pulled in more than 20,000 applicants by the time casting was finished, he confirms.\n\nAfter whittling down the pool, potential participants are invited to final callbacks, which the producers refer to as \u201cworkshops.\u201d\n\n\u201cI personally attend this and help run it,\u201d says Coelen. \u201cIn groups of 20 to 30 people, we explain how this whole things works. We\u2019re extremely transparent with them, and we do that with the people who are in-the-know that it\u2019s Married at First Sight and who aren\u2019t familiar with it.\u201d\n\nThe show\u2019s four experts \u2013 Dr. Pepper Schwartz, Dr. Joseph Cilona, Greg Epstein and Dr. Logan Levkoff \u2013 are also in attendance at the gender-specific workshops.\n\nIn the next few days, potential participants are contacted, and those who are \u201cseriously interested\u201d in continuing the process \u201cimmediately start very significant background checks and psychological evaluations by highly accredited third parties,\u201d says Coelen. \u201cWe get their recommendations and they rule out a lot of people.\u201d\n\nThe potential participants also undergo \u201cextensive written evaluations\u201d only available to licensed therapists or government agencies \u201cthat take hours and hours to complete,\u201d adds Coelen.\n\nAlthough the final casting \u201cis done over a relatively short period of time,\u201d the time potential participants spend with the experts, undergoing psychological evaluation and filling out the questionnaires \u201cis very, very intense,\u201d says Coelen, who estimates the initial casting process to be about six months and the final casting to be a minimum of four to six weeks.\n\nUltimately, the show\u2019s four experts present their matches to Kinetic Content and A&E, and \u201cthe people they present are the people we move forward with and document,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s no debate. The experts always say there is no exact science and no guarantees, but it is based on a high degree of research.\u201d\n\nWhile all three of the couples from season 2 have split, two of the couples from the show\u2019s first season \u2013 Cortney Hendrix and Jason Carrion, Jamie Otis and Doug Hehner \u2013 have remained married and will star in a second season of Married at First Sight: The First Years airing this fall.", "images":
