Rossi was auditioning for a role in the actor\u2019s movie.\n\n\u201cMy final audition for a Steven Segal [sic] movie took place in his office. He told me how important it was to have chemistry off-screen as he sat me down and unzipped his leather pants,\u201d she recalled.\n\n\u201cI ran out and called my agent. Unfazed, she replied, \u2018Well, I didn\u2019t know if he was your type,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nEllen DeGeneres, de Rossi\u2019s wife of nine years, tweeted she was \u201cproud of\u201d her wife for opening up about the alleged encounter.\n\nDe Rossi is the second actress to accuse Seagal of inappropriate behavior in the last week. \u201cThe Good Wife\u201d actress Julianna Margulies recalled when she \u201csquirmed\u201d her way out of being alone with Seagal in a hotel room.\n\n\u201cHe made sure that I saw his gun, which I had never seen a gun in real life,\u201d Margulies said in an interview Friday on SiriusXM. \u201cI got out of there unscathed. It\u2019s a long story\u2026 but I never was raped, and I never was harmed, and I don\u2019t know how I got out of that hotel room.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt always starts with, \u2018I\u2019m a healer, I want to massage you.\u2019 I sort of squirmed my way out.\u201d", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/kevinSpacey.jpeg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/GettyImages-597569672.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/114c43c4-untitled-design.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/436b45c1-kushner-kloss-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-411.svg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/sly-wife.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/Kesha-Dr-Luke.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/114c43c4-untitled-design.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/348/196/beyonce.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/114c43c4-untitled-design.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/portia-de-rossi-says-steven-seagal-unzipped-his-leather-pants-during-audition", "title": "Portia de Rossi says Steven Seagal 'unzipped his leather pants' during audition", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Portia de Rossi said on Wednesday she had an uncomfortable encounter with Steven Seagal during an office audition, becoming the second actress to accuse the actor of sexual misconduct in the last week.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Portia de Rossi says Steven Seagal 'unzipped his leather pants' during audition", "dcterms.abstract": "Portia de Rossi said on Wednesday she had an uncomfortable encounter with Steven Seagal during an office audition, becoming the second actress to accuse the actor of sexual misconduct in the last week.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Portia de Rossi said on Wednesday she had an uncomfortable encounter with Steven Seagal during an office audition, becoming the second actress to accuse the actor of sexual misconduct in the last week.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:44f7467d-99bc-5ad9-97c5-94c1302e7896", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-11-09", "dcterms.created": "2017-11-09T07:38:48-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-11-09T08:48:43-05:00", "og": {"title": "Portia de Rossi says Steven Seagal 'unzipped his leather pants' during audition", "description": "Portia de Rossi said on Wednesday she had an uncomfortable encounter with Steven Seagal during an office audition, becoming the second actress to accuse the actor of sexual misconduct in the last week.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/114c43c4-untitled-design.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/portia-de-rossi-says-steven-seagal-unzipped-his-leather-pants-during-audition", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Portia de Rossi says Steven Seagal 'unzipped his leather pants' during audition", "description": "Portia de Rossi said on Wednesday she had an uncomfortable encounter with Steven Seagal during an office audition, becoming the second actress to accuse the actor of sexual misconduct in the last week.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/114c43c4-untitled-design.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/portia-de-rossi-says-steven-seagal-unzipped-his-leather-pants-during-audition"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment", "classification-tags": "celebrity,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
