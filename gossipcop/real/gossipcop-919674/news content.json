You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nI'm sorry to report that the latest post on Khloe Kardashian's Khloe With a K app is all about looking \"thin AF\" in photos. HEAVY SIGH.\n\nAs the \"fat\" sister in my family, I love Khloe on a very deep level, and it's always a bit of a bummer to see her being just as image obsessed as her siblings. I mean, she can't really escape the, uh, culture of her family \u2014 remember when they told her to lose weight because she was hurting their brand?! \u2014 but I just wish she would fight back against it more. DGAF Khloe is the best Khloe, and it would be so cool if she just flipped the middle finger in the face of all this bullshit body image stuff, too. BUT ALAS! Our culture is poisoned, and she's a part of our culture, and the result is an entire blog entry about not wearing vertical stripes in photos.\n\n\n\nAnd that's the thing! Her tips are shit you've already heard a million times before, anyway!\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nHere are some of the revolutionary \"thin AF\" tidbits as:\n\n\u201cOnly allow your photographer to shoot from above. It\u2019s the only flattering angle,\u201d she says. \u201cIf they shoot from beneath, you might as well have had like ten cheat days in a row! (Frito pie anyone?)\u201d\n\nI mean, hello. Shooting from above is an age-old trip that's been around since Live Journal. (RIP!!!)\n\nAnd then there's: \u201cWear black or vertical stripes. Avoid horizontal stripes and prints if you plan to be within a mile of a camera. They add instant bulk.\u201d\n\nAnd buckle your seat belts for the next one: Good posture! \u201cMake your arms and shoulders werk. Hands on hips,\u201d Khloe wrote, with a straight face, I'm assuming. \u201cBonus points if you angle sideways and use your camera-facing arm. Shoulders back and away from ears. Always.\u201d\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nNot only are these tips stale; they also suck. In response, I'm going to post a bunch of photos from below whilst wearing horizontal stripes and scrunching my shoulders up to my ears. Change starts here! Join me, Khloe! (Or at least stay away from dumb photo \"tips,\" and stick to more wonderful things \u2014 like those adorable pregnancy pics from Japan! Too cute!)\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.
