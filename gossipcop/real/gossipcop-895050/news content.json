When Mark Cuban announced that they had won the AMA for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist on Sunday, November 19, he thought that they weren\u2019t in attendance \u2014 until they made their way to the stage.\n\n\u201cThey didn\u2019t know we were gonna be here you guys \u2026 but we\u2019re here,\u201d Linkin Park cofounder Mike Shinoda said while accepting the award, thanking nominees Imagine Dragons and twenty one pilots. He then added that members of both bands had reached out following the death of their lead singer, Chester Bennington. Bennington, who was open about his battle with depression, committed suicide on July 20.\n\n\u201cWe want to dedicate this award to him, to his memory, to his talent, to his sense of humor, to his joy,\u201d Shinoda, 40, said alongside Brad Delson and Rob Bourdon. \u201cWhether you\u2019re a fan or an artist, take a moment to appreciate what you\u2019ve got and make Chester proud.\u201d\n\nFollowing his passing, the band posted a heartfelt message on their website. \u201cOur hearts are broken. The shockwaves of grief and denial are still sweeping through our family as we come to grips with what has happened,\u201d they wrote, addressing a letter to Chester. \u201cYou touched so many lives, maybe even more than you realized.\u201d\n\nIf you or anyone you know is experiencing suicidal thoughts, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 to be connected to a local crisis center for confidential emotional support.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/linkin-park-chester-bennington.jpg?crop=202px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/linkin-park-chester-bennington.jpg?crop=202px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/american-music-awards-2017-linkin-park-dedicates-win-to-chester-bennington/", "title": "American Music Awards 2017: Linkin Park Dedicates Win to Chester Bennington", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Linkin Park took home the American Music award for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist and dedicated it to Chester Bennington \u2014 watch the emotional speech", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Linkin Park Dedicates AMA Win to Late Chester Bennington", "description": "Linkin Park took home the American Music award for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist and dedicated it to Chester Bennington \u2014 watch the emotional speech", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/american-music-awards-2017-linkin-park-dedicates-win-to-chester-bennington/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:16:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/linkin-park-chester-bennington.jpg?crop=202px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/linkin-park-chester-bennington.jpg?crop=202px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-20T04:04:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:16:19+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Longeretta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Linkin Park Dedicates AMA Win to Late Chester Bennington", "description": "Linkin Park took home the American Music award for Favorite Alternative Rock Artist and dedicated it to Chester Bennington \u2014 watch the emotional speech", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/linkin-park-chester-bennington.jpg?crop=202px%2C0px%2C1600px%2C840px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511150653.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
