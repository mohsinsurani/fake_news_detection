Brooks, who triumphed over Chris Stapleton, Keith Urban, Luke Bryan and Eric Church, returned from hiatus in 2014 and launched a sprawling world tour that will continue through the end of 2017. Brothers Osborne and Chris Stapleton wound up as the night\u2019s most-awarded performers, with two wins each.\n\nStapleton\u2019s From A Room: Volume 1 was named Album of the Year, beating out a stack of critically acclaimed releases that included Miranda Lambert\u2019s The Weight of These Wings and Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit\u2019s The Nashville Sound. Stapleton previously won Album of the Year in 2015 for Traveller. He also added to his streak in the Male Vocalist of the Year category, beating out Dierks Bentley, Eric Church, Keith Urban and Thomas Rhett for his third consecutive win.\n\nIn a repeat from 2016, Brothers Osborne were named Vocal Duo of the Year, beating out a field that included Florida Georgia Line and Dan + Shay. TJ and John Osborne also took home a second award in the Music Video of the Year category for their action-packed send-up of Donald Trump in \u201cIt Ain\u2019t My Fault,\u201d directed by Ryan Silver and Wes Edwards. Additionally, the siblings performed on the telecast, combining their sinewy punch of \u201cIt Ain\u2019t My Fault\u201d with the late Don Williams\u2019 funky \u201cTulsa Time.\u201d\n\nJon Pardi won the first CMA Award of his career, taking home the New Artist of the Year prize after a breakthrough year with hits such as \u201cHead Over Boots,\u201d \u201cDirt on My Boots\u201d and \u201cHeartache on the Dance Floor.\u201d\n\nMany past winners refused to be unseated from their respective categories. Miranda Lambert extended her reign as Female Vocalist of the Year, taking the category for the seventh consecutive time. Meanwhile, Little Big Town collected their sixth consecutive Vocal Group of the Year win. The vocal quartet also accepted the Song of the Year award for \u201cBetter Man\u201d on behalf of its writer, Taylor Swift. The night\u2019s big winner Brooks was himself a repeat champ: he took home Entertainer of the Year at the 2016 show.\n\nKeith Urban\u2019s \u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color\u201d was named Single of the Year, giving the Aussie performer his 11th career win. Guitarist Mac McAnally was named Musician of the Year, marking his ninth win in the category. \u201cFunny How Time Slips Away,\u201d which the late Glen Campbell recorded with Willie Nelson for his farewell album Adios, won Musical Event of the Year.\n\nHere\u2019s the complete winners list:\n\nEntertainer of the Year\n\nGarth Brooks \u2013 WINNER\n\nLuke Bryan\n\nEric Church\n\nChris Stapleton\n\nKeith Urban\n\nAlbum of the Year\n\nThe Breaker \u2013 Little Big Town\n\nFrom A Room: Vol. 1 \u2013 Chris Stapleton \u2013 WINNER\n\nHeart Break \u2013 Lady Antebellum\n\nThe Nashville Sound \u2013 Jason Isbell and the 400 Unit\n\nThe Weight of These Wings \u00ad\u2013 Miranda Lambert\n\nSingle of the Year\n\n\u201cBetter Man\u201d \u2013 Little Big Town\n\n\u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color\u201d \u2013 Keith Urban \u2013 WINNER\n\n\u201cBody Like a Back Road\u201d \u2013 Sam Hunt\n\n\u201cDirt on My Boots\u201d \u2013 Jon Pardi\n\n\u201cTin Man\u201d \u2013 Miranda Lambert\n\nSong of the Year\n\n\u201cBetter Man\u201d \u2013 Little Big Town (songwriter: Taylor Swift) \u2013 WINNER\n\n\u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color\u201d \u2013 Keith Urban (songwriters: Clint Lagerberg, Hillary Lindsey, Steven Olsen)\n\n\u201cBody Like a Back Road\u201d \u2013 Sam Hunt (songwriters: Zach Crowell, Sam Hunt, Shane McAnally, Josh Osborne)\n\n\u201cDirt on My Boots\u201d \u2013 Jon Pardi (songwriters: Rhett Akins, Jesse Frasure, Ashley Gorley)\n\n\u201cTin Man\u201d \u2013 Miranda Lambert (songwriters: Jack Ingram, Miranda Lambert, Jon Randall)\n\nMale Vocalist of the Year\n\nDierks Bentley\n\nEric Church\n\nThomas Rhett\n\nChris Stapleton \u2013 WINNER\n\nKeith Urban\n\nFemale Vocalist of the Year\n\nKelsea Ballerini\n\nMiranda Lambert \u2013 WINNER\n\nReba McEntire\n\nMaren Morris\n\nCarrie Underwood\n\nNew Artist of the Year\n\nLuke Combs\n\nOld Dominion\n\nJon Pardi \u2013 WINNER\n\nBrett Young\n\nLauren Alaina\n\nVocal Duo of the Year\n\nDan + Shay\n\nFlorida Georgia Line\n\nLoCash\n\nMaddie and Tae\n\nBrothers Osborne \u2013 WINNER\n\nVocal Group of the Year\n\nLady Antebellum\n\nLittle Big Town \u2013 WINNER\n\nOld Dominion\n\nRascal Flatts\n\nZac Brown Band\n\nMusic Video of the Year\n\n\u201cBetter Man\u201d \u2013 Little Big Town\n\n\u201cBlue Ain\u2019t Your Color\u201d \u2013 Keith Urban\n\n\u201cCraving You\u201d \u2013 Thomas Rhett feat.
