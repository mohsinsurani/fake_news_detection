In 2017, E News calculated that the franchise had a divorce rate of about 34%, but that was before a flood of new breakups.\n\nSince then four cast members from The Real Housewives of Orange County, one from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, two from The Real Housewives of Atlanta and of course there was Tom. Luann de Lesseps and Tom D\u2019Agostino from The Real Housewives of New York City married and divorced so fast, viewers had whiplash.\n\nWith the amount of cash being flashed around on the show, you\u2019d think every couple has a prenuptial agreement. Surprisingly, the women who seem to be the wealthiest on the show actually don\u2019t have one. So which Real Housewives don\u2019t have a prenup?\n\nKyle Richards\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nMarital status: married\n\nRichards, who is an original Real Housewives of Beverly Hills cast member, says when she met her husband Mauricio Umansky, they were stone cold broke.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I didn\u2019t have two nickels to rub together when we got married, so a prenup was not an option or even talked about,\u201d she said on Andy Cohen\u2019s Then & Now, People recounts. \u201cBut if I were to marry somebody who had less money than me, I would probably make them sign a prenup. But if I were getting married to somebody with a lot of money, no I wouldn\u2019t sign one.\u201d\n\nLisa Vanderpump\n\nNet worth: $75 million\n\nMarital status: married\n\nVanderpump claims she and husband Ken Todd were so blinded by love, there was no need for a prenup. In addition to a short acting career, Vanderpump and Todd own 26 restaurants, according to Celebrity Net Worth. She also appears on two Bravo series, The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills and Vanderpump Rules. She earns a staggering $500,000 per season for RHOBH.\n\nErika Girardi\n\nNet worth: $5 million\n\nMarital status: married\n\nThe performer and alter-ego, Erika Jane says she and high profile attorney Tom Girardi didn\u2019t sign one either. \u201cI don\u2019t have a prenup,\u201d she said on Andy Cohen\u2019s Then & Now. \u201cBut let me tell you something, let me be very clear. I\u2019m married to a very powerful lawyer. A prenup wouldn\u2019t stand in his way anyway. So it doesn\u2019t matter whether you had one or you didn\u2019t, it\u2019s gonna be all Tom\u2019s way, I assure you. \u2026 He\u2019ll rip that piece of paper to shreds in two seconds!\u201d Tom Girardi\u2019s net worth is $30 million.\n\nShannon Beador\n\nNet worth: $10 million\n\nMarital status: divorced\n\nBeador recently went through a nasty divorce where she was ultimately awarded $22,500 a month in alimony payments. She revealed on Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen she and ex-husband David did not sign a prenup. But said, \u201cI just want a fair settlement,\u201d E News reports. \u201cThat\u2019s all I want.\u201d According to California law, divorcing couples split assets equally. Which means Beador is entitled to half of her ex\u2019s net worth of $20 million.\n\nCamille Grammer\n\nNet worth: $50 million\n\nMarital status: divorced but remarried\n\nThe most expensive divorce sans prenup is between Camille and Kelsey Grammer from The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills. She received the largest settlement in the franchise and their divorce is one of the most expensive celebrity splits on record. Grammer received $30 million from her divorce and when the couple met, Kelsey was struggling with addiction and broke at the time.\n\nGrammer recently re-married and appeared on Watch What Happens Live. Andy Cohen asked, \u201cPrenup?\u201d And she said, \u201cYes!\u201d With her future husband looking on, smiling from the audience.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Shannon-Beador-and-her-husband-David.png?w=640&h=359", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kyle-richards-mauricio-umansky.jpg?w=640&h=388", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Real-Housewives-reunion-640x327.png?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/lisa-vanderpump-ken-todd.jpg?w=640&h=426", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Kelsey-and-Camille-Grammer.jpg?w=640&h=320", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Gloria-Allred-And-Erika-Jayne-Honored-By-LGBTs-In-The-News.jpg?w=640&h=455", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Real-Housewives-reunion.png?w=640&h=327", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/The-Real-Housewives-reunion-640x327.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Ragusa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/which-real-housewives-dont-have-a-prenup.html/", "title": "Which \u2018Real Housewives\u2019 Don\u2019t Have a Prenup?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "The rich and famous often have a prenuptial agreement before they marry.
