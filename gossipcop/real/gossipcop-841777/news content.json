Leave it to Britney to shake up international politics.\n\n\u201cWe delayed the vote one day, to July 4. We couldn\u2019t hire enough security for the election because of the Britney Spears concert on July 3. There would also be a lot of traffic and roadblocks that would make it hard for the vote to go ahead,\u201d Labor Party spokesman Liron Zach said.\n\nSecurity and traffic concerns prompted move\n\nThe primary election will decide who becomes chairman of the party. The elected official will then enter the running to be prime minister.\n\n\u201cWe aren\u2019t concerned about voters favoring Spears over the party. The two main concerns are security and traffic,\u201d Zach said.\n\nThe concert is being held at Yarkon Park, right across the street from the Tel Aviv exhibition grounds where polling is set to take place.\n\nThis will be Britney\u2019s first time performing in Israel, and her first world tour since 2011. The concert is part of her Asia tour that includes performances in Japan and the Philippines.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear if party officials plan on attending the concert, it appears the rest of Tel Aviv wants a piece of Britney.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/210208142744-01-britney-spears.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_2518,w_4474,c_fill/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160526164254-13-week-in-photos-0527.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1715,w_3047,c_fill/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160526164254-13-week-in-photos-0527.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1715,w_3047,c_fill/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160526164254-13-week-in-photos-0527.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1715,w_3047,c_fill/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Delaney Strunk"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/world/britney-spears-israel-trnd/index.html", "title": "Israel postpones vote due to Britney Spears concert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Israel postpones vote due to Britney Spears concert | CNN", "description": "Britney Spears, the Princess of Pop, is disrupting the Israeli political system -- in fact they moved an election date just for her.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160526164254-13-week-in-photos-0527.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1715,w_3047,c_fill/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/04/06/world/britney-spears-israel-trnd/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Israel postpones vote due to Britney Spears concert | CNN", "description": "Britney Spears, the Princess of Pop, is disrupting the Israeli political system -- in fact they moved an election date just for her.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160526164254-13-week-in-photos-0527.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1715,w_3047,c_fill/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNN"}, "description": "Britney Spears, the Princess of Pop, is disrupting the Israeli political system -- in fact they moved an election date just for her.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "world", "theme": "world", "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-06T15:19:33Z", "modified_time": "2017-04-06T15:19:33Z", "tag": "arts and entertainment, britney spears, celebrities, concerts and musical performances, elections and campaigns, government and public administration, israel, middle east, middle east and north africa, music, politics", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "arts and entertainment, britney spears, celebrities, concerts and musical performances, elections and campaigns, government and public administration, israel, middle east, middle east and north africa, music, politics", "author": "Delaney Strunk", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491433200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
