While no episode count or premiere date was included in the release, an enclosed synopsis stated that the next iteration of the show \u201ctells the story of a macabre crime in the heart of the Ozarks, and a mystery that deepens over decades and plays out in three separate time periods.\u201d Ali will star as Wayne Hays, a state police detective from northwest Arkansas. (Ali follows in the footsteps of season one stars, and continuing executive producers, Matthew McConaughey and Woody Harrelson, and season two\u2019s Colin Farrell and Vince Vaughn. No word yet on whether he\u2019ll have a partner.) The show will once again be helmed by creator Nic Pizzolatto, who penned all the episodes of the upcoming series, save the fourth, which he co-wrote with David Milch (\u201cDeadwood,\u201d \u201cNYPD Blue\u201d).

So it makes sense that Angels Flight has been featured in many movies and television shows over the years. Angels Flight resumed regular service Thursday after being closed since 2013 (it did operate for one day of shooting on \u201cLa La Land\u201d). It remains to be seen if it starts to appear again in movies and television shows. (Not that it ever really stopped.) Speaking to The Times at last year\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, \u201cLa La Land\u201d star Ryan Gosling reflected on the use of historic locations in the movie. \u201cThis was an opportunity to show an L.A. that\u2019s still there.... You\u2019ve got to squint your eyes a little, but there are still places in L.A. that are still part of the golden years of Los Angeles when Hollywood was in its heyday,\u201d Gosling said. \u201cI lived around the corner for a long time from Angels Flight and Grand Central Market, although I never got to ride Angels Flight because it had been shut down,\u201d Gosling added. \u201cThose places are still there... these gems that are there, and we were able to shoot them one by one.\u201d Angels Flight reopened on Thursday. (Myung J. Chun / Los Angeles Times) The small piece of land next to the top of Angels Flight, known as Angels Knoll, was also prominently featured in \u201c(500) Days of Summer.\u201d The location has appeared in a wide variety of movies over the years, as early as 1916\u2019s \u201cGood Night, Nurse,\u201d 1918\u2019s \u201cUp She Goes\u201d and 1920\u2019s \u201cAll Jazzed Up.\u201d It has also had high-profile cameos in \u201cAct of Violence\u201d (1949), \u201cM\u201d (1951), \u201cKiss Me Deadly\u201d (1955), \u201cThe Exiles\u201d (1961), \u201cThe Incredibly Strange Creatures Who Stopped Living and Became Mixed-Up Zombies\u201d (1963) -- all the way up to to 2011\u2019s \u201cThe Muppets\u201d and last year\u2019s \u201cLa La Land.\u201d And on television, Angels Flight has been seen on \u201cPerry Mason,\u201d \u201cDragnet\u201d and the recent series \u201cBosch.\u201d READ MORE: Angels Flight: How it works and what it\u2019s been through in its 100-year history Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nJamie Foxx announces telethon for Harvey relief By Libby Hill (Andrew Krech / News & Record via Associated Press) A new stream of celebrity support for victims of Hurricane Harvey opened Wednesday, as Jamie Foxx announced that a telethon fundraiser is in the works. In an Instagram post where the actor revealed his own donation of $25,000 to GlobalGiving, Foxx also shared preliminary plans for the upcoming benefit. \u201cFrom a fellow Texan, my heart goes out. My prayers go out,\u201d Foxx, from Terrell east of Dallas, said. \u201cSeptember 12 we have a telethon that we\u2019re doing.

TMZ reported that Foxx, Reese Witherspoon, Blake Shelton, Hilary Duff and Michael Strahan are all involved with the project, with commitments from the four major broadcast networks to air the special for an hour on Sept. 12. In an interview with TMZ, Bun B said that fellow Houston natives Beyonc\u00e9 and Jim Parsons are high on his wish list for the telethon. The outlet also reported that Bun B would only want President Trump\u2019s presence if it was via a show of unity with other former presidents. Solange also announced Wednesday that she will be holding a benefit show at Boston\u2019s Orpheum Theatre on Sept. 28. Featuring the Sun Ra Arkestra, the performance is titled \u201cOrion\u2019s Rise\u201d and all proceeds will go to Hurricane Harvey relief.

Yeah, she admits she\u2019s screwed up plenty of relationships By Libby Hill Gwyneth Paltrow takes full responsibility for her romantic failings. She admitted as much in a recent interview with the podcast Girlboss Radio, during which Paltrow went deep on some of her lost loves. \u201cOh, my god, I\u2019ve [screwed] up so many relationships, so many,\u201d Paltrow said. \u201cI\u2019m actually a pretty good friend and a good sister and a daughter and a mother, but I am at my potentially most vulnerable \u2026 in the romantic slice of the pie. So it\u2019s taken me a lot of work to get to the place where I have a good romantic relationship.\u201d Paltrow \u201cconsciously uncoupled\u201d from ex-husband Chris Martin in 2014 after 10 years of marriage and has been romantically linked to \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d creator Brad Falchuk for the past three years. On Girlboss Radio, Paltrow sent a shout-out to former beau Brad Pitt, whom she dated from 1994 through 1997, and was at one point engaged to. \u201cI [screwed] that up, Brad,\u201d Paltrow said. Paltrow also delved into her experiences as founder and CEO of her lifestyle brand Goop, sharing that once she\u2019s in the boardroom with investors, no one cares if she\u2019s a celebrity. \u201cI go into the room, and for the first 90 seconds, I\u2019m Gwyneth Paltrow,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, my god, my wife loves you .... And then, about 90 seconds later, I\u2019m just getting grilled like anyone else.\u201d But she doesn\u2019t get offended; she relishes the challenge. \u201cIt was such a beautiful chapter of my life when I started raising [venture capital financing], because it knocked me down so many pegs.

Clausen, who composed the Fox animated show\u2019s incidental music, was told that the show was looking for \u201ca different kind of music\u201d moving forward, according to Variety.

And although \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d theme song was penned by Danny Elfman, the sonic feel of the series has been defined by Clausen\u2019s grandiose, often epic productions.

Occasionally setting aside the show\u2019s usual comedic tone, Trevor Noah enlisted correspondent Roy Wood Jr. to consider whether these statues honor Southern heritage, as their supporters claim, or the nation\u2019s history and lingering problem with racism. After showing a montage of guests on network news shows who reminded viewers that these statues were erected during the Jim Crow era, decades after the Civil War, Wood equated slavery to another tragedy. \u201cIt\u2019s like if a woman got out of an abusive relationship and then she had to keep pictures of her ex up in her house to remember the time,\u201d a straight-faced Wood explained. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t need pictures to remember pain.\u201d \u201cPeople say, \u2018We want to remember the history of the Civil War,\u2019\u201d Noah added. \u201cThere\u2019s an easier way to remember what happened in the Civil War: Just walk around in the South.

Di Caprio\u2019s foundation \u201chas been committed to climate-related issues and environmental projects since 1998,\u201d Terry Tamminen, president and CEO of the foundation, said in a statement. \u201cWe support efforts to build climate resilient communities and protect vulnerable wildlife and ecosystems across the planet, and have supported disaster relief and victim funds in the past.

However, she didn\u2019t directly address her \u201cI am a victim\u201d statement that was released at the height of the scandal. On \u201cGMA,\u201d she said she meant she was a victim of the media. Regarding \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d with Harrison, she simply talked about how awful it was to have so many people acting like they had been there or were suddenly experts on her life. \u201cTo even get up and go get eggs at the grocery store ... my face was all over every magazine and I had to check out and everyone\u2019s staring,\u201d Olympios said. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at them and it\u2019s like, \u2018I\u2019m not what you\u2019re thinking right now.\u2019\u201d Then, near the end of the interview, she shared one big wish. \u201cObviously hindsight is 20/20,\u201d she said, \u201cand I wish it could have been handled differently.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nTomi Lahren finds new home at Fox News By Libby Hill Conservative firebrand Tomi Lahren is again gainfully employed after being fired from Glenn Beck\u2019s The Blaze in March.

What was clear is that a typically dubious character was at the center of it \u2014 namely Felix Sater, a Russian-born real estate developer once convicted of stabbing a man in the neck and face with the stem of a broken margarita glass. \u201cOf all the glasses to stab someone with, a margarita glass is the worst,\u201d Noah said. \u201cYou\u2019re literally putting salt into the wounds.\u201d There was also a conviction for Sater\u2019s involvement in a $40-million stock fraud, Noah added, which came as no surprise to the host. \u201cYou never trust someone with a cat name. If a human goes by Felix or Whiskers or Mittens, you should probably just stay away.\u201d There were emails, of course; there are always emails. \u201cBuddy, our boy can become President of the USA and we can engineer it. I will get all of Putin\u2019s team to buy in on this,\u201d Sater wrote to Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen. \u201cThis buddy boy email may not be the smoking gun for Trump,\u201d Noah concluded, \u201cbut what it could end up being is the broken taillight \u2014 the thing that gives law enforcement the excuse they need to look into Trump\u2019s trunk. \u201cAnd we all know,\u201d he said, as a picture of the golfing president\u2019s derriere appeared over his shoulder, \u201che\u2019s got a lot of junk in that trunk.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nJury president Annette Bening addresses lack of female representation at Venice Film Festival By Nardine Saad (Claudio Onorati / Associated Press) Though there aren\u2019t as many women represented at this year\u2019s Venice Film Festival as she would like, jury president Annette Bening believes \u201cthings are changing.\u201d The four-time Oscar nominee, whose film credits include \u201cAmerican Beauty,\u201d \u201cThe Kids Are All Right,\u201d \u201c20th Century Women\u201d and \u201cBugsy,\u201d addressed the lack of female directors Wednesday during the 74th annual Venice Film Festival\u2018s opening press conference.

(Ricardo DeAratanha / Los Angeles Times) As the city of Charlottesville, Va., and the nation as a whole continues to grapple with the violent racial strife that erupted earlier this month, the Virginia Film Festival announced on Tuesday that it will host filmmaker Spike Lee as a special guest at the upcoming festival as part of a program around the legacy of slavery. Lee, who has tackled thorny issues of race throughout his career, will present his Oscar-nominated documentary \u201c4 Little Girls\u201d about the 1963 bombing of a Baptist church in Birmingham, Ala., that claimed the lives of four African American girls, an act of white supremacist terrorism that marked a pivotal moment in the civil rights movement. \u201cWe have for many years been interested in bringing Spike Lee to the Virginia Film Festival as he remains one of the most talented, innovative, and socially conscious filmmakers in our world today,\u201d said Jody Kielbasa, director of the film festival and vice provost for the arts at the University of Virginia. \u201cWe first reached out to Mr. Lee in the spring to include him in our upcoming collaboration with Montpelier, and of course, the recent events in Charlottesville have made his participation more compelling, relevant and vital.\u201d The festival program will also include a short film titled \u201cI Can\u2019t Breathe\u201d that combines footage of the 2014 chokehold death of Eric Garner during his arrest by a New York City police officer with footage of the death of Radio Raheem under similar circumstances in Lee\u2019s 1989 film \u201cDo the Right Thing. The program is part of a larger collaboration with Montpelier, the Virginia plantation of President James Madison, who owned more than 100 slaves, that will explore both how the legacy of slavery continues to affect the lives of African Americans and how they are depicted in film and other media. The 30th annual Virginia Film Festival will run from Nov. 9 to 12 in Charlottesville.

New Muppeteer Matt Vogel made his vocal debut as the iconic frog on Monday in a \u201cMuppet Thought of the Week\u201d video posted on YouTube. \u201cDreams are how we figure out where we want to go. Life is how we get there,\u201d he says in the brief clip. \u201cI\u2019m headed this way.\u201d The veteran voice actor has worked on \u201cSesame Street\u201d and also operates the Muppets Floyd, Constantine and Sweetums. He is only the third puppeteer to take on Kermit the Frog full time since the character was created in 1955. He replaced former puppeteer Steve Whitmire, who began work on \u201cThe Muppet Show\u201d in 1978 and inherited the role of Kermit when creator Jim Henson died in 1990. Whitmire was dismissed over concerns about his \u201crepeated unacceptable business conduct over a period of many years and he consistently failed to address the feedback,\u201d the Muppets Studio said at the time. Whitmire claimed he was fired in October 2016 and kept quiet about it until Vogel was announced as his replacement in July. It was his \u201copinionated communication style\u201d that earned him his walking papers, he said.

The controversial Maricopa County lawman, who was convicted of criminal contempt of court for violating Latinos\u2019 rights, earned himself a thuggish reputation as a sheriff, Noah said, citing his agency\u2019s use of tent cities, stun guns, jail overcrowding and numerous cases of inmate deaths and police brutality. But those were \u201cjust his extracurriculars,\u201d Noah said. \u201cIt turns out his full-time job is racism.\u201d The 85-year-old Arpaio was found guilty in July of defying a 2011 court order barring officers from stopping and detaining Latino motorists to check their immigration status. \u201cAs much as Sheriff Arpaio presented himself as anti-illegal immigrants, it turned out really he was just anti being a decent human being,\u201d Noah said. When the president of the United States steps in and pardons someone\u2019s contempt conviction, he\u2019s essentially rendering the courts powerless. \u2014 \u2018Daily Show\u2019 host Trevor Noah His abuses hurt inmates and taxpayers, costing the state $142 million in legal fees, settlements and compliance costs, Noah said. Other things they could have spent that money on? \u201cSchools, roads or they could have just paid Conor McGregor and Floyd Mayweather to just punch Arpaio in the face.\u201d But Noah made the point that Trump\u2019s decision completely undercut the judiciary. \u201cRemember how the three branches of government are supposed to be equal? Well, convicting someone of contempt is the one and only way the judicial branch can put muscle behind its decisions. So when the president of the United States steps in and pardons someone\u2019s contempt conviction, he\u2019s essentially rendering the courts powerless,\u201d he said. Watch the full segment above.

The band, which was forced to cancel its Houston show days earlier due to the storm, wrote the song as the region was enduring historic flooding. After acknowledging that he and the band all \u201cgrew up loving country music, and, of course, that\u2019s kind of what we think of when we go to Texas,\u201d Martin asked the crowd to bear with them. \u201cThis is a new song, and we\u2019ll never play it again,\u201d Martin said. \u201cIt\u2019s a once-off. It\u2019s called \u2018Houston.\u2019 We\u2019re going to sing it in Miami for everybody here and then we\u2019re going to send it over there to everyone who missed the show.\u201d Vowing to return to Houston, Martin and band huddled and tentatively started a twangy little number. \u201cI\u2019m dreaming of when I get back to Houston,\u201d sang Martin, replete with a touch of Johnny Cash-ian twang. Describing it as \u201cthat city where they send you into space,\u201d Martin crooned of \u201cCorpus Christi, Harris County, Galveston,\u201d of \u201ca harmony that hums down there in Houston,\u201d and urged the region to \u201ckeep on keeping on.\u201d Merle Haggard it wasn\u2019t (and everyone\u2019s a critic), but the performance drew huge applause from fans and went viral on Tuesday morning. Coldplay\u2019s quick-turnaround ditty is hardly the first to document such deluges. Johnny Cash\u2019s \u201cThree Feet High and Rising\u201d occurred in real time as a family struggled to keep dry.

Calling the situation \u201cjust really unfortunate,\u201d she said Tuesday on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d that she doesn\u2019t remember anything that happened. Seeing video of what transpired on the first day of production on the looking-for-love reality show was \u201clike watching not-me,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m watching someone else.\u201d On that day, Olympios and fellow cast member DeMario Jackson allegedly wound up in the pool or hot tub together in a situation that a producer thought went too far. Allegations of \u201cmisconduct\u201d were made, and production shut down the next day for an investigation that ultimately determined nothing untoward had happened. The show, sans Corinne and DeMario, premiered its fourth season Aug. 14, a week later than originally planned. \u201cI did drink, too much, I definitely understand that,\u201d Olympios said. \u201cBut I was also on a medication that severely blacks you out and impairs your judgment and messes with your balance, that I didn\u2019t know you were not supposed to not drink on, and so it really just caused a horrible, horrible blackout. It was like I went under like anesthesia and then just like woke up.\u201d She\u2019s now weaning off the medication, she said, and cutting down on her drinking. But in explaining her provocative official statement that she was \u201ca victim\u201d living out her \u201cworst nightmare,\u201d Olympios revealed her specific definition of victimhood, which had little or nothing to do with consent, which was a hot topic throughout the scandal. \u201cI was really a victim of the media,\u201d Olympios said. \u201cIt was just, all of a sudden people became an expert on the situation and on what happened, and it was like, I\u2019m still trying to figure out exactly what happened. It was just horrible to deal with. \u201cIt got really, really bad. ...,\u201d she added. \u201cThe things people say are just insane.\u201d When the remaining \u201cParadise\u201d cast met as a whole on the first episode of the season, their sympathies seemed to lie with Jackson as they worried about the long-term effects the scandal would have on him and any future career opportunities, especially given the lingering racial issues of alleged misconduct between a white woman and a black man. However, they were quick to say they were not \u201cslut-shaming\u201d Olympios either. Jackson spoke last week on \u201cBachelor in Paradise,\u201d sitting down with host Chris Harrison to give his take on what happened.

That far surpasses the record set in 2013 by Korean pop star Psy\u2019s \u201cGentleman,\u201d which racked up 36 million views in its first day. It also hasn\u2019t slowed interest in Swift\u2019s previously released lyric video for the same song, which set a record for lyric video viewership by drawing 19 million views in the first 24 hours. That version has now surpassed 47 million views in less than four days.

The production magic of \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is undeniable and it extends to beyond special effects dragons. From Arya donning Walder Frey\u2019s face to dole out her brand of vengeance to Daenerys walking into Dragonstone for the first time, there is plenty to explore from just the first episode alone. The video above dives deep into what it took to craft the Season 7 premiere, including how Cersei\u2019s fancy new giant map came to be. Of course, plenty of fans are probably still contemplating the latest episode and what Jon and Dany\u2019s new level of intimacy means going into the final season. Can this be how the actual prince that was promised is conceived? And if you were a bit squicked out by the pair\u2019s developing relationship, you\u2019re not alone.

In an extensive interview with The Cut, Griffin admitted that her 17-year friendship with Anderson Cooper, with whom she co-hosted CNN\u2019s New Year\u2019s Eve gig for a decade, ended in the wake of the Trump controversy. In May, Griffin publicized a photo shoot that featured her holding a bloodied imitation severed head bearing a strong resemblance to the president. The backlash was immediate and largely bipartisan, as many saw the images as glorifying violence and furthering political division. Griffin quickly apologized for the misstep but the damage had been done, with condemnation from the White House, investigation by the Secret Service and the loss of several jobs, including her CNN gig. On May 30, Cooper tweeted his disapproval of Griffin\u2019s artistic expression, calling it \u201cdisgusting and completely inappropriate,\u201d and Griffin admitted at a June 2 news conference that Cooper\u2019s comments hurt her. For the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in. It is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate. \u2014 Anderson Cooper (@andersoncooper) May 31, 2017 In July, Cooper appeared on Bravo\u2019s \u201cWatch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\u201d and stated that he and Griffin were still friends. \u201cYeah, we\u2019re still friends, and look I said what I said about \u2014 I didn\u2019t think what she said was appropriate, but I wish her the best and I hope she bounces back,\u201d he stated. But Griffin claimed that at that point, nearly two months after the fact, she had yet to hear from Cooper privately. In reality, it wasn\u2019t until Aug. 10 that Cooper finally reached out to Griffin in a series of text messages, CNN confirmed to The Cut \u2014 at which point Griffin informed him that their friendship was over.

The ballad\u2019s a meditation that name-checks Aphex Twin, shoegaze, Talking Heads, \u201cJaws,\u201d Patagonia sportswear and Stanley Kubrick, and moves through verses without much regard for structure. Immediately following the Sunday premiere, Ocean dropped the lyric video on his website. Featuring a souped-up mini-boombox retrofitted with bigger speaker cones and a Velcro-attached machete, the clip suggests an owner getting ready to hunt prey while using \u201cProvider\u201d as the lure. Ocean hasn\u2019t uploaded the clip to YouTube, but you can listen and watch on his blonded.co website.

The 1939 movie, which marked the first Oscar win by a black actor, depicts a romanticized view of slavery and life on a Southern plantation before, during and after the Civil War. \u201cGone With the Wind,\u201d which won 10 Academy Awards in 1940, including for best picture, had been shown by the Orpheum Theatre Group for years as part of an annual Summer Movie Series, according to Memphis\u2019 Commercial-Appeal. At times, it was screened more than once a year, the paper said. This year, however, a different climate prevailed. \u201cThe recent screening of \u2018Gone With the Wind\u2019 at the Orpheum on Friday, Aug. 11, 2017, generated numerous comments,\u201d Brett Batterson, president of the theater group, said Friday in a statement (via the New York Times). \u201cThe Orpheum carefully reviewed all of them. As an organization whose stated mission is to \u2018entertain, educate and enlighten the communities it serves,\u2019 the Orpheum cannot show a film that is insensitive to a large segment of its local population.\u201d The majority of Memphis residents are black, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. The screening happened, coincidentally, on the day before a rally of white nationalists that turned violent in Charlottesville, Va. \u2014 a rally that has been followed by a national conversation about whether to purge monuments to Civil War generals and soldiers from public spaces. In an interview with the Commercial-Appeal, Batterson said the appropriateness of screening \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d had been discussed \u201cevery year,\u201d but \u201cthe social media storm this year really brought it home.\u201d By Monday, comments on social media, including on the Facebook post announcing the screening, had shifted in large part to defense of \u201cGone With the Wind\u201d as a product of its time that, despite its romanticized portrayal of the Old South and of slavery, was still part of movie history and worth showing on a big screen. The Orpheum did not respond Monday to The Times\u2019 requests for comment. Hattie McDaniel\u2019s Oscar win for supporting actress was a significant first but was also \u201cloaded with a lot of political and racial issues given that the film was the classic archetype of the Mammy,\u201d said Adilifu Nama, associate professor of African American Studies at Loyola Marymount University, speaking to The Times in 2014. McDaniel\u2019s role of Mammy \u201cis fundamentally a subservient role and is part of a film that is a Southern racial fantasy,\u201d Nama said.

Fear not! We\u2019ve gathered up four must-see moments from the socially conscious affair (and one lackluster video debut from Taylor Swift) to keep you in the loop. Pink\u2019s PowerPoint presentation It was a banner night for singer Pink, who received the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award for her body of work and used the occasion to share an anecdote about her daughter Willow. Recently, Pink stated, her daughter referred to herself as \u201cthe ugliest person she knew\u201d and complained that she looked like a boy with long hair. At first, the \u201cRaise Your Glass\u201d singer was taken aback by her daughter\u2019s words but soon swung into action, compiling an elaborate PowerPoint presentation about the history of androgynous rock stars, including Michael Jackson, David Bowie and Annie Lennox. Pink relayed a simple sentiment that most of us could learn a lot from: \u201cSo, baby, girl, we don\u2019t change. We take the gravel and the shell and we make a pearl.\u201d Logic talks emotions Plenty of artists used the VMAs stage to speak passionately about issues they care about, but few did so as extensively as rapper Logic. After his performance of \u201c1-800-273-8255\" with Khalid and Alessia Cara, the title of which is the phone number of the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline, Logic talked about mental health and equality. Beginning at 3:50 in the above video, Logic first thanked the audience for giving him a platform to discuss the important issue of mental health. He then quickly pivoted to other pressing social issues including discrimination, sexism and domestic violence. \u201cI don\u2019t give a damn if you\u2019re black, white or any color in between,\u201d Logic said. \u201cI don\u2019t care if you\u2019re Christian, you\u2019re Muslim, you\u2019re gay, you\u2019re straight, I am gonna fight for your equality because I believe that we are all born equal, but we are not treated equally and that is why we must fight.\u201d Jared Leto honors Chester Bennington Logic\u2019s performance and subsequent speech were particularly moving given the past year\u2019s loss of two rock musicians to suicide \u2013 Linkin Park\u2019s Chester Bennington and Soundgarden\u2019s Chris Cornell. Jared Leto, an Academy Award winner and frontman of Thirty Seconds to Mars, spoke about both men at Sunday\u2019s ceremony. \u201cMTV asked me to come here to say a few words about Chester and the late, great, Chris Cornell, two artists I had the absolute pleasure of touring with,\u201d Leto said of the two singers who were also close friends. \u201cChester said of Chris, \u2018Your voice was joy and pain and anger and forgiveness, love and heartache, all wrapped up into one,\u201d Leto recalled. Leto also recounted his own memories of Bennington. \u201cI think about his heart,\u201d Leto said. \u201cAnd I remember his voice. At once ferocious and delicate, that voice will live forever.\u201d Fifth Harmony gets shady Despite the pleas for equality and the heartfelt speeches, there was still plenty of time for pettiness at the VMAs, as evidenced by Fifth Harmony\u2018s performance. As the group took the stage to perform its latest single, \u201cAngel,\u201d a mystery fifth member appeared in the lineup before being unceremoniously yanked offstage as the song began. What appeared as an inexplicable stunt to the uninitiated was likely a shady reference to former Fifth Harmony frontwoman Camila Cabello, who exited the group in December to pursue a solo career. It wasn\u2019t so much that Cabello\u2019s departure stung her former colleagues but that she reportedly failed to inform them of her decision before announcing it to the world. Oops. Also Taylor Swift Unless you were in a coma for the whole of last week, you probably heard that Taylor Swift announced the release date for her upcoming album, \u201cReputation,\u201d as well as releasing the first single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d It\u2019s fine. Sunday night, Swift debuted the video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do.\u201d It is also fine. This has been your daily Taylor Swift update.

Baylen / Los Angeles Times) As Harvey lashed southeastern Texas over the weekend, celebrities rallied for the relief effort. Comedian Kevin Hart led the charge Sunday night, donating $25,000 and challenging his celebrity friends to donate to the Red Cross amid catastrophic flooding in the Lone Star State. \u201cI think we\u2019ve participated in a lot of challenges on the Internet, some meaningful, some meaningless, but we\u2019ve all done them. I\u2019ve been a person that\u2019s partaken in several of them,\u201d Hart said in an Instagram video. \u201cAt this point, this is a serious matter,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think the people are in bad shape and they need help. I\u2019m going to lead the charge and step up in this way.\u201d The \u201cJumanji\u201d star called on his co-star Dwayne Johnson, comics Steve Harvey, Chris Rock, Dave Chappelle and Jerry Seinfeld, as well as musicians Jay-Z, Beyonc\u00e9 and Justin Timberlake to make donations and tag someone else to do the same. At that point, Houston native Beyonc\u00e9 and Kelly Rowland of Destiny\u2019s Child had already posted notes about their hometown on Instagram, sending thoughts and prayers to the state that launched their careers. View Instagram post View Instagram post The deluge of support continued with country star Chris Young. \u201cThe Man I Want to Be\u201d singer posted an emotional YouTube video about his certainty that his Texas home was destroyed and concern for his friends and family in the state. He donated $100,000 to relief efforts to a GoFundMe campaign to benefit the Red Cross. Harvey, one of the worst natural disasters in the state\u2019s history, slammed onshore Friday as a Category 4 hurricane, then weakened to a tropical storm on Saturday, dropping up to 24 inches of rain on Houston in 24 hours. The National Weather Service reported that at least five people had died as of Sunday evening, but that number was expected to increase as the floodwaters recede. More than 30,000 people across the Gulf Coast are likely to seek temporary shelter as the tropical storm continues to drench southeastern Texas and Louisiana with heavy rains and surging floodwaters, The Times reported. Toronto native Drake, who has lived in Houston for the last eight years, said that he and DJ Future the Prince are working with local relief groups \u201cto aid and assist the people of Texas in anyway we can and in the most immediate way possible.\u201d \u201cI also want to thank all the men and women of service and volunteers for their courageous efforts to help people in need,\u201d the rapper said on Instagram. \u201cI encourage everyone to do what they can to assist the people of Texas knowing whatever effort you can make to help will go a long way.\u201d View Instagram post Also, during the MTV Video Music Awards Awards on Sunday, host Katy Perry touched upon the catastrophic event. She too urged viewers to donate to the Red Cross. \u201cAll of us here at the VMAs are sending love to the people of southeastern Texas and everyone affected by Hurricane Harvey right now,\u201d Perry said onstage. \u201cWe\u2019re praying for your safety in the days to come and we stand with you as you rebuild because we\u2019re all in this together.\u201d According to the Houston Chronicle, more than 15 inches of rain could fall on several more southeastern Texas cities. Corpus Christi, where Harvey first made landfall, saw upward of 20 inches of rain in two days. By Monday morning, up to 40 inches of rain had fallen on northeast Houston. Another 20 inches were expected Monday before Tropical Storm Harvey travels farther east.

Cornell and Bennington committed suicide in 2017, and Leto was friends with both. \u201cIn 1976 in Phoenix, Ariz., a child was born.

As she poses and pretends, Swift makes a not-so-veiled reference to her ongoing feud with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, getting all combative behind the microphone as a feather-light melody jumps behind her. The video premiered during a ceremony hosted by pop star and avowed Swift nemesis Katy Perry. Perry didn\u2019t introduce the clip, a hint that the two probably still aren\u2019t besties.

And tonight at the Forum in Inglewood, it was clear that the network decided to go big \u2014 huge really. Upon arrival to the venue it appeared that the scale of this year\u2019s show was unlike anything MTV had done in recent history. A structure that looked like a space shuttle swallowed the lot in front of the venue, and stars such as Cardi B and Big Freedia could be seen pumping through the red carpet (it\u2019s a deep shade of blue this year). Inside the Forum, the stage took up the entirety of the venue\u2019s ground floor. The imprint of the stage was impressive, even overwhelming in size as a maze of catwalks and secondary stages traced the floor, all of which was outlined by hundreds of glowing triangles and projection screens. It made for a futuristic playground of geometric glowing shapes that show opener Kendrick Lamar put to use immediately as he emerged from the center of the venue for the explosive \u201cDNA,\u201d strutting through half of the venue before making it to the main stage.

It\u2019s also the best 24-hour figure Swift has logged, besting the first-day result for her 2015 official video for \u201cBad Blood,\u201d which attracted 17 million views, and has since totaled more than 1.1 billion views. As of Sunday morning, the tally for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d had surpassed 35 million. It sets the stage for the premiere tonight of Swift\u2019s official video for the new single, which will be introduced during the MTV Video Music Awards Ceremony, taking place at the Forum in Inglewood. The overall record for viewership in the first 24 hours for any music video belongs to Adele, who registered 27.7 million views in 2015 at the premiere of the official video for her song \u201cHello.\u201d Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nShow more sharing options Share Close extra sharing options Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nLinkedIn\n\nEmail\n\nCopy Link URL Copied!\n\nPrint\n\nWhy William Friedkin called Tobe Hooper\u2019s \u2018Texas Chain Saw Massacre\u2019 an Umami Burger of a movie By Mark Olsen Director Tobe Hooper, who died in Los Angeles on Saturday at age 74, created many movies and TV shows during his long career \u2014 including stepping to helm the filming of \u201cPoltergeist\u201d when Steven Spielberg was contractually banned from directing other films during the production of \u201cET: The Extra Terrestrial.\u201d Hooper\u2019s most admired film, of course, was 1974\u2019s \u201cThe Texas Chain Saw Massacre.\u201d In 2014, on the occasion of the film\u2019s 40th anniversary, \u201cThe Exorcist\u201d director William Friedkin interviewed Hooper before an overflow audience at Los Angeles\u2019 Vista theater. During the engaging conversation, Friedkin called Hooper \u201cone of the sweetest, nicest guys I\u2019ve ever known.\u201d And then added, \u201cSo I often wonder where this stuff comes from.\u201d Hooper talked about purposely pitting his actors against each other to keep the on-screen tension high, how an unlikely pair of albums \u2014 Elton John\u2019s \u201cGoodbye Yellow Brick Road\u201d and Lou Reed\u2019s \u201cBerlin\u201d \u2014 inspired him during the writing of the screenplay, and about \u201chow damn strong women are,\u201d referring to the resilent character played by Marilyn Burns. \u201cShe\u2019s just not going to die.\u201d At one point, Friedkin provocatively asked, \u201cDo you think this is a work of art?\u201d Hooper first asked, \u201cShould I be modest?\u201d before responding with a salty confirmation, \u201cIt\u2019s a ... work of art.\u201d The Times\u2019 Mark Olsen was there for the interview. At the end of his article, there\u2019s this affirmation of the film from Friedkin: \u201cNo 3-D, no CGI, welcome to this Umami Burger of a movie.\u201d Read on to find his reasoning.

(Lawrence K. Ho / Los Angeles Times) Following the resignations Tuesday of two leadership figures at Cinefamily, the Los Angeles independent film venue has announced that it is temporarily suspending all activities to \u201callow for the investigation and necessary restructure of management and the board.\u201d \u201cRecently, claims were made alleging improper behavior by one of more members of the organization,\u201d reads a release posted on the organization\u2019s website and social media pages. \u201cThe Board of Directors of The Cinefamily has no tolerance for any form of behavior that does not conform to the high standards demanded by our members and staff and that of common human decency.\u201d The letter also says that Cinefamily is bringing on \u201can independent third party, Giles Miller at Lynx Insights & Investigations, to conduct a thorough investigation\u201d into the allegations. View Twitter post A spokesperson for the theater could not immediately be reached for comment. The announcement comes in the wake of two high profile exits: co-founder and executive creative director, Hadrian Belove, and vice president of its board of directors, Shadie Elnashai, resigned on Tuesday following allegations of sexual misconduct. The exits were announced in postings on Cinefamily\u2019s social media accounts. \u201cIn light of recent events, Shadie Elnashai has resigned from Cinefamily\u2019s Board of Directors and Hadrian Belove has resigned as the Executive Creative Director of Cinefamily,\u201d read the statement. Addressing the anonymous allegations in a post to his personal Facebook account following his resignation, Belove described the email\u2019s contents as \u201cdemonstrable lies and half-truths, and allegations without known victims.\u201d It is not clear whether screenings currently scheduled will still run, and there has been grumbling by monthly billed members as to whether or not automated charges will be suspended or cancelled.

He was 74. The Los Angeles County coroner\u2019s office says Hooper died Saturday in Sherman Oaks. It was reported as a natural death. Hooper and contemporaries like George Romero crafted some of the scariest nightmares that ever haunted moviegoers.

By Mikael Wood We can skip the rundown of Taylor Swift\u2019s feud with Kanye West, right? Less than 24 hours after the world\u2019s biggest pop star unleashed her new single on a waiting commentariat, I\u2019m already exhausted by the idea of having to read (let alone write) yet another rehash of this deeply tiresome conflict. But you know who\u2019s not over it? Taylor Swift. In \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d \u2014 released online Thursday night as the lead single from a new album, \u201cReputation,\u201d due in November \u2014 the singer sounds positively fired up as she takes whack after brutal whack at the rapper who once interrupted her at an awards show. (Swift doesn\u2019t name West, to be clear, but with her reference to a \u201ctilted stage,\u201d she doesn\u2019t need to.) \u201cI don\u2019t like your perfect crime / How you laugh when you lie,\u201d she seethes over a throbbing electronic groove, \u201cYou said the gun was mine / Isn\u2019t cool \u2014 no, I don\u2019t like you.\u201d Later in the tune, which Swift created with Jack Antonoff, she pretends to answer a phone call from someone evidently looking for \u201cthe old Taylor\u201d \u2014 the sucker, you presume, who might\u2019ve let bygones be bygones. But she can\u2019t come to the phone, Swift tells the caller. \u201cWhy?\u201d she adds. \u201cOh, \u2019cause she\u2019s dead.\u201d What\u2019s surprising about \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d \u2014 beyond the harsh industrial production that makes it feel like Swift\u2019s response to her enemy\u2019s \u201cYeezus\u201d \u2014 is that it suggests the singer no longer cares (or is no longer able to tell) what pop fans want. Swift rose to superstardom by anticipating listeners\u2019 desires; she knew just when to pivot from acoustic guitars to sleek synthesizers, from the fairy-tale romance of early hits like \u201cLove Story\u201d to the more grown-up depiction found on her last album, 2014\u2019s smash \u201c1989.\u201d On tour behind that record, she spent a good portion of her show every night telling the members of her audience how closely she\u2019d been paying attention to them. But dredging up Taylor v. Kanye again? I mean, I can\u2019t be the only one who\u2019s sick of this topic \u2014 something Swift would\u2019ve known a few years ago without even having to think about it. OK, so she hardly lacks for company among A-listers eager to cook expired beef. Earlier this summer Katy Perry revived her ancient tussle with Swift \u2014 I believe it had something to do with backup dancers? \u2014 for \u201cSwish Swish.\u201d But Perry\u2019s song takes delight in its own pettiness, whereas \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d just makes me think of President Trump whining endlessly about fake news. (Crediting Right Said Fred for the song\u2019s supposed debt to \u201cI\u2019m Too Sexy\u201d is funny in writing, but the inspiration adds little humor to the dour music.) Maybe Swift isn\u2019t aiming for me, though. Maybe this polarizing song is meant to galvanize her base \u2014 which, sure enough, is rhapsodizing about the track on social media \u2014 even at the expense of the wider world she\u2019s dominated for much of the last decade. If that\u2019s her play, it\u2019s a wild one, especially coming after her powerful testimony during the recent trial regarding her alleged sexual assault at the hands of a Denver radio DJ. In court, Swift appeared driven to speak with a voice loud enough for others. Now, just days later, she seems uninterested in that job. Have we ever seen a pop star so happily give up a portion of her following? That\u2019s an idea I\u2019m not tired of considering. Maybe \u201cReputation\u201d will take it up.

(Michael Owen Baker / For The Times) As the potentially devastating Hurricane Harvey approaches the Texas coast, major acts including Coldplay, Lady Antebellum and Mary J. Blige have canceled or rescheduled their Houston-area concerts. Coldplay on Friday postponed a show scheduled for NRG Stadium in Houston. \u201cWe really wanted to play tonight, but sitting here all together watching the news about the storm, we feel that we can\u2019t ask anyone to put their safety at risk. So, sadly, we will have to postpone,\u201d the band wrote. Live Nation Houston said ticket-holders would be updated when there was further information. \u201cWe urge all fans in the area to stay safe,\u201d it said. A makeup date has not yet been scheduled. The country trio Lady Antebellum canceled its Sunday show at the Cynthia Woods Mitchell Pavilion in the Woodlands, citing the storm. Blige postponed her Friday show at the Smart Financial Centre at Sugar Land. The venue announced that the concert had been rescheduled to Sept. 19. The Category 3 storm, which would be the first major hurricane to hit the United States since 2005, is expected to make landfall in coastal Texas on Saturday morning, bringing 100-mph winds and up to 35 inches of rain in some areas.

The \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u201d actor, the \u201cBad Moms\u201d actress and the outlet \u201chave reached a satisfactory resolution of their legal action\u201d regarding the publication of photos of their children, their legal representatives said in a joint statement to The Times on Friday. The couple, who starred in \u201cThat \u201870s Show\u201d together years before they began dating, took the website\u2019s publisher, Associated Newspapers, to London\u2019s High Court in July 2015 over two articles featuring their daughter, who was 1 at the time. The U.K.'s MailOnline.com published images of Wyatt taken during a private family outing to the beach. A paparazzo used a long-lens camera to obtain the images, and the couple said they were unaware the photos were being taken. They claimed that the photos breached the Data Protection Act and were used for the unauthorized promotion of clothing on the website. [T]hey have reached a satisfactory resolution of their legal action, which includes an agreement to pixelate photographs of their daughter, Wyatt, their son, Dimitri, and any future children they should have together. \u2014 Joint statement from Kutcher, Kunis and the MailOnline announcing their lawsuit settlement Per the agreement announced Friday, the outlet will \u201cpixelate photographs of Kutcher\u2019s and Kunis\u2019 daughter, Wyatt, their son, Dimitri, and any future children they should have together.\u201d The settlement is the latest legal blow to MailOnline and its associated newspaper, the Daily Mail. (The U.S. version of the website, DailyMail.com, is run by a separate news team.) In April, the tabloid\u2019s parent company settled a libel suit with First Lady Melania Trump over an article it ran in the paper and online that suggested she may have once worked as an escort. In July 2014, George Clooney lambasted the Daily Mail in a USA Today op-ed that accused it of \u201cmaking up stories\u201d in the wake of an article it published about his mother-in-law. He got an apology and an acknowledgement that the story was inaccurate. That same month, Angelina Jolie reportedly threatened to take legal action after it published a video that claimed to show her under the influence of heroin in the 1990s.

Nothing like the \u201cobjectified\u201d \u201cbeauty icon\u201d he considers Wonder Woman to be. Jenkins points out that Cameron\u2019s narrow qualifications for what makes a \u201cgood\u201d female hero are restrictive and not at all progressive. \u201cIf women have to always be hard, tough and troubled to be strong, and we aren\u2019t free to be multidimensional or celebrate an icon of women everywhere because she is attractive and loving, then we haven\u2019t come very far have we,\u201d Jenkins wrote. Jenkins also insisted that there should be room for all types of female lead characters and that women themselves should be the judge of these \u201cicons of progress.\u201d \u201cThere is no right and wrong kind of powerful woman,\u201d she wrote.
