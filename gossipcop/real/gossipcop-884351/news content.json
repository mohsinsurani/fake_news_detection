He was put on life support, but after it was determined that he had no brain activity, the decision was made on Monday to pull life support, according to TMZ.\n\nPetty\u2019s music career began more than 40 years ago with a local Gainesville, Fla. band named Mudcrutch. The group fell apart, but two of its members, Mike Campbell and Benmont Tench, would soon rejoin their friend for a new (and much longer-lasting) venture: Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nBetween 1976 and 1987, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers released seven albums, organically becoming one of the biggest rock bands in the world. Their third album, Damn the Torpedoes (1979), went platinum almost immediately, featuring breakthrough singles like \u201cDon\u2019t Do Me Like That\u201d and \u201cRefugee.\u201d\n\nAfter a break from the band in the early \u201890s, Tom Petty reunited with the Heartbreakers first for a movie soundtrack and then for their 1999 album \u201cEcho.\u201d Since then, the band has released three more albums and continue to tour around the globe: Just last week, they wrapped their 40th anniversary tour.\n\nIn his 2015 biography, Petty opened up about the darkness that had plagued him since childhood. He was four years old when his father first beat him: \u201cI remember it so well,\u201d he said. \u201cHe beat me so bad that I was covered in raised welts, from my head to my toes. I mean, you can't imagine someone hitting a child like that.\u201d His father died in 1999; they had never reconciled.\n\nThe turmoil led to longtime depression, which Petty attempted to numb with heroin in the 1990s, he said. \u201cThe only thing that stopped the pain was drugs,\u201d he explained, adding that using making the decision to use heroin was \u201cstupid.\u201d In discussing his past drug use, Petty worried, his biographer told the Washington Post, that he would be setting a bad example for others.\n\nPetty wed his teenage-years girlfriend, Jane Benyo, in 1974. Unfortunately, the marriage soured as Petty\u2019s international fame skyrocketed: A drug addict herself, Benyo reportedly became abusive as she allegedly verbally abusing Petty and the couple\u2019s two daughters, Adria and AnnaKim Violette. Their divorce was finalized in 1996.\n\nIn 2001, Petty married Dana York Epperson, whom he had first met a decade earlier at one of his concerts. They shared the Malibu home where Petty went into cardiac arrest.\n\nMore from AOL.com:\n\nCBS exec fired for \u2018deeply unacceptable\u2019 post about \u2018Republican gun toters\u2019 after Vegas shooting\n\nDon Lemon holds hands with boyfriend Tim Malone at 'Saturday Night Live' after-party: Pic!\n\nSerena Williams flaunts slim waist in form-fitting dress just one month after giving birth", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190830/aol-logo.svg", "https://s.aolcdn.com/caas-assets-production/assets/v1/images/icons/happening-now-icon-white.svg", "https://s.aolcdn.com/aoldotcom-releases/lazyload/blank.gif", "https://s.aolcdn.com/caas-assets-production/assets/v1/images/icons/close.svg", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0b6piL5aOq15LY6XzizIGQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/d47596dcb4c90d877bd7780af031260e/0/RTR1WN7F.jpeg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/csZxOr8GJ1DduJ1YIW8ZVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDtoPTgw/https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/hlogos/aol_Light.png"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0b6piL5aOq15LY6XzizIGQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/d47596dcb4c90d877bd7780af031260e/0/RTR1WN7F.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aol Staff", "Jennifer Kline", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/10/03/tom-petty-dead-at-66-following-cardiac-arrest-see-his-life-in-photos/23230246/", "title": "Tom Petty dead at 66 following cardiac arrest: See his life in photos", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.aol.com"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@AOL", "dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "com.aol.mobile.aolapp"}, "name": {"googleplay": "Aol App"}, "url": {"googleplay": "https://www.aol.com/23230246.html"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@AOL", "domain": "www.aol.com", "description": "Tom Petty, whose hits like 'American Girl' and 'Free Fallin' made him one of the world's biggest rock stars, has died at age 66.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0b6piL5aOq15LY6XzizIGQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/d47596dcb4c90d877bd7780af031260e/0/RTR1WN7F.jpeg", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0b6piL5aOq15LY6XzizIGQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/d47596dcb4c90d877bd7780af031260e/0/RTR1WN7F.jpeg"}, "title": "Tom Petty dead at 66 following cardiac arrest: See his life in photos", "account_id": 66237835}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=646100661,app-argument=https://www.aol.com/23230246.html", "news_keywords": "Tom Petty, Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers, cardiac arrest, Benmont Tench, Jane Benyo", "robots": "index,follow", "author": "AOL Staff", "google-site-verification": "ko2245Ra2QPRrivJQepBc3qAXmApiF8Wrb1nbWAP_jc", "msapplication-config": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/aolfp/metadata/browserconfig.xml?q=12347133", "msapplication-TileColor": "#39f", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/aolfp/metadata/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "AC51FE4BBA33843E8A3FC86F4B7024F2", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "category": "entertainment", "publish-date": "October 2, 2017", "description": "Tom Petty, whose hits like 'American Girl' and 'Free Fallin' made him one of the world's biggest rock stars, has died at age 66.", "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Aol App", "package": "com.aol.mobile.aolapp", "url": "https://www.aol.com/23230246.html"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Aol App", "app_store_id": 646100661, "url": "https://www.aol.com/23230246.html"}}, "og": {"type": "website", "app_id": 183146218394780, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/0b6piL5aOq15LY6XzizIGQ--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/d47596dcb4c90d877bd7780af031260e/0/RTR1WN7F.jpeg", "description": "Tom Petty, whose hits like 'American Girl' and 'Free Fallin' made him one of the world's biggest rock stars, has died at age 66.", "title": "Tom Petty dead at 66 following cardiac arrest: See his life in photos", "url": "https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/10/03/tom-petty-dead-at-66-following-cardiac-arrest-see-his-life-in-photos/23230246/"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506985200.0, "source": "https://www.aol.com", "summary": ""}
