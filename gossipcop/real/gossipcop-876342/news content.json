{"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/celebrity/taylor-swift-is-selling-i-heart-ts-shirts-aka-the-kind-tom-hiddleston-wore/", "text": "Last night, Taylor Swift premiered her new music video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d and it was met with reactions. The stans were screaming, \u201cYAS,\u201d and everyone else was like, \u201cHmm, okay.\u201d No matter what you think of it, it\u2019s clear that Swift had a vision. One of those visions was seizing every narrative that\u2019s ever been crafted about her and monetizing it.\n\nSwift\u2019s online shop features snake accessories and something a little more subversive. Remember that \u201cI Heart TS\u201d tank that Tom Hiddleston was spotted wearing in the ocean last July 4th at Swift\u2019s Rhode Island house? The very same shirts that were featured in her new music video on her backup dancers?\n\nYeah, Swift sells \u201cI <3 TS\u201d shirts now.\n\nIn her online shop, she sells them for $50 a pop.\n\nShe also sells a crop-top version. To think that a thing everyone made fun of is going to be worn on the backs of every pre-teen fan in the audience at her shows is mind-boggling. If this is something you\u2019re into, you can buy it here.\n\nAlso, just because the symbol needs to be mentioned, Swift has $60 snake rings in her online shop as well.\n\nBack when \u201cI <3 TS\u201d was only a Hiddleswift meme, Hiddleston himself explained how he came to wear said shirt.\n\n\u201cThe truth is it was the Fourth of July and a public holiday and we were playing a game and I slipped and hurt my back,\u201d he told GQ. \u201cAnd I wanted to protect the graze from the sun and said, \u2018Does anyone have a T-shirt?\u2019 And one of her friends said, \u2018I\u2019ve got this.\u2019 We all laughed about it. It was a joke. It was a joke among friends.\u201d", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/28/swiftheart.png?resize=640%2C360&quality=82&strip=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='569'%20height='581'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/28/ts-shirt.png", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='580'%20height='543'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/28/snake-ring.png", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/28/swiftheart.png", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/28/swiftheart.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Vanderberg"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/taylor-swift-is-selling-i-heart-ts-shirts-aka-the-kind-tom-hiddleston-wore/", "title": "Taylor Swift is selling \"I Heart TS\" shirts, aka the kind Tom Hiddleston wore - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Taylor Swift is attempting to monetize any jokes or rumors made at her expense, starting with these \"I Heart TS\" shirts she's selling.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift is selling \"I Heart TS\" shirts, aka the kind Tom Hiddleston wore - HelloGiggles", "description": "Taylor Swift is attempting to monetize any jokes or rumors made at her expense, starting with these \"I Heart TS\" shirts she's selling.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/taylor-swift-is-selling-i-heart-ts-shirts-aka-the-kind-tom-hiddleston-wore/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/28/swiftheart.png", "width": 537, "height": 227, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-28T18:56:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-18T01:24:05+00:00"}, "author": "madison vanderberg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "madison vanderberg", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503946565.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
