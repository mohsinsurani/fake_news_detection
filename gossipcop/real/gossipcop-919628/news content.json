Karin Hallsten Schulz was one of those critics, writing in the comments, \u201cYes, feminist that believe in God and stand up for The Unborn. I would be for that kind of feminist,\u201d according to Bustle.\n\nRELATED: Jessica Chastain Helped Octavia Spencer Get Five Times Her Original Salary for Their New Movie\n\nRather than skip over the comment, Chastain took a peek at Schulz\u2019s Instagram handle, which has a link for her GoFundMe page. Schulz and her husband have been trying to start a family since they tied the knot in 2015, and she\u2019s raising money for fertility treatments on the site.\n\n\u201cMy hormone levels and egg quality aren't the best, due to my age,\u201d Schutz wrote. \u201cWe found out that we would need help to become pregnant. It was very disheartening to hear these results.\u201d She continued, \u201cThe idea of having us to go into debt to become pregnant made me so, so sad. It is hard to know your body doesn't do what it is supposed to do. But even through it all, we remember that God is faithful and true, and He has great plans for us. He knows the desires of our hearts to become parents.\u201d\n\nSchulz and her husband have a $5,000 goal, and Chastain donated $2,000 to help them achieve it.\n\nRELATED: Jessica Chastain Speaks Out Against Her All-White LA Times Magazine Cover\n\nAfter she did, Chastain responded to Schulz\u2019s comment on the \u2018gram, writing, \"Yes you can decide what is right for you. I am pro-choice and I believe that everyone has the right to make their own decision. I read about your journey to become a mother and it broke my heart. I hope that your dream will come true in 2018! Much love to you\u201d.\n\nSchulz was quick to thank the actress for her sweet and generous gesture. \"Dear Jessica. Thank you for your words, for your encouragement and loving wishes I too am a feminist!! It is ok if we don't see eye to eye on everything. We do agree on more than we disagree!! You are my sister, and together wonderful change and more awesome things will happen in this beautiful world we live in. Love Always Karin.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035646im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035646im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035646im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035646im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035646im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/03/030918-jessica-chastain-lead.jpg?itok=DOFsMj82"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035646im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/03/030918-jessica-chastain-lead.jpg?itok=DOFsMj82", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandi Fowler"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180310035646/http://www.instyle.com/news/jessica-chastain-donates-money-woman-criticized-feminist-instagram", "title": "Why Jessica Chastain Gave $2,000 to a Woman Who Criticized Her Feminist Instagram Post", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Celebrity,Social Media,News,latest,Jessica Chastain", "news_keywords": "Celebrity,Social Media,News,latest,Jessica Chastain", "description": "Jessica Chastain responded to a follower's critique of her feminist Instagram post for International Women's Day by donating $2,000 to help with her fertility treatment.
