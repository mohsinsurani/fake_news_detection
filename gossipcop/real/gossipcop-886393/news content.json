Last night on Instagram, the model of the moment teased her loyal fan base of 36 million followers and counting with the announcement of her very own makeup line with Maybelline. Beauty junkies everywhere went wild.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n\u201cA year in the making...\u201d captioned the image, which found the model, clad in faux-shearling and leaning over a drool-worthy table of brushes, concealers and lipsticks, ranging in shades of nude, light pink and deep berry purple. (Her face-framing blowout and 70s-inspired tinted shades gave off girl-in-charge vibes a la Gloria Steinem during her Ms. days.) And while the news comes fresh off the heels of yet another multi-tasking It-girl's makeup brand, it's safe to say that the sunny sister, who is famous for her supermodel abs and So-Cal beach waves, will offer up the same makeup palate of tawny nude-colored statements that has secured her a spot as fashion\u2019s favorite beauty icon. And although Hadid has been known to take a winning risk every now and then (hello, last month\u2019s super-cool, graphic cat eye), the social media star tends to stick to her golden-girl roots, playing up a few key signatures: a set of fluttery lashes, a fleshy pink pout and that flawless, smooth complexion.\n\nAfter becoming the face of the brand over two years ago, it was only a matter of time before the soon-to-be beauty mogul crafted her own glow-inducing products. After all, who wouldn't want to look like Gigi? For a drugstore price none the less. Here is to the line \"coming soon.\"", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6328729a42296b5636d30839/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/633c6a57fa8ccd7955ea1562/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6336f496c4ca1612b2222852/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59dbd13bb5f1bb164401a650/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-gigi-hadid-maybelline.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632c9821865823be1b6826de/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/63307ed44523ea24a7af0893/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632718f3e89efd644675cc93/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59dbd0c13db3a03293edb3ac/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/00-story-image-gigi-hadid-maybelline.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59dbd13bb5f1bb164401a650/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-gigi-hadid-maybelline.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Jenna Rennert"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/gigi-hadid-makeup-maybelline-line-collaboration-nude-lipstick-instagram", "title": "What You Need to Know About Gigi Hadid\u2019s New Makeup Line With Maybelline", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Free off the heels of fashion month, the model of the moment is launching a new makeup line with Maybelline.", "id": "59dbce9a8b2d8d666d9efb94", "keywords": "gigi hadid", "news_keywords": "gigi hadid", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59dbce9a8b2d8d666d9efb94", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Free off the heels of fashion month, the model of the moment is launching a new makeup line with Maybelline.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59dbd0bb3db3a03293edb3aa/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-image-gigi-hadid-maybelline.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59dbd0bb3db3a03293edb3aa/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-promo-image-gigi-hadid-maybelline.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59dbd13bb5f1bb164401a650/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-gigi-hadid-maybelline.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "What You Need to Know About Gigi Hadid\u2019s New Makeup Line With Maybelline", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/gigi-hadid-makeup-maybelline-line-collaboration-nude-lipstick-instagram"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-09T20:50:41.615Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-09T20:50:41.615Z", "author": "Jenna Rennert"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/59dbd13bb5f1bb164401a650/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-image-gigi-hadid-maybelline.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "What You Need to Know About Gigi Hadid\u2019s New Makeup Line With Maybelline"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507582241.615, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
