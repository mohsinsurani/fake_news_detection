I am just a better version of me than I was 10 years ago,\u201d Hilton said in a video posted on his website Monday. \u201cDo I still have work to do? Can I still be even better? Fuck yeah, but I am not that person in the past. And if you\u2019re trying to keep me in the prison that is the past, then fuck you!\u201d\n\nHilton then said, \u201cSo, actually this video is for Jennifer Lawrence, to say \u2018fuck you\u2019! And I\u2019m going to get in trouble for that, but I don\u2019t give a shit.\u201d\n\nSee photos: Party Report in Pictures: Jennifer Lawrence, Reese Witherspoon, Jon Stewart and SNL\u2019s Week Off\n\nAs TheWrap previously reported, the Oscar-winning actress scolded Hilton in the November issue of Vanity Fair for posting \u2014 and then removing \u2014 nude photos of her that emerged in August as part of the massive celebrity photo hack. Kate Upton, Kaley Cuoco and Meagan Good were also targeted.\n\n\u201cHe took it down because people got pissed, and that\u2019s the only reason why,\u201d Lawrence said. \u201cAnd then I had to watch his apology. And what he basically said was \u2018I just didn\u2019t think about it\u2019 \u2026 \u2018I just didn\u2019t think about it\u2019 is not an excuse. That is the exact issue itself.\u201d\n\nBut Hilton, whose real name is Mario Lavandeira, wasn\u2019t happy with her characterization of his previous apology.\n\nAlso read: Jennifer Lawrence Slams Gossip Blogger Perez Hilton for Posting Her Nude Photos\n\n\u201cShe mentions how she was forced to watch the video I made right after her naked photos surfaced online. In that video, I apologized to her sincerely from my heart,\u201d he said in Monday\u2019s video. \u201cAnd I did so more than once. And I was tempted to apologize to her again, but you know what \u2026 No. Fuck that. Life isn\u2019t always what you want. And you don\u2019t always get what you ask for,\u201d Hilton said.\n\n\u201cThat video that I made and me explaining my thought process was real, it was sincere, and it wasn\u2019t some bullshit made up excuse.\u201d\n\nHe wasn\u2019t finished. After dropping those aforementioned f-bombs, Hilton then called Lawrence out for bringing up his past. And he also strangely brought up actor Robert Downey Jr.\n\nAlso read: Meagan Good Rips Fans for Reposting Her Leaked Nude Photos: \u2018You Should Be Ashamed\u2019\n\n\u201cWhen you think about Robert Downey Jr. , you don\u2019t think \u2018oh, he\u2019s a drug addict\u2019 or \u2018a recovering drug addict.\u2019 You think about that actor that you truly love,\u201d he said.\n\nBut eventually Hilton changed his tune and said sorry.\n\n\u201cYou were extremely hurt. I contributed to that. I genuinely am sorry,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope that you can look inside my brain and see that I truly, truly did not pre-meditatively, purposely decide to hurt you. And that\u2019s all that I have to say, I will not be making any more comments on this.\u201d\n\n\u201cOr maybe I will.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/perez-hilton-jennifer-lawrence.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0e3695c7e6334b66bba91631e8240954?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewrap.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fthewrap-canvas%2Fimgs%2Fthewrap-gravatar.png&r=g", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thewrap-film-slate.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo_Small.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo-Stacked.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Image-2022-04-26-at-3.00.43-PM-300x81.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/perez-hilton-jennifer-lawrence.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Travis Reilly"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/perez-hilton-fires-back-at-jennifer-lawrences-vanity-fair-comments-f-ck-you-im-sorry-video/", "title": "Perez Hilton Fires Back at Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Vanity Fair Comments: \u2018F-ck You\u2026 I\u2019m Sorry\u2019 (Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f9f9f9", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-title": "Perez Hilton Fires Back at Jennifer Lawrence\u2019s Vanity Fair Comments: \u2018F-ck You\u2026 I\u2019m Sorry\u2019 (Video)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/perez-hilton-fires-back-at-jennifer-lawrences-vanity-fair-comments-f-ck-you-im-sorry-video/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2014-10-20T18:24:00-07:00", "parsely-section": "media", "parsely-author": "Travis Reilly", "parsely-tags": "jennifer_lawrence, nude-photos, perez_hilton, robert-downey-jr", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/perez-hilton-jennifer-lawrence-160x105.jpg"}, "description": "Celebrity gossip blogger lashes out at the \"Hunger Games\" actress but then apologizes for initially posting her hacked nude photos", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Perez Hilton Fires Back at Jennifer Lawrence's Vanity Fair Comments: 'F-ck You...
