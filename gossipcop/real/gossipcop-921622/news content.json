District attorney wasn\u2019t convinced about the validity of the case, leading to the felony charges being dropped against the singer.\n\nSongz\u2019s lawyer reportedly presented several eye-witness statements that contradicted the statements given by Buera, as well as other info damaging to Buera\u2019s credibility.\n\nThe assault was first reported back in February, with Buera giving a press conference with her side of the story in early March, where she claimed that he beat her so badly that she had to be sent to the hospital. She also confirmed that she had received a temporary restraining order against Songz. Since then, Songz was forced to turn himself in to police, and was released from jail on a $50,000 bond. In his sole statement on the situation, Songz claimed that he was \u201cbeing lied on and falsely accused for someone\u2019s personal gain.\u201d\n\nDespite gaining support from other artists such as 50 Cent, who called the accusations a \u201cmoney play,\u201d Songz still has several accusations against him from multiple women.\n\nHowever, in this instance it appears he\u2019s gotten off easy. Songz still isn\u2019t off the hook yet, as his case is now being referred to the L.A. City Attorney, who can still charge him with the lesser crime of misdemeanor domestic violence.\n\nWe\u2019ll keep you up to date with any more news about the case.", "images": ["https://editor.urbanlinx.net/wp-content/uploads/cover/25/36/1523283625_795abbffa4d49a2014b7176e19fee887.jpg?resize=918,627"], "top_img": "https://editor.urbanlinx.net/wp-content/uploads/cover/25/36/1523283625_795abbffa4d49a2014b7176e19fee887.jpg?resize=918,627", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matthew Parizot"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/100842-trey-songz-will-reportedly-not-face-felony-charges-for-domestic-violence-case-news", "title": "Trey Songz Will Reportedly Not Face Felony Charges For Domestic Violence Case", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#000000", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no;user-scalable=0;", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Trey Songz Will Reportedly Not Face Felony Charges For Domestic Violence Case", "description": "Good news for Trey Songz.", "url": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/100842-trey-songz-will-reportedly-not-face-felony-charges-for-domestic-violence-case-news", "site_name": "HotNewHipHop", "image": {"identifier": "https://editor.urbanlinx.net/wp-content/uploads/cover/25/36/1523283625_795abbffa4d49a2014b7176e19fee887.jpg?resize=918,627", "width": 918, "height": 627, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/realhotnewhiphop/", "published_time": "2018-04-09T10:48:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-26T05:14:53+00:00"}, "author": "Matthew Parizot", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@HotNewHipHop", "site": "@HotNewHipHop", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Matthew Parizot", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "next-head-count": 37}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523270884.0, "source": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com", "summary": ""}
