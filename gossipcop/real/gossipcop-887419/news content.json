Gomez recently underwent a recent kidney transplant to aid her ongoing battle with Lupus.\n\nLast night, Gomez shared an Instagram video with her 4-year-old sister, Gracie Elliot Teefey. The two are sitting by the ocean when Gracie says, \u201cI\u2019m not scared.\u201d Gomez responds by saying, \u201cBecause you are fearless, right? You\u2019re not scared of anything, right?\u201d Then the two share a high five.\n\nSweet, right?! Wait it gets better. Gomez captioned the video with this empowering message: \u201cI will forever let my sister know she is strong, bold, and beautiful. She will be raised to know her voice matters. She is going to understand the importance behind being a leader and inspire others by her truth.\u201d\n\nWatch the empowering video here.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://allpro.pro.poola.tritondigitalcms.com/kcxx-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/textclub-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/4225/sites/4/2017/10/17093628/selena-gomez-may-1-2017-billboard-1548-e1508258200270.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://allpro.pro.poola.tritondigitalcms.com/kcxx-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/twitter-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/4225/sites/4/2016/01/19091358/logo-main.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://allpro.pro.poola.tritondigitalcms.com/kcxx-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/facebook-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://allpro.pro.poola.tritondigitalcms.com/kcxx-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/textclub-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://allpro.pro.poola.tritondigitalcms.com/kcxx-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/instagram-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://allpro.pro.poola.tritondigitalcms.com/kcxx-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/02/yt-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/4225/sites/4/2016/02/19091345/john-desantis.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://allpro.pro.poola.tritondigitalcms.com/kcxx-fm/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2016/01/listenlive.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855im_/http://images.tritondigitalcms.com/4225/sites/4/2017/10/17093628/selena-gomez-may-1-2017-billboard-1548-e1508258200270.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855/http://www.hot1039.com/watch-selena-gomez-give-an-empowering-message-to-little-sister/", "title": "Watch Selena Gomez Give an Empowering Message to Little Sister", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "site_name": "KHTI-FM", "title": "Watch Selena Gomez Give an Empowering Message to Little Sister", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171017232855/http://www.hot1039.com/watch-selena-gomez-give-an-empowering-message-to-little-sister/", "type": "article", "description": "We all know Selena Gomez knows a thing about being brave and strong.
