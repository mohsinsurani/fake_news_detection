That\u2019s right, strapless and sequined all-over, the epic frock came covered in galactic glittering stars.\n\nOf course, like most trends it may come as no coincidence that intergalactic motifs were first spotted on the runways of the Autumn Winter 2017 fashion shows.\n\nFlounced Dress, \u00a324.99, H&M\n\nChanel staged its show around a double C-branded spacecraft that even had a mock liftoff, as well as astronaut prints, sparkly lunar boots and metallic space blankets.\n\nDior\u2019s Maria Grazia Chiuri also explored constellations as an extension of her couture collection, with evening gowns emblazoned with phases of the moon, golden colours and cosmic elements scattered on sweaters.\n\nRose gold Starburst Short Drop Earrings, \u00a315, Accessorize\n\nA trend that proves entirely wearable in real life, if the thought of donning spacecraft-inspired garb is all a bit too Rebel Alliance for your liking, then there\u2019s always jewellery.\n\nInstead, star spangle your accessories with zodiac trinkets from Astley Clarke, twinkling jewels from Diane Kordas \u2013 or, if you\u2019re on a budget, high street stores such as Topshop and Accessorize promise to light up your complexion.\n\nStar Embellished Clutch Bag, \u00a314, George at Asda\n\nStar and Moon Print Frill Top, \u00a329, Topshop", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/23/ms-constellation-print-midi-dress.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/23/ms-constellation-print-midi-dress.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/23/ms-constellation-print-midi-dress.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Young"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/star-print-galaxy-fashion-style-autumn-winter-2018-chanel-dior-marks-and-spencer-a8140796.html", "title": "Seeing stars: Intergalactic style is here to stay for 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Astrological motifs and space-inspired references have dominated both on and off the runway this season, as designers and the style savvy looked to the skies for their next fashion fix.", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Fashion", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/life-style/fashion", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-01-08T06:51:02.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Intergalactic style is here to stay for 2018", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/star-print-galaxy-fashion-style-autumn-winter-2018-chanel-dior-marks-and-spencer-a8140796.html", "type": "article", "description": "Astrological motifs and space-inspired references have dominated both on and off the runway this season, as designers and the style savvy looked to the skies for their next fashion fix.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/23/ms-constellation-print-midi-dress.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/23/ms-constellation-print-midi-dress.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-08T06:51:02.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-08T06:51:02.000Z", "section": "Lifestyle", "subsection": "Fashion", "author_name": "Sarah Young", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 344, "image_count": 6, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2018-01-08T06:51:02.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Intergalactic style is here to stay for 2018", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Astrological motifs and space-inspired references have dominated both on and off the runway this season, as designers and the style savvy looked to the skies for their next fashion fix.", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/01/03/23/ms-constellation-print-midi-dress.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "fashion and style,Chanel,Dior,Marks And Spencer,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515394262.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
