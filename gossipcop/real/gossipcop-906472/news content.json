The actor, who has been on a whirlwind press-tour stumping for Call Me by Your Name, declared on Tuesday that he is donating his salary from the upcoming Allen film A Rainy Day in New York to three different charities: Time\u2019s Up, RAINN, and the L.G.B.T. Center in New York. He made the announcement with a statement posted to Instagram, clarifying that he was inspired to donate his salary after seeing the wave of activism that has taken over Hollywood.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to profit from my work on the film,\u201d Chalamet said, after first saying that due to \u201ccontractual obligations,\u201d he can\u2019t speak directly about his decision to work with Allen. That said, Chalamet indicated that he initially joined the Allen project because he is \u201ca young actor trying to walk in the footsteps of more seasoned actors I admire.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I am learning that a good role isn\u2019t the only criteria for accepting a job\u2014that has become much clearer to me in the past few months, having witnessed the birth of a powerful movement intent on ending injustice, inequality and, above all, silence,\u201d he continued.\n\nChalamet ultimately decided to donate his salary to various charities because he wants \u201cto be worthy of standing shoulder to shoulder with the brave artists who are fighting for all people to be treated with the respect and dignity they deserve.\u201d\n\nHis high-profile co-stars in the film, including Selena Gomez, Jude Law, Liev Schreiber, and Elle Fanning, have largely remained silent on this matter\u2014even when asked about it directly. Chalamet\u2019s co-star Rebecca Hall, however\u2014who also starred in Allen\u2019s 2008 film Vicky Cristina Barcelona\u2014has said she regrets working on the project and has donated her salary from the film to Time\u2019s Up.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nChalamet has been asked several times in the last few months about his decision to work with Allen\u2014a controversial figure most recently because of accusations from his estranged daughter. Dylan Farrow, who was adopted by Allen and Mia Farrow, has alleged that Allen sexually abused her when she was a child. Allen has denied the claims.\n\nFarrow made headlines again in December with an op-ed for the Los Angeles Times that asked why the #MeToo movement\u2014which has swept up the careers of alleged predators like Harvey Weinstein\u2014had not yet had an impact on Allen\u2019s career. Farrow specifically called out stars who have worked with Allen recently, including Greta Gerwig and Blake Lively, who danced around acknowledging the allegations against Allen in various interviews. \u201cIt breaks my heart when women and men I admire work with Allen, then refuse to answer questions about it,\u201d Farrow wrote.\n\nBut in the weeks since her op-ed was published, there has been a sea change in the industry response to Allen. Gerwig, for example, eventually told The New York Times that she regrets working with Allen and \u201cwill not work for him again.\u201d She was largely inspired to take that stance after reading pieces by Dylan Farrow.\n\nJust a few days later, Mira Sorvino, who won an Oscar after starring in Allen\u2019s 1995 film Mighty Aphrodite, penned an open letter in which she apologized directly to Farrow. \u201cI never personally experienced what has now been described as inappropriate behavior toward young girls,\u201d she said. \u201cBut this does not excuse my turning a blind eye to your story simply because I wanted desperately for it not to be so.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63289a827bc899fa8a2e0127/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined",
