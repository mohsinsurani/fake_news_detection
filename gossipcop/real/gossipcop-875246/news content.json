Although \u201cThe Book of Henry\u201d actress is currently enjoying a whirlwind romance with Jack Kelly for over seven months, the talented teen is the first one to admit that she\u2019s still too young for love.\n\nThe \u201cBallerina\u201d actress first ignited dating rumors when she posted a bathroom selfie with Jack Kelly back in January. Maddie Ziegler captioned the sweet snap with a purple heart and many of her fans quickly took that as a sign that she was indeed dating the Australian hottie.\n\nMaddie enjoys romance with Jack Kelly but understands the limits\n\nAlthough Maddie Ziegler never really talked about her boyfriend at the time, her and Jack Kelly\u2019s social media posts were enough proof to confirm that they were in a romantic relationship. The pair has been sharing photos of them together and adding sweet messages on the snaps, but Maddie recently revealed that she's taking things slow with her beau.\n\n\"I would never want things to move too quick and plus I know I'm still 14, I'm still a child,\u201d Maddie Ziegler shared to Entertainment Tonight. \u201cBut Jack is really great and I have a good time with him.\u201d\n\nMaddie Ziegler is clearly smitten with Jack Kelly and she is always smiling when talking about her boyfriend.\n\nHowever, the 14-year-old dancer, actress, model, and businesswoman would rather not talk about Abby Lee Miller or say nothing but bad things about her.\n\nMaddie wants nothing to do with former 'Dance Moms' mentor\n\nIn the same interview, Maddie Ziegler was also asked if she was still in contact with the famously tough dance teacher, and she quickly said \u201cno.\u201d When asked if she was surprised with Abby Lee Miller\u2019s fraud and money laundering cases, Maddie opted not to say anything about her former mentor at all.\n\nIt can be recalled that Maddie Ziegler and the 50-year-old dance instructor and choreographer used to be close. However, their teacher-student relationship suddenly changed when \u201cThe Book of Henry\u201d actress and her younger sister Mackenzie Ziegler decided to quit \u201cDance Moms\u201d to focus on their individual careers outside the Lifetime show.\n\nNow, Maddie Ziegler has noted that she is a lot happier after leaving the reality dance television series even though the hit show catapulted her to stardom. The star has since expanded her brand and is now one of the most promising stars in Hollywood.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/7/3/660x290/b_502x220x75/maddie-ziegler-may-be-happy-with-jacky-kelly-but-she-is-not-ready-for-their-romance-to-move-too-quickly-via-youtube-dancesnapz_1421211.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/7/3/660x290/b_1200x630x75/maddie-ziegler-may-be-happy-with-jacky-kelly-but-she-is-not-ready-for-their-romance-to-move-too-quickly-via-youtube-dancesnapz_1421211.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/4/94/profile_4094525_1507041290.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/2/52/profile_2052547_1487651390.jpg"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/7/3/660x290/b_1200x630x75/maddie-ziegler-may-be-happy-with-jacky-kelly-but-she-is-not-ready-for-their-romance-to-move-too-quickly-via-youtube-dancesnapz_1421211.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Kat Kenneth", "Ablee Miller Admits Fear Of Being Abused In Prison", "Ablee Miller Plans To Survive Prison Pretending She S", "Shooting A Movie", "Ablee Miller Reveals She'S Not Tough Enough For Prison"], "canonical_link": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/07/maddie-ziegler-adores-jack-kelly-but-believes-shes-still-too-young-for-love-001819721.html", "title": "Maddie Ziegler adores Jack Kelly but believes she\u2019s still too young for love", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, user-scalable=0", "description": "Maddie Ziegler may be happy with Jacky Kelly but she is not ready for their romance to move too quickly.", "news_keywords": "Maddie Ziegler, Jack Kelly", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956, "pages": 556225464427184}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Blasting News", "url": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/07/maddie-ziegler-adores-jack-kelly-but-believes-shes-still-too-young-for-love-001819721.html", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Maddie Ziegler adores Jack Kelly but believes she\u2019s still too young for love", "image": {"identifier": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/7/3/660x290/b_1200x630x75/maddie-ziegler-may-be-happy-with-jacky-kelly-but-she-is-not-ready-for-their-romance-to-move-too-quickly-via-youtube-dancesnapz_1421211.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Maddie Ziegler may be happy with Jacky Kelly but she is not ready for their romance to move too quickly.
