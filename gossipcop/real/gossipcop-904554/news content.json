Oprah Winfrey\u2014the talkshow host, philanthropist, producer, actress and businesswoman\u2014stole the show with a moving and cohesive speech that touched on everything from racial equality to press freedom to sexual harassment and brought tears to the star-filled audience.\n\nWinfrey\u2014whose unsurpassable compassion and relatability has brought her both incredible fame and fortune\u2014made the memorable speech as the first African American woman to ever accept the Cecil B. DeMille Award, honoring her contributions to the world of entertainment. (With a net worth of $2.8 billion, Winfrey is the only billionaire to have, herself, won an award, though Steven Spielberg, worth $3.6 billion, was nominated, and Jeff Bezos, worth $103 billion, was likely celebrating the many wins of Amazon Studio's The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel.)\n\nFollowing her acceptance, Winfrey headed backstage to answer questions posed by various members of the press. Her answers demonstrated the same balance of justifiable frustration and hope that her speech did and further addressed the Time's Up movement, while also turning to her personal journey\u2014and, of course, including some of that Oprah Winfrey wisdom.\n\nWhat is the greatest lesson you\u2019ve learned throughout your life and career?\n\n\"The greatest lesson I\u2019ve learned throughout my career came from Maya Angelou actually. After I\u2019d known her for a while, she said, \u2018Baby, you know, you need to know that when people show you who they are, you believe them the first time. And your problem is that it takes you 29 times.' I that has been one of my greatest wisdom-teachings: to assess from people\u2019s behavior\u2014their actions not just towards me, but towards other people\u2014who they are. I think in business and in personal relationships that\u2019s been my greatest lesson. Also staying grounded has been really great for me.\"\n\nWhat humbles you right now?\n\n\"This humbles me! When they first called me and said they wanted me to accept this, I said, \u2018I shouldn\u2019t be the person to get the Cecil B. DeMille Award.\u2019 You know why? I was working with Reese Witherspoon this past spring and winter, and I happened to say in the makeup room one morning, \u2018How many movies have you done?\u2019 She goes \u2018Oh, honey child, I don\u2019t know. It\u2019s been so many.\u2019 And I then thought, \u2018I hope she doesn\u2019t ask me, because I think it\u2019s been five.\u2019 So I didn\u2019t understand [the award], and then they explained it\u2019s about overall entertainment.\"\n\nWhat I was able to do with The Oprah Show and the cultural statement we were able to make throughout the world, I feel very, very, very proud of that. But I think that when it comes to films that I am really the new kid on the block. And I always feel that when I\u2019m acting, I am out of my box, and it\u2019s the most intimidated I ever feel.\"\n\nI\u2019m curious what wisdom you can pass on to me and my friends? We are film school scholarship recipients of the Hollywood Foreign Press. What wisdom can you pass on to the future generation here in Hollywood that wants to make movies?\n\n\"The way to make movies is to do stuff that you love because for 25 years I worked on The Oprah Show, and, Stedman will tell you, there were nights I came home and it was hard to even take off my clothes because I knew I was going to be getting up four hours later. I felt exhausted, but I never really felt depleted.\n\nDo the work that comes straight from the soul of you\u2014from your background, from stories that you\u2019ve grown up with, from stories that bring you passion, from stories that you not just yearn to tell, but that if you don't tell them, they won\u2019t get told.\n\nThe single greatest wisdom I think I\u2019ve ever received\u2014other than when people show you who you are\u2014is that the key to fulfillment, success, happiness, contentment in life is when you align your personality with what your soul actually came to do. I believe everybody has a soul\u2014has their own personal, spiritual energy\u2014so when you can use your personality to serve whatever that thing is, you can\u2019t help but be successful. So if you do films that come from the interior of your soul\u2014you do work, you do art\u2014that comes from the interior of you, you cannot miss.\n\nIt\u2019s only when you\u2019re doing stuff that you think may make money, you think may be a hit or you think may bring you some level of attention or success, that isn\u2019t what does it. I would have to say that all of the great, wonderful experiences of my life that have brought me to this moment, have come from working from the interior of myself. And so that\u2019s why it feels so authentic, because it actually is. So when you do that, you\u2019ll win.\"\n\nWhat advice would you give to seven-year-old Oprah about being a woman surviving in this world?\n\n\"At seven, I was so sad. At seven, all of my real love came from my teachers. I would say this to anyone in this room: You have no idea the power of noticing another human being and what it feels like when someone knows they have been seen\u2014truly seen\u2014by you. It is the greatest offering you can give.\n\nAll those years at The Oprah Show, the greatest lesson I learned, was that after every show, someone would say, invariably, in one way or another, \u201cHow was that?\u201d I\u2019d finish an interview of a father who killed his twin daughters, I\u2019d finish an interview with a politician\u2014Barack Obama, Joe Biden, George Bush\u2014or with Beyonce. They all say the same thing: \u2018How was that?\u2019\n\nSo I started to see that there is this common thread in our humanity where everyone wants to know 'How was that? Did I do okay? Did you hear me? Did what I say mean something to you?'\n\nSo I would say that recognizing that in other people has helped me be able to become a person of compassion, a person of understanding, a person who can interview anybody about anything, because I know that the core of you is the same as the core of me, you just want to be heard.\"\n\nLast year when Meryl Streep won this award, it was a very different time\u2014Trump had just won, and since then we\u2019ve had all of the allegations. With your speech, with everyone in solidarity in black tonight, do you feel that the country together as a whole is moving in a better direction that we moved last year?\n\n\"I always think and know\u2014having watched it over the years, through thousands and thousands of interviews and watching people in their dysfunction\u2014that when something really negative is brewing, that there is the direct opposite reaction that is also possible. For every action, there\u2019s an equal and opposite reaction. So when something as big as what started to happen in October with Harvey Weinstein started to unfold, I though 'Woah, woah, woah.' And with every day\u2019s revelation, I thought, here is an opportunity for a powerful growth, and how do we use this moment to elevate what is happening instead of continuing to victimize ourselves.\n\nSo I think that wearing black in solidarity is one step. I think what Time\u2019s Up is doing with a legal defense fund is a major step. It was very important to all of us involved with Time\u2019s Up that it not just be about the women of Hollywood, because we're already a privileged group, but to extend to the women of the world. As I said tonight, there isn\u2019t a culture, a race, a religion, a politic, a workplace that hasn\u2019t been affected by it. One of the reasons I wanted to tell Recy Taylor\u2019s story is because it's been happening for a very long time\u2014when people didn\u2019t know that they could speak up. There are so many women who have endured so much and remained silent and kept going because there was no other recourse. And now that we've all joined as one voice, I think that it feels like empowerment to those women who have never had it.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074306im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/dam/imageserve/902386684/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074306im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F902386684%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074306im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/144x144/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Ffiles%2F2015%2F02%2Fmaddieberg_avatar_1425069302.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074306im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F902386684%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madeline Berg"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074306/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2018/01/08/what-oprah-winfrey-the-star-of-the-golden-globes-had-to-say-backstage/", "title": "What Oprah Winfrey, The Star Of The Golden Globes, Had To Say Backstage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "What Oprah Winfrey, The Star Of The Golden Globes, Had To Say Backstage", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074306im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F902386684%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "updated_time": "2018-01-08T00:42:04-05:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108074306/https://www.forbes.com/sites/maddieberg/2018/01/08/what-oprah-winfrey-the-star-of-the-golden-globes-had-to-say-backstage/", "description": "After her powerful speech, the Cecil B.
