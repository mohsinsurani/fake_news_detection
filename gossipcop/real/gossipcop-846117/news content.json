Luckily, at the Time 100 Gala last night (Tuesday, April 25), Ashley Graham was able to catch herself before she took a serious tumble, after the back of her dress got caught on her 4.5-inch heel.\n\nIt was a close save, as the supermodel could\u2019ve fallen flat on her face while trying to strike a pose on the red carpet. Graham gasped as she felt herself falling, and of course the shutterbugs caught the whole thing. But the 29-year-old \u2014 who was dressed to the nines in a Cami NYC plunging black gown, cinched at the waist with a corset, and Jimmy Choo \u201cPearl\u201d peep-toe sandals \u2014 was able to laugh off the incident.\n\nAshley Graham steps out at the Time 100 Gala in New York on April 25.
