A little more than a month later, the rock legend is being remembered by his daughter Toni Cornell. The daughter of the Audioslave frontman penned an emotional and heartbreaking letter to her dad, who she called her \u201cidol.\u201d The touching letter shared some of her favorite moments spent with her father.\n\nThe letter speaks highly of the Soundgarden and Audioslave frontman who would often tell his 12-year-old daughter to \u201cDon\u2019t sit worrying peanut. Worry is a waste of time, I\u2019m ok.\u201d\n\nThe letter was posted to Cornell\u2019s official Facebook page on Monday since she was missing him on Father\u2019s Day.\n\n\u201cDaddy,\n\nLet me start by saying how much I love you and how much you mean to me. You are my idol, someone I\u2019ve always looked up to. You were always there for me. You pushed me forward every day, and you still do.\n\nWhenever I cry or feel like there\u2019s no way I can go on, I hear your voice, \u2018Don\u2019t sit worrying peanut. Worry is a waste of time, I\u2019m ok.\u2019\n\nI always took what you said to heart. Probably because everything you said was so smart.\n\nEvery time you came home from tour you spent all your hours with us. No matter how tired you were, how many time zones you traveled, you were there for us.\n\nWhenever I was sick you would take care of me. You would cuddle with me, hug me, kiss me. You didn\u2019t care about getting sick. You would stay up all night to make sure my fever went down. And if it didn\u2019t, you would wake me up and give me my medicine. I would open my eyes, see you, and feel better.\n\nI have so many memories with you but one of my favorite ones was earlier this year when I was jetlagged and we watched \u2018Purple Rain\u2019. We were staying at the BHH and you came into my room when I was trying to find a movie to watch.\n\n\u2018How about Purple Rain?\u2019 you said. I always trusted your judgement. I put it on and immediately fell in love! We then got to your favorite song, \u2018The Beautiful Ones\u2019.\n\n\u2018This song is so special it doesn\u2019t even belong in a genre. When I was in my twenties, I saw this in the theatre and some guy started cracking up laughing at this scene and song. It got me really mad,\u2019 you said.\n\nI fell in love with the song too and listened to it on repeat.\n\nOur special connection was always the arts. Poems, books, music, writing. We both have a unconditional love for it.\n\nWho\u2019s going to introduce me to movies like \u2018Purple Rain\u2019 and songs like \u2018The Beautiful Ones\u2019 now? I\u2019m hoping I will find some because you trained me so well.\n\nI know you are still here, and the warmth I feel beneath the cold, is you. YOU ARE THE BEST FATHER IN THE WHOLE WIDE WORLD. And I know, that if this wasn\u2019t an accident, you\u2019d still be cuddling with me watching \u2018Purple Rain\u2019.\n\nI love you and miss you so, Daddy. You deserve your own day to be celebrated because you are the best dad anyone could ever have. Happy Father\u2019s Day!\n\nLove,\n\nYour Baby Toni\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1179056832248952&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/JORGE-01.png?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/DOUG-avatar.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/clay-sauertieg-avatar.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PAC-12-Fails-To-Reach-Deal-With-ESPN-And-Fox-Sports-To-Continue-Television-Rights-Deal.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kanye-west-gigi-hadid.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/brandon-wenerd-avatar.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1431021967-e1665241758426.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CASS-01.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/CONNOR-01.png?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/bob-menery-breaks-full-send-silence-says-built-it-was-used.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/22c07ff907c4993d2e71ebfb5570356b?s=85&r=g", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/tom-conroy-avatar.jpg?w=44", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/themes/brobible/assets/images/logo.svg", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/BroBible-photo.jpg?w=47", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/eric-ital.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chris_cornell_daughter_letter.jpg", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-Orleans-Saints-Will-Be-Short-Handed-Again-For-Matchup-Against-Seahawks.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Eckrich_Original_Skinless_SmokedSausage_Rope.png?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=c5F3s1ah9W20em", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0d83581f68109c1ae2166acf2b713132?s=50&r=g", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chris_cornell_daughter_letter.jpg?quality=90&w=650", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1663747047200561&ev=PageView&noscript=1&eid=16637470472005612e04d7b3-cd55-4c9d-96e7-bdaf98017dcf&cd%5Btags%5D=Audioslave%2C+Chris+Cornell%2C+Music%2C+Toni+Cornell&cd%5Bpost_category%5D=Entertainment&cd%5Bpage_title%5D=Chris+Cornell%E2%80%99s+Daughter+Pens+Heartbreaking+Letter+To+Her+%27Idol%27+And+Dad&cd%5Bpost_type%5D=post&cd%5Bpost_id%5D=22655697&cd%5Bplugin%5D=PixelYourSite&cd%5Bevent_url%5D=brobible.com%2Fentertainment%2Farticle%2Fchris-cornell-daughter-letter-dad%2F&cd%5Buser_role%5D=guest", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/sean-costello-avatar.jpg?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/john-vaccaro-avatar.png?w=50", "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Collage-Maker-08-Oct-2022-12.01-PM.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chris_cornell_daughter_letter.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paul Sacca"], "canonical_link": "https://brobible.com/entertainment/article/chris-cornell-daughter-letter-dad/", "title": "Chris Cornell\u2019s Daughter Pens Heartbreaking Letter To Her \u2018Idol\u2019 And Dad", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Copyright": "2022 Horseneck Media, LLC", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "paulsacca", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes", "text": {"title": "Chris Cornell\u2019s Daughter Pens Heartbreaking Letter To Her \u2018Idol\u2019 And Dad"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://brobible.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/chris_cornell_daughter_letter.jpg?w=640", "alt": "Chris Cornell Daughter Letter"}, "title": "Chris Cornell\u2019s Daughter Pens Heartbreaking Letter To Her \u2018Idol\u2019 And Dad"}, "fb": {"pages": 108698394910, "app_id": 537702696375827}, "p": {"domain_verify": "dfe4f29d190c152a4b503e48d15f4a71"}, "keywords": "entertainment, audioslave, chris cornell, music, toni cornell", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chris Cornell\u2019s Daughter Pens Heartbreaking Letter To Her \u2018Idol\u2019 And Dad", "description": "On May 18, 2017, Chris Cornell took his own life after performing at a show in Detroit.
