His muses of late are venerable stars like Jessica Lange, Kathy Bates, and Angela Bassett, among others\u2014gifted performers who have seen their options in Hollywood largely dry up over the years. That simply won\u2019t do for Murphy. And his latest series, Feud\u2014the behind-the-scenes story of Bette Davis and Joan Crawford\u2019s legendary rivalry\u2014has given Murphy the perfect vehicle to ramp up his crusade, particularly when it comes to sexualizing older female actresses on-screen.\n\nIn an interview with The Hollywood Reporter, Murphy discusses that particular urge, explaining why (spoiler alert!) he really wanted to include a sex scene between Davis (played by Susan Sarandon) and What Ever Happened to Baby Jane? director Robert Aldrich (Alfred Molina) in the last episode. Both Davis and Crawford were in their 50s when they filmed this movie, at an age where older female actresses are \u201cno longer sexualized,\u201d Murphy said.\n\n\u201cIt was important to me and to Jessica and Susan to show that side of Bette and Joan,\u201d he continued. \u201cThey were sexual in that they did have romances, they did sleep with men in their 50s. They weren\u2019t just actresses and mothers, they had a completely other thing going on, as everybody does.\u201d\n\nHe and his lead actresses \u201cspent a lot of time\u201d discussing Bette and Joan\u2019s sexual lives (which were famously voracious), and were determined to document them. In fact, after Davis wrapped Baby Jane, she had an affair with an actor in his 20s while filming Hush . . . Hush, Sweet Charlotte, Murphy told the Reporter. \u201cNobody ever thought of that of Bette Davis, but that\u2019s who she was and how she acted. I love that she lived her life unapologetically as a man would and I wanted to show that.\u201d\n\nBefore Murphy became FX\u2019s in-house TV auteur, he was an entertainment journalist who actually got to spend time with Davis, which informed the way he shaped her character in Feud: \u201cI got to ask her these questions [about her rivalry with Crawford]\u2014I did reporting many years ago, and it was never published.\u201d\n\nMurphy\u2019s determination to champion older actresses also comes from his personal experience and friendships with older stars. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up with many women in my career now, all of whom come into my office and sometimes break down in tears, saying suddenly the phone has stopped ringing. \u2018Suddenly people aren\u2019t interested in me anymore just because I got older.\u2019 And I\u2019m very moved by that,\u201d he said. \u201cPersevering and fighting to stay in the game instead of giving up and still fighting to demonstrate your self worth is tremendously moving. For me, the saddest thing in the world is always lost potential.\u201d", "images":
