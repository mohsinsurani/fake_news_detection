Okay, moving on.\u201d\n\nVanderpump added, \u201cYou know the answer to that question.\u201d\n\n\u201cLike you just said: there are certain people you butt heads with, there\u2019s certain people you can have conflict with,\u201d E!\u2019s Catt Sadler said to Vanderpump. \u201cWhy is she the exception?\u201d\n\nIn Vanderpump\u2019s eyes, Glanville \u201ctakes it to a whole other level and I don\u2019t even want to kind of dignify that with an answer.\u201d\n\nThough Vanderpump actively helps dogs \u2014 she and her husband, Ken Todd, have opened their own rescue dog center \u2014 she joked that she \u201ccan rescue some dogs, but I can\u2019t rescue all my friends.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Brandi Glanville Slaps Lisa Vanderpump On \u2018RHOBH\u2019\n\nDuring Glanville\u2019s time on the Bravo reality series, audiences witnessed the highs and lows of her relationship with Vanderpump, who she famously slapped during an episode of RHOBH.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE in February 2015, Vanderpump said she \u201chad a horrible season last year,\u201d and added, \u201cThey threw everything at me last year, the other women.
