PEOPLE has reached out to Red Bank authorities for further information.\n\nEdwards was charged with simple possession of heroin and is currently being held in the Hamilton County Jail without bond, according to the Hamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office. He is scheduled to appear in Red Bank Court on Aug. 6.\n\nThe Ashley was the first to report the news. MTV did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nHamilton County Sheriff\u2019s Office\n\nEdwards was previously arrested in March for violating terms of his probation stemming from a prior heroin possession charge \u2014 one day after it was revealed on the MTV series that he and wife Mackenzie Standifer Edwards are expecting their first child together. The couple secretly tied the knot last June before Edwards, whose battle with substance abuse has been documented on the show, headed to rehab.\n\nFollowing Edwards\u2019 March arrest, his ex Maci Bookout filed for an order of protection against him that included her three children: Bentley, 9, whom she shares with Edwards, as well as Jayde, 3, and Maverick, 2, whom she shares with husband Taylor McKinney. According to court documents obtained by E! News, Bookout claimed Edwards had threatened to hurt her and take their son.\n\nShe was reportedly granted the two-year order in May.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom\u2019s Maci Bookout Granted 2 Year Order of Protection Against Ex Ryan Edwards: Report\n\nEdwards\u2019 latest arrest comes just days after he and his wife Mackenzie announced they would not be returning for the upcoming season of Teen Mom OG. Mackenzie told E! News that \u201cthe network told us they don\u2019t want to show Ryan as a recovering addict.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey also want to take Maci\u2019s word on how I\u2019m doing,\u201d Edwards told the outlet. \u201cMaci\u2019s said she\u2019s not going to film unless I enter rehab again and quit the show. But I\u2019m sober.\u201d\n\nEdwards also recently spoke out against MTV in an emotional Instagram post about his battle with addiction.\n\n\u201cI will never stop speaking out against this horrible disease! It consumes your life and turns you into someone even you don\u2019t know,\u201d he began. \u201cI\u2019m asking you to never give up. Each day is a struggle. I\u2019ve made mistakes and I have really messed up in the past but there is so much hope ahead and it doesn\u2019t mean I can\u2019t change the future. If you or someone you know needs help, please don\u2019t hesitate to go SAMHSA.gov. Help is out there.\u201d\n\nEdwards alleged that MTV doesn\u2019t want to show him or Mackenzie \u201cin a happy light or that I am active in my recovery.\u201d\n\n\u201cThey want me to look angry, passive aggressive and uncaring regarding things that mean the most to me,\u201d he said. \u201c\u2018Im done taking their s\u2014 and letting the world believe this by standing up for myself. You\u2019re believing a lie. And soon\u2026 very very soon, you WILL see the TRUTH behind the LIAR.\u201d", "images":
