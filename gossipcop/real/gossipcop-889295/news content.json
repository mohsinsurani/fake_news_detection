Since you have dense breasts, just go across the hall for your sonogram,\u2019 \u201d Goodacre, 53, tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue. But during the sonogram, something was detected. After undergoing a biopsy, Goodacre received the harrowing news \u2014 during breast cancer awareness month \u2014 that she had Stage 1 invasive ductal carcinoma and would need to immediately undergo a lumpectomy, followed by radiation.\n\nFor more from Harry Connick Jr. and Jill Goodacre, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE on newsstands Friday\n\n\u201cI was scared I was going to lose her, absolutely,\u201d says Connick Jr., 50, whose mother died of ovarian cancer when he was 13. \u201cI wasn\u2019t going to let her see that, but I was. I know from losing my mom that the worst can happen. She\u2019s my best friend, and I really don\u2019t know what I would do without her.\u201d\n\nFor Goodacre, one of the hardest parts of her cancer battle was telling the couple\u2019s three daughters \u2014 Georgia, 21, Sara Kate (who goes by Kate), 20, and Charlotte, 15 \u2014 about the diagnosis. \u201cIt broke my heart,\u201d she shares.\n\nBryan Bedder/NBCUniversal\n\nAlthough the mother of three did not have to undergo chemotherapy, her treatment has been grueling.\n\n\u201cThe lumpectomy didn\u2019t come back with clean margins,\u201d she explains. Pathology tests showed she also had extensive ductal carcinoma in situ, a less invasive form of the disease. \u201cSo I had to go in for a second surgery the very next day. And then radiation absolutely wiped me out. And since then there\u2019s been the Tamoxifen, which I\u2019ve now been taking for five years.\u201d\n\nTamoxifen, an estrogen modulator taken in pill form that helps prevent the development of hormone receptor-positive breast cancers, can have difficult side effects, including weight gain, which Goodacre \u2014 a former Victoria\u2019s Secret model \u2014 has admittedly struggled with.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve always been a pretty fit person, and so to be just rounder and heavier and not to really be able to do much about it \u2014 that\u2019s been hard. It\u2019s taken a lot out of my self-confidence,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a part of how the cancer and the treatment impacted her, and it was a real issue, even though she will always be the most beautiful woman in the world,\u201d adds Connick Jr.\n\nNow, as she approaches the five-year mark of remission, Goodacre is looking forward to stopping Tamoxifen soon and preparing to tell the world what few outside her family knew.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t like we were superstitious, like if we said something about being in the clear we\u2019d somehow jinx it,\u201d Goodacre says. \u201cBut we wanted to be well on the other side of things before we told everybody. The doctors all say that after the five-year mark, things look optimistic, so we\u2019re starting to feel pretty good.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not something that\u2019s just going to go away like it never happened,\u201d adds Goodacre. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a little nervous, always having to get checked, always hoping it doesn\u2019t come back.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday\u2019s episode of Harry, the couple will candidly discuss her cancer journey and the day she was diagnosed \u2014 \u201cIt\u2019s one of the hardest days of my life,\u201d she recalls \u2014 in a heart-to-heart discussion.\n\n\u201cAll I wanted to do was grow old with you and have as many years as possible as I could with you,\u201d Connick Jr. tells Goodacre in a PEOPLE exclusive sneak peek of the interview.\n\nGoodacre tells him, \u201cYou always used to say that: \u2018I just want to grow old with you.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true,\u201d Connick Jr. says. \u201cI wanted to know what you would look like older. \u2026 I made the right decision.\u201d\n\nHarry airs weekdays (check local listings or visit Harrytv.com).", "images":
