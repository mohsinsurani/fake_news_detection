The fact that you can never make it out of the store in less than thirty minutes without stuffing your shopping cart with things you don't need is proof of that. But do you really love Target? Like, enough to take your wedding photos there? One Miami couple is currently going viral after recently using the store to take their wedding photos \u2014 and the pictures are nothing short of stunning.\n\nEvan Rich Photography\n\nThe couple pictured is Michael Delvalle and Isabella Sablan from Florida, and they've stated that Target has always played a significant role in their eight-year relationship.\n\n\"Even if we didn't need anything, Target always knew what was best for us and it never failed to send us home without some sort of delicious treat, household good, or one of those beautiful red tag clearance items that now consume our entire home de\u0301cor,\" they wrote, speaking on why they chose Target as their photo shoot location in a story that we can all relate to, tbh. The newlyweds continued, \"When it came time to decide on a location to shoot our engagement photos, we knew it had to be somewhere with deep personal meaning- somewhere that contributed to the development of our relationship \u2014 so naturally our first inclination was the enthralling aisles of our favorite emporium.\"\n\nEvan Rich Photography\n\nMichael and Isabella officially tied the knot right after their sweet and fun-filled photo shoot at the store. So now they can rage in Target for the rest of their days as a husband and wife \u2014 a love story for the ages.\n\nFollow Delish on Instagram.\n\nDownload the Delish app.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/food-quotes-cover-1664300432.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.00977xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-squash-explainer-1665156804.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gh-072920-best-kids-lunch-box-1596043949.png?crop=0.466xw:0.717xh;0.263xw,0.236xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/1280x1280/square-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-fallfruits-1662572205.gif?crop=0.560xw:1.00xh;0.222xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/2048x1024/landscape-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image-from-ios-1633385289.jpg?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.223xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/40/768x766/1506956722-1506773136-hp-1506714823_1.jpg?resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/food-fashion-1658757725.jpg?crop=0.5551670551670551xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/delish-eggnog-spice-cake-still003-1574825973.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/1520550554-michandl0005-2-preview.jpeg?resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nabisco-oreo-billboard-with-two-girls-watching-tv-and-old-news-photo-1663690807.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-adventcal-1660880317.gif?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.223xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/delish/static/images/logos/network-logo.921541b.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/38/768x768/square-1505770110-vb-pouringopenbox-1.jpg?resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ecomm-halloweenbeers-1660744280.jpg?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.223xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ghk-index-lunchboxes-041-web-1658783613.jpg?crop=0.503xw:1.00xh;0.0353xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/1520549924-peeks0021-preview.jpeg?resize=480:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/2048x1024/landscape-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.delish.com/food/a58666/couple-wedding-photos-target/", "title": "This FL Couple Took Their Wedding Photos At Target", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "This Couple Took Their Wedding Photos At Target, Combining Their Two Great Loves", "description": "The pics will make your heart melt.", "keywords": "Relationships,Viral/Trending", "theme-color": "#000000", "og": {"site_name": "Delish", "title": "This FL Couple Took Their Wedding Photos At Target", "description": "The pics will make your heart melt.", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/2048x1024/landscape-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "url": "https://www.delish.com/food/a58666/couple-wedding-photos-target/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 184150621627178, "pages": 41937927436}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/delish", "section": "Food Trends", "modified_time": "2020-09-16T03:10:50Z", "published_time": "2018-03-09T19:46:55Z"}, "twitter": {"site": "@DelishDotCom", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/2048x1024/landscape-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg?resize=640:*", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "6Eu1_apH238CLAgXc5HY1w4El9wSbaIK-bBOqqNNSnU", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/1280x1280/square-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/1280x1280/square-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg?resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/18/10/1280x1280/square-1520549518-michandl0048-preview.jpeg", "auto-publish": "evergreen", "sailthru.excerpt": "We know you love Target.
