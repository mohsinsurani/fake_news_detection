Fox confirmed on Monday that the network picked up a new season of \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d \u2014 the previously canceled ABC comedy starring Tim Allen \u2014 after being \u201cemboldened\u201d by the response to the reboot of \u201cRoseanne\u201d this spring.

Choose your plan ArrowRight Both shows feature 1990s sitcom stars playing lead characters with conservative views who clash with their liberal family members.\n\nWhile executives clarified that they were interested in \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d (produced by its own studio, Twentieth Century Fox Television) long before \u201cRoseanne\u201d debuted in March with a jaw-dropping 18 million viewers, seeing those numbers helped.\n\n\u201cObviously, I think everyone took a good hard look at the performance of \u2018Roseanne.\u2019 It did so well, and it certainly did remind us that we have a huge iconic comedy star in our Fox family in Tim Allen,\u201d said Dana Walden, chairman and chief executive officer for Fox Television Group, on a conference call to announce the network\u2019s new fall 2018 schedule. \u201c[\u2018Last Man Standing\u2019] is a really funny show.\u201d\n\nShe added that Fox considered picking up the comedy when ABC canceled it last year but couldn\u2019t find the right place on its schedule. Plus, she said, \u201cABC didn\u2019t really prioritize\u201d the series, and it still earned about 8 million viewers every week, so Fox execs are curious to see what happens when they put marketing muscle behind it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere was an outcry from fans after \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d was canceled in 2017, and many blamed the fact that Allen is a conservative-leaning actor who attended President Trump\u2019s inauguration. Allen, who compared being a non-liberal in Hollywood these days to \u201c1930s Germany,\u201d also hinted that his character\u2019s beliefs (Allen plays Mike Baxter, who hates Obama and political correctness) caused ABC to ax the show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not sure that I think that the cancellation had anything to do with politics,\u201d said Gary Newman, chairman and chief executive officer for Fox Television Group; he theorized that ABC was more interested in shows produced by its own studio. \u201cTim\u2019s personal politics aren\u2019t a big feature on the show. I think if you were to talk to Tim and our showrunners, they would say Mike Baxter is a centrist. \u2026 He doesn\u2019t have extreme views, and the show never delved deeply into political views.\u201d\n\nAnother topic on the call: The cancellation of \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine,\u201d which sparked intense reaction from fans on social media. (NBC picked up the show about 24 hours after Fox canceled it.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWalden said they loved the series and cast, yet \u201cultimately, we felt like we didn\u2019t have the exact right place to schedule it this year.\u201d (Fox\u2019s schedule has shifted this fall with the addition of Thursday Night Football.) Walden said \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d performed best on Sunday nights after \u201cThe Simpsons,\u201d but the network planned to hand that slot to the popular cartoon \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe wanted to give \u2018Bob\u2019s Burgers,\u2019 the Emmy-winning huge performer for us, the opportunity to have a plum time period,\u201d she said. \u201cSo once we made that decision, it just really limited the opportunities to schedule \u2018Brooklyn.\u2019 \u201d\n\nFox\u2019s new fall series are \u201cThe Cool Kids,\u201d a retirement community sitcom executive produced by \u201cIt\u2019s Always Sunny in Philadelphia\u201d star Charlie Day, and \u201cRel,\u201d based on the life of Lil Rel Howery, who starred in \u201cGet Out\u201d and \u201cThe Carmichael Show.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFALL 2018 PRIME-TIME LINEUP ON FOX\n\nNew shows are in bold.\n\nMONDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cThe Resident\u201d *\n\n9 p.m. \u201c9-1-1\u201d *\n\nTUESDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cThe Gifted\u201d *\n\n9 p.m. \u201cLethal Weapon\u201d *\n\nWEDNESDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cEmpire\u201d\n\n9 p.m. \u201cStar\u201d\n\nTHURSDAY\n\n8 p.m. NFL Football\n\nFRIDAY\n\n8 p.m. \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d\n\n8:30 p.m. \u201cThe Cool Kids\u201d\n\n9 p.m. \u201cHell\u2019s Kitchen\u201d *\n\nSUNDAY\n\n7 p.m. \u201cNFL on Fox\u201d\n\n7:30 p.m. \u201cThe OT\u201d\n\n8 p.m. \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d\n\n8:30 p.m. \u201cBob\u2019s Burgers\u201d *\n\n9 p.m. \u201cFamily Guy\u201d\n\n9:30 p.m. \u201cRel\u201d\n\n* Moved to a new time slot\n\nRead more:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2014/11/137538_5702_pre.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2014/11/137538_5702_pre.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/05/14/fox-picked-up-last-man-standing-after-being-emboldened-by-response-to-roseanne/", "title": "Fox picked up \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 after being \u2019emboldened\u2019 by response to \u2018Roseanne\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "Tim Allen's conservative-leaning politics were widely blamed as the reason \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d was axed from ABC last year.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/05/14/fox-picked-up-last-man-standing-after-being-emboldened-by-response-to-roseanne/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2014/11/137538_5702_pre.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Fox picked up \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 after being \u2019emboldened\u2019 by response to \u2018Roseanne\u2019", "description": "Tim Allen's conservative-leaning politics were widely blamed as the reason \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d was axed from ABC last year."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Fox picked up \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 after being \u2019emboldened\u2019 by response to \u2018Roseanne\u2019", "description": "Tim Allen's conservative-leaning politics were widely blamed as the reason \u201cLast Man Standing\u201d was axed from ABC last year."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-12-03T04:04:14.563Z", "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-14T14:40:17.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-12-03T04:04:14.563Z", "section": "Arts & Entertainment", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 70, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/05/14/fox-picked-up-last-man-standing-after-being-emboldened-by-response-to-roseanne/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526252400.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
