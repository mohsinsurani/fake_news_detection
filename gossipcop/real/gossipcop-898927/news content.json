They would later make their red carpet debut in August at the MTV Video Music Awards in L.A.\n\n\u201cI think we just kind of fell into this groove really enjoying life with each other for a while, so its kind of fun and it\u2019s kind of serious in a way as well,\u201d Portwood told Us of the lighting technician in August. \u201cBut we\u2019re trying not to put too much pressure on a relationship.\u201d\n\nGlennon has been very supportive during Portwood\u2019s pregnancy so far. \u201cAndrew is very adamant on making sure that I\u2019m eating nothing but fruits, veggies, meats and organic foods,\u201d she told Us last month, also admitting that she was \u201cnervous\u201d about revealing the baby news at first. \u201cObviously it\u2019s non-traditional. Usually parents want you to be married first and things like that. But you know me, if I didn\u2019t do things the way I did, I wouldn\u2019t be me.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/840019966_amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1837px%2C964px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/840019966_amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1837px%2C964px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-amber-portwood-reveals-gender-of-her-second-child/", "title": "Pregnant Amber Portwood Reveals Gender of Her Second Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Pregnant Amber Portwood revealed the gender of her second child on Friday, December 8 \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pregnant Amber Portwood Reveals Gender of Her Second Child", "description": "Pregnant Amber Portwood revealed the gender of her second child on Friday, December 8 \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-amber-portwood-reveals-gender-of-her-second-child/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/840019966_amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1837px%2C964px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/840019966_amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1837px%2C964px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-08T13:38:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:45+00:00"}, "author": "Stephanie Webber", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pregnant Amber Portwood Reveals Gender of Her Second Child", "description": "Pregnant Amber Portwood revealed the gender of her second child on Friday, December 8 \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/840019966_amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1837px%2C964px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512740301.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
