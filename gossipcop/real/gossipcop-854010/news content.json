News. \u201cWhen you\u2019re thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.\u201d\n\nThe pair, who\u2019d planned on an October wedding, broke up while filming Marriage Boot Camp earlier this summer following three years together. They hit a rough patch last August when reports surface that Baier was facing legal trouble for failing to paying child support to multiple other women for several secret biological kids. While Baier and Portwood don\u2019t share any children, she\u2019s mom to 7-year-old Leah with ex Gary Shirley.\n\n\u201cWhat I\u2019ve learned from this is you have to do the work,\u201d Baier added to E! \u201cYou have to make the person you\u2019re with feel loved every single day. I forgot to do that and now I\u2019m paying the price.\u201d\n\nFollowing the breakup, the father of six headed to Las Vegas, where he\u2019s regretfully turned to a life of gambling. \u201cI\u2019ve been making a living through my winnings,\u201d he explained. \u201cThat said, I\u2019m not really enjoying it. This isn\u2019t the life I want to live.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: The Moment Teen Mom OG\u2018s Amber Portwood Was Forced to Pause Her Wedding\n\nBaier would rather make up with Portwood, who was spotted kissing a mystery man last week and shared a photo Thursday to Instagram of a man looking into the camera and holding a broken rose.\n\n\u201cIf I got a do-over I would do everything differently,\u201d Baier said. \u201cI should have listened to her more. I\u2019ll hold out hope for a reconciliation. But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends. We started off as best friends and that\u2019s what I miss the most from her \u2014 her friendship. To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family.\u201d\n\nHe\u2019d even hoped the MTV star would join him in Sin City. \u201cUltimately, my hope was to get a place where Amber could come visit me and we could work on our issues,\u201d he admitted to E! \u201cObviously, that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d", "images":
