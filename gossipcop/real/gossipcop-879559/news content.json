I started working harder and harder than everyone else. And it started paying off ,\u201d says Lopez on the value of ceaseless hustle and self-belief in paving her own success path. It\u2019s that same attitude that comes to life in Lopez\u2019s new film, \u201cSecond Act\u201d where her character Maya, sidelined by unfulfilled career dreams, learns to unleash her inner confidence to realize her biggest aspirations.\n\nWith a heroine who hits her career stride in her forties and proves that attitude, versus social status or education, determines your possibility, the film represents more than a storyline; it\u2019s part of critical cultural conversation around embracing reinvention, banishing self-doubt, and the power of believing in limitless potential.\n\nWith the mission to spotlight how women spanning the success spectrum have overcome barriers to embrace their own second acts, Jennifer Lopez joined a discussion of dynamic female leaders including Hollywood producer and the film\u2019s writer Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas, Thrive Global CEO Arianna Huffington and Dr. Stacy Smith, Founder and Director of the Annenberg Inclusion Initiative. Hosted and moderated by Full Picture CEO Desiree Gruber, the conversation offered a candid exchange on pushing past career hurdles, from the pervasive glass ceiling still faced by women today to unlocking the \u201cstraightjackets in our minds.\u201d\n\n\u201cPart of what\u2019s happened in this [women\u2019s] movement right now is that some of it is platitudes like \u2018Try harder. Tomorrow\u2019s another day. Be your best self. Reach for the stars!\u2019 And it\u2019s like, how? What do I need to do today? What can I do today?\u201d says Gruber on the importance of offering women actionable insights and tangible solutions to empower them to take their next step forward. \u201cAs women and as industry leaders, we can and should mentor as many people and help as many people as we can to reinvent,\u201d says Goldsmith-Thomas, a sentiment which exemplifies the spirit of Gruber\u2019s conversation and the powerful perspectives shared on learning to be limitless.\n\nBanish Impost0r Syndrome:\n\n\u201cMore than anything, I started believing in myself. I started believing in the fact that I wasn\u2019t an impostor. That I wasn\u2019t a fake. That there was a reason I was doing this and people kept hiring me. It took time and it took me to believe in myself.\u201d \u2013 Jennifer Lopez\n\nTurn Setbacks Into Successes:\n\n\u201cFor me, the question of how we deal with failure is everything. My mom used to say to my sister and me, \u2018Failure is not the opposite of success. It\u2019s a stepping stone to success. There is absolutely nobody who has not failed.\u201d \u2013 Arianna Huffington\n\nTune Out the Critics:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t let the opinions of others really influence how I think about myself. And that took a long time. Everybody was like \u2018She can\u2019t sing. She can\u2019t dance. She can\u2019t act. She is just a pretty face\u2019. Or \u2018her butt is big\u2019. Or whatever they were saying about me. And I started thinking, \u2018yeah that\u2019s true\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cDespite the hurt and the pain, I just kept going and I just couldn\u2019t allow myself to let that become who I was. The most important thing is not listening to all the outside voices, but making sure that the voice that I\u2019m speaking to myself \u2013 that roommate \u2013 is a kind roommate.\u201d \u2013 Jennifer Lopez\n\nCome Back Stronger:\n\n\u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody out there who hasn\u2019t fallen, who hasn\u2019t said, \u2018God, I wish I didn\u2019t do that.\u2019 All we can do is let it inform a better path for us and be stronger because of it.\u201d \u2013 Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas\n\nCompete With Yourself:\n\n\u201cThis is my path. This is my race. Yes, I\u2019m competitive, but I\u2019m competitive with myself. How much further can I go? How much more can I do? How much better can I be?\u201d \u2013 Jennifer Lopez\n\nWrite Your Own Story:\n\n\u201cWe are the architects of our own lives. We have to be responsible. We have one life. We have one narrative and it is ours to write. Get up and do it.\u201d \u2013 Elaine Goldsmith-Thomas\n\nJust Jump:\n\n\u201cWomen can be limitless, we can rise above it. That doesn\u2019t mean that we\u2019re not going through pain, or through challenges, or through difficulties. That\u2019s what is so powerful.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think there are limitless acts. The fact that you can achieve everything without having to lose your health and your relationships and what matters to you. It\u2019s hard, but close your eyes, take a deep breath, and jump. And it\u2019s sometimes what we all need to do because it doesn\u2019t make sense always.\u201d \u2013 Arianna Huffington\n\n\"Second Act\" is in theaters now.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20181221182733im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmoiraforbes%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F12%2FIMG_0899a-1200x887.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221182733im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7c06f39493c31e3f1dda4a5d4849fb1a?s=400&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221182733im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmoiraforbes%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F12%2FIMG_0899a-1200x887.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Moira Forbes"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221182733/https://www.forbes.com/sites/moiraforbes/2018/12/21/jennifer-lopez-on-battling-self-doubt-and-achieving-her-own-second-act/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez On Battling Self-Doubt And Achieving Her Own Second Act", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,minimum-scale=1,maximum-scale=2,user-scalable=yes", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Jennifer Lopez On Battling Self-Doubt And Achieving Her Own Second Act", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221182733im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmoiraforbes%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F12%2FIMG_0899a-1200x887.jpg", "updated_time": "2018-12-21T12:20:20-05:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221182733/https://www.forbes.com/sites/moiraforbes/2018/12/21/jennifer-lopez-on-battling-self-doubt-and-achieving-her-own-second-act/", "description": "Jennifer Lopez is a testament to the fact that achieving the entertainment industry\u2019s biggest breaks requires creating your own opportunities, not waiting for them.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jennifer Lopez On Battling Self-Doubt And Achieving Her Own Second Act", "description": "Jennifer Lopez is a testament to the fact that achieving the entertainment industry\u2019s biggest breaks requires creating your own opportunities, not waiting for them.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20181221182733im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fmoiraforbes%2Ffiles%2F2018%2F12%2FIMG_0899a-1200x887.jpg", "creator": "@moiraforbes"}, "description": "Jennifer Lopez is a testament to the fact that achieving the entertainment industry\u2019s biggest breaks requires creating your own opportunities, not waiting for them.", "author": "Moira Forbes", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Moira Forbes", "section": "Leadership", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/forbeswoman//", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/1017-5316", "published": "2018-12-21", "modified": "2018-12-21"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545350400.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
