Throughout that time period, the We the Best CEO has nurtured relationships with some of the most talented artists in the industry. Most don\u2019t have any issue offering up their talents for a potential banger meticulously constructed by Khaled.\n\nExplore Explore DJ Khaled See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news\n\nWith back-to-back albums topping the Billboard 200, the Miami native looks to make it three in a row with the anticipated Father of Asahd. On Monday (July 24), Khaled kicked off the rollout process into his eleventh studio album by announcing the project\u2019s lead single \u201cNo Brainer\u201d due out Friday (July 27).\n\nAfter 2017\u2019s \u201cI\u2019m the One\u201d debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, DJ Khaled has decided to go back to the well one more time with the same collaborators (sans Lil Wayne), with Quavo, Chance The Rapper, and Justin Bieber all re-enlisted to help execute the global smash formula.\n\nKhaled has connected with a range of hitmaking artists over the years, including Rihanna, Nas, Drake, Demi Lovato and many other. Below, Billboard lists ten of the king of Snapchat\u2019s most frequent star collaborators throughout his decorated career.\n\nFuture\n\nNumber of Appearances: 15\n\nSongs: \u201cI Can\u2019t Lie,\u201d \u201cDo You Mind,\u201d \u201cI Got the Keys,\u201d \u201cTop Off,\u201d \u201cI Don\u2019t Play About My Paper,\u201d \u201cIce Out My Arms,\u201d \u201cI Wanna Be With You,\u201d \u201cFuck Up the Club,\u201d \u201cIma Be Alright,\u201d \u201cThat Range Rover Came With Steps,\u201d \u201cWhatever,\u201d \u201cHold You Down,\u201d \u201cDown For Life,\u201d \u201cYou Mine,\u201d \u201cBitches & Bottles\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s one thing to take away from this list, it\u2019s when Khaled gives the Freebandz CEO a call, he picks up the phone. Future is a lock to make multiple cameos in the studio whenever the 42-year-old is in album mode. The trap pioneer has made a career of crafting high-quality music at a blistering rate throughout the decade. \u201cI Got the Keys\u201d pitted the Atlanta native against JAY-Z, but their contrasting flows made for an enthralling joint effort, as Future held his own.\n\nRick Ross\n\nNumber of Appearances: 15\n\nSongs: \u201cDo You Mind,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m On One,\u201d \u201cNo New Friends,\u201d \u201cAll I Do Is Win,\u201d \u201cWe Takin\u2019 Over,\u201d \u201cTake It to the Head,\u201d \u201cFuck Up the Club,\u201d \u201cDown For Life,\u201d \u201cBrown Paper Bag,\u201d \u201cWhatever,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m So Hood,\u201d \u201cWelcome to My Hood (Remix),\u201d \u201cOn Everything,\u201d \u201cPull a Caper,\u201d \u201cHolla at Me\u201d\n\nThe ongoing bromance between DJ Khaled and Rick Ross is real. The fellow Miami natives spend plenty of time together outside of music, as their houses are only a jet ski ride away. Rozay is a shoo-in to lay down a verse when Khaled is piecing together his next hit record. Ross appeared on 2007\u2019s \u201cWe Takin\u2019 Over\u201d smash to four different tracks on the inspirational figure\u2019s Grateful album a decade later.\n\nLil Wayne\n\nNumber of Appearances: 12\n\nSongs: \u201cWe Takin\u2019 Over,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m the One,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m On One,\u201d \u201cTake It to the Head,\u201d \u201cWelcome to My Hood,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m So Hood,\u201d \u201cNo New Friends,\u201d \u201cTourist,\u201d \u201cBrown Paper Bag,\u201d \u201cBitches & Bottles,\u201d \u201cHow Many Times,\u201d \u201cHolla at Me\u201d\n\nLil Wayne has become a staple in the 305 music scene. If you frequent the LIV nightclub on a Sunday, there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll see Weezy sipping in VIP. Khaled actually met the New Orleans legend in his hometown and continued to build their relationship whenever Wayne was in Miami. He\u2019s even hosted some of the rapper\u2019s early mixtapes. Weezy\u2019s appearance on \u201cHolla at Me\u201d alongside Paul Wall, Rick Ross, Fat Joe, and Pitbull powered the first single from Khaled\u2019s debut album in 2006.\n\nOver a decade later, and the pair are still crafting hits together, as Lil Wayne joined Chance The Rapper, Quavo, and Justin Bieber on \u201cI\u2019m The One\u201d which debuted at No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100 last May. Weezy may be wondering where his call was to hop on \u201cNo Brainer.\u201d\n\nMeek Mill\n\nNumber of Appearances: 9\n\nSongs: \u201cThey Don\u2019t Love You No More,\u201d \u201cNever Surrender,\u201d \u201cI Lied,\u201d \u201cI Did It for My Dawgz,\u201d \u201cMurcielago,\u201d \u201cFuture,\u201d \u201cShout out to the Real,\u201d \u201cI Feel Like Pac/I Feel Like Biggie,\u201d \u201cYou Don\u2019t Want These Problems\u201d\n\nAfter Meek Mill inked a deal under Rick Ross\u2019 MMG label in 2011, Khaled quickly got familiar with the Philly street rapper and the two have connected on plenty of tracks throughout the better part of the decade. Meek laid the opening verse on I Changed A Lot\u2018s debut single \u201cThey Don\u2019t Love You No More\u201d in 2014, where JAY-Z controversially challenged the toughness of lacrosse players. DJ Khaled has said that he kept in touch with Meek during his incarceration and hopefully, another collaboration is on the horizon.\n\nChris Brown\n\nNumber of Appearances: 7\n\nSongs: \u201cDo You Mind,\u201d \u201cHow Many Times,\u201d \u201cGold Slugs,\u201d \u201cHold You Down,\u201d \u201cTake It to the Head,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m Still,\u201d \u201cLegendary\u201d\n\nWhenever Khaled is searching for a certain melodic chorus, there\u2019s always one call he seems to make. Chris Brown has churned out dozens of tuneful guest hooks throughout his historic catalog. Breezy teamed up with Asahd\u2019s father on numerous occasions this decade, including the Gold-certified \u201cTake It to the Head\u201d in 2012 by forming the Fab 5 alongside superstar collaborators Nicki Minaj, Rick Ross, and Lil Wayne.\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nNumber of Appearances: 6\n\nSongs: \u201cDo You Mind,\u201d \u201cI Wanna Be With You,\u201d \u201cI Can\u2019t Lie,\u201d \u201cTake It to the Head,\u201d \u201cNobody,\u201d \u201cAll I Do Is Win (Remix)\u201d\n\nThe only female artist to grace the list is Nicki Minaj. As the First Lady of Young Money, Nicki was quickly introduced to Khaled through his developing rapport with her YM compatriots Lil Wayne and Drake. Back in 2013, Khaled oddly proposed to Minaj on MTV, which just ended up being a promotional stunt for his \u201cI Wanna Be With You\u201d single off his seventh studio album.\n\nDrake\n\nNumber of Appearances: 5\n\nSongs: \u201cFed Up,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m on One,\u201d \u201cNo New Friends,\u201d \u201cFor Free,\u201d \u201cTo the Max\u201d\n\nDrizzy and DJ Khaled\u2019s relationship spans back to when Drake appeared on \u201cFed Up\u201d back in 2009, when he was just a burgeoning MC. Since that point, the star pair have successfully connected on a plethora of hits, including summer bangers \u201cI\u2019m On One\u201d and the now-Platinum \u201cFor Free,\u201d which dominated urban radio stations throughout the country and steered Khaled\u2019s 2016 Major Key album. The pair most recently linked up to less FM fanfare with 2017\u2019s \u201cTo the Max.\u201d\n\nJAY-Z\n\nNumber of Appearances: 4\n\nSongs: \u201cI Got the Keys,\u201d \u201cShining,\u201d \u201cTop Off,\u201d \u201cThey Don\u2019t Love You No More\u201d\n\nGrowing up, Khaled had dreams of one day working with JAY-Z. The Miami-bred DJ caught Hov\u2019s eye to the point he even inked a management deal directly under Jay\u2019s guidance with Roc Nation in 2016. Since then, Khaled has been blessed to work with the Brooklyn-bred MC on three additional occasions. He\u2019s also slated to open for The Carters on the North American leg of their On The Run II Tour this summer.\n\nChance The Rapper\n\nNumber of Appearances: 3\n\nSongs: \u201cI Love You So Much,\u201d \u201cI\u2019m The One,\u201d \u201cNo Brainer\u201d\n\nThe 42-year-old has made a concerted effort to connect with the younger generation of stars in order to expand his diverse fan base. Chance The Rapper appeared on a pair of tracks from Khaled\u2019s Grateful album, including his worldwide anthem \u201cI\u2019m the One,\u201d which recently eclipsed the billion-view mark on YouTube.\n\nKanye West\n\nNumber of Appearances: 2\n\nSongs: \u201cI Wish You Would,\u201d \u201cGo Hard\u201d\n\nKanye West and T-Pain paired up for \u201cGood Life\u201d off West\u2019s Graduation and the track went on to take home Best Rap Song at the 2008 Grammy Awards. DJ Khaled teamed the Godfathers of auto-tune together once again later that year on The Runners-produced \u201cGo Hard.\u201d Yeezy would then return the favor in 2012 by enlisting Khaled on his Cruel Summer album for the harrowing \u201cCold.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/DJ-Khaled-2017-bet-experience-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=623&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/DJ-Khaled-2017-bet-experience-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/DJ-Khaled-2017-bet-experience-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Saponara"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rb-hip-hop/dj-khaled-collaborators-future-drake-lil-wayne-list-8466927/", "title": "From Future to Drake, Here\u2019s a Look Back at DJ Khaled\u2019s Most Frequent Star Collaborators", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "DJ Khaled has connected with a range of artists including Rihanna, Lil Wayne, Nas, Drake, Demi Lovato, and many others on a slew of hit records.
