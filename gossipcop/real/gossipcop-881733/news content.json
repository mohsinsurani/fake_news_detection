Watch my documentary and chill out. \u2014 Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) September 20, 2017\n\nThe singer then said, \u201cJust because (I) refuse to label myself for the sake of a headline doesn\u2019t mean I\u2019m not going to stand up for what I believe in,\u201d before adding, \u201cIf you\u2019re that curious about my sexuality, watch my documentary. But I don\u2019t owe anybody anything.\u201d\n\nJust because I'm refuse to label myself for the sake of a headline doesn't mean I'm not going to stand up for what I believe in. \u2014 Demi Lovato (@ddlovato) September 20, 2017\n\nIf you're that curious about my sexuality, watch my documentary.
