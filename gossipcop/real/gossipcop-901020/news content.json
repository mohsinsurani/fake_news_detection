This show has been a Disney attraction since a single animated figure of former president Abraham Lincoln was developed for the 1964-65 New York World\u2019s Fair.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5686865004001_5686857548001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2017/12/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636492282850247015-trump-hall1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2017/12/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636492282850247015-trump-hall1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Carly Mallenbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/12/18/animatronic-trump-disney-hall-presidents-twitter-reaction/963529001/", "title": "Animatronic Trump joins Disney's Hall of Presidents, and Twitter thinks he looks like Jon Voight", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/12/18/animatronic-trump-disney-hall-presidents-twitter-reaction/963529001/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Animatronic Trump joins Disney's Hall of Presidents, and Twitter thinks he looks like Jon Voight", "description": "There are plenty of comparisons to the Oscar winner, and plenty of other Twitter jokes.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/514922ee78c25e2bb90a92cf29ab3e31e5542750/c=0-153-3000-1848/local/-/media/2017/12/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636492282850247015-trump-hall1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "There are plenty of comparisons to the Oscar winner, and plenty of other Twitter jokes.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513555200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
