{"url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/review-diet-coke-new-flavors-2018-1", "text": "Diet Coke debuted four new flavors on Wednesday in an attempt to turn around the struggling beverage's sales.\n\nTwo of the flavors were disappointing as gimmicky stunts failing to live up to the original's excellence.\n\nHowever, the other two demonstrate a possible path toward salvation for Diet Coke.\n\nDiet Coke is undergoing some massive changes, including some surprising new flavors.\n\nOn Wednesday, Coca-Cola announced it is rolling out four new flavors: Ginger Lime, Feisty Cherry, Zesty Blood Orange, and Twisted Mango. The new flavors are accompanied by modernized Diet Coke packaging and a new ad campaign.\n\nFor the last few years, Diet Coke has been the weakest link in the company's cola lineup. In October, Coca-Cola reported the brand's sales by volume declined in the mid-single digits last quarter. Industry publication Beverage Digest reported Diet Coke US sales by the dollar dropped 1.9% in 2016.\n\nCoca-Cola said in a press release it spent two years developing the new flavors and bottles, testing more than 30 new Diet Coke flavors.\n\nWe had the chance to taste test the feisty flavors and see if Coca-Cola's two-year project was time well spent.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a57936525954cb8398b4a99?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a579365a75e2057398b4a6f?width=700", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a579365a75e20c5378b4aa5?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a57bbf925954c06148b4dbd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a579365a75e201d008b4e82?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a57936525954cad388b4a9a?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a57936525954cac038b4d41?width=600&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a57bbf925954c06148b4dbd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Taylor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/review-diet-coke-new-flavors-2018-1", "title": "Diet Coke has just rolled out 4 shocking new flavors \u2014 here's the verdict", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Diet Coke has just rolled out 4 shocking new flavors \u2014 here's the verdict", "datePublished": "2018-01-11T19:48:00Z", "dateModified": "2018-01-12T17:25:41Z", "news_keywords": "Features, Hollis Johnson, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Retail, Kate Taylor", "description": "Diet Coke is making some massive changes, including some surprising new flavors.\u00a0Here is how they measure up.", "author": "Kate Taylor", "article": {"publisher": "businessinsider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Retail", "og": {"title": "Diet Coke has just rolled out 4 shocking new flavors \u2014 here's the verdict", "description": "Diet Coke is making some massive changes, including some surprising new flavors.\u00a0Here is how they measure up.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/review-diet-coke-new-flavors-2018-1", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5a57bbf925954c06148b4dbd?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Business Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Diet Coke has just rolled out 4 shocking new flavors \u2014 here's the verdict", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-11", "sailthru.tags": "Features, Hollis Johnson, Coca-Cola, Diet Coke, Retail, Kate Taylor", "sailthru.description": "Diet Coke is making some massive changes, including some surprising new flavors.\u00a0Here is how they measure up.", "sailthru.author": "Kate Taylor", "sailthru.verticals": "retail", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5a57bbeca75e201f008b5021?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5a57bbeca75e201f008b5021?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@BI_RetailNews"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"bii-imgalt": "Diet Coke"}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 20446254070}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.businessinsider.com/review-diet-coke-new-flavors-2018-1?fbia"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=554260576", "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"newsletter-email-input": "control"}, "ii-split-test": {"bii-media-show-lock": "control", "ii-finance-email-lock": "control", "ii-retail-show-lock": "control"}, "viking-id": "5a57938625954c91028b4d7a", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/BI/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2021-08", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Business Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515628800.0, "source": "https://www.businessinsider.com", "summary": ""}
