Celebrities truly hit fashion high notes at the 2017 MTV VMAs, held at The Forum in Inglewood, California, on Sunday, August 27. Among the most dazzling: host Katy Perry, Yara Shahidi and Lorde. Watch the video above to see who else topped Stylish\u2019s best dressed list.\n\nThe 32-year-old \u201cSwish, Swish\u201d singer looked white hot in a one-shoulder caped maxigown by Stephane Rolland. She accessorized with large circle drop earrings by Hueb. Perry wore her bleach blonde hair in a short, cropped \u2018do. The CoverGirl spokesmodel had on purple eyeshadow and nude lipstick.\n\nAnother stunner at the star-studded event: Shahidi. The Black-ish actress, 17, was radiant in a gold, draped Zimmermann frock. The belted dress, which was giving Us serious Grecian goddess vibes, had a large bow on one shoulder. Shahidi also donned strappy gold heels by Giuseppe Zanotti and gold tassel earrings. She wore minimal, natural-looking makeup and styled her hair in a low ponytail.\n\nLorde, 20, looked like a fairy princess in a lavender Monique Lhuillier number. The strapless maxigown had an A-line skirt that was embellished with feathers. The \u201cGreen Light\u201d singer wore pink eyeshadow and lipstick and styled her wavy lob in a half-updo.\n\nWatch the video above to see these stars\u2019 looks and find out who else Stylish deemed the best dressed at the 2017 VMAs!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/katy-perry-best-dressed-vmas-promo-5df42185-07a4-4a9e-abfa-ec8650513784.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/katy-perry-best-dressed-vmas-promo-5df42185-07a4-4a9e-abfa-ec8650513784.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Talia Ergas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/vmas-2017-katy-perry-lorde-and-more-best-dressed-stars-w499811/", "title": "VMAs 2017: Katy Perry, Lorde and More Best Dressed Stars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Celebrity Fashion,Celebrity Style,vmas", "post-cats": "Stylish", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Katy Perry, Lorde, Yara Shahidi and more stars stunned at the 2017 MTV VMAs \u2014 see who else topped the best dressed list", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "VMAs 2017: See Who Topped the Best Dressed List", "description": "Katy Perry, Lorde, Yara Shahidi and more stars stunned at the 2017 MTV VMAs \u2014 see who else topped the best dressed list", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/vmas-2017-katy-perry-lorde-and-more-best-dressed-stars-w499811/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:15:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/katy-perry-best-dressed-vmas-promo-5df42185-07a4-4a9e-abfa-ec8650513784.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/katy-perry-best-dressed-vmas-promo-5df42185-07a4-4a9e-abfa-ec8650513784.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-08-28T02:24:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:15:30+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "VMAs 2017: See Who Topped the Best Dressed List", "description": "Katy Perry, Lorde, Yara Shahidi and more stars stunned at the 2017 MTV VMAs \u2014 see who else topped the best dressed list", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/katy-perry-best-dressed-vmas-promo-5df42185-07a4-4a9e-abfa-ec8650513784.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503887088.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
