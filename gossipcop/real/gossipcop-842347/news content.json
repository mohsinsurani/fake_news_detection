Ray Pillar of Character Award on Saturday, the That '70s Show actor spoke at length about what it means to be a role model and to demonstrate good character, first speaking about his twin brother before pivoting to his wife and two kids, 2-year-old Wyatt and 4-month-old Dimitri.\n\n\"It's not whether you win or lose, it's how you learn from the mistakes that you make and how you perceive the world that's coming at you,\" he said. \"Because life doesn't happen to you, it happens for you. Every single time. And as long as you have love and kindness and optimism and a pursuit of something greater in your heart, you're the lucky one. So this award is for you. It is for my family, it's for all four of my parents, it's for my wife, who kicks my ass on character every day.\"\n\n\"I'm telling you, this morning, I woke up and she kicked my ass on character,\" he continued. \"I thought I was awesome because I got up early and helped with the kids before she woke up and I let her sleep a little bit and then she's like, 'Well, now you're gonna act tired? I do it every day.' But it was a character moment, right? Because she's right!\"\n\nAshton went on to say that raising his children with Mila has also been the \"greatest lesson in character\" of his life, emphasizing what an \"amazing honor\" its been to be a parent.\n\n\"When I had these kids, my wife and I had these kids and we got to share that amazing, amazing, amazing honor, my first response was, I wanted to call my parents and say, 'I'm sorry, because I never knew how much you loved me,'\" he said.\n\nYou can watch the entirety of Ashton's speech below \u2014 but be warned: You might want to have a box of tissues handy.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube.
