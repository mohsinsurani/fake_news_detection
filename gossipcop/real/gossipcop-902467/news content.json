The emails included one that used a vulgar term for female genitalia to refer to past Miss America winners, one that wished that a particular former Miss America had died and others that speculated about how many sex partners former Miss America Mallory Hagan has had.\n\nThe ensuing uproar led to the group\u2019s executive director, Sam Haskell; its president, Josh Randle; board chairwoman Lynn Weidner, and one other board member to resign.\n\nDan Meyers, the group\u2019s interim board chairman, said the group wants former Miss Americas and state directors to recommend members for a search committee that would determine the organization\u2019s leadership structure, and choose individuals to fill those roles.\n\n\u201cThe board wanted to have a process that was unprecedented in terms of openness, transparency and inclusion,\u201d he said. \u201cGiven the turbulent nature of leadership transitions, asking all the stakeholders to be a part of this process was the best way.\u201d\n\nSome past winners reacted negatively to the board\u2019s statement, saying the board had not reached out to them about help in selecting new leaders. Others said they wanted no involvement whatsoever by any current board members in seeking new leadership.\n\n\u201cAt this time all remaining members must step aside so we can take our beloved program back,\u201d Miss America 1977 Dorothy Benham told the AP. \u201cThey have underestimated the strength, intelligence, and determination of the women who have worn the Miss America crown, as well as every young woman who is currently wearing, or has worn the local and state crown. We stand united.\u201d\n\nJennifer Vaden Barth, a former Miss North Carolina, said the former winners want a completely new board to search for leaders, not one that supported Haskell.\n\n\u201cThe board needs to accept responsibility for the damage they have caused,\u201d she told the AP late Wednesday. \u201cThey need to step aside quickly and allow new leadership to save the Miss America program.\u201d\n\nUnder the plan, former Miss Americas and state directors collectively would name four people to the search committee, and the board would name a former state title holder to the panel. These five individuals and two board members \u201cwill begin their exhaustive search in a matter of days,\u201d a statement from the board read.\n\nThere are currently two vacancies on the 14-member board, and there will be at least two more when the resignations of Randle and Weidner become effective in a matter of weeks.\n\nThe organization hopes to have the nominations in hand by Jan. 3. The board said it was notifying groups of its decision to seek their help late Wednesday night.\n\nThe emails already cost the pageant its television production partner and raised questions about the future of the nationally televised broadcast from Atlantic City\u2019s Boardwalk Hall the week after Labor Day each year. Dick Clark Productions told the AP last Thursday that it cut ties with the Miss America Organization over the emails, calling them \u201cappalling.\u201d\n\nMeyers said the group has spoken with ABC, the television network scheduled to broadcast the September 2018 pageant, as well as with pageant sponsors. None has ended its relationship with the Miss America Organization, he said. Independent messages sent by the AP over the past two days seeking comment from ABC and pageant sponsors have gone unanswered.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/newspress-collage-6453052-1665215604829.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&1665201786&w=322&h=213&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/hagan1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/EP.-6-wp-thumb_NEW-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/missamerica.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=389", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/chloe-grace-moretz-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/pitbull-mauling-317.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/hagan1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/monopoly.png?w=260", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ron-DeSantis-Ana-Navarro.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/haskell.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=661"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/hagan1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/12/28/ex-miss-americas-asked-to-help-recruit-new-leaders-after-email-uproar/", "title": "Ex-Miss Americas asked to help recruit new leaders after dirty email scandal", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
