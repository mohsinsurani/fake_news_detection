It starred Raven-Symon\u00e9, Kiely Williams, Sabrina Bryan, and Adrienne Bailon.\n\nOf course, one of those stars has a special connection to Kim. Bailon, 34, famously dated Kim\u2019s brother Rob Kardashian for two years before splitting in 2009.\n\nTheo Wargo/WireImage\n\nMichael Buckner/Getty\n\nShe\u2019s remained on good terms with the Kardashians since (Rob\u2019s sister Kourtney Kardashian was even Bailon\u2019s \u201cbreakup buddy\u201d). So Kim had no problem tagging Bailon on Instagram, and teasing her Monday night.\n\n\u201cNorth\u2019s new obsession! #CheetahGirls,\u201d Kim wrote on her Instagram story of the movie. \u201cShould I break the news to North that this could have been her auntie?!?!?!\u201d\n\nThe message left Bailon in stitches.\n\n\u201cJust woke up to this! LOL,\u201d she wrote in a post shared to her own Instagram story, commenting on the videos Kim posted. \u201cThis hairstyle and this outfit. HYSTERICAL.\u201d\n\n\u201cCHEETAHLICIOUS,\u201d she added, quoting one of the movie\u2019s iconic taglines.\n\nThe Cheetah Girls spawned two film sequels, one in 2006 and another in 2008. All based on the book series of the same name by Deborah Gregory, the titles inspired a slew of merchandise. Several hit soundtracks also sent the stars on a three nationwide tours.\n\nOn one of those tours, the actresses made a homemade horror movie called Meow. The three-part flick features cameos from both Kim and Rob.\n\n\u201cYou have to watch,\u201d Kim tweeted on Monday night, continuing her Cheetah Girls throwback.\n\n\u201cLOL,\u201d Bailon responded, with adding crying laughing emoji.\n\nThough Bailon\u2019s relationship with Rob never lasted, she did carry a piece of her ex everywhere she went\u2026. literally.\n\nBailon had his name tattooed on her posterior. And she didn\u2019t just get his first name \u2014 she got his first, last and middle initial. She eventually got the tattoo removed, and in 2013 told her co-hosts on The Real that the ink wasn\u2019t something she was proud of: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I was thinking.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Adrienne Bailon Reveals the Details of Her Extravagant Paris Wedding\n\nIn 2016, Bailon married gospel singer Israel Houghton in Paris.\n\n\u201cI genuinely just feel so blessed and grateful. I\u2019ve honestly never been happier in my entire life,\u201d Bailon told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cI\u2019ve never felt what I feel right now. I can\u2019t even describe what it is, but it\u2019s such a peace mixed with total excitement.\u201d\n\nRob was last in a relationship with ex-fianc\u00e9e Blac Chyna. The two share daughter Dream Kardashian.", "images":
