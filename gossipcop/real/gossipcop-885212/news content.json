By \"cigarette breath,\" she means Brielle\u2019s mother, Kim Zolciak.\n\n\"They came [into] my house wit ROACH gate, I\u2019m on drugs etc.\"\n\nNeNe has accused Kim of racism, for which Kim has said that she received death threats. That\u2019s scary and serious.\n\nNeNe\u2019s rant continues:\n\n\"I tried my best 2 befriend them but This is why U can never WIN when U play DIRTY.\"\n\nPhoto via instagram\n\nKim Zolciak hit back at NeNe with a series of tweets, writing:\n\n\"This is exactly why I said this b\u2013ch has to be on something.\"\n\nAllegations of drug use aren\u2019t really funny, but it seems that Kim believes that NeNe may be genuinely unstable.\n\n\"She\u2019s insane! Nobody wanted to be befriended by a b\u2013ch who consistently shows their ass.\"\n\nRemember, folks, that very few people become Real Housewives if they\u2019re open to easily and quietly resolving interpersonal conflicts. They\u2019re supposed to be entertaining, not nice.\n\nKim insists taht she knows who NeNe is and what she\u2019s really like.\n\n\"WE know who you are. The REAL you! Nobody values your friendship. Haven\u2019t for years! You have victims not friends.\"\n\nKim goes on to shoot down NeNe\u2019s accusations.\n\n\"\u2019Cigarette breathe?\u2019 I haven\u2019t smoked a cigarette in years.\"\n\nSmoking is gross, but it\u2019s a powerfully addictive habit and, until very recently, there were widespread social pressures for people to pick up the habit when they were very young.\n\nEven now, there are still pressures to smoke within certain pockets of society, such as in intensely rural areas and in industries such as modeling.\n\nGood for Kim Zolciak for ridding herself of that addiction.\n\nKim goes on to double down on the presence, which was recorded on video, of roaches in NeNe\u2019s house.\n\n\"The bug was in your house just a few months ago. FACT What else?\"\n\nAs you may recall, when NeNe slammed Brielle Biermann as a Kylie Jenner wannabe, she also accused her of planting the bugs.\n\nSpecifically, she said that they must have emerged from Brielle\u2019s genitals, though she did not phrase it that way.\n\nPhoto via Bravo\n\nKim continued her retort to NeNe\u2019s angry post.\n\n\"I pray to god I\u2019m not this miserable and bored at 50 Imagine being so sad and stupid that the only time anyone\u2019s mentioning you is if you\u2019re mentioning someone you \u2018have no time for.\u2019\"\n\nNotice Kim\u2019s dig about NeNe Leakes being older. That\u2019s come up already during this feud.\n\nKim Zolciak, though a mother of six children, is only 39 years old.\n\n\"Off to film my OWN show!\" Kim concludes.\n\nShe then sends her best wishes to her fans.\n\n\"Have a great day you guys! Stay blessed not stressed/pressed.\"\n\nPhoto via instagram\n\nAt the beginning, Kenya Moore was involved in the feud, but fans assume that she was only so outspoken because she was trying to save her job at the time.\n\nNow that Marc Daly has made his RHOA debut, she doesn\u2019t need to fight with everyone in sight in order to have a storyline.\n\nBut NeNe Leakes \u2026 is still who she\u2019s always been. And the same goes for Kim Zolciak.\n\nTheir explosive feud doesn\u2019t show any sign of dying down in the near future.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/kim-zolciak-with-low-cut-top-657x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20858'%3E%3Crect%20width='1024'%20height='858'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/kelly-clarkson-as-voice-coach-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20657%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='657'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/10/nene-leakes-kim-zolciak-split.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/hailee-steinfeld-reps-niall-horan-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/10/nene-leakes-kim-zolciak-split-720x540.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='540'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/nene-leakes-selfie-725x1024.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20725%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='725'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/03/kim-zolciak-winks.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20715%20707'%3E%3Crect%20width='715'%20height='707'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/11/brielle-biermann-a-selfie.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20500'%3E%3Crect%20width='500'%20height='500'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/nene-leakes-on-the-real-housewives-of-atlanta-season-10-1024x858.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20809%20952'%3E%3Crect%20width='809'%20height='952'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/10/nene-leakes-kim-zolciak-split.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/03/kim-zolciak-and-nene-leakes-feud-explodes-on-twitter/", "title": "Kim Zolciak vs. NeNe Leakes: #RoachGate Feud EXPLODES on Twitter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Zolciak vs. NeNe Leakes: #RoachGate Feud EXPLODES on Twitter", "description": "So, remember how that whole feud of Brielle Biermann and Kim Zolciak versus Kenya Moore started when Brielle pointed out on social media that she'd found roaches in NeNe Leakes' home?
