I have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\n\n\n\n\u201cI would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u201d\n\n\n\nPlanning for the wedding is entering its final day. Markle and the prince arrived in Windsor hours after a full dress rehearsal, watched by thousands who lined the route of the planned carriage procession around the town.\n\nMarkle is said to be distressed that her father, a retired award-winning TV lighting director who lives in Mexico, has found himself under intense pressure from the media. The impact on him personally is said to be her main concern, rather than the impact of his absence at the meticulously planned event.\n\n\n\nBoth she and the prince, who has yet to meet his future father-in-law, are understood to have been in contact with him in recent days.\n\n\n\nKensington Palace has faced criticism over perceptions it has not sufficiently protected both parents from media intrusion. Markle\u2019s estranged half-sister, Samantha Markle, 53, has claimed their father has been terrorised by paparazzi.\n\n\n\nSources said extensive private security and media advice had been given to the parents from the moment Markle\u2019s relationship with Harry became public. Markle\u2019s comment that she has always \u201ccared\u201d for her father may be interpreted by some as alluding to this private support the couple are said to have been giving him.\n\n\n\nThe developments began on Sunday when her father was accused of staging paparazzi photographs of himself. Having never previously spoken publicly about his daughter\u2019s marriage, he then began communicating through the American celebrity website TMZ.\n\nIt first reported he had decided to pull out due to his embarrassment over the photographs. He then changed his mind, apparently after Markle managed to contact him by text. But he was reportedly suffering chest pains following a heart attack last week. On Wednesday he reportedly underwent surgery at a hospital in Mexico.\n\n\n\nTMZ later said he was \u201calert and coherent\u201d after doctors implant three stents in arteries. It quoted him as saying: \u201cI\u2019m OK. It will take a long time to heal. Staying in the hospital a few more days. Not allowed to get excited.\u201d\n\n\n\nKensington Palace has refused to give a rolling commentary on the slew of reports emanating from TMZ. But by Thursday Markle felt she owed it to the public to clarify the situation.\n\n\n\nNeither she nor Harry have responded to criticism aired by other members of her family, which has recently dominated the media, and it is clear they have no intention of doing so.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/241d515e308ca2be0d99bcdea9e616505e052edf/0_590_5276_3165/master/5276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3aaffcd6463c89484de9484550b1a9a9", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Royal+wedding+2018%2CPrince+Harry%2CMeghan%2C+the+Duchess+of+Sussex%2CMonarchy%2CUK+news", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/241d515e308ca2be0d99bcdea9e616505e052edf/0_590_5276_3165/master/5276.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/241d515e308ca2be0d99bcdea9e616505e052edf/0_590_5276_3165/master/5276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3aaffcd6463c89484de9484550b1a9a9", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Davies"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-confirms-her-father-thomas-markle-will-not-attend", "title": "Meghan Markle confirms her father will not attend the royal wedding", "meta_data": {"description": "Thomas Markle Sr will miss Saturday\u2019s ceremony in Windsor in order to focus on his health", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-confirms-her-father-thomas-markle-will-not-attend", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/241d515e308ca2be0d99bcdea9e616505e052edf/0_590_5276_3165/master/5276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3aaffcd6463c89484de9484550b1a9a9", "height": 720}, "title": "Meghan Markle confirms her father will not attend the royal wedding", "description": "Thomas Markle Sr will miss Saturday\u2019s ceremony in Windsor in order to focus on his health", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/carolinedavies", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2021-03-08T04:14:43.000Z", "section": "UK news", "published_time": "2018-05-17T14:19:17.000Z", "tag": "Royal wedding 2018,Prince Harry,Meghan, the Duchess of Sussex,Monarchy,UK news"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2018/may/17/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-confirms-her-father-thomas-markle-will-not-attend?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2018/may/17/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-confirms-her-father-thomas-markle-will-not-attend", "iphone": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2018/may/17/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-confirms-her-father-thomas-markle-will-not-attend?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://uk-news/2018/may/17/royal-wedding-meghan-markle-confirms-her-father-thomas-markle-will-not-attend?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/241d515e308ca2be0d99bcdea9e616505e052edf/0_590_5276_3165/master/5276.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=135b902a24e3d8ad4ed476791e57d95b", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526511600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
