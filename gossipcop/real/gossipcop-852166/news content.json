The show has been on the air for six years, they\u2019ve written two books, hatched many spinoff series, and unlike some other HGTV stars, while each Property Brothers episode only focuses on a few rooms, they usually finish the entire home. Even if he has to split the proceeds with his brother, Jonathan Scott is undoubtedly earning more than he did as an award-winning magician.\n\nIn fact, they are a distant third to some of HGTV\u2019s other bigger star\u2014 Property Brothers and Love It or List It. E! Online took an in-depth look into how much money and fame comes with being an HGTV star. The results will have you picking up your sledgehammer and wallpaper swatches and pitching your own home renovation show ASAP.\n\n\n\n\u200b\n\nThe second biggest money earner the stars of Love It or List It, interior designer Hilary Farr and real estate agent David Visentin, who have a collective net worth of $7 million. They haven\u2019t written books or launched any spin-off series, but still manage to rake in some big bucks.\n\n\n\nAs for Chip and Joanna Gaines, don\u2019t worry that they won\u2019t be able to put their kids through school. According to E! they have a net worth of about $5 million, but considering how much we all love them and the fact that they have a spin-off in the works, that is likely to increase over the next few years.\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220825160521im_/https://www.lipstickalley.com/data/avatars/s/190/190234.jpg?1644704886",
