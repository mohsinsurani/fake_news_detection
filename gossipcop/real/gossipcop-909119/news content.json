However, the reality star didn\u2019t confirm the news until after giving birth to her baby girl. Instead, she kept her fans guessing about whether or not the rumors are true.\n\nThis prompted Jenner\u2019s followers to look for clues that she or her famous family dropped via social media or in interviews, but they didn\u2019t make it easy. Here\u2019s how Jenner kept fans guessing over her pregnancy.\n\nJenner posted this cryptic Instagram photo\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZT9rWVl-Dz/\n\nThe day before the possible pregnancy news broke, Jenner posted an image to Instagram that her followers didn\u2019t think much of at the time. However, after the internet blew up with reports that she was having a girl, this photo really got everyone\u2019s attention, speculating if this was Jenner\u2019s way of letting her fans know she was pregnant.\n\nNext: Here\u2019s what Kim Kardashian had to say about it.\n\nKim Kardashian tweeted it\u2019s fake news\n\nThis sounds like a very fake story\u2026 https://t.co/ZIxCltgK6d \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 26, 2017\n\nJust when we thought the pregnancy rumors could actually be true, Jenner\u2019s older sister, Kim Kardashian, threw us a curve ball.\n\nKardashian took to Twitter with a link to a Harper\u2019s Bazaar article which again claimed that Jenner was pregnant and detailed how her big sis reacted to the news. Mrs. West tweeted a pretty feisty response to the publication that the story sounded \u201cvery fake.\u201d\n\nNext: Making appearances on these shows haven\u2019t revealed much either.\n\nMama Kris refused to confirm news\n\nKris Jenner hasn\u2019t been forthcoming at all about if her youngest daughter is expecting either. During an episode of Live with Kelly and Ryan, the Kardashian-Jenner family matriarch texted Ryan Seacrest to say that \u201cKylie is not confirming anything.\u201d\n\nIn November, the momager appeared on Ellen DeGeneres\u2019 talk show and avoided any questions pertaining to whether the Life of Kylie star is preggers.\n\nNext: Is Kylie just trolling her own fans?\n\n\u2018Nothing\u2019s Gonna Hurt You Baby\u2019 Snap\n\nJenner, meanwhile, continued to confuse her many social media followers by posting a video to Snapchat with the song \u201cNothing\u2019s Gonna Hurt You Baby\u201d by Cigarettes After Sex playing in the background. Moreover, she captioned it \u201cBABY\u201d with a winking face emoji.\n\nSo, is she trolling us or trying to tell us something?\n\nNext: This is Kylie\u2019s excuse for those prego-looking photos.\n\nKylie claims tabloid pics were Photoshopped\n\nOn Nov. 5, some pictures were published by the Daily Mail showing what is supposedly Jenner\u2019s baby bump, but the makeup mogul fired back claiming that the images were \u201cPhotoshopped.\u201d\n\nThe X17Online, whose photographer took the pics, then responded to Jenner\u2019s with a statement that the photos were in no way altered. \u201c100% REAL! No Photoshop, #nofilter, no additives, no preservatives\u2014all organic and all REAL!\u201d\n\nNext: But her style hasn\u2019t changed much, leaving fans to wonder.\n\nShe only wears baggy clothes\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZb2LFiF3yI/?hl=en&taken-by=kyliejenner\n\nAlthough Jenner claimed that the baby bump pics aren\u2019t real, there hasn\u2019t been an explanation for why she\u2019s only been seen in baggy clothes lately. One look at her social media accounts show the reality star in a way we\u2019re not used to seeing her: all covered up in oversized sweats.\n\nNext: Is this the biggest clue she isn\u2019t really pregnant?\n\nJenner bought tampons\n\nProbably the most confusing thing of all, and what really threw everyone off, is when Jenner posted on Snapchat her purchases at a convenience store. Some eagle-eyed followers noticed that underneath a pile of junk food was a box of tampons!\n\nSo, there could be a few different explanations for this. She could be using them to put on foundation, buying them for someone else, or just keeping us guessing. There\u2019s also always the possibility she really isn\u2019t pregnant. You decide.\n\nNext: Kylie is missing from this popular photo.\n\nShe didn\u2019t appear in the Kardashian-Jenner family Christmas card\n\nThe Kardashians and the Jenners aren\u2019t ones to miss a photo opportunity. But Kylie has certainly been laying low \u2014 and she kept that going through the holiday season.\n\nLeading up to Christmas Day, Kim and co. shared images from a denim-themed photoshoot on social media featuring many members of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Notably missing was Kylie herself, which sparked even more conversation about her alleged pregnancy.\n\nNext: She conveniently covered up in this family photo.\n\nShe covered up in the Calvin Klein promotional shoot\n\nIn January 2018, the first images of the Kardashian and Jenner girls for their new partnership with Calvin Klein appeared. And once again, the jury is out on whether or not Kylie is pregnant.\n\nIn every photo in which she appears, Kylie\u2019s abdomen is somehow blocked from view. It\u2019s worth noting that Khlo\u00e9, whose pregnancy has been confirmed, isn\u2019t showing in the photos either, though Kylie is rumored to be further along than her big sis.\n\nShe finally confirmed her pregnancy\n\nAfter months of speculation, Jenner finally confirmed her pregnancy \u2014 after giving birth, that is! The star announced on Feb. 3, 2018, that she had just given birth two days prior on Feb. 1. She took to social media to announce her \u201cbeautiful and healthy\u201d baby girl, who at 4:43 p.m. local time and weighed in at 8 pounds, 9 ounces.\n\nShe shared the baby\u2019s first name and an image\n\nWhile many suspected Jenner would wait until an episode of a Keeping Up with the Kardashians or another media moment in the future to spill more details, she surprised us. The 20-year-old mom took to her Instagram account just two days after confirming her daughter\u2019s birth to share this image.\n\nAccompanied by the simple caption, \u201cstormi webster\u201d and an angel emoji, Jenner appeared to reveal the infant\u2019s name alongside a pic showing part of her face and her tiny hand holding on to her mother\u2019s (perfectly manicured) thumb. It\u2019s simply adorable, but of course, leads to more questions, like \u201cIs \u2018Stormi\u2019 short for something?\u201d\n\nWebster is the legal last name of the child\u2019s father, Travis Scott (birth name Jacques Webster).\n\nAdditional reporting by Becca Bleznak.\n\nFollow Michelle Kapusta on Twitter @philamichelle.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Screen-Shot-2018-02-05-at-11.10.49-AM-e1517847285146.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/kylie-jenner-baby.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kim-kardashian-west-twitter.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-photoshop-tweet.jpg?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-photoshop-tweet.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kardashian-calvin-klein.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-photoshop-tweet.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Kapusta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/kylie-jenner-keeping-fans-guessing-pregnancy.html/", "title": "How Kylie Jenner Kept Fans Guessing Over Pregnancy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Kylie Jenner didn't address those pregnancy rumors until after her baby was born, but fans kept looking for hints in her social media.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Kylie Jenner Kept Fans Guessing Over Pregnancy", "description": "Kylie Jenner didn't address those pregnancy rumors until after her baby was born, but fans kept looking for hints in her social media.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/kylie-jenner-keeping-fans-guessing-pregnancy.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kylie-jenner-photoshop-tweet.jpg?w=1200"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "published_time": "2018-04-24T14:24:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-25T14:25:06+00:00"}, "author": "Michelle Kapusta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@PhilaMichelle", "site": "@cheatsheet", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Michelle Kapusta", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "6 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/hQkF80DgQQQ?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/qKzu9cq-xik?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1524579840.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
