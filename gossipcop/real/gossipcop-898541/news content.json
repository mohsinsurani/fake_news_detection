It began in late 2009, when the Jimmy Kimmel Live! producer and co-head writer started dating her boss. Every bone in McNearney\u2019s body knew it was a bad idea, and not just because the St. Louis native was then the only female in the show\u2019s writers room and was dead set on fitting in. \u201cI remember telling Jimmy, \u2018If this doesn\u2019t work out, nothing in your life changes,\u2019 \u201d she says, \u201cbut mine changes completely.\u201d It was left to Kimmel, who had been married once before, to impart to her his confidence that this was something more than a workplace fling.\n\nThat their romance has survived \u2014 Kimmel, 50, and McNearney, 39, wed in 2013 and now have two children together \u2014 is, at least in part, a credit to the way they have committed to keeping their work life separate from their personal one. Most of the time, anyway. \u201cOccasionally,\u201d she admits, \u201cI\u2019ll be brushing my teeth at night and go, \u2018Really? That was a good idea that you rejected today.\u2019 \u201d Though McNearney has with time gotten comfortable with her boss by day, husband by night setup, she insists she\u2019ll never fully adjust to the prying eyes that come with it: \u201cIt\u2019s unsettling and scary to have people have an opinion about you and take an interest in your family who don\u2019t know you.\u201d\n\nMcNearney\u2019s emergence as a voice of a movement came April 21, when the couple\u2019s second child, a son named Billy, was born with a congenital heart defect. Rather than keep quiet about the harrowing situation, she and Kimmel agreed that Billy\u2019s condition would be discussed on the ABC late-night show, both as an explanation for the host\u2019s weeklong absence and as an opportunity to support the Affordable Care Act, which was on the verge of congressional repeal. (Access to health care has remained a powerful theme on JKL! as well as on both parents\u2019 social media feeds.) The decision to speak out has thrust Kimmel and to a lesser extent his wife into a hugely divisive debate. Along with a surge in ratings and publicity has come a vicious backlash from those who accuse the Kimmel family of exploiting their child\u2019s condition for political purposes.\n\nSeated in the JKL! greenroom in the heart of Hollywood in November, McNearney vacillates between tears and laughter as she reflects on the tumultuous year: \u201cThere have definitely been times where I couldn\u2019t help but think, \u2018Life would be so much easier if we could just go back to making fun of the Kardashians.\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nBilly arrived, and everything seemed fine.\n\nThree hours later, we were in the recovery room, and the nurse started to ask me a lot of questions that I thought seemed strange. \u201cDid he kick a lot when he was in you?\u201d Yeah, he kicked a lot, but, I thought, who cares? He\u2019s out now. \u201cMore than Jane [your older daughter]?\u201d she asked. Yeah. I didn\u2019t know what any of this had to do with anything. Then she said, \u201cI\u2019m going to take him out of the room for a few minutes,\u201d and I didn\u2019t think anything of it. \u201cAnd Jimmy\u2019s going to come with us.\u201d Jimmy didn\u2019t seem concerned, and they left the room. Twenty minutes went by, then 30 minutes, 40 minutes. \u2026 I started to get worried.\n\nThen a doctor I\u2019d never seen before came in the room \u2014 and I knew. He sat down on the bed and put his hand on my knee, and I just burst into tears. \u201cWhere is he?\u201d I said. \u201cWhere is the baby?\u201d\n\nThe doctor told me there\u2019s an issue, it\u2019s either his heart or his lung. From that moment on, it became a whirlwind of medical jargon and information I never knew I would have to understand. I was brought up to the neonatal intensive care unit, and I saw him there in his incubator with all these tubes in him. Jimmy was already there. He had watched it all happen: more and more people coming into the room, putting more and more things in him. After listening to a lot of opinions, we made the decision to move him to Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles for open-heart surgery, which Billy had when he was just 3 days old.\n\nIt was all so crazy.\n\nOn day six or so of us being in the hospital, we knew it was time to start thinking about Jimmy going back to work. I remember it had been a really long day at the hospital, and we were in the car going home to have dinner with our daughter, and Jimmy turned to me and said, \u201cI want to talk about Billy on the show on Monday.\u201d I said, \u201cOK.\u201d And then he said, \u201cAnd I want to talk about the health care problem in this country.\u201d Again, I didn\u2019t think much of it. I figured he\u2019d tell the story and then he\u2019d probably cry because, well, he once cried on the show over a lion dying.\n\nThat Monday, Billy was finally home, and Jimmy was back at work. Even though I was on maternity leave, I was still getting all of my work emails, and I didn\u2019t get one with the monologue for that night. I emailed Jimmy, and he said, \u201cI just want you to watch.\u201d So, there I am, in my living room breastfeeding Billy with my mom beside me, and we\u2019re watching. I sobbed through the entire thing. I couldn\u2019t believe the strength that it took to tell that story a week after it happened. He didn\u2019t have to do that. Our family has excellent health care; he had nothing to gain from that. He did it for the other people whom we met in that hospital. He came home that night, and I just hugged him and I wouldn\u2019t let go.\n\nAt that point I thought what Jimmy had done was incredible, but I didn\u2019t think it would make much of a difference. Of course, I couldn\u2019t have been more wrong. The positive response was and still is overwhelming. Jimmy and I can\u2019t go anywhere without someone coming up and thanking him for that monologue. Now, people interrupting our dinner isn\u2019t annoying to me anymore because I\u2019m so thankful that they show their gratitude toward him and what he did. Then came the criticism. People attacking us for politicizing what happened to our baby, which to me is truly crazy. We took a personal experience and we shared it with the world, and then it just so happened that this was going on while people were trying to take health care away from children like ours. People were sending letters to our home, attacking both of us on Twitter, saying things like we deserve this and we\u2019re terrible people. That\u2019s been the ugliest part of all of this, and it\u2019s been harder for me to deal with than the weekly cardiologist appointments and making sure my baby is breathing properly. I got off Twitter for a while, and now that I\u2019m back I just refuse to look at my replies, which makes me sad because a lot of it is mothers who have children with similar defects who are grateful for what we\u2019re doing. Nine out of 10 are positive, but that one nasty one will shake me.\n\nI just don\u2019t understand. To me, children having access to health care, no matter what their parents\u2019 income, should not be a divisive issue, but that\u2019s where we are as a country right now. I\u2019ll admit I had never been a political person until recently \u2014 until Hillary lost. I remember the day after she did, I came to work and I was numb. I had just watched her concession speech with my daughter, who was 2 at the time, on my lap, and then I came in, went in to Jimmy\u2019s office and burst into tears. I told him, \u201cI don\u2019t know if I can do this anymore.\u201d I\u2019d been looking forward to coming in here and not having to watch Donald Trump clips anymore. Once she won, Trump wasn\u2019t going to be the lead story every night. I envy the friends of mine who say, \u201cI\u2019m not going to pay attention this week.\u201d I don\u2019t have the luxury of turning off the news. I have to watch. I can\u2019t write the show if I don\u2019t know the terrible things that he\u2019s said and done.\n\nAt the same time, I know it was good for me to start listening to other people. I have family members and friends who voted for Trump. My dad voted for him. I needed to understand why. I also became much more active. Like a lot of people that morning, I saw things being stripped away that were really important to me, and I didn\u2019t want to sit on the sidelines. So I began researching things, signing up for emails and donating to causes like the environment and sensible gun legislation that were important to me. And now, after Billy, access to health care.\n\nLook, there\u2019s something almost every day that we could be going after, something we could try to be the voice of. But I think that would be a disservice, so we have to stay focused on the few things that are really personal for us. It just so happens that this year Jimmy had a health scare with a child when health care was up for debate, and then people were being gunned down in his hometown [of Las Vegas]. He couldn\u2019t sit quiet, and I\u2019m so glad he didn\u2019t. The monologues he delivered on both of those nights were so personal to him. He had 14 writers sitting in a room ready to write, and he said, \u201cI got this,\u201d and went into his own office and closed the door. That was all him, all his heart.\n\nI don\u2019t necessarily like that everyone knows what\u2019s going on with the health of my child. And it\u2019s scary to make yourself vulnerable the way we have, but the encouragement that we\u2019re helping other people far outweighs my fears about our lack of privacy. If we were to do this all over again and someone said, \u201cYou would have an opportunity to have a perfectly healthy baby boy,\u201d I would take the one we got because I think it helped a lot of families. We didn\u2019t anticipate we would be in this position, but we were, and we made the most of it. And thank God this will, fingers crossed, end in a positive way because we get asked about him everywhere we go, and I\u2019m not sure we would ever be able to leave the house. I swear, we haven\u2019t gone to a coffee shop, filled up the gas tank, done anything without someone asking us how Billy is doing, and, thank God, we get to say something positive.\n\nJust yesterday, I was cleaning shit out of his socks, and all I could think was, \u201cOh honey, you are so unaware right now. You have no idea you have a letter from Obama on your wall.\u201d There\u2019s one from George W. Bush hanging up, too. I\u2019m looking forward to the day that I get to tell him about all of this. I want to be the one to tell Billy what his dad did for him.\n\n[Editor\u2019s Note: Billy Kimmel underwent his second successful heart surgery Dec. 4.]\n\nThis story first appeared in the 2017 Women in Entertainment Power 100 issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
