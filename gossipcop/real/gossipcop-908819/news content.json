The assassination in question takes place in the very first scene of the series and, unlike the crimes of which Simpson was accused, there\u2019s no ensuing legal battle that grips the country, collectively watching a White Bronco on the 405. So Murphy, television\u2019s pre-eminent dramatist, quite literally flips the script. Versace doesn\u2019t reach the heights of season one, and it\u2019s slow to boil, but at it\u2019s best it makes for thrilling, macabre, deliciously campy television.\n\nIf The People v OJ took the gruesome murders of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman and wove them into a fraught tale of racial politics, Versace uses its eponymous victim to tell a story about being gay in America: the seclusion and loneliness of the closet, the pain of stymied desire, the necessary accumulation of lies, and the confusion of a post-Aids-crisis, pre-Will-and-Grace world in which tolerance is nascent but skepticism still pervasive.\n\nAt the center of all this is Andrew Cunanan, who in 1997 went on a cross-country murder spree, killing Jeffrey Trail, David Madson, Lee Miglin, William Reese and, finally, Gianni Versace, on the front steps of his Miami Beach mansion. Murphy, with Tom Rob Smith adapting Maureen Orth\u2019s book Vulgar Favors, chooses to tell the story in reverse, a gambit that can be confusing but begins to pay off several episodes in. The desired effect is to watch criminality unfurl itself backwards, to show the origin story of a killer as perversely apathetic and strangely endearing as Cunanan. But the tactic is neither necessary nor particularly enhancing.\n\nCunanan is played by Darren Criss, the velvet-voiced Warbler of Glee fame. His portrayal is not convincing at first, but like everything in the series, it improves with time and exposure. As the closeted, bespectacled killer, Criss is clearly inspired by Anthony Perkins\u2019 Norman Bates and Malcolm McDowell\u2019s Alex DeLarge; charm is conveyed through widened eyes, sweetness through an uptick in cadence, and homosexuality through a cock of the wrist or a wiggle of the hips, which is maybe why we should cast gay actors to play gay characters a little more often. But despite the capital-A acting, Criss is nothing if not dedicated, and he comes to embody Cunanan quite formidably by the time he\u2019s gallivanting through gay bars telling people he\u2019s a set designer on the upcoming movie Titanic.\n\nDarren Criss, Edgar Ramirez, Penelope Cruz, and Ricky Martin star in The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.

It\u2019s impossible to turn away from Pen\u00e9lope Cruz as Donatella Versace, wearing a black-laced veil as she confronts her brother\u2019s corpse; Edgar Ram\u00edrez as Gianni is commanding and quietly tortured; Max Greenfield is superb as a South Beach junkie who crosses paths with Cunanan and makes it out alive; Finn Wittrock, playing a closeted naval officer after the signing of Don\u2019t Ask, Don\u2019t Tell, is the first of Cunanan\u2019s victims; and Judith Light, in a single-episode cameo as the widow of the Chicago real estate developer Lee Miglin, is, well, Judith Light (read: brilliant). Murphy\u2019s heavy-handedness is not to everyone\u2019s liking, but he always manages to squeeze all the pulp out of his performers.\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz as Donatella Versace in a scene from The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.

One moment, we\u2019re at the Versace mansion, as chiseled butlers serve orange juice on silver trays, and the next we\u2019re in seedy motels and lakeside cottages as characters snort heroin and hunt quail. The contrast says as much about class as it does the geographical scope of the murders; Cunanan is both killer and liar, but more than anything he\u2019s a striver, with Versace advertisements thumb-tacked to his wall and an expensive wardrobe mostly gifted to him by the older, rich men whom he dates and, in some cases, slays.\n\nThe smartest thing about the show is that, in stark contrast to the courtroom procedural style of The People v OJ Simpson, each episode plays like a standalone film. Versace\u2019s name may be in the title, but Miglin, Trail and Madson get almost as much backstory, not to mention Cunanan, the only character who appears in every episode. Which is to say that, in the world of the show, queer lives mean very little to law enforcement; in the world of Ryan Murphy, though, they\u2019re each deserving of attention, regardless of wealth or fame.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e72f4e0541d0730b2d11196dfb16868eec5226a/0_46_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8104fdbd99c7ae32ed667d55b8573116", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Television%2CCulture%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CVersace%2CFashion%2CPen%C3%A9lope+Cruz%2CUS+television%2CRicky+Martin%2CDrama", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e72f4e0541d0730b2d11196dfb16868eec5226a/0_46_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e9eabe0393a2a3a6943b7c358ab29ed191360b1b/0_49_4808_2884/master/4808.jpg?width=445&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e72f4e0541d0730b2d11196dfb16868eec5226a/0_46_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8104fdbd99c7ae32ed667d55b8573116", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jake Nevins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/17/assassination-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-review", "title": "The Assassination of Gianni Versace review \u2013 a grim portrait of gay life", "meta_data": {"description": "In his follow-up to The People v OJ Simpson, Ryan Murphy spins the designer\u2019s murder into a compelling story of deceit, ambition and what it meant to be gay at the turn of the century", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/17/assassination-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-review", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e72f4e0541d0730b2d11196dfb16868eec5226a/0_46_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8104fdbd99c7ae32ed667d55b8573116", "height": 720}, "title": "The Assassination of Gianni Versace review \u2013 a grim portrait of gay life", "description": "In his follow-up to The People v OJ Simpson, Ryan Murphy spins the designer\u2019s murder into a compelling story of deceit, ambition and what it meant to be gay at the turn of the century", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jake-nevins", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-07-02T13:50:37.000Z", "section": "Television & radio", "published_time": "2018-01-17T11:30:52.000Z", "tag": "Television,Culture,Television & radio,Versace,Fashion,Pen\u00e9lope Cruz,US television,Ricky Martin,Drama"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://tv-and-radio/2018/jan/17/assassination-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-review?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2018/jan/17/assassination-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-review", "iphone": "gnmguardian://tv-and-radio/2018/jan/17/assassination-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-review?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://tv-and-radio/2018/jan/17/assassination-gianni-versace-american-crime-story-review?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jhnevins", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/3e72f4e0541d0730b2d11196dfb16868eec5226a/0_46_4272_2563/master/4272.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctcmV2aWV3LTQucG5n&s=4cf1358023f84a19af5995e62d6a1a14", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516147200.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
