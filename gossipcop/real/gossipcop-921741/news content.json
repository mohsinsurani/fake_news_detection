The former Desperate Housewives star purchased the house for $3.6 million back in August 2006. The lavish contemporary Mediterranean-style home features nine bathrooms and six bedrooms, with a fireplace in each. Common areas in the house are primarily found on the second floor (there are three floors total, connected by a circular staircase with wrought-iron railings), and include a combination living-dining room with two fireplaces and several wood-trimmed glass doors leading out onto a wraparound balcony and a kitchen with an oversize center island and a cozy breakfast nook.\n\nAlong with a fireplace, the master suite has a sitting area, not one but two custom-fitted walk-in closets, and a tumbled travertine tiled bathroom with an additional gas fireplace between a large tub and a separate, glass-enclosed steam shower. The home also includes a subterranean ground-floor level with a state-of-the-art screening room, as well as a cavelike family room with a large wet bar and large windows that peek directly into the depth of the swimming pool. Outside, Longoria\u2019s home is no less luxe, with a stone-tiled, courtyard-sized yard; a sheltered dining terrace complete with an outdoor kitchen and barbecue area; and a swimming pool and spa with grand mountainous views.\n\nThis recently listed Hollywood home is just one of the Overboard star\u2019s many properties. She also currently owns an 11,000-plus-square-foot mansion in Beverly Hills, which she picked up for $13.5 million in late 2017, as well as a 1,500-square-foot home just above Malibu\u2019s Zuma Beach, which she purchased in 2008 for $2.5 million. Longoria also maintains a 3,500-square-foot residence in a gated enclave just north of downtown San Antonio that she\u2019s owned since 2005.", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/60d5f926629cdf5f72514b1d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5ab3f0a72ed63a101d561df8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-921805778.jpg", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us-reverse.0ae5c38d353e00b66b06ff79880d6cbcaac70fc2.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5ab3f0a72ed63a101d561df8/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-921805778.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/6320e4840d22e61b51294b3b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/631f7fd0a734effedaab6821/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us.651c7dd3bde4415d6ae6e43ca752399cf2213fc2.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/6328c85d04902492a06cc6b6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5ab3f0a72ed63a101d561df8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-921805778.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Joyce Chen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/eva-longoria-lists-her-dollar38-million-hollywood-mansion-weeks-ahead-of-babys-birth", "title": "Eva Longoria Lists Her $3.8 Million Hollywood Mansion Weeks Ahead of Baby's Birth", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The lavish 8,603-square-foot home of the former Desperate Housewives star features six bedrooms, each with its own fireplace, and nine bathrooms", "id": "5ab3e9c8d91fc303af543c2e", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ab3e9c8d91fc303af543c2e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The lavish 8,603-square-foot home of the former Desperate Housewives star features six bedrooms, each with its own fireplace, and nine bathrooms\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5ab3f0a72ed63a101d561df8/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-921805778.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5ab3f0a72ed63a101d561df8/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-921805778.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The lavish 8,603-square-foot home of the former Desperate Housewives star features six bedrooms, each with its own fireplace, and nine bathrooms", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5ab3f0a72ed63a101d561df8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-921805778.jpg", "site_name": "Architectural Digest", "title": "Eva Longoria Lists Her $3.8 Million Hollywood Mansion Weeks Ahead of Baby's Birth", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/eva-longoria-lists-her-dollar38-million-hollywood-mansion-weeks-ahead-of-babys-birth"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-22T20:34:05.799Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-22T20:34:05.799Z", "author": "Joyce Chen"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ArchDigest", "description": "The lavish 8,603-square-foot home of the former Desperate Housewives star features six bedrooms, each with its own fireplace, and nine bathrooms", "domain": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5ab3f0a72ed63a101d561df8/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-921805778.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@ArchDigest", "title": "Eva Longoria Lists Her $3.8 Million Hollywood Mansion Weeks Ahead of Baby's Birth"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267091300008193, "pages": 43794751042}, "google-signin-client_id": "960933707988-c28a5u0f04t7r9sdmr2u8ct9tioi4m1n.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521750845.799, "source": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "summary": ""}
