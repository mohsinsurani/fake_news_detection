Country singer Jason Aldean delivered a brief monologue on the SNL main stage, saying \u201cI\u2019m struggling to understand what happened that night\u201d and that \u201cso many people are hurting.\u201d He then performed a rendition of the Tom Petty classic \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down,\u201d which also paid homage to Petty, who died Monday at 66.\n\nIt has been less than a week since 64-year-old Stephen Paddock fired upon the crowd at the Route 91 Harvest Festival in Las Vegas, several songs into Aldean\u2019s closing set. Authorities said Paddock killed at least 58 people and left more than 500 injured, making the rampage the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis is how Aldean began SNL on Saturday:\n\n\u201cI\u2019m Jason Aldean. This week, we witnessed one of the worst tragedies in American history. Like everyone, I\u2019m struggling to understand what happened that night and how to pick up the pieces and start to heal. So many people are hurting. There are children, parents, brothers, sisters, friends \u2014 they\u2019re all part of our family. So I want to say to them: We hurt for you and we hurt with you. But you can be sure we\u2019re going to walk through these tough times together, every step of the way, because when America is at its best, our bond and our spirit, it\u2019s unbreakable.\u201d\n\nThe shooting renewed the debate over gun control, and one musician \u2014 lead guitarist of the Josh Abbott Band, Caleb Keeter \u2014 publicly reversed his position on the issue and called for greater gun control. His declaration was a rarity for country music, where it\u2019s rare to make any remotely political statements (especially regarding guns given the community\u2019s close ties to the National Rifle Association).\n\nIt\u2019s not uncommon for SNL to go for an entirely seriously cold open following a national tragedy. Perhaps most memorably, SNL returned to air 18 days after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks with then-New York Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani delivering a speech while flanked by several first responders. Paul Simon performed \u201cThe Boxer.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGiuliani said it was important that SNL, as a New York institution, continue again to show the city \u201cwas open for business.\u201d SNL executive producer Lorne Michaels then asked, \u201cCan we be funny?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy start now?\u201d Giuliani responded, getting big laughs from the audience.\n\nBut the most recent serious cold open came after the highly contentious 2016 presidential election, when Kate McKinnon as Hillary Clinton played the piano on the SNL main stage, singing Leonard Cohen\u2019s \u201cHallelujah.\u201d\n\nIt also served as partially a tribute to Cohen, who had just died.\n\nAfter the song, McKinnon\u2019s Clinton, with tears in her eyes, simply said: \u201c\u201cI\u2019m not giving up, and neither should you.\u201d It was an opening that drew praise from those reeling from Clinton\u2019s surprise defeat, and criticism from those who said the approach showed SNL had a clear bias and that it treated Trump\u2019s triumph as a time to grieve.\n\nBut this week\u2019s cold open avoided any hint of politics. It saved that for later in the show.\n\nRead more:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2017/10/snl.png&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2017/10/snl.png&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elahe Izadi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/10/08/jason-aldean-opens-snl-with-tribute-to-las-vegas-victims-we-hurt-with-you/", "title": "Jason Aldean covers Tom Petty on SNL in an emotional tribute to Las Vegas victims", "meta_data": {"description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" began its first post-Las Vegas shooting episode with a serious cold open.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/10/08/jason-aldean-opens-snl-with-tribute-to-las-vegas-victims-we-hurt-with-you/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2017/10/snl.png&w=1440", "title": "Jason Aldean covers Tom Petty on SNL in an emotional tribute to Las Vegas victims", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" began its first post-Las Vegas shooting episode with a serious cold open."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jason Aldean covers Tom Petty on SNL in an emotional tribute to Las Vegas victims", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" began its first post-Las Vegas shooting episode with a serious cold open."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-12-03T05:55:13.443Z", "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-08T05:54:12.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-12-03T05:55:13.443Z", "section": "Arts & Entertainment", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 70, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/10/08/jason-aldean-opens-snl-with-tribute-to-las-vegas-victims-we-hurt-with-you/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507417200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
