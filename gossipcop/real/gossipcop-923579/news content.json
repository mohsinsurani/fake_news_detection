The Korean singer, who performed as Minwoo, was found without a pulse at his home in Seoul on the evening of 25 March, and was pronounced dead by first responders. The cause of death is reportedly cardiac arrest.\n\nThe band\u2019s label, Top Media, paid tribute to the artist on its website: \u201cHis family, the 100% members, and the Top Media artists and staff members are all grief-stricken and in mourning from the unexpected, sad news.\u201d Minwoo\u2019s family have requested a private funeral.\n\nHis former bandmate Woo Changbum paid tribute to Minwoo in an Instagram post, captioning a photo of them together (translated from Korean): \u201cMay the souls of the deceased refrain. I hope you are comfortable in the sky. I want you to be a bright star and shine this world.\u201d One fan paid tribute to Minwoo\u2019s support for LGBTQ rights.\n\nAllow Instagram content?

The group were the second boyband created by Andy Lee of the K-pop group Shinhwa. They also have a smaller group comprising members of the main band \u2013 called 100% V \u2013 of which Minwoo was not a member.\n\nMinwoo was the band\u2019s lead vocalist, but took a sabbatical from the band to complete mandatory military service in 2014. Minwoo had also worked as an actor, appearing in dramas such as Sharp 3 and The King and I, and making cameos in the TV series New Tales of Gisaeng and movies including Where Are You Going?\n\n100% had made their Japanese debut in January 2017, breaking through with this year\u2019s Top 10 single Song for You, released last month. They are due to perform in Tokyo and Osaka at the end of April. Top Media has not confirmed if the shows will go ahead.\n\nMinwoo is the second high-profile K-pop death in recent months; SHINee lead singer Kim Jong-hyun died in December.\n\n", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741ce15404ce4124f9362c2f60c1e1c526e86d77/0_0_818_491/master/818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=eafc8b34c06f8cbb6c3b9f62f2f0f88d", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=K-pop%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CPop+and+rock%2CAsia+Pacific%2CWorld+news%2CSouth+Korea", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741ce15404ce4124f9362c2f60c1e1c526e86d77/0_0_818_491/master/818.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741ce15404ce4124f9362c2f60c1e1c526e86d77/0_0_818_491/master/818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=eafc8b34c06f8cbb6c3b9f62f2f0f88d", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33", "title": "Seo Minwoo, member of K-pop boyband 100%, dies aged 33", "meta_data": {"description": "The Korean singer, found unresponsive at home in Seoul, reportedly died after going into cardiac arrest", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741ce15404ce4124f9362c2f60c1e1c526e86d77/0_0_818_491/master/818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=eafc8b34c06f8cbb6c3b9f62f2f0f88d", "height": 720}, "title": "Seo Minwoo, member of K-pop boyband 100%, dies aged 33", "description": "The Korean singer, found unresponsive at home in Seoul, reportedly died after going into cardiac arrest", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-snapes", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-03-27T12:23:25.000Z", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2018-03-27T10:55:48.000Z", "tag": "K-pop,Music,Culture,Pop and rock,Asia Pacific,World news,South Korea"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2018/mar/27/seo-minwoo-k-pop-boyband-100-percent-dies-aged-33?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/741ce15404ce4124f9362c2f60c1e1c526e86d77/0_0_818_491/master/818.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=a33f577b27f2a061543d983073e986c9", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522105200.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
