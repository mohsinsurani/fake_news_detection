The product, which has been dubbed \u2018The Jewel of the Amazon\u2019, was clearly a huge success, as it sold out in less than twenty minutes, and I don\u2019t want to think about what the buyers must be doing with them. Anyway, you can learn more about the, um, dildo in an interview with the creators here.\n\nHowever, del Toro has made it clear that he\u2019s not a fan of the rather naughty piece of merchandise. Speaking to The Wrap, he said that the toy, which depicts the creature\u2019s manhood, was not an accurate depiction of how its genitalia would actually look. He was quoted as saying the following:\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s an accurate representation. It\u2019s some form of fan art\u2026 I guess.\u201d\n\nSeeing as del Toro designed the creature, he has the final say over how its manly parts look. So if he says the dildo\u2019s incorrect, it\u2019s incorrect.\n\nJones was also not particularly fond of the sex toy, saying:\n\n\u201cAfter pouring my heart, soul, blood, sweat, and tears into this romantic, beautiful, magical role, the last thing I want to be remembered for is a silicone appendage that comes in two sizes.\u201d\n\nWe hear you, Doug. And don\u2019t worry, people will be praising your performance in The Shape of Water for years to come.\n\nSo I guess the moral of this story is that you shouldn\u2019t create a sex toy modeled after an amphibious creature\u2019s private parts without first consulting an expert.\n\nAnyway, The Shape of Water also stars Sally Hawkins, Michael Shannon, Richard Jenkins, Michael Stuhlbarg, and Octavia Spencer. We loved the film in our review, and it\u2019s also picked up thirteen Oscar nominations in addition to earning a current worldwide total of $75 million. Despite all its success, we\u2019ll probably never truly know what the creature\u2019s penis really looks like. And maybe that\u2019s a good thing.", "images": ["https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-toy5-1.jpg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/dread-tv-button-1.png", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Screen-Shot-2022-09-20-at-1.32.07-PM-336x177.png", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/VHS99_01_39_42_03_0024-336x189.jpeg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-creature-image-1-750x422.jpg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-creature-image-1.jpg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-toy4-1.jpg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dread-Central-Logo-mob.png", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/The-Wendigo-1-336x177.jpg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/hellbilly-hollow-header-336x176.jpg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/masking-threshold_stills-9-a\u0302-johannes-grenzfurthnermonochrom.5976374-336x168.jpeg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5f03c53dd5edb667cdb3454f885338d4?s=96&d=mm&r=x", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/newsletter-signup-1024x714.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1141563382706084&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-toy6-1.jpg", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-07-at-4.58.47-PM-336x141.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=279384635878016&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Dread-Central-Logo-1.png", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-toy7-1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-wP9uAe3ADYc3w.gif", "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-toy-1-240x300.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-creature-image-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["David Gelmini"], "canonical_link": "https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/267079/guillermo-del-toro-says-shape-water-sex-toy-not-accurate/", "title": "Guillermo del Toro Says The Shape of Water Sex Toy is Not Accurate", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-creature-image-1-336x176.jpg"}, "description": "Guillermo del Toro Says The Shape of Water Sex Toy is Not Accurate", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Guillermo del Toro Says The Shape of Water Sex Toy is Not Accurate", "description": "Guillermo del Toro Says The Shape of Water Sex Toy is Not Accurate", "url": "https://www.dreadcentral.com/news/267079/guillermo-del-toro-says-shape-water-sex-toy-not-accurate/", "site_name": "Dread Central", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.dreadcentral.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/the-shape-of-water-creature-image-1.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 627, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/DreadCentral", "published_time": "2018-02-16T00:00:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-15T18:06:00+00:00"}, "author": "David Gelmini", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@dreadcentral", "site": "@dreadcentral", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "David Gelmini", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "BridPlugin": "site:17839|oauth_token:01110011 01100101 01100011 01110010 01100101 01110100|ver:3.5.1|widget:1|disable_video_autosave:|channels:Array|width:900|height:506|autoplay:0|aspect:1|user_id:17159|default_channel:14|ovr_def:1|async_embed:1|google_seo:1|raw_embed:0|unit:15603|unit_width:480|unit_height:270|player:23442|video_image:|onready:", "google-site-verification": "Zxfjb8K02423qEDK9FPfh0cz5MXVLey9TBDX5U41gPI", "generator": "Powered by Slider Revolution 6.5.31 - responsive, Mobile-Friendly Slider Plugin for WordPress with comfortable drag and drop interface."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518739252.0, "source": "https://www.dreadcentral.com", "summary": ""}
