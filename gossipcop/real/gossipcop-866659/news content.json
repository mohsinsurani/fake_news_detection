From Peyton Manning\u2019s cheeky jokes and making fun of himself, to Kevin Durant\u2018s pouting, plus plenty of tear-inducing emotional moments \u2014 we had an (almost) front row view of all the action.\n\nSee below for 22 things you didn\u2019t see on TV below:\n\nAlso Read: ESPYs 2017 Winners: Simone Biles, Golden State Warriors, Chicago Cubs and More\n\nPeyton Manning\u2019s flawless comic timing\n\nOnce renown for his perfect passes, the former Colts and Broncos QB annihilated the audience with his swift jokes. Entering the stage to an explosion of cheers, Manning immediately mocked former hosts \u2014 especially TV has-beens like Jimmy Smits. \u201cThe only difference is I knew when to retire,\u201d Manning said. \u201cThe ESPYs finally got it right instead of some comedian or entertainer or Matthew Perry,\u201d he added.\n\n\n\nNo one likes Ryan Lochte \u2026\n\n\u201cJohn Cena is an athlete the same way Ryan Lochte is a reliable witness,\u201d Manning continued, to cheers of agreement. \u201cYou\u2019ve got me, Michael Phelps?\u201d Yep, the multi-gold medal winner agreed. Manning went on to say he wouldn\u2019t rip into other athletes \u2026 \u201cbut here are the jokes I wouldn\u2019t tell.\u201d And went on to rip all the other athletes in the house.\n\n\n\n\u201cUnfortunately my brother Eli can\u2019t be here \u2014 that\u2019s what I told the guys at the door,\u201d he said. Manning wasn\u2019t afraid of making some toilet humor at Mark Sanchez\u2019s expense regarding his infamous butt fumble against the Patriots, either. \u201cThey wanted me to say anus on TV. My kids are here, I want it to be classy,\u201d Peyton claimed, before dropping in another \u201canus\u201d mention.\n\nAlso Read: ESPYs: Kevin Durant Pouts Hard Over Brutal Peyton Manning Monologue Dunk (Video)\n\nKevin Durant was not amused\n\nThe joke about Kevin Durant willing to jump to any winning team \u2014 even the women\u2019s gymnastics Olympic team \u2014 was a hit with the audience but fell flat with the NBA Finals MVP, who was stony-faced when the cameras fell on him. Was that part of the joke or was Durant really pissed? We\u2019re not sure, but it sure did make it funny either way. Durant was just as straight-faced later in the night when he accepted the award for Best Championship Performance.\n\nAlso Read: 25 Most Memorable ESPYs Moments, From Stuart Scott to Justin Timberlake (Photos)\n\nReluctant respect for the Super Bowl LI champions\n\n\u201cFinally \u2018cos I am being forced to say it \u2014 I love that Tom Brady and Bill Belichick won their fifth Super Bowl. Enough of that,\u201d Manning said, to united groans from the non-New England fans in the house.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe Falcons and Matt Ryan will be back,\u201d Manning assured the Super Bowl LI losers. \u201cI want to say that at the beginning of the show, because I know they\u2019ll stop paying attention three-quarters of the way through.\u201d OUCH!\n\n\n\nFeathered guest of honor\n\nAs part of Manning\u2019s self-mocking of all the products he endorses, from pizza to insurance, the Aflac duck had the best seat in the house \u2014 and a very dapper bow tie. He also had a slew of admirers snapping pics of him, just like a true Hollywood celebrity.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in the insurance game now \u2026 I\u2019ve got to compete with that damn Aflac duck,\u201d Manning quipped.\n\nJeremy Renner\u2019s broken wings\n\nElizabeth Olsen and Jeremy Renner were the first hosts of the night, with the \u201cAvengers\u201d actor looked quite recovered from a recent on-set accident that broke both his arms. Ironically,he presented the Breakthrough Athlete of the Year Award to Dallas Cowboys Dak Prescott.\n\nAlso Read: Inside the Plans for Tonight's 25th Anniversary ESPY Awards\n\nMr. Clippers was the entertainer of the night\n\nWhen NBA star DeAndre Jordan came to the stage, a die-hard L.A. Clippers fan \u2014 known as Clipper Darrell \u2013 stood up in a full Clippers gear and shouted \u201cWe love you DJ!\u201d Mr. Clippers also seemed to really like Snoop Dogg \u2026 and wasn\u2019t afraid to stand up and dance alone. Later, he showed very vocal love for Michelle Obama as well.\n\n\n\n\u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d worthy skit was a hit\n\nWhile no famous face in the audience was safe, Peyton made fun of himself a lot too, with the best take-down being part of a skit about a retirement home called Sunset Acres.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m retired so I live in a retirement home. I\u2019m a veteran but we have real WWII veterans here too, \u201d Manning said in the hilarious video.\n\n\n\nOf course, every sports story has a rivalry \u2014 and Manning had it out for fellow resident Ruth, who just happened to be Tom Brady\u2018s grandmother.\n\n\u201cDid you win five Super Bowls too?\u201d she asked Peyton while Facetiming with her famous grandkid. Ouch.\n\nOff-camera award winners\n\nAnnouncements during in the commercial break included LeBron James winning Best NBA Player and Serena Williams nabbing Best Tennis Player, both of which scored huge rounds of applause even as guests made quick bathroom or bar breaks.\n\nSerious Stewart\n\nJon Stewart was uncharacteristically serious when he presented the Pat Tillman Award for Service, and paused during his opening to allow the audience to cheer. \u201cIsrael \u2018DT\u2019 Del Toro looked me in the eyes and said one thing: \u2018Fear me bro,'\u201d Stewart said of his first meeting of the recipient.\n\n\n\n\u201cWhen he heard he was getting the award he texted and said \u2018holy cow, my phone is blowing up. Is this what it\u2019s like to be a celebrity?\u2019 Then moments later, he texted back and said \u2018blowing up\u2019 probably wasn\u2019t the right thing to say.\u201d\n\nSparking laughter from the crowd even during the emotional presentation, it soon fell into a quiet hush seeing the extent of DT\u2019s injuries, which burned over more than 80 percent of his body in an IED explosion in Afghanistan.\n\nDT\u2019s walk onto the stage to collect his award \u2014 and a hug from Stewart \u2014 earned him the first standing ovation of the night. And then he dropped the first F-bomb, saying: \u201cI will never f\u2014ing quit on you.\u201d And then he got the second standing ovation of the night.\n\nAlso Read: ESPYs 2017: Red Carpet Arrivals (Photos)\n\nLove for \u201cDunkirk\u201d\n\nDT\u2019s speech was followed by a special preview of \u201cDunkirk\u201d featuring Cillian Murphy to keep with the military theme of the segment. It\u2019s safe to say, that it secured a lot of movie ticket sales.\n\nSweating red carpet\n\nIt was hot, hot, hot in the city. With Los Angeles going through a heatwave, the normally steamy ESPYs red carpet was like a sweat box earlier in the day, with athletes and reporters melting in the sun. While the most frequently asked question at the Oscars and Emmys is \u201cwho are you wearing?\u201d at the 2017 ESPYs it was \u201cdo you have any water?\u201d\n\nCubs confusion\n\nWhen diehard Cubs fan Nick Offerman came out to present the Best Moment award to the Chicago curse-breakers everyone thought the team would accept the award \u2014 and seemed genuinely shocked when Bill Murray joined him instead.\n\n\u201c108 years of waiting is hardly a moment \u2026 108 years is momentum,\u201d the \u201cGroundhog Day\u201d actor said. Proving he really is a talented bartender, Murray then grabbed a bottle of champagne from a \u201cjanitor\u201d and opened it with a machete. If they were mystified before, no one guessed it was World Series star and \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d alum David Ross cleaning the floors. The trio made such a mess with their bubbly that real janitors had to come out to clean it up.\n\nJulian Edelman beats Manning at his own game \u2014 again\n\nWhen the Patriots came out to accept the award for Best Game, Edelman dropped a killer joke of his own. \u201cI never thought I\u2019d say this but Peyton Manning is kinda killing it \u2026 but we are indoors though,\u201d he said.\n\n\n\nSat in the audience, Manning looked very unimpressed with the jab \u2014 but giggling Katie Couric behind him found it hilarious.\n\n\n\nAlso Read: ESPN the Magazine Body Issue: See Julian Edelman, Javier Baez, Caroline Wozniacki and More Pose Nude (Photos)\n\nDance Cam fails\n\nThe ESPYs version of the Dance Cam planted Snapchat style lips on stars\u2019 faces \u2014 and proved that Aaron Rodgers shouldn\u2019t go on \u201cDancing With the Stars\u201d anytime soon. Talk about awkward moves \u2026 Michael Phelps had way more rhythm when it landed on him later and super imposed a football helmet on his head. \u201cDWTS\u201d could be another thing Phelps can beat Ryan Lochte at.\n\nJunior Jimmy V winner brings down the house\n\nThe Jimmy V Perseverance Award has gone to famous broadcasters like Stuart Scott and Craig Sager, but this year it was a 15-year-old cancer patient who got everyone in tears.\n\nJarrius \u201cJJ\u201d Robertson has turned into the sports world\u2019s favorite little New Orleans Saints and WWE fan thanks to his brave fight against liver cancer and multiple transplants. The pint-sized superstar is sharing the message of transplants through his endless energy and infectious smile, which he brought to the ESPYs stage. \u201cThere he is!\u201d said surprised guests as he strutted to the stage and quoted Jimmy V.\n\nJJ then thanked the Who Dat nation and Stephanie McMahon of the WWE. \u201cShe\u2019s much nicer in person than she is on TV,\u201d he quipped. Now that was a speech worthy of Scott or Sager.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got no make up left,\u201d one tearful audience member sobbed afterwards.\n\nAlso Read: Inside Aly Raisman, Julian Edelman, and the Black Eyed Peas' Pre-ESPYs Bash (Photos)\n\nLate arrivals\n\nSometime s the g ame doesn\u2019t start \u2019til the second quarter, and that was true for ESPN\u2019s NFL guru Adam Schefter, who came in with his family an hour into the show and played usher getting them comfortably seated for the remainder of the ESPYs.\n\nEmotional and thankful Berman\n\nAfter losing his wife in a car crash just a few months ago, there was ripple of sympathy in the audience when Chris Berman came out to pay tribute to late \u201cSportsCenter\u201d host John Saunders. Talking of Saunders losing his battle with cancer before introducing the ESPYs In Memoriam section, Berman\u2019s voice broke as he thanked everyone for the support after his wife\u2019s death.\n\nGallant performed a melodic song over footage of the sports greats lost this year \u2014 but it was Craig Sager and Arnold Palmer that prompted eruptions from the audience.\n\nSmooth jazz soundtrack\n\nHouse band Crown and the M.O.B. added some smooth jazz moves to the commercial breaks \u2014 and even the king of product endorsements Peyton Manning appreciated that they were more fun to listen to than insurance ads. \u201cKaraoke time,\u201d didn\u2019t quite get Steph Curry or Odell Beckham Jr. up singing to \u201cGin and Juice,\u201d however.\n\n\n\nVin Scully is the real mayor of L.A.\n\nIn the City of Angels a few miles from both Dodger Stadium and Hollywood, it\u2019s no surprise that the hometown audience adored Bryan Cranston\u2019s monologue on Vin Scully.\n\n\u201cVin Scully was summer \u2014 as refreshing as the smell of cut grass,\u201d the \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d actor said, recalling his first game listening to Scully, whom he dubbed everyone\u2019s \u201csurrogate father.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is my lifetime honor to present the Icon Award to the incomparable Vin Scully,\u201d he concluded.\n\n\n\nThe audience gave Vin a standing ovation and then squealed with delight when he delivered his signature line: \u201cHi everyone and a very pleasant good evening to you.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: ESPN the Magazine Body Issue Brought to Life in New TV Special\n\nBromance on the front row\n\nThey were utter rivals in Super Bowl XLIX when the Patriots snatched a victory from the Seahawks after a blown call by coach Pete Carroll, but Richard Sherman and Julian Edelman looked like best pals when they hugged it out and chatted on the front row during one break. Edels also seemed to be the most popular person with selfie-hunting young fans too, as he posed for pics with kids during breaks.\n\nMutual respect for Michelle Obama\n\nManning\u2019s announcement of Michelle Obama presenting the Arthur Ashe Courage Award left no one wondering about the political leanings of the crowd, which erupted into cheers, applause and yet another standing ovation as she took to the stage (yep, Mr. Clippers loved her too).\n\nObama looked just as moved when she introduced another female trailblazer, Eunice Kennedy Shriver, for her formation of the Special Olympics \u2014 describing its inception in Chicago in 1968 to the groundbreaking 2015 Summer Games in Los Angeles. Eunice\u2019s son, Tim Shriver, accepted the award, after diligently spending hours on the red carpet with Special Olympic athletes.\n\n\u201cOnce a great first lady, always a great first lady,\u201d he told Michelle, sparking the loudest scream of the night. \u201cMy mother would have loved you.\u201d\n\nSounding like a true politician like his uncle JFK, Shriver said: \u201cWe will not stop until there\u2019s true equality,\u201d earning a rousing applause worthy of a campaign rally. On the red carpet, Tim had told TheWrap that the current political reality made it even more important that we should be accepting of all different people.\n\nMeanwhile, the night before Special Olympics gold medalist Daina Shilts told TheWrap that she really hoped to share the stage with Obama \u2014 she later got her wish, and stood side-by-side with her icon.", "images":
