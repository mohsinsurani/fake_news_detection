Not pulling punches. We Beefin\u2019,\" Wendy's official Twitter account posted.\n\nThe mixtape drops now. Not pulling punches. We Beefin\u2019. pic.twitter.com/H1Rm1ODYC4 \u2014 Wendy's (@Wendys) March 23, 2018\n\nThe playlist, titled \"We Beefin',\" is now available on Spotify, Apple Music and Google Play. It has album artwork that features a single image of Wendy's signature square burger patty. The chain tweeted a preview of the art earlier this week.\n\nLyrics from the track \"Clownin',\" take direct jabs at McDonald's mascot, Ronald McDonald: \"You hide from funk / That's prolly why you go paint your face / My meals are great, people lining up like everyday / Leave you in shame, make you run back to Cirque du Soleil / That's cold game / But what you expect from tryna play / Won't say no names but you a clown / Get it, OK?\"\n\nAnother track titled \"Rest In Grease,\" calls out McDonald's broken ice cream machines: \"You No. 1? That's a joke / Why you ice cream machine always broke? / Why you drive-thru always slow? / Why you innovation just can't grow? / It's queen Wendy, need I say more?\"\n\nMeanwhile, the song \"Holding It Down,\" takes aim at Burger King with lyrics: \"The problem is you didn't recognize I give no clucks / So wrap it up, turn these chickens to rubber ducks / And BK, don't think that you got away / You copied my old menu and put it out on replay.\"\n\nTo make it clear these tracks weren't just aimed at any old restaurant, Wendy's even tweeted a Spotify link to the playlist directly at McDonald's. \"Don't sleep on this mixtape,\" the chain wrote with flame and burger emojis.\n\nHey Fam Hottest new rapper in the game Don't sleep on this mixtape. https://t.co/8GGxjfbeL0 \u2014 Wendy's (@Wendys) March 23, 2018\n\nWendy's has been steadily gaining praise among fans for its creative use of social media to troll its fast food rivals. In November, Wendy's slammed McDonald's over a Black Friday tweet that went awry. The chain also sent out a fiery tweet after McDonald's announced most of its locations would begin making its Quarter Pounders with fresh beef instead frozen patties. Wendy's has long prided itself on using fresh, never-frozen patties.\n\n\"So you\u2019ll still use frozen beef in MOST of your burgers in ALL of your restaurants? Asking for a friend,\" Wendy's tweeted earlier this month.\n\nSo, which chain really has the freshest beef now? Your move, McDonald's and Burger King.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201703/tdy_tren_mcd_170331_4.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_12/1327101/wendys-dis-track-today-180323-tease.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_12/1327101/wendys-dis-track-today-180323-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryanna Cappadona"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/food/wendy-s-drops-mixtape-tracks-aimed-burger-king-mcdonald-s-t125790", "title": "Wendy's drops mixtape with tracks aimed at Burger King, McDonald's", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/food/wendy-s-drops-mixtape-tracks-aimed-burger-king-mcdonald-s-t125790", "title": "Got beef?
