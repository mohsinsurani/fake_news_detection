Then stay seated! Just because the movie\u2019s over and your popcorn is finished doesn\u2019t mean that\u2019s all that\u2019s in store for you.\n\nPower Rangers, which hit theaters Friday, is following the Marvel Studios trend by featuring a little something extra.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a post-credits scene, so people should stay,\u201d the film\u2019s director, Dean Israelite, tells The Hollywood Reporter, adding, \u201cIt teased up the direction of what the next movie could be. For people that know the brand, it\u2019s super exciting. There are so many ideas we\u2019re kicking around in the direction of where the film leads you.\u201d\n\nAnd it looks like the film is hoping to morph toward a sequel by introducing a key character in the story about the Rangers. In the post-credits scene, the teacher in detention does roll call. And there\u2019s one person he can\u2019t find on the list: Tommy Oliver. The teacher repeatedly announces the name Tommy Oliver, and the camera cuts to a green coat sitting on an empty chair in detention.\n\nOliver is no stranger to Power Rangers fanatics. In the original Mighty Morphin Power Rangers TV series, the character was introduced as the Green Ranger, who is actually, at first, an enemy to the other Rangers while he\u2019s a new student at Angel Grove High School. In the franchise, the character has also had a varied amount of story development, including being elevated to being the White Ranger and becoming a love interest for the Pink Ranger. In fact, in the new film, the actor Jason David Frank (who played Oliver) appeared alongside original Pink Ranger actress Amy Jo Johnson in a cameo during the final battle.\n\nAs for the new Tommy, with the green coat in the scene, he will likely be the Green Ranger at the start. But wait a minute: The character doesn\u2019t necessarily need to be a he. And according to Dacre Montgomery, aka the new Red Ranger, the cast is campaigning for Oliver to be female.\n\nMontgomery tells THR, \u201cA lot of the cast and I have discussed that we think it should be a girl. It makes it even: three girls, three boys.\u201d\n\nHe adds that the scene is ambiguous and actually leaves the door open for this to happen.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s left blank. It\u2019s a cliff-hanger. Whoever you\u2019re going to drop into that position \u2014 whether it\u2019s a girl \u2014 it\u2019s inevitably going to create drama. It\u2019ll be interesting to drop that drama into it and see how we all relate to it and work with it,\u201d says the star.\n\nSo what do you think? Should the new Tommy Oliver be female? And who should play her?
