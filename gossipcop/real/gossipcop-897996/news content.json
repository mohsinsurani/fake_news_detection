The arresting officer in Mill's case was among the police officers the prosecutor's office has sought to keep off the stand because of credibility questions.\n\nThe DA's office also said it has a policy of generally not requesting more than six to 12 months for technical violations of probation and parole.\n\nBrinkley said in a lengthy opinion that jail time was warranted because during probation, Mill, 30, tested positive for opiates, got arrested in St. Louis and New York and made travel or performance plans without getting the required approval.\n\nMill's lawyers have asked the state Supreme Court to let him out on bail and to replace Brinkley as the presiding judge in the case.\n\nMill was charged in March 2017 with assault for an alleged fight in the St. Louis airport, charges the judge said were later reduced to summary offenses. He was then charged in August with felony reckless endangerment for allegedly driving an all-terrain vehicle in New York City, a matter resolved by \"a negotiated resolution\" through a diversionary program that required him to perform community service", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/2f860aa9bb0a968180b1376f3ed24e50be5cbfc1/c=211-0-3520-2488/local/-/media/2018/04/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636582883653992779-AP-MEEK-MILL-98883030.JPG?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f7e1242970c3364e7d8c720132bb597896e4fe25/c=0-190-3732-2298/local/-/media/2018/04/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636582883653992779-AP-MEEK-MILL-98883030.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f7e1242970c3364e7d8c720132bb597896e4fe25/c=0-190-3732-2298/local/-/media/2018/04/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636582883653992779-AP-MEEK-MILL-98883030.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/04/02/meek-mill-remain-behind-bars-during-appeal-judge-denies-bail-request/479919002/", "title": "Meek Mill to remain behind bars during appeal as judge denies bail request", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/04/02/meek-mill-remain-behind-bars-during-appeal-judge-denies-bail-request/479919002/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Meek Mill to remain behind bars during appeal as judge denies bail request", "description": "Meek Mill will remain behind bars while appealing a prison sentence after bail was denied on Thursday.", "site_name": "Associated Press", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f7e1242970c3364e7d8c720132bb597896e4fe25/c=0-190-3732-2298/local/-/media/2018/04/02/USATODAY/USATODAY/636582883653992779-AP-MEEK-MILL-98883030.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Meek Mill will remain behind bars while appealing a prison sentence after bail was denied on Thursday.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522623600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
