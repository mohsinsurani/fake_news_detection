Davidson claims that DSS investigated and found that both Evans and her fianc\u00e9, David Eason \u2014 with whom she shares Ensley \u2014 had marijuana in their system.\n\nDavidson also claimed that she has seen unusual bruises and marks on Kaiser on \u201cseveral occasions\u201d and alleged that Eason has used \u201cinappropriate and excessive discipline\u201d on her grandson, which included spanking the child with harsh force. In the documents, it was stated that Kaiser told his grandmother, \u201cNana, David punched me,\u201d making motions of being hit in the face.\n\nThe documents also allege that Evans, 25, has harassed Davidson with nasty text messages and the reality TV star has \u201csporadic mood swings where she screams and curses.\u201d\n\nEvans \u2014 who has bitterly battled with her mom, Barbara, over custody of her oldest son, Jace \u2014 released a statement to E! News in which she stated, \u201cOur lawyers are talking today. Doris made accusations but I can tell you that Barbara has a lot to do with them \u2026 Doris threw her own son under the bus by admitting that he has pending felonies and possibly on drugs. Her emergency filing was against me and Nathan Both \u2026 I can tell you that they are allegations, mostly driven by my mom. Our lawyers are working out a new agreement.\u201d\n\nIndeed, the documents indicate that Barbara expressed her concern over Kaiser\u2019s well-being and she referenced an incident in May in which both Kaiser and Jace, 8 \u2014 whom Barbara has custody of \u2014 were locked out of the house on a particularly hot day.\n\nDavidson has asked a judge to test Evans\u2019 hair follicles for drugs and also force her to undergo a psychological evaluation.\n\nThe Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teen Mom author exclusively revealed to Us Weekly that her mother won\u2019t be attending her September 23 wedding to Eason due to their ongoing battle over Jace. \u201cI can\u2019t forgive someone that\u2019s just not going to give me back my son, so, and it\u2019s still going on. It hasn\u2019t been resolved,\u201d she told Us in August. \u201cAnd if I had custody of him now maybe I would have invited her, but I\u2019m not at the moment.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jenelle-evans-2017-mtv-video-music-awards-custody-filing-28f94e1e-408e-425f-99d5-d59cd93eca26.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C1293px%2C678px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jenelle-evans-2017-mtv-video-music-awards-custody-filing-28f94e1e-408e-425f-99d5-d59cd93eca26.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C1293px%2C678px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-mom-2s-jenelle-evans-responds-to-emergency-custody-filing-by-exs-mom-w502119/", "title": "Teen Mom 2's Jenelle Evans Responds to Emergency Custody Filing By Ex\u2019s Mom", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jenelle Evans released a statement addressing the emergency custody filing submitted by the mother of her ex\u00a0Nathan Griffith over their son, Kaiser \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jenelle Evans Responds to Emergency Custody Filing By Ex\u2019s Mom", "description": "Jenelle Evans released a statement addressing the emergency custody filing submitted by the mother of her ex\u00a0Nathan Griffith over their son, Kaiser \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-mom-2s-jenelle-evans-responds-to-emergency-custody-filing-by-exs-mom-w502119/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:33:57+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jenelle-evans-2017-mtv-video-music-awards-custody-filing-28f94e1e-408e-425f-99d5-d59cd93eca26.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C1293px%2C678px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jenelle-evans-2017-mtv-video-music-awards-custody-filing-28f94e1e-408e-425f-99d5-d59cd93eca26.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C1293px%2C678px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-09-09T19:35:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:33:57+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jenelle Evans Responds to Emergency Custody Filing By Ex\u2019s Mom", "description": "Jenelle Evans released a statement addressing the emergency custody filing submitted by the mother of her ex\u00a0Nathan Griffith over their son, Kaiser \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jenelle-evans-2017-mtv-video-music-awards-custody-filing-28f94e1e-408e-425f-99d5-d59cd93eca26.jpg?crop=0px%2C113px%2C1293px%2C678px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504985700.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
