For about the first two-thirds of its running time, tonight\u2019s episode is another dour power hour, a Ghost of Christmas Yet to Come trip to a dismal future where the members of Team Flash are all either dead or broken. Somehow The Flash is able to pull out of this tailspin and rally, delivering a rousing and emotionally satisfying final act that rescues the episode from the depths of bleakness.\n\nBefore that happens, however, \u201cThe Once And Future Flash\u201d plays almost like a parody of the big-screen version of the DC Universe, that Zack Snyder world of oppressive, self-conscious gloom and humorless, damaged-goods heroes. Killer Frost escapes from STAR Labs, which Barry takes as a sign that this is the perfect time to travel to the future and collect intel on Savitar. (This is one time when Barry isn\u2019t actually being a bonehead: anytime is the perfect time, since he can always travel back to the exact moment he left. This is a concept people will have trouble with throughout the episode.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2024 he arrives in is, in Community parlance, the darkest timeline. The Flash has been missing for years, leaving villains like Mirror Master and the Top to run roughshod over Central City. Cisco is a shadow of his former self, deprived of his powers when Killer Frost froze off his hands (an effectively shocking moment). Wally is in a wheelchair, his spine snapped after facing Savitar alone. (So much for those super-healing powers, I guess.) Julian now works in a prison where he can look after the captured Killer Frost. Joe hangs around Iris\u2019s grave, having been abandoned by Barry. That would be Future Emo Barry, with his stringy hair and black wardrobe, holed up in the abandoned and trashed STAR Labs, living in the past.\n\nThis is all very depressing, but worse than that, it\u2019s (almost) meaningless. This future ceases to exists as soon as Barry gets back to his own time and starts changing things. Spending so much time here all but guarantees that Iris won\u2019t be killed at season\u2019s end, because we\u2019ve already seen the effects of that happening. Why waste the emotional impact of Joe standing over Iris\u2019s grave now? Only because it\u2019s not going to happen later.\n\nI said it\u2019s almost meaningless, because the effect it all has on 2017 Barry does make an impact. Sure, Barry has a bad habit of not learning from his mistakes and repeating them over and over, but seeing the way Future Emo Barry has abandoned Joe strengthens his resolve to never let that happen. This is Scrooge seeing the error of his ways and vowing to change, which makes me wonder why this wasn\u2019t scheduled as the Christmas episode.\n\nTo that end, 2017 Barry decides to stay long enough to repair the fractured Team Flash and take down Mirror Master and Top. This is where the episode really comes to life, and a lot of the credit is due to director Tom Cavanagh. He\u2019s already worn so many different hats on this show that stepping behind the camera was probably inevitable, and while he does a decent job with the bleak portion of the episode, it\u2019s probably no coincidence that the hour improves drastically as soon as we see what future HR is up to. (He\u2019s reading his romance novel to a crowd of appreciative women who are all eager to get in his pants. At least the future worked out for someone!)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nArranging the reunion of the surviving and able-bodied members of Team Flash is something Barry doesn\u2019t have to do. Again, from his point-of-view this is only one possible future; if he is successful in changing events, it will never come to exist. It still feels like the right thing to do, though, and the way it plays out, it\u2019s almost as if we\u2019re getting a glimpse of a Flash reunion special years from now. The battle with Mirror Master and Top gives us some freaky Inception-type visuals of bendy buildings as well as a look at the future Flash outfit when Emo Barry finally snaps out of and joins the fight. One thing it doesn\u2019t give us, that now feels way overdue, is Savitar\u2019s identity. In the end we\u2019re left with yet another tease as Savitar meets up with Killer Frost and removes his outer shell to win her trust. Who does she see? That will have to wait yet again. Ugh.\n\nStray observations", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_264,q_80,w_470/b79608df135ebc4b059a2cdad3a83176.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/kqnkjlylkf7tymsqmoqr.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/52a29fe0001de9a08e76ea6d559528e9.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/u0939doeuioaqhspkjyc.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/j59upeyynundqjvbmcwj.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/v4sckews2f3bzf0ztbkf.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/aqhdzcldymb9mkltfhxh.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/rnxqtvv6advgidzfs6am.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f2b6295902a8e0a7c4d168840e7b3d51.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/eti2h1r4wg0bqxctxenl.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/muaaluj2wznfomol9ero.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.avclub.com/the-flash-meets-his-future-self-in-the-darkest-timeline-1798191210", "title": "The Flash meets his future self in the darkest timeline", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "keywords": "TV, The CW, The Flash, Grant Gustin, Recap, The A.V.
