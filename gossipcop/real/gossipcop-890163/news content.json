Bless her furry heart... \u2014 Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) October 30, 2017\n\n\u201cMy @cookiedabooboo is gone. Bless her furry heart,\u201d Frankel, 46, wrote.\n\nShe later paid tribute to Cookie, who was 17, with a sweet photo and message.\n\nMy furry first baby, May ur next life be as beautiful as this one was. Thank u for the love u gave to me &my peanut. See u on the other side pic.twitter.com/a2bBlc1RDy \u2014 Bethenny Frankel (@Bethenny) October 30, 2017\n\n\u201cMy furry first baby, May ur next life be as beautiful as this one was. Thank u for the love u gave to me & my peanut. See u on the other side,\u201d she captioned the picture.\n\nFrankel first alerted her fans to Cookie\u2019s condition on Saturday, noting that the dog had suffered a 45-minute-long seizure.\n\nHours before announcing Cookie\u2019s death on Monday, Frankel wrote, \u201cMy baby had 2 more seizures last PM. My heart is broken.\u201d\n\nCookie was a familiar face to \u201cReal Housewives\u201d fans and, much like Frankel\u2019s other dogs, Biggy and Smallz, has a sizeable following on both Twitter and Instagram. Her relationship with Frankel\u2019s now 7-year-old daughter, Bryn, helped inspire the reality star\u2019s 2014 children\u2019s book, \u201cCookie Meets Peanut.\u201d\n\nWe\u2019re sending our well-wishes to Frankel and Bryn during this difficult time in their lives.\n\nTODAY\u2019s editorial team thought this item was news-worthy \u2013 and we hope you do, too.
