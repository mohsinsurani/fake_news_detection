Production company Emmett/Furla/Oasis is expected to seek new distribution, but the movie is unlikely to make its December 15 release date.\n\nFormer Entourage cast member Kevin Connolly directed the mob drama, and the project also features Travolta\u2019s wife Kelly Preston as Victoria Gotti.\n\nWhile the reasons for the sale remain unclear, this isn\u2019t the first obstacle Gotti has encountered throughout its production. A number of actors have been connected to the project throughout its years of development, including Al Pacino, Lindsay Lohan, and Anthony Hopkins. The film began production in July 2016.\n\nUpdate: On Wednesday, John Travolta, Kevin Connolly, and the producers of Gotti spoke out against reports that Lionsgate dropped the film. According to a new report from Deadline, Travolta persuaded Lionsgate to sell back the film in order to give it a wider release.\n\n\u201cAll these reports are saying the studio \u2018dropped\u2019 Gotti and John Travolta, that\u2019s 100 percent false,\u201d said Keya Morgan, executive producer of the film, via Vulture. \u201cThe studio never dropped it! Lionsgate said, \u2018We want this movie. It has Oscar buzz.\u2019 We had to beg them for it.\u201d\n\nTravolta reportedly shopped around for distributors who would give the film a larger release than the minimal plans that Lionsgate had for the biopic. \u201cThat is the simple explanation for this,\u201d Travolta said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t dropped. It wasn\u2019t easy to get Lionsgate to give it up. They said no, twice, and I literally begged them to reconsider and they finally and generously let it go.\u201d\n\nMorgan vehemently denied claims that Gotti\u2019s delayed release might be for any reason other than an attempt at a wider opening. \u201cThis has nothing to do with any sex scandal at all,\u201d he said. \u201cThis has nothing to do with Scientology. Or Trump. Or Harvey Weinstein! Get over it! We just got more money, it\u2019s a great film and we\u2019re putting it in more theaters.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71467969/scoot_full_interview_thumb_SITE.0.jpeg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71467894/1238113320.0.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71467995/1431161170.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Z8lAmzPy3Z_0EXoOWJc_i8aDMjE=/0x0:3000x2125/1200x800/filters:focal(1260x823:1740x1303)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/57870819/112069346.jpg.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71468851/southerncharmreunionpt1_bravo.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VHY0aiHHnbsdu3DQZ70-TG0sb2A=/0x278:3000x1849/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9817305/112069346.jpg.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71467760/mets_getty_ringer.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71468047/1431154193.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VHY0aiHHnbsdu3DQZ70-TG0sb2A=/0x278:3000x1849/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9817305/112069346.jpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Halliwell", "Rachel Lindsay", "Jodi Walker", "Kevin O'Connor", "Chris Vernon", "Ryen Russillo", "David Shoemaker", "Kazeem Famuyide", "Katie Baker", "Dec"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/12/5/16740234/gotti-pulled-john-travolta", "title": "John Travolta\u2019s \u2018Gotti\u2019 Biopic Pulled 10 Days Before Release", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Ringer", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ringer/", "published_time": "2017-12-05T20:15:07-05:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-05T20:15:07-05:00"}, "author": "Kate Halliwell", "style-tools": "https://www.theringer.com/style/community/723/2ae0ed8f83bedc27f0c403be20a55bf2/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "Lionsgate has sold the film back to its producers", "og": {"description": "Lionsgate has sold the film back to its producers", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VHY0aiHHnbsdu3DQZ70-TG0sb2A=/0x278:3000x1849/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9817305/112069346.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Gotti Press Conference", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "The Ringer", "title": "John Travolta\u2019s \u2018Gotti\u2019 Biopic Pulled 10 Days Before Release", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/12/5/16740234/gotti-pulled-john-travolta"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.theringer.com/movies/2017/12/5/16740234/gotti-pulled-john-travolta", "title": "John Travolta\u2019s \u2018Gotti\u2019 Biopic Pulled 10 Days Before Release", "description": "Lionsgate has sold the film back to its producers", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/VHY0aiHHnbsdu3DQZ70-TG0sb2A=/0x278:3000x1849/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9817305/112069346.jpg.jpg", "alt": "Gotti Press Conference"}, "site": "ringer"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/8991995/favicon-196x196.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#67c385"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512432000.0, "source": "https://www.theringer.com", "summary": ""}
