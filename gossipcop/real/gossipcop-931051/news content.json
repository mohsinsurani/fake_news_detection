The vegan objected to Saint Nick slipping a sable under the tree and wondered: \"Am I saying that I\u2019m gonna hook up with Santa if he buys me all this stuff?\u201d\n\nWith Jimmy Fallon's encouragement to \"do it however makes you comfortable,\" Cyrus performed her reworked version.\n\n\u201cSanta baby, I don\u2019t need any fancy jewelry \u2013 not me,\" she sang. \"I\u2019ve got something else in mind, Santa baby, and I don\u2019t need your presents tonight.\"\n\nMore: Miley Cyrus smoking weed again: 'My mom got me back on it'\n\nMore: Miley Cyrus praises Liam Hemsworth for rescuing her animals, talks of their 'regular' life\n\nWhy not? Well Cyrus is an independent woman happy to declare she can \"buy my own damn stuff!\"\n\n\"Santa baby, I've got a baller car of my own, no loan,\" she continued. \"I bought it all by myself, Santa baby, with zero help from Elf on the Shelf.\"\n\nBut Cyrus did have some requests for Mr. Claus, inline with the Time's Up and #MeToo movements.\n\n\u201cListen, Santa, to what I say: A girl\u2019s best friend is equal pay,\" she performed. \"So, stop interrupting me when I talk, and don't text me pictures of your... \u201d\n\n\u201cSanta baby, I\u2019d love to know my (butt) won\u2019t get grabbed at work,\" she added, \"by some ignorant jerk.\u201d\n\nCyrus wasn't the only one to rework holiday lyrics on late night Thursday. The team at \"Late Night with Seth Meyers\" revised the much-debated \"Baby, It's Cold Outside.\"\n\n\"I really can't stay,\" writer Amber Ruffin belted out.\n\n\"I fully respect that,\" her male counterpart said, before the two took a bow.\n\n\"'Baby, It's Cold Outside' 2018, everybody!\" a beaming Meyers told his audience.\n\nMore: Melania's trees, Christmas song drama and more: The top meltdowns over the holiday season\n\nMore: Here are the lyrics to 'Baby, It's Cold Outside,' the Christmas song facing a radio ban", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/21/USAT/5363efc0-baf1-4ded-ad10-01eeccfe54cf-NUP_185535_1145.JPG?crop=398,299,x346,y50?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/21/USAT/5363efc0-baf1-4ded-ad10-01eeccfe54cf-NUP_185535_1145.JPG?auto=webp&crop=692,389,x136,y30&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/21/USAT/5363efc0-baf1-4ded-ad10-01eeccfe54cf-NUP_185535_1145.JPG?auto=webp&crop=692,389,x136,y30&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Jensen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/12/21/miley-cyrus-santa-baby-lyrics-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon-mark-ronson/2385721002/", "title": "Miley Cyrus revamps 'Santa Baby' lyrics for today: 'A girl\u2019s best friend is equal pay'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/music/2018/12/21/miley-cyrus-santa-baby-lyrics-tonight-show-jimmy-fallon-mark-ronson/2385721002/life/music", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Miley Cyrus revamps 'Santa Baby' lyrics for today: 'A girl\u2019s best friend is equal pay'", "description": "\\", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/12/21/USAT/5363efc0-baf1-4ded-ad10-01eeccfe54cf-NUP_185535_1145.JPG?auto=webp&crop=692,389,x136,y30&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "\\", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/rPdXgCq_Rlg?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/j84Iu0yMGbo?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1545350400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
