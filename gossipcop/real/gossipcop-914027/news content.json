She took my chocolate huge hearts that I gave from my perfume, and broke them and made place cards for the table for our Valentine\u2019s Day dinner,\u201d the KKW Beauty mogul, 37, said in a video shared on her Instagram Story Wednesday evening. \u201cMy mom is so resourceful.\u201d\n\n\u201cHappy Valentine\u2019s Day everybody from my loved one to yours,\u201d the Cleveland Cavaliers power forward, who is expecting a baby boy with Khlo\u00e9, said on his girlfriend\u2019s Instagram Story.\n\nRounding out the guest list were Richards\u2019 husband Mauricio Umansky, longtime KarJenner pal Faye Resnick and her husband Everett Jack Jr., and three of Thompson\u2019s close friends.\n\nAt the dinner table, which was decorated with red rose petals and boxes of chocolate, the group sang West\u2019s 2010 song \u201cRunaway\u201d in unison. And that wasn\u2019t the only musical moment of the night.\n\nThe host commanded her karaoke machine as she recruited Richards and Resnick for renditions of songs such as \u201cBuild Me Up Buttercup\u201d by The Foundations and \u201cBaby One More Time\u201d by Britney Spears.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: A Vision in White!
