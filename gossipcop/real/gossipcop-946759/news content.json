He called & said \u201cmonster ratings.\u201d Be a man Jimmy! \u2014 Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) June 25, 2018\n\nFallon responded on Twitter with a nod to the plight of young immigrants caught up in administration policies.\n\n\"In honor of the President\u2019s tweet I\u2019ll be making a donation to RAICES in his name,\" Fallon said, referring to a nonprofit organization that provides free and low-cost legal services to immigrant children, families and refugees in Texas.\n\nIn honor of the President\u2019s tweet I\u2019ll be making a donation to RAICES in his name. \u2014 jimmy fallon (@jimmyfallon) June 25, 2018\n\nThe Refugee and Immigrant Center for Education and Legal Services, or RAICES, is the largest immigration legal services provider in Texas.
