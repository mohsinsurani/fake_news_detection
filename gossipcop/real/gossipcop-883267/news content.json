If that's true, we're pretty sure the Kardashian empire will never end! USA TODAY\n\nWhy confirm baby news the old-fashioned celebrity way (through a publicist), when there's a season of reality TV to promote?\n\nKim Kardashian, 36, who has danced around confirming a third baby on the way via surrogate for months, confirmed the news by way of a teaser trailer for Season 14 of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, released Thursday.\n\nThe mom of two is shown revealing the news via Facetime to sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\n\nSeason 14 is gonna be wild. Tune in this Sunday!!! #KUWTK pic.twitter.com/rnpIdGiNyK \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) September 28, 2017\n\n\"What happens every time I say, 'Guess what?'\" asks Kim. \"The person's pregnant?\" Khlo\u00e9 asks. That's when Kim announces: \"We're having a baby!\"\n\nIn an April episode of KUWTK, Kim revealed she was pursuing surrogacy after she was told a third pregnancy was not in the cards: She suffered from placenta accreta in her first pregnancy, a painful and potentially life-threatening condition that makes giving birth difficult because the placenta is attached too deeply to the uterine wall.\n\nMore: Reports: Kylie Jenner is pregnant\n\n\"I'm definitely leaning more towards I want to try ... After talking to Kanye, I think I always knew that surrogacy was an option, but I didn't think it was that realistic of an option, and now I feel like that's my reality. I feel like surrogacy really is the only other option for me,\" she said at the time.\n\nIn June, unnamed sources told People and E! Online the couple paid a surrogacy agency nearly $70,000 to find a surrogate, who will be paid about $45,000 for 10 months of carrying a pregnancy, with a bonus of $5,000 for each possible twin or triplet child.\n\nKardashian's half-sister, Kylie Jenner, 20, is also expecting her first child. According to People and TMZ, sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is pregnant, too.\n\nKardashian and Kanye West married in May 2014. They are parents to North, 4, and Saint, 20 months.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5593378243001_5593375490001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/339b54c72b61481106e2136673ad917259df2ee4/c=0-89-1992-1215/local/-/media/2017/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636422104090520161-GTY-844587080-93621828.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5588025831001_5588006569001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/339b54c72b61481106e2136673ad917259df2ee4/c=0-89-1992-1215/local/-/media/2017/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636422104090520161-GTY-844587080-93621828.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrea Mandell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/09/28/kim-kardashian-finally-confirms-shes-expecting-third-child-kanye-west/713880001/", "title": "Kim Kardashian finally confirms she's expecting a third child with Kanye West", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/09/28/kim-kardashian-finally-confirms-shes-expecting-third-child-kanye-west/713880001/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian finally confirms she's expecting a third child with Kanye West", "description": "She confirmed it in a trailer for her reality show, of course.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/339b54c72b61481106e2136673ad917259df2ee4/c=0-89-1992-1215/local/-/media/2017/09/28/USATODAY/USATODAY/636422104090520161-GTY-844587080-93621828.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "She confirmed it in a trailer for her reality show, of course.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506553200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
