Watch the trailer below.\n\nSet between \u201cCaptain America: Civil War\u201d and the just-released \u201cAvengers: Infinity War\u201d (so much war!), the film follows Scott Lang/Ant-Man as he deals with being placed under house arrest in further proof that no good deed goes unpunished. Michael Douglas, Bobby Cannavale, Judy Greer, and Michael Pe\u00f1a will all be reprising their roles.\n\nThey\u2019ll be joined by Michelle Pfeiffer, Laurence Fishburne, Hannah John-Kamen. Peyton Reed will be returning to the director\u2019s chair for \u201cAnt-Man and the Wasp,\u201d which Disney will release on July 6.\n\nSign Up: Stay on top of the latest breaking film and TV news!
