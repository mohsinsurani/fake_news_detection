Over the weekend, the Dance Moms star updated her followers on her recovery process, sharing a photo on Instagram of the scars and stitches from her recent operations.\n\n\"After the 2nd surgery, My back is finally on the mend,\" Miller wrote on Instagram.\n\n\"I just wish the top section & bottom would hurry along too! I had 52 staples perfectly aligned and now a bunch of crazy stitches are holding my neck & lumbar region together!\" the dance instructor captioned the photo.\n\nAs seen in the picture, Miller has an incision running all the way from her neck to her lower back. And while the majority of the cut has already healed over, stitches from the second surgery, at the top and bottom of her back, are still fully visible.\n\nIn April, a few weeks after her first surgery, Miller shared a photo of her post-op scar, and those \"52 staples perfectly aligned,\" on Instagram. \"This gives a whole new meaning to being stabbed in the back!\" she joked in the caption.\n\nAnd in early June, Miller explained on Instagram that she had undergone the second operation.\n\nMiller first underwent emergency spinal surgery in April after experiencing severe neck pain and weakness in her arm.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAs SELF wrote previously, Miller's pain eventually progressed to paralysis, which then required an emergency surgery to relieve pressure on her spinal cord.\n\nThough her symptoms were initially thought to be caused by a spinal infection, anorthopedic spine surgeon Hooman Melamed, M.D., who is treating Miller, told SELF previously that further testing suggested that she actually had Burkitt lymphoma, a rare type of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Burkitt lymphoma affects the lymph system, a part of the body's immune system. Because lymph tissue is found all over the body, this type of cancer can start pretty much anywhere, but it's often found in the stomach, the American Cancer Society explains.", "images": ["https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.64f3bdc15b1f321829f9f30c7853a1469f469d71.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/632cb2ff04a9708c3441d38f/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/633e080b717525ceacc174b7/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.22fddcfca2f2de42711a84ec66a5157a9995d8ab.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/6320d75381fa4227806ada9b/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631f3986d8abd65405905973/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/632b6e82bfd16c6baa203ff6/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6333690d31aaaeb99d6e6888/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/63407b5238618ec3e4a542ad/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/633f23a9e1963cdc0acd737e/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/63346bced427ebd0501be34e/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/633dd85d904ed8c6214f83c5/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a49f3ee9fbc4733481306/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-683170296.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/632373ff74314293c0851a1b/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/abby-lee-miller-back-surgery-scar-photo", "title": "After a Second Back Surgery, Abby Lee Miller Shows Off Her Healing Progress on Instagram", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "After undergoing a second back surgery to treat her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Abby Lee Miller wrote on Instagram that she is \"finally on the mend.\"", "id": "5b3a4518ee9fbc4733481304", "keywords": "abby lee miller,cancer,pain management,news,leukemia and lymphoma,lymphoma,leukemia & lymphoma", "news_keywords": "abby lee miller,cancer,pain management,news,leukemia and lymphoma,lymphoma,leukemia & lymphoma", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b3a4518ee9fbc4733481304", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"After undergoing a second back surgery to treat her non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, Abby Lee Miller wrote on Instagram that she is \\\"finally on the mend.\\\"\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a49f3ee9fbc4733481306/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-683170296.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a49f3ee9fbc4733481306/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-683170296.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She's \"finally on the mend.\"", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "After a Second Back Surgery, Abby Lee Miller Shows Off Her Healing Progress on Instagram", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/abby-lee-miller-back-surgery-scar-photo"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-07-02T17:34:15.803Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-02T17:34:15.803Z", "author": "Andrea Park"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "She's \"finally on the mend.\"", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/5b3a7098ee9fbc473348132b/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/abby-lee-miller-recovery.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "After a Second Back Surgery, Abby Lee Miller Shows Off Her Healing Progress on Instagram"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530552855.803, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
