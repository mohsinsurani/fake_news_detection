First, the emotional singer received a standing ovation from her famous peers after debuting her single \u201cCry Pretty\u201d at the Academy of Country Music Awards in April. When she sang the moving ballad about overcoming obstacles at the CMT Music Awards on June 6, the crowd took to its feet once more.\n\nBut even though 2018 has been a fabulous year for her so far, Carrie just noted in a new interview that last year wasn\u2019t one of her best. \u201cA lot happened in 2017 during my \u2018off year.\u2019 I love it when people say, \u2018You took a year off.\u2019 I\u2019m like, \u2018You know, I had this shoot and this thing, and I was writing this and doing that.\u2019 There was always so much to do, but it was also a very soul-searching year for me,\u201d she told Redbook Magazine.\n\nThe 35-year-old added, \u201cThere were some personal things that happened. And I had the accident and all of that to get through\u2026 and just life. Life is full of ups and downs, and I might have had a few more downs than ups last year.\u201d\n\nJust eight months ago, Carrie didn\u2019t know if she\u2019d ever sing again. In November, the country star tripped and fell on a step at her Nashville home, breaking her wrist, chipping her tooth, and injuring her face so badly that she needed more than 40 stitches. Weeks later, she confessed in a letter to fans that she was \u201cnot quite looking the same\u201d and felt uncertain about \u201chow it\u2019s all going to end up.\u201d Overcome by insecurity, Carrie largely stayed out of sight \u2014 for five long months.\n\nBut now Carrie\u2019s done hiding. \u201cCarrie\u2019s finally moved on,\u201d an insider recently Life & Style. \u201cShe\u2019s over talking about the accident in interviews and wants to let her music do the talking from now on. Friends have noticed Carrie is singing better, stronger and with more heartfelt conviction than ever before. She realizes her accident could have been far more catastrophic, leaving her unable to walk, sing, or worse. So she thanks God she\u2019s got her life back.\u201d\n\nCarrie credits her doctors and makeup team for helping her feel physically normal again. \u201cShe had been insecure about how she\u2019d appear to fans, at times wondering if she\u2019d ever return to performing live at all,\u201d explained the insider. \u201cBut she gains more confidence each day.\u201d\n\nFan support has helped the process. While some accused the performer of over-hyping her injuries, the insider notes that \u201cthe public\u2019s generally positive reaction to Carrie\u2019s return has been a big part of her healing.\u201d\n\nBut the biggest factors in her emotional recovery have been her son and husband. \u201cHer family really pulled Carrie through,\u201d the insider said of Isaiah, 3, and newly retired hockey player Mike Fisher, 38. Carrie and Mike had been going through a rough patch at the time of the accident: \u201cTheir differing personalities, interests, and schedules were really affecting the marriage,\u201d said the insider. Carrie\u2019s strong Christian faith helped save the union, a source says, and Mike\u2019s help with her recovery bonded them like never before. \u201cIn many ways,\u201d noted the insider, \u201cthe accident has proved to be a blessing in disguise because it brought them closer, and they\u2019ve been able to spend more time with each other.\u201d\n\nAfter months of uncertainty, Carrie is looking forward to her future. She\u2019s searching for a new, larger family home in the Nashville area, and pals have been buzzing that she\u2019s expecting again. \u201cGoing forward, Carrie has vowed to balance career and family better,\u201d said the insider. \u201cShe will continue to record and tour, but Mike and their family will be her main priorities.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/carrie-underwood-life-accident.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/carrie-underwood-life-accident.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TITANIC_300x490_7_11r.gif?fit=300%2C490&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/carrie-underwood-life-accident.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Closer Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/carrie-underwood-life-back-accident-162219/", "title": "Carrie Underwood Talks Soul-Searching After Her Scary Accident Last Year", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Music icon Carrie Underwood\u2019s return to the stage in 2018 to get her life back following her scary accident has been nothing short of triumphant.
