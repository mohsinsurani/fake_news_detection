{"url": "https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a20764717/james-corden-revealed-who-bolted-from-carpool-karaoke/", "text": "Carpool Karaoke is the signature bit from James Corden\u2019s Late Late Show, and the likes of everyone from Bruno Mars, to Stevie Wonder, to then-First Lady Michelle Obama have joined him for ride-along sing-alongs. But apparently one star found the prospect of participating so off-putting that he \u201cbolted\u201d from the set.\n\nDuring a Late Late Show segment with Steven Tyler, Corden admitted that \u201880s rock icon Bryan Adams abandoned a Carpool Karaoke taping, apparently after learning that other musicians would be a part of it. Still, Corden made sure to note that the incident did nothing to dampen his affection for Adams and his music.\n\nWhat happened was, for the anniversary of Back to the Future, we were gonna do a sort of, \u201cBest of the \u201980s\u201d Carpool Karaoke. And we had booked \u2013 in a DeLorean \u2013 and we booked Bryan Adams, right, to come and do the thing, and we were very excited. I love Bryan Adams, he\u2019s got hits for days, he\u2019s terrific. I don\u2019t know that Bryan\u2019s management had told Bryan that it was a sort\u2019ve collaboration with lots of other singers from that time period.\n\n\n\nBryan walked in, seen the list of other people that have done it, turned around, walked, and got in his car and left. I\u2019ve never seen \u2013 I\u2019ve never heard from him. He just bolted. He was gone.\n\nGabrielle Bruney Gabrielle Bruney is a writer and editor for Esquire, where she focuses on politics and culture.
