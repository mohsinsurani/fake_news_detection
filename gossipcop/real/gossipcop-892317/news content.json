And the premise he and co-writer Jim Taylor devise seems like a perfect projectile to hit those targets: a near future where scientists have devised a way to shrink human bodies to 5 inches tall, a development the scientists say can solve the world\u2019s ills of overpopulation and diminishing resources.\n\nWe experience the process vicariously through the Safraneks, Paul (Matt Damon) and Audrey (Kristen Wiig), a nondescript middle-class couple in Omaha. The Safraneks aren\u2019t unhappy, really, but are less than satisfied with their jobs and lives. When they attend a high-school reunion and see an old friend, Dave (Jason Sudeikis), who has been reduced down to action-figure size, they start thinking about a major change.\n\nPaul and Audrey go to Leisure Land, a \u201cdownsized\u201d suburbia, where they get the spiel from a happy couple-turned-QVC salespeople (played by Neil Patrick Harris and Payne\u2019s \u201cCitizen Ruth\u201d star, Laura Dern, in a gem of a scene). Once a couple are downsized, they\u2019re told, their meager savings will buy the McMansion of their dreams. After a sales rep (Niecy Nash) runs them through the deal as if she were selling a timeshare, Paul and Audrey buy in.\n\nBut after the elaborate shrinking process \u2014 a sequence where much of the movie\u2019s whimsical visual style is deployed \u2014 Paul discovers there are downsides to downsizing. He soon learns there are hustlers in the small world just like in the big one, like his hard-partying neighbor Dusan (Christoph Waltz), who repurposes smuggled Cuban cigars for small people. There also are scroungers, like Dusan\u2019s cleaning woman, Ngoc Lan Tran (Hong Chau), a Vietnamese dissident who was shrunk against her will and is now aiding the small community\u2019s hidden underclass.\n\nIn this image released by Paramount Pictures, Hong Chau, left, and Matt Damon appear in a scene from \"Downsizing.\" On Monday, Dec. 11, 2017, Chau was nominated for a Golden Globe for best supporting actress in a motion picture for her role in the film. The 75th Golden Globe Awards will be held on Sunday, Jan. 7, 2018 on NBC. (Paramount Pictures via AP)\n\nPayne and Taylor could have plenty to say about the voracious haves and the striving have-nots, something that might resonate as the world\u2019s ever-ravenous 1 percent takes all the pie. But the movie can never get past lazy stereotypes about the rich and the immigrant poor, particularly in Chau\u2019s inexplicably Golden Globe-nominated performance as Ngoc Lan, which viewers may find merely annoying or an offensive Asian caricature.\n\nWhen the movie starts heading into cut-to-the-bone satire, Payne veers off into shallower waters. This is especially true of the finale, a tour of the first small colony in Finland, a sequence that feels like the result of someone programming a computer to replicate a Wes Anderson movie.\n\nBut of all the miscalculations Payne makes on the stumbling journey of \u201cDownsizing,\u201d the biggest may be casting Damon as Paul. Sure, Damon has become the icon of the American Everyman, the normal guy who embodies red-white-and-blue values so well that our government has spent exorbitant amounts of money to rescue him in three films (\u201cSaving Private Ryan,\u201d \u201cInterstellar\u201d and \u201cThe Martian\u201d).\n\nHere, though, his brand of normal comes out as bland disinterest, his aw-shucks personality a dull mirror of ourselves. One wonders why Paul chose to be shrunk in the first place, considering that his character\u2019s ambitions, like those of the movie he\u2019s in, were already so small.", "images": ["https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/AZDbAO8rkg8kwVJxZBSpufsTgqc=/111x74/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/Z5QXOYXIUFGW5CKYRYKZ3L4BHE.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/pf/resources/svg/sltrib-logo.svg?d=313", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,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", "https://www.sltrib.com/pf/resources/svg/trib_masthead.svg?d=313", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1602919493094198&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/HX9DeztGP1zRP9ag9nIlbib7K0w=/1200x630/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CTFXQYU7MNDY5E2CI72E2C75RI.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/lmhiCuD4SoWSFQ8DzYFUFFofWH0=/60x60/s3.amazonaws.com/arc-authors/sltrib/812ed2c8-76c2-42e1-b690-3a87ab025bce.png", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/u3GPc2de0dEz8ofjji-Kvri6te0=/111x74/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/IABVGLGYWFCW7EYLBJ4QGQLKY4.jpg", "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/U1prq8K4A0I20SNrFxInn6ASRcM=/111x74/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/sltrib/SRMI3KIXOBGJJOZN7YNTV4AKSU.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.sltrib.com/resizer/HX9DeztGP1zRP9ag9nIlbib7K0w=/1200x630/arc-anglerfish-arc2-prod-sltrib.s3.amazonaws.com/public/CTFXQYU7MNDY5E2CI72E2C75RI.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sean P.
