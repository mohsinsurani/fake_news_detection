I know that your bridesmaids adore you and are thrilled that you are getting married, but I\u2019m pretty sure that they don\u2019t want a personalized gift that says bridesmaid. We all know what happens to those gifts, you use them on the wedding day, you love them for a bit and then they get tossed \u2013 because what are you really going to do with one wine glass that says \u201cMike + Jenny\u2019s Wedding\u201d. So I\u2019ve scoured the millions of creative listings on Etsy to bring you a list of what I think are the 15 best bridesmaids gifts ever that don\u2019t have anything about your wedding printed on them, lol. The best part is that all of these gifts are well under $40, so they won\u2019t break the bank if you have to buy for 10 gals. I\u2019ve also put together a list of great items that you can search for yourself, just in case my ideas don\u2019t tickle your fancy:\n\nSweatpants or something cozy like a robe\n\nCoffee mug + coffee\n\nJewelry dish\n\nCustom notebook\n\nNecklace, bracelet, or earrings\n\nSpecialty hair ties\n\nNon-wedding clutches + tote bags\n\nWine stoppers + wine\n\nCandles\n\nSpecialty soaps, bath salts and lotion\n\nUnique planters\n\nPersonalized iPhone cover\n\nCalligraphy Starter Kit, since everyone is obsessed!\n\nEtsy Wedding Shops\n\nWe have built an amazing directory of the best wedding related shops on Etsy! All the items shared here are also listed in our directory plus about 400+ more! You can shop by wedding theme or item \u2013 check it out!", "images": ["https://somethingturquoise.com/assets/images/icons-post/gift.png", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gem-soap1.jpg", "https://static.tapfiliate.com/5e6ade4959e67.jpg?a=66672-d4051b&s=716016-1f9826", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Custom-notebooks.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/jewelry-dishes-monogramed.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gold-air-plant-pots.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Craft-File-Sidebar-Ad.png", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/weddings10_300x250_5_2-2.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/custom-coffee-mugs-bridesmaids.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/coordinates-necklaces.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pineapple-iphone-6-case.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/pinterest-wedding-card.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/assets/images/logo.png", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/best-bridesmaids-gifts-ever-featured.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/afabulousfete-tofrom-stamp.jpg", "https://assets.pinterest.com/images/pidgets/pinit_fg_en_rect_white_20.png", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/initial-bracelet.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/custom-bridesmaids-sweatpants.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/gemstone-wine-toppers.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/champagne-strawberries-candles.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/calligraphy-starter-kit.jpg", "https://www.tqlkg.com/image-7621423-12013949", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/bridesmaids-hair-ties.jpg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/custom-floral-tote-bag.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/e4349bce0da892adbb753b4c2ea2a8d7?s=96&d=mm&r=pg", "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/sequin-bridesmaids-bags.jpg"], "top_img": "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/best-bridesmaids-gifts-ever-featured.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://somethingturquoise.com/2015/07/09/15-best-bridesmaids-gifts-ever/", "title": "The 15 Best Bridesmaids Gifts Ever From Etsy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "We've scoured the millions of listings on Etsy to bring you this list of the 15 most awesome, unique bridesmaids gifts ever - check it out!", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The 15 Best Bridesmaids Gifts Ever From Etsy", "description": "We've scoured the millions of listings on Etsy to bring you this list of the 15 most awesome, unique bridesmaids gifts ever - check it out!", "url": "https://somethingturquoise.com/2015/07/09/15-best-bridesmaids-gifts-ever/", "site_name": "Something Turquoise", "image": {"identifier": "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/best-bridesmaids-gifts-ever-featured.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 385}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/SomethingTurquoise", "published_time": "2015-07-09T10:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2016-06-23T19:23:07+00:00"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://somethingturquoise.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/cropped-New-Favicon-scissors-270x270.png", "verification": "65ceb5cee05ef1dc17d13aa2ec98e689", "fo-verify": "1d8e0253-a5e1-4021-88ab-423c24f40aae"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1436396400.0, "source": "https://somethingturquoise.com", "summary": ""}
