She was so calm,\u201d the mother of five said of Kylie, who shares Stormi with rapper Travis Scott. \u201cIt was really exciting,\u201d she said before adding, \u201cI delivered the baby! I delivered her. I pulled her out.\u201d\n\nThe famous matriarch also shared that, unlike most about to give birth, Kylie didn\u2019t feel much pain.\n\nJenner said, \u201cShe just kept saying, \u2018I don\u2019t feel any pain,\u2019 and you\u2019d see the contractions like crazy and she would say, \u2018I\u2019m just not feeling it,\u2019 and I would say, \u2018This is really weird.\u2019\u201d\n\nPeople magazine first reported Jenner\u2019s pregnancy news back in September 2017, but the young reality star didn\u2019t personally confirm them until after she gave birth.\n\nKylie shared an Instagram post with fans as well as a 10-minute video of her pregnancy journey on YouTube.\n\n\u201cI knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress-free and healthy way I knew how,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\u201d\n\nBut Kylie isn\u2019t the only sister who has had a unique baby delivery.\n\nBack in 2009, when older sister Kourtney gave birth to her first child with ex-boyfriend Scott Disick, Mason, the star famously pulled out her own baby during the delivery.\n\nIn a 2016 interview with Today Extra, she revealed that it was her then boyfriend Disick who had filmed the birth that was aired on the family\u2019s reality show.\n\n\u201cScott was filming it for our own purposes, like for a home movie,\u201d Kourtney explained. \u201cThe birth of my son was such a beautiful experience that I really wanted to share it with people because it was my child. I remember being so terrified to give birth because you see in movies everyone is screaming and it was so crazy and my experience was amazing. I just felt something in me wanted to share that with people.\u201d\n\nMiddle sister Khloe, who recently gave birth to her first child, True, often makes fun of her sister\u2019s epic delivery.\n\nDuring Kourtney\u2019s second birth to her daughter, Penelope, Khloe joked that her sister just \u201cpulls out her own children.\u201d\n\nKris Jenner is now a grandmother to nine grandkids.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Fox News and is republished here with permission.", "images":
