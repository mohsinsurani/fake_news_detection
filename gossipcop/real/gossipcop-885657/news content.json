A post shared by Jenna Dewan Tatum (@jennadewan) on Oct 7, 2017 at 9:21pm PDT\n\nDuring the show, according to Entertainment Tonight, Channing Tatum was in the crowd watching his wife reunite with her former boss onstage.\n\nVideos surfaced on YouTube of Jackson performing \u201cRhythm Nation\u201d with the group of her previous dancers, some of which date back to her Rhythm Nation Tour, as well as her introducing those dancers.\n\n\u201cWhen I was a baby, my brothers were always working, \u201d Jackson told the crowd, \u201calways going on tour, and I was so close to them. I missed them so much. It was sad for me. I missed that sense of family, that bond. I started my career when I was seven years old, and I was fortunate enough to be able to sing with my brothers and my sisters. We were all together, so I got that sense of family, that bond, back.\n\n\u201cSeveral years later, when my solo career took off I was about 19 years old. It was a sad time for me \u2014 it was sweet and sour. The sadness, that family, that sense of family, that bond, was gone for me again. And it was at that moment that I decided to create a family of my own. I became very close to those who danced with me but even closer with who danced on tour with me. We vacationed together, we went out together, I went to their families\u2019 house, I got to know their parents. \u2026\u201d\n\nJackson then introduced each dancer, whom she called \u201cthe kids,\u201d one by one. Watch the full 17 minutes here.\n\nIn May, Dewan Tatum appeared on Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen where she divulged that she owes everything in her career to Jackson, though she hadn\u2019t yet met Jackson\u2019s new baby son. \u201cI\u2019m not really in touch with Janet,\u201d she said, \u201cbut when I see her \u2014 we\u2019ve seen each other at various parties or we actually emailed a little while ago. \u2026 I kind of owe everything to Janet. She was my dream job, she was my first big dance job and because of her, I met certain people who then led me to others, then led to acting then led to here.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Janet-Jackson-performs-Dubai-2016-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Janet-Jackson-performs-Dubai-2016-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=623&crop=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/Janet-Jackson-performs-Dubai-2016-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Armstrong"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/janet-jackson-la-show-jenna-dewan-tatum-former-back-up-dancers-reunion-7990479/", "title": "Jenna Dewan Tatum and Former Backup Dancers Reunite With Janet Jackson at L.A.
