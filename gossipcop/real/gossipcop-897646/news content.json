In just three seconds ...Baby One More Time, which turns 20 this year, announced the arrival of a new superstar: the then 16-year-old ex-Mouseketeer from Kentwood, Louisiana, Britney Jean Spears. Along with its equally iconic high school-set music video it re-turfed pop, kickstarting an entire sound (think funk-tinged R&B grooves mixed with Abba melodies), sweeping aside the dregs of grunge (sorry, Bush) and US heartland rock (bye, Hootie & the Blowfish), revitalising pop radio and MTV in the process, before cementing its songwriter and co-producer Max Martin as one of modern music\u2019s most influential exponents. In the space of just three minutes and 31 seconds, Spears launched millennial teen pop, fusing family-friendly, girl-next-door fun with good old fashioned controversy, forging a template for those who followed.\n\nWithout it, there would by no Christina Aguilera, no Katy Perry, no Charli XCX; Taylor Swift would probably still be singing country songs, and Eminem \u2013 who arrived in 1999 \u2013 would not have had as much to rail against. Released in the wake of Alanis Morissette\u2019s hugely successful 1995 album Jagged Little Pill and its litany of imitators, it presented a different angle to the prevalent idea of female angst; this was gloriously OTT teen girl longing, encapsulated by a lyric \u2013 \u201cMy loneliness is killing me\u201d \u2013 that feels depressingly evergreen. \u201cThe whole song is about that stress that we all go through as teens,\u201d Spears tells me. \u201cI knew it was a great song. It was different and I loved it, [but] I don\u2019t think you can anticipate how a song is going to be received.\u201d\n\nIn a Sliding Doors-esque moment that could have changed the world as we know it, \u2026Baby One More Time very nearly didn\u2019t get written at all, with the song\u2019s melody bubbling up as Martin was drifting off to sleep. Having hauled himself out of bed to his nearby dictaphone, he sketched out the song. \u201cI remember listening back to [the tape] after [the song] blew up and you can hear me sort of go: \u2018Hit me baby one more time\u2019, then I hear myself say, Yeah, it\u2019s pretty good,\u2019\u201d the notoriously interview-shy Martin told Swedish journalist Jan Gradvall in 2016. Martin, convinced he\u2019d written an R&B song (\u201cPop music with a flavour \u2013 what we call R&B in Sweden, what you guys [in America] say is pop,\u201d he said in 1998), sent the song, then called Hit Me Baby (One More Time), to TLC who rejected it. \u201cI was like: \u2018I like the song but do I think it\u2019s a hit? Do I think it\u2019s TLC?\u2019 \u2026 Was I going to say \u2018Hit me baby one more time\u2019? Hell no!\u201d said T-Boz in 2013.\n\nWhile TLC interpreted the lyrics as alluding to domestic violence, they actually represented Martin\u2019s attempts at American slang, believing \u201chit me\u201d could seamlessly replace \u201ccall me\u201d. The song was then offered to fellow Swede, Robyn, whom Martin had already worked with on two US top 10 singles (Do You Know (What It Takes) and Show Me Love, both released in 1997), but again nothing came of it. According to Tim Bower\u2019s 2012 book, Sweet Revenge: The Intimate Life of Simon Cowell, the song had one further dalliance with a pop act other than Britney. The story goes that after hearing Martin\u2019s demo of what had now been renamed \u2026Baby One More Time, Cowell demanded he have the song for his latest boyband, UK rabble Five. Martin had already co-written Five\u2019s debut single, Slam Dunk (Da Funk) alongside his mentor, the late Denniz Pop, but declined Cowell\u2019s request, saying it had already been earmarked for Spears. \u201cYou\u2019re mad,\u201d Cowell is reported to have said. \u201cNo one can be successful with a name like that.\u201d As a last gasp attempt, Cowell offered Martin a new Merc 500SL in return for the song. \u201cIt costs \u00a395,000,\u201d he added.\n\nIt was \u2026Baby One More Time that convinced Spears of the merits of pop. She initially saw herself as making \u201cSheryl Crow music, but younger\u201d, while Larry Rudolph, an entertainment lawyer friend of Spears\u2019s mum Lynne who had been tasked with getting her signed (he\u2019s now her manager), had her record a clutch of songs originally recorded by Toni Braxton. It was those recordings that lead to auditions for Mercury, Epic and Jive (the first two labels said no; she signed with the latter) which included Spears covering Whitney Houston\u2019s version of I Will Always Love You. With the more R&B-leaning early material not working, and with a clause allowing Jive to terminate her contract after 90 days if they felt an album wasn\u2019t on the horizon, A&R Steve Lunt approached Martin, who had already delivered success for Jive\u2019s boyband the Backstreet Boys. A meeting was set up with Spears in New York. \u201cI was pretty young at the time, so I was nervous,\u201d she says, \u201cbut he was so nice and put me right at ease.\u201d For Martin, his song had finally found its home.\n\nMaxed out: Spears and Martin, 2017. Photograph: Lester Cohen/WireImage\n\nFrom New York, Spears de-camped to Martin\u2019s Cheiron studios in Stockholm to start recording. \u201cI remember being so in awe of Stockholm,\u201d Spears says. \u201cI was out there for, like, 10 days, but we were so busy in the studio I didn\u2019t have time to go out and explore on that first trip.\u201d The song\u2019s co-producer Rami Yacoub remembers Spears as \u201cvery shy and super sweet \u2013 I mean she was a kid and we had no idea there was a beast of an artist lurking under that innocent look\u201d. The sessions were intense, with four of the album\u2019s five singles recorded in that time. In 2001, Martin referred to the Cheiron sound as \u201cdirect, effective, we don\u2019t show off\u201d, words reiterated by Yacoub. \u201cA song that sounds simple is not simple to make. It\u2019s all about the taste and making sure you don\u2019t add more than what the song needs.\u201d\n\nFor Spears, working with perfectionists suited her. \u201cI really respect that when I\u2019m working with him,\u201d she says. \u201cI think Max is a genius. It all just came together and felt right. In my opinion Max is the greatest songwriter of all time.\u201d\n\nAnother person to witness firsthand this studied effortlessness was Nana Hedin, a backing vocalist who had previously worked with Denniz Pop on songs by Dr Alban, whose 1992 hit It\u2019s My Life soundtracked a Tampax advert in the UK. Pop recommended Hedin to Martin, who brought her onboard for \u2026Baby One More Time. \u201cI remember I thought the song was for teenagers but the production was filled with a grown-up attitude and sounds that I really liked,\u201d she says. \u201cI was so impressed by how a guy like Max could write lyrics that got into the hearts and spoke to the teenage thinking.\u201d Occasionally, Hedin would record her backing vocals first, before the artist arrived, but with \u2026Baby One More Time Spears\u2019s vocals were already recorded. \u201cI tried to sound exactly like her,\u201d she laughs. \u201cIt was hard, but a lot of fun. I\u2019m like a parrot in many ways. I try to get the same vibe and use the exact same pronunciation as the artist. In one harmony, each take is different; I sing very high, in another I use powerful belting, the next I\u2019m whispering and sometimes I even pinch my nose for a sharper sound.\u201d\n\nWith Britney\u2019s vocals recorded in March, and the song finished shortly after (\u201cIt took probably around two to three weeks to finish,\u201d says Yacoub), Spears headed out on a summer tour, taking in 26 shopping malls. Aware that they had a potential hit on their hands, Jive sent reps out to meet with the influential US radio programme directors ahead of the song\u2019s October release. \u201cThe label guy brought in a video featuring Britney rehearsing dance moves to the song,\u201d remembers Clarke Ingram, then operations manager and program director of New York\u2019s Top 40 radio station WPXY. \u201cThis had the desired effect of showing me that Britney had star quality, in addition to having a potential hit record. We went to lunch afterwards, and I committed to adding the song at that time.\u201d In fact, Ingram is pretty sure he was the first person to play the song on US radio. \u201cNo other station would have heard it any earlier, and I know of no station that played it before we did.\u201d For Ingram, \u2026Baby One More Time represented the holy grail: a song pop radio could fully own. \u201cWe\u2019d been through an alternative cycle in the early to mid-90s, and something of an R&B cycle after that,\u201d he explains. \u201cBritney was among the first big artists in a pop cycle that began in the late 1990s and continued into the early 2000s. The song hit the centre of the Top 40 audience, and it proved that by its performance, both on the air and off.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s so lucky: Britney in 1999. Photograph: ACTION PRESS/REX/Shutterstock\n\nThe song sold 500,000 copies on its first day of release in the US, eventually peaking at No 1. It reached No 1 in every single country it charted in, and was 1999\u2019s biggest-selling song in the UK with 1.4m copies sold. A megastar had been created seemingly overnight. \u201cI don\u2019t think we understood what we had done,\u201d Martin said in a 2008 Swedish radio documentary. \u201cI remember sitting in the studio when they called me to let me know that my song had made No 1 in the USA \u2026 I had so much going on I didn\u2019t really grasp the meaning of it\u201d. He even forgot to tell Yacoub. \u201cMax walked into the studio one day while I was working and said: \u2018Hey man, by the way, we are No 1 in America,\u2019\u201d he recalls. \u201cI asked him when it had happened and he said: \u2018Three weeks ago.\u2019 We really didn\u2019t focus on charts, we just kept working.\u201d Even celebrations were muted. \u201cIt was on a Tuesday, I believe: an early dinner, a cigar, and to bed at 11pm as we had work the next day.\u201d\n\nAn iconic song needed an iconic video. Unfortunately, director Nigel Dick\u2019s original concept was deemed a dud by Spears. \u201cI wrote an idea which sucked, so the label put me back on the phone with Britney who told me she wanted to make a video where she was stuck in a classroom thinking about boys and we took it from there,\u201d Dick writes on the harangued-sounding FAQ section of his website. He also states the school uniform look, augmented by plaited bunches and bare midriff, was Spears\u2019s idea too. What seems relatively tame now caused uproar in a bubblegum pop era that, via shows like MTV\u2019s popular Total Request Live, was being fed directly into family homes.\n\nThe video, an instant pop culture moment that gave Spears all-important tabloid notoriety, also fused in the public consciousness with David LaChapelle\u2019s controversial 1999 Rolling Stone cover shoot featuring Spears lying on her childhood bed in her underwear clutching a Teletubby. Suddenly, the now turbo-charged teen pop genre had its flag bearer, one whose identity \u2013 sweet southern belle in the video for soft-focus follow-up single Sometimes; red PVC-clad dominatrix in the \u201cnot that innocent\u201d Oops!\u2026I Did It Again visual \u2013 was malleable enough to, at least initially, be everything all at once. How does Spears feel about the song almost 20 years later? \u201cWow, that went quick. It was such a fun and crazy time, it was a bit of a blur.\u201d\n\nBritney Spears plays Open Air Theatre, Scarborough, Friday 17 August; touring to 1 September", "images":
