I\u2019m more than sorry for the mistakes I have made,\u201d Miller began in a lengthy post on Sunday, January 21, via Instagram. \u201cMy world flipped upside down when I had to enter prison. I did so with grace, the stories you read about me been a princess are untrue. I have made friends with both inmates and staff, I\u2019ve tried to better myself, participated in anything offered to me and I am a better person for this experience.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cAll the press stories and speculation are not entirely correct however, I am feeling hopeful but no dates have been confirmed at this time. I am feeling great and ready to turn over a new leaf thank you so much to everyone for your support especially my nearest and dearest I love you all \u2764\ufe0f ( and yes this is me in prison )\n\n#abbyleemiller #abbylee #dancemoms#dance #aldc.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, The Abby Lee Dance Company owner, 51, was sentenced in May 2017 for bankruptcy fraud and bringing $120,000 worth of Australian currency into the United States without reporting it.
