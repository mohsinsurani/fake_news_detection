Is this the supermodel taking a page out of her sister Kim Kardashian's book?\n\nThe supermodel went sans bra to LAX, leaving her breasts exposed by the bright flashes of the paparazzi cameras. The pants revealed a nude-colored pair of briefs underneath and her long legs.\n\nThe Keeping Up With The Kardashians model seems to have gotten her inspiration from her older sister, Kim Kardashian, who is often wearing revealing clothing and daring ensembles.\n\nKendall tucked her see-through pants into a pair of beige heeled Yeezy ankle boots, which Kim Kardashian has also been spotted doing recently. She also appeared to have gone without makeup for her travels.\n\nKendall was flying to Nice for the annual Cannes Film Festival, according to Daily Mail.\n\nThe model made her way to a car waiting upon her arrival before heading off to the luxury 5-star Eden Roc Hotel in Antibes.\n\nalways been an OG #TBT A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 18, 2017 at 9:20am PDT\n\nA post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 18, 2017 at 9:20am PDT\n\nKendall Jenner teases her saucy lingerie as she lands in Nice for Cannes Film Festival appearance https://t.co/gF2R2SMPKV \u2014 Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) May 19, 2017\n\n\u2014 Daily Mail Celebrity (@DailyMailCeleb) May 19, 2017\n\nSo, Kendall Jenner wore see-through pants to the airport https://t.co/dIngwhOmCS pic.twitter.com/IlAl7QkiOz \u2014 Who What Wear (@WhoWhatWear) May 19, 2017\n\n\u2014 Who What Wear (@WhoWhatWear) May 19, 2017\n\nThe reality star also started a line with her sister called Kendall and Kylie.

Kendall has been showing up on red carpets looking confident and glamorous.\n\nThe Estee Lauder model certainly has not been afraid to show off her body recently. Kendall wore a La Perla Haute Couture dress made of some thread and a few less than 100,000 crystals.\n\nThe designer gown showed off quite the view of the 21-year-old's backside. Her gown was definitely one of the highlights of the event.\n\nA post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 2, 2017 at 8:57am PDT\n\nEarlier in the day on Thursday, Kendall Jenner shared a throwback photo of herself wearing an Adidas t-shirt with pigtails and a missing front tooth.\n\nalways been an OG #TBT A post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 18, 2017 at 9:20am PDT\n\nA post shared by Kendall (@kendalljenner) on May 18, 2017 at 9:20am PDT\n\n[Featured Image by Mike Coppola / Staff / Getty Images]", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/28fd1ecd-acc0-48fc-be3b-21a0f5ef3d90.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/24774fc25d8eabdc10ed03eabe81d7f9?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4230622/kendall-jenner-nude-outfit-airport-met-gala-gown/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Wears Nude See-Through Outfit To The Airport After Barely-There Met Gala Gown", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kendall Jenner Wears Nude See-Through Outfit To The Airport After Barely-There Met Gala Gown", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4230622/kendall-jenner-nude-outfit-airport-met-gala-gown/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kendall Jenner Wears Nude See-Through Outfit To The Airport After Barely-There Met Gala Gown", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-09-07 09:19:47Z", "section": "Fashion"}, "description": "Kendall Jenner Wears Nude See-Through Outfit To The Airport After Barely-There Met Gala Gown", "keywords": "Fashion", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504775987.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
