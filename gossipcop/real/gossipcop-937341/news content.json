If you didn't, it was because said screaming got so loud you went momentarily deaf.

The styling is perfect, the vocals are on point, the choreography is exceptional, and the visuals are beyond \u2014 watch the video below:\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nIt's an angsty dramatic affair, building on the themes and love/love lost storylines the band have been developing in their discography thus far. Take the song's lyrics in the chorus, for example:\n\nLove you so bad, love you so bad\n\nMold a pretty lie for you\n\nLove it\u2019s so mad, love it\u2019s so mad\n\nTry to erase myself and make me your doll\n\nI'm so sick of this fake love, fake love, fake love\n\nI'm so sorry but it's fake love, fake love, fake love\n\nAs well as all sorts of creepy fairground rides and boarded-up rooms that, per SPIN, \"reflect dishonesty and disillusionment,\" there's also a huge pile of Snickers and actually that's amazing?? Where can I get a room full of sneakers??\n\nYouTube\n\nAnd there are big fireballs and flooding at various points, but it's fine because the band is fine! (Wait, did someone say \"Fire,\" though?!) In fact, the only folks who got burned are their competition. Zing!\n\nP.S. BTS will perform \"Fake Love\" again during an appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show next week, in case this just isn't enough for you.\n\n", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bts-abs-fake-love-billboard-1526872201.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.217xh&resize=1200:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/assets/icons/Instagram.svg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bts-abs-fake-love-billboard-1526872201.jpg?resize=480:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bts-abs-fake-love-billboard-1526872201.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.754xh;0,0.217xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Rees", "Deputy Editor Of News", "I M The News Director Here At Cosmopolitan.Com", "I Could Really Use A Cup Of Tea Right Now."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/a20767369/bts-fake-love-2018-billboard-music-awards/", "title": "BTS!
