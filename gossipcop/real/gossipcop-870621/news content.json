In fact, like many popular series finales, there was a wedding. No, Kylie didn\u2019t tie the knot with a rumored boyfriend or anything \u2014 rather, on the finale episode, she tied the knot with her BFF, model Jordyn Woods. Well, kind of.\n\nWe already knew that Kylie and Jordyn have quite the bond. \"I actually feel like I'm in a full relationship with Kylie,\" Jordyn said in an earlier teaser for the show. \"There are different types of relationships \u2014 we're definitely in one. Not necessarily sexual, but definitely emotional. It's draining sometimes.\"\n\nAnd then things went to the next level in the season finale. While in South America, momager Kris Jenner expressed her concern that there might be some co-dependency between the two. But Kylie and Jordyn talked it out and evaluated their friendship, with the duo even revealing some news to Kris.\n\n\"You know me and Jordyn have a special connection,\" Kylie said. \"Since you know, it's been a few years now, we thought we should just take this to the next level. We're going to do a little ceremony.\"\n\n\"Ceremony?\" Kris inquired. Which Jordyn responded with, \"It's our wedding day.\"\n\nAnd sure enough, Kylie and Jordyn had a commitment ceremony in front of Kylie\u2019s assistant, Victoria, Kris, as well as an alpaca or two. \u201cDo we need to get this annulled after?\u201d Kris asked. \u201cThere\u2019s no prenup.\u201d (Since it doesn't look like there was a marriage license signed or anything, we're thinking they\u2019re in the clear. Don\u2019t worry, Mama Kris.)\n\nJordyn said during the ceremony, \"I vow to always be there for you, through thick and thin. In this life and after.\" Kylie also shared her vows, \"I promise to encourage you, inspire you, love you, through all the good and bad times.\"\n\nThe two really have been there for each other over the years. Kylie has posted plenty of Instagrams about her love for Jordyn. Kylie and Jordyn have been there for each other during hard times, too, including the death of Jordyn's father. So while we don't know much about the legality of the ceremony, it's clear that Kylie and Jordyn are committing to be BFFs for years to come with this friendship wedding.\n\nCheck out a clip from the episode below:\n\nContent This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRelated: Kylie Jenner\u2019s Shaman Spilled Some Serious \u201cT\u201d About Her Love Life", "images": ["https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bfddc4b45a9c7864e75e57/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/kylie-lede.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6335a7ee8611297b17473509/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63247853c9f3a82503992bfb/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63397fc942ae4e4fa7da20d8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bfddc8994165653114afac/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kylie-fb.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633c63963d918e54c4fd37ca/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bfddc8994165653114afac/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kylie-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kara Nesvig"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kylie-jenner-jordyn-woods-wedding", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods Had a Commitment Ceremony on \u201cLife of Kylie\u201d Finale", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "In the season finale of \u201cLife of Kylie,\u201d Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods held a commitment ceremony and swapped friendship vows.", "id": "59bfd63860721e78d6db7235", "keywords": "life of kylie, kylie jenner,jordyn woods", "news_keywords": "life of kylie, kylie jenner,jordyn woods", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59bfd63860721e78d6db7235", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In the season finale of \u201cLife of Kylie,\u201d Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods held a commitment ceremony and swapped friendship vows.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bfddc4994165653114afaa/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/kylie-tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bfddc4994165653114afaa/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/kylie-tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "They swapped friendship vows.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bfddc8994165653114afac/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kylie-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods Had a WEDDING on \u201cLife of Kylie\u201d Finale", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kylie-jenner-jordyn-woods-wedding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-18T14:54:09.385Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-18T14:54:09.385Z", "author": "Kara Nesvig"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "They swapped friendship vows.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59bfddc8994165653114afac/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/kylie-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Kylie Jenner and Jordyn Woods Had a WEDDING on \u201cLife of Kylie\u201d Finale"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505746449.385, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
