Zendaya and Tom Holland bumped into a statue of the title character from their 2017 movie Spider-Man: Homecoming while hanging out in Los Angeles on Thursday, March 29.\n\nThe low-key couple stepped out together for an afternoon walk that included a stop at Golden Apple Comics on Melrose Avenue. They stopped to snap a quick photo outside of the store with the statue while showing off their best web-shooting poses.\n\nBoth movie stars kept it casual during the afternoon outing, with Zendaya wearing a white T-shirt and cuffed pants, and Holland donning a gray tee and faded jeans. They also rocked matching black Converse Chuck Taylor All Star high-top sneakers.\n\nThe Greatest Showman actress and the British actor are both rumored to star in the 2019 sequel to Spider-Man: Homecoming. He will reprise his role as the superhero, while she will return as Peter Parker\u2019s classmate Michelle \u201cMJ\u201d Jones.\n\nUs Weekly confirmed in July 2017 that Zendaya and Holland were officially dating, though they both laughed off the news on Twitter at the time. \u201cWait wait\u2026my favorite is when it says we go on vacations together HA! I haven\u2019t been on a vacation in years! hbu @TomHolland1996???\u201d she tweeted. He replied, \u201c@Zendaya Does the press tour count?\u201d\n\nThe \u201cSomething New\u201d singer continued to play coy the following month. \u201cWe are friends,\u201d she said in Variety\u2019s Power of Young Hollywood issue. \u201cHe\u2019s a great dude. He\u2019s literally one of my best friends.\u201d\n\nIn December, a source close to Zendaya told Us exclusively that Holland met his girlfriend\u2019s family \u201cand they love him.\u201d The insider added of the pair, \u201cThey are still seeing each other. It\u2019s been about a year.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bgus_1189826_001_zendaya-tom-holland-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C192px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bgus_1189826_001_zendaya-tom-holland-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C192px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/zendaya-tom-holland-run-into-spider-man-statue-in-l-a/", "title": "Zendaya, Tom Holland Run Into Spider-Man Statue in L.A.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "\u2018Spider-Man: Homecoming\u2019 costars Zendaya and Tom Holland were spotted hanging out in Los Angeles on Thursday, March 29 \u2014 see the photos", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Seeing Double!
