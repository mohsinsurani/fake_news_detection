Affleck called his colleague's actions unacceptable, but many Twitter users crudely reminded him that he was no better with his sketchy past. When a user brought up Hilarie Burton's accusation that Affleck groped her on camera on TRL in 2003, others began sharing the video of the incident, making it go viral.\n\nThe actor soon released a statement, saying that he was sincerely asking for Ms. Burton's forgiveness after he acted inappropriately towards her. The controversy did not die down, though. Makeup artist Annamarie Tendler revealed that the actor inappropriately touched her during a Golden Globes party in 2014 and was also asking for a public apology. A televised interview of Affleck flirting with Canadian TV host Anne-Marie Losique also went viral. She said, though, that nothing \"improper\" happened even though she was sitting on the actor's lap.\n\nAmidst all the hoopla, Garner has kept her silence, preferring to stay out of the limelight and focus on their kids. The couple previously announced their separation in June 2015. Affleck, however, continued to live on the same property as Garner to co-parent their three children: Violet, 11, Seraphina, 8, and Samuel, 5. Last Halloween, they went trick-or-treating with the kids in Malibu. They were photographed accompanying the little ones while collecting candies in the neighborhood.\n\nE! News reports, though, that Garner is actually very annoyed with the whole situation. The actress is allegedly doing her best to show their children that everything is all right, but she is frustrated with her ex-husband.\n\n\"[She] is very annoyed because it just means more attention on her and the kids as a result of Ben's actions,\" a source claimed. \"She tries to shield them from any and all publicity and scrutiny. She's taking her kids to school and to all of their activities. As far as they know nothing has changed and all is well. That is always her goal but she's been pretty frustrated with him.\"", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/image/14/64/146481_a_66_66.jpg",
