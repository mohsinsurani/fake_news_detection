By a whisker, Spielberg wins it.\n\nIf you\u2019re a fan of the 2011 Ernest Cline best-seller, you wouldn\u2019t use \u201cbanality,\u201d but you\u2019d have to concede \u201cfamiliarity\u201d as an acceptable substitute. We\u2019re back in the realm of Young Adult dystopia, in this case (as revised by screenwriter Zak Penn, working with co-adapter Cline) the miserably overcrowded year 2045 in Columbus, Ohio. There, our Young Hero, Wade, played by Tye Sheridan, lives a life the way millions of his fellow citizens are living it. They\u2019re hooked on their virtual-reality devices, and wired for hours and hours at a stretch into the multistrand worlds of the OASIS (Ontologically Anthropocentric Sensory Immersive Simulation), created by the late tech genius played, thank God, by Mark Rylance.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe story is \u201cCharlie and the Chocolate Factory,\u201d digitized. The sweetly mad inventor has hidden clues to three keys inside the OASIS, and whoever secures all three becomes heir to a massive fortune. Much of \u201cReady Player One,\u201d and the artistic reason for Spielberg\u2019s involvement, concerns the ever-shifting parameters and rules and environments within the OASIS. For an hour, \u201cReady Player One\u201d is terrific fun with a necessary ominous edge. At its heart is a lovelorn teen boy looking for a real connection. Wade\u2019s gaming avatar, a sleek, blonde, tattooed, boy-band-looking dude named Parzival, longs to know the supercool Art3mis in the real world, where she is plain ol\u2019 supercool Samantha, played by Olivia Cooke.\n\nIf the whole of \u201cReady Player One\u201d were as fluid and exciting as the first action showcase, we\u2019d have a classic. Driving the DeLorean from \u201cBack to the Future,\u201d Wade/Parzival learns the secret to winning the dizzying championship auto race. From there it\u2019s on to the next world, the next race for the next key. The forces of corporate evil conspire against Wade and, eventually, his OASIS posse. Ben Mendelsohn portrays the sniveling face of adversity, and he makes for a surprisingly ineffectual antagonist. Or maybe I\u2019m at the point in my life where I want Rylance to play every available supporting role, not just one or two.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe movie runs 140 minutes, which feels overgenerous for the amount and the quality of the narrative at hand. Spielberg juices it, flinging the audience between virtual worlds, and between virtual and real ones. The visual referencing is happily relentless. The holy hand grenade from \u201cMonty Python and the Holy Grail\u201d flies by for a cameo; so does King Kong and \u201cThe Breakfast Club\u201d and Chucky from \u201cChild\u2019s Play\u201d and famous emblems of Spielberg\u2019s own movies.\n\nFor a longer section, \u201cReady Player One\u201d enters a sly re-creation of \u201cThe Shining.\u201d There, Wade\u2019s cohort Aech (don\u2019t want to give away the performer; it\u2019s a bit of a spoiler) runs afoul of the blood-gushing elevator and the twins and the beautiful woman in the tub who turns out to be a decaying crone, this time for laughs.\n\nSo it goes. In the later stages of the story, we\u2019re stuck with routine complications and challenges posed by the Mendelsohn character and his ferocious aide played by the infinitely more charismatic Hannah John-Kamen. Spielberg\u2019s control of pacing, rhythm, action dynamics and tonal juggling is so astute that the story of Wade never quite gets lost in all the fly-by jokes and references. Sheridan\u2019s highly skillful, as is Cooke.\n\nBut there\u2019s a big difference between a movie content to surf a tsunami of nostalgia, and science fiction sturdy enough to invent tomorrow\u2019s nostalgia, today. Lest we forget, \u201cE.T.,\u201d \u201cClose Encounters of the Third Kind,\u201d \u201cA.I.\u201d and \u201cMinority Report,\u201d to name four of the director\u2019s achievements, sampled all sorts of established literary and screen classics. \u201cReady Player One\u201d is a different and more disposable diversion. It\u2019s like a visualization, however immersive and impressive, of movie trivia night down at the local bar.\n\nBut as I say: By a whisker, Spielberg wins the race against his own material.\n\nMichael Phillips is a Tribune critic.\n\nmjphillips@chicagotribune.com\n\nTwitter @phillipstribune\n\n[ RELATED: At South by Southwest, a sneak preview of 'Ready Player One' wows the fans ]\n\n[ Before 'Ready Player One,' the Washington Post: Michael Phillips on Steven Spielberg's newspaper drama ]\n\n[ 'Isle of Dogs': Wes Anderson's desolate canine tale of loyalty ]", "images": ["https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/zoF5M3bZvpqao42kMx6DEvGD7Zs=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/92p_pX7_-XsRY7WKx28FZv68Vg0=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(764x25:774x35)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/QRN2U57E7JDVBGZH56WEVUINOQ.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/fFM32zJj3LUbI8Avasgg6Ud6src=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(1726x449:1736x459)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/UC56ICML7IUM5D4SMJO75KLKN4.jpg", "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/gsLHPb_o1onaWXBIlOUqWs-ZsQo=/1440x1080/filters:format(jpg):quality(70):focal(701x13:711x23)/cloudfront-us-east-1.images.arcpublishing.com/tronc/7H7KR55BMZFMVCNR6CVNWLMOEI.jpg", "http://www.chicagotribune.com/pf/resources/icons/Menu_Icon.svg?d=87", "https://static.themebuilder.aws.arc.pub/tronc/1657752787005.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/zoF5M3bZvpqao42kMx6DEvGD7Zs=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364-story.html", "title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "meta_data": {"language": "English (United States), en-US", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "content-id": "4OTFJYKKOBBRRHD7QYDPVYZIGY", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=383137151, app-argument=http://www.chicagotribune.com/deeplinkid4OTFJYKKOBBRRHD7QYDPVYZIGY", "description": "Even with banal material, a master's visual assurance transcends the cliches in this science-fiction adventure starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Mark Rylance", "twitter": {"description": "Even with banal material, a master's visual assurance transcends the cliches in this science-fiction adventure starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Mark Rylance", "title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/zoF5M3bZvpqao42kMx6DEvGD7Zs=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "site": "@chicagotribune", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "og": {"description": "Even with banal material, a master's visual assurance transcends the cliches in this science-fiction adventure starring Tye Sheridan, Olivia Cooke and Mark Rylance", "title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "image": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/resizer/zoF5M3bZvpqao42kMx6DEvGD7Zs=/1200x630/filters:format(jpg):quality(70)/www.trbimg.com/img-5ab9396a/turbine/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364", "type": "article", "site_name": "Chicago Tribune", "url": "https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/movies/sc-mov-ready-player-one-rev-02364-story.html", "locale": "en_US"}, "keywords": "steven-spielberg,mark-rylance", "robots": "noarchive", "distribution": "global", "rating": "general", "googlebot-news": "index", "copyright": "Copyright \u00a9 2022, Chicago Tribune", "fb": {"page_id": "5953023255,104061989632161,330360537007411,264870045299,73734231949,53310156364,40762490776,60569705796,121922684499844,182379588445160,62915602634,1987930441432108,119608021389933,745745225518281", "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/chicagotribune", "app_id": 306836229411287, "admins": 100000786395051}, "fb_title": "'Ready Player One' review: In Spielberg's dystopia, pop culture saves the day", "y_key": "cee2fe4077f8d050", "msvalidate.01": "AAC9C18F70AC386BC4DCF4DDF9BF1786", "article": {"publisher": "Chicago Tribune", "tag": "Steven Spielberg,Mark Rylance", "content_tier": "locked"}, "google": "nositelinkssearchbox"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.chicagotribune.com", "summary": ""}
