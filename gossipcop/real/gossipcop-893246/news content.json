In early November, he threatened to quit the upcoming Fast & Furious 9 because of an online feud with costar Dwayne (The Rock) Johnson.\n\n\n\nREAD MORE: Tyrese Gibson says Will Smith gave him $5M to pay for his legal fees\n\nGibson, 38, has also been embroiled in a custody battle and abuse investigation with his ex-wife Norma over their 10-year-old daughter, Shayla. On Nov. 3, the investigation was closed after the Department of Child and Family Services found no wrongdoing on Gibson\u2019s part.\n\nThe actor and singer apologized to his fans on Instagram, explaining that his online \u201cmeltdown\u201d wasn\u2019t because of any use of recreational drugs or alcohol, but rather due to the psychiatric medications prescribed to him by a doctor. He claims they caused an \u201cadverse effect\u201d on him.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201c11:11 today here\u2019s my public apology \u2014 everything just changed Medication post I want you guys to know that to this day I don\u2019t drink, smoke or on any level do I do drugs,\u201d read the post. \u201cBecause of this high stress and very traumatic experience I was advised then ultimately connected with multiple therapist and psychiatrist I had a few private meetings and this particular drug that was suggested although maybe helpful to others had an adverse effect on me and this is the reason I had a complete meltdown online.\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: Corey Haim\u2019s mom says Charlie Sheen never sexually assaulted her son\n\nThe drug Gibson is referring to, Rexulti, is mainly used in the treatment of major depressive disorder in combination with other antidepressants.
