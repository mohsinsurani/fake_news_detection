Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters was crowned Sunday during the event that took place at The AXIS theater at Planet Hollywood casino-resort on the Las Vegas Strip. (Nov. 27) AP\n\nMiss South Africa Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters has been crowned Miss Universe 2017.\n\nNel-Peters was honored on-stage along with first runner-up Miss Colombia Laura Gonz\u00e1lez and second runner-up Miss Jamaica Davina Bennett Sunday night in Las Vegas.\n\nNel-Peters, 22, recently earned her degree in business management at North-West University.\n\nDuring a pre-taped interview, the Western Cape native talked about how her experience being held at gunpoint made her passionate about training women in self-defense. She plans to bring that passion, along with a self-defense program she helped develop, to the Miss Universe platform.\n\nDuring the competition's Q&A portion, the newly crowned Miss Universe was asked about the most important issue she thought was facing women in the workplace.\n\n\"In some places, women get paid 75% of what men earn for doing the same job, working the same hours \u2014 and I do not believe that this is right,\" she said. \"I think we should have equal work for equal pay for women all over the world.\u201d\n\nMiss Colombia and Miss Jamaica also impressed the judges during the Q&A segment, answering questions on how to talk to children about terrorism and sexual harassment, respectively.\n\n\u201cSexual harassment is a form of abuse and no abuse should be tolerated whether in the workplace or in society,\u201d Bennett said. \u201cI believe that men and women should come together and be professional.\u201d\n\nThe competition's top 13 finalists were Thailand, Sri Lanka, Ghana, Spain, Ireland, Croatia, Great Britain, USA, Brazil, Canada, Philippines, Venezuela and China.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb4c899425a497b2823e9ae4e98a74a16035fc06/c=0-500-4189-2866/local/-/media/2017/11/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636473316095055890-EPA-USA-MISS-UNIVERSE.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/6fb2e4a2f3117d90fa717a9091627ef5354f29bd/c=0-91-4189-2457&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2017/11/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636473329525805984-EPA-USA-MISS-UNIVERSE.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb4c899425a497b2823e9ae4e98a74a16035fc06/c=0-500-4189-2866/local/-/media/2017/11/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636473316095055890-EPA-USA-MISS-UNIVERSE.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/11/26/miss-south-africa-demi-leigh-nel-peters-crowned-miss-universe-2017/894556001/", "title": "Miss South Africa Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters is crowned Miss Universe 2017", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/11/26/miss-south-africa-demi-leigh-nel-peters-crowned-miss-universe-2017/894556001/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Miss South Africa Demi-Leigh Nel-Peters is crowned Miss Universe 2017", "description": "Miss Colombia\\u00a0Laura Gonz\u00e1lez was crowned first runner-up,\\u00a0and second runner-up went to Miss Jamaica\\u00a0Davina Bennett.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/cb4c899425a497b2823e9ae4e98a74a16035fc06/c=0-500-4189-2866/local/-/media/2017/11/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636473316095055890-EPA-USA-MISS-UNIVERSE.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Miss Colombia\\u00a0Laura Gonz\u00e1lez was crowned first runner-up,\\u00a0and second runner-up went to Miss Jamaica\\u00a0Davina Bennett.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511654400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
