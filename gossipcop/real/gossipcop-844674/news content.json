So yes, it\u2019s a wait but it\u2019s also Christmas themed, so worth it.\n\nThe original story sees Casey Stuart (Lohan) bring her doll (Banks) to life after a spell intended to bring her mother back to life goes awry.\n\nWhile Banks has taken to Twitter to confirm she's set to reprise her role as Eve and announce that filming for the sequel has begun, there\u2019s no word yet on whether Lohan will make a cameo or take on a role.\n\n\"Now filming: LIFE SIZE 2,\" wrote Banks. \"It\u2019s time y\u2019all! You\u2019ve waited long enough. Could not find one single woman more perfect to co-star with Eve than the magnificently fierce @franciaraisa. See you on @FreeformTV this holiday season! #LifeSize2 #ShineBrightShineFar.\"\n\nNow filming: LIFE SIZE 2.\n\n\n\nIt\u2019s time y\u2019all! You\u2019ve waited long enough.\n\n\n\nCould not find one single woman more perfect to co-star with Eve than the magnificently fierce @franciaraisa.\n\n\n\nSee you on @FreeformTV this holiday season! #LifeSize2#ShineBrightShineFarpic.twitter.com/p3XKU0oN25 \u2014 Tyra Banks (@tyrabanks) July 9, 2018\n\nBanks also announced that Grown-ish star Francia Raisa will star alongside her as a character named Grace Manning who, according to Freeform, is \"the confident and funny CEO of Marathon Toys, a huge toy company started by her mother that is most famous for manufacturing the iconic Eve doll.\"\n\nWhile we ponder what Life-Size two might look like, especially at Christmas time and how LiLo fits in, we remain hopeful the former Disney star will make an appearance given that Banks confirmed she'd been in contact with Lohan regarding the her role in August 2017.\n\n\"Lindsay and I have been slipping into each other\u2019s DMs a lot lately,\" said Banks. \"I think she\u2019s very interested in returning. It\u2019s about figuring out what that role is. I\u2019d like it to be kind of robust. I\u2019m not looking for a Lindsay cameo, I\u2019m looking for her to have something pretty meaty in Life-Size 2, so we shall see what our writer comes up with.\u201d", "images":
