Reps for the actors have not commented.\n\nThe Disobedience actress, 48, revealed she was pregnant in an interview in April with The New York Times while promoting her film. \u201cI\u2019ll be showing soon,\u201d she said, adding, \u201cDaniel and I are so happy.\u201d\n\nContinued Weisz, \u201cWe\u2019re going to have a little human. We can\u2019t wait to meet him or her. It\u2019s all such a mystery.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Both have children from previous relationships: Weisz has a 12-year-old son, Henry, with director Darren Aronofsky, while the James Bond star has an adult daughter named Ella, whom he welcomed in 1992 with ex Fiona Loudon.\n\nThe then-pregnant star also opened up about the pair\u2019s relationship to the Times, saying, \u201cI\u2019m very happy being married, very, very happy.\u201d She mused of the couple\u2019s reserved nature when it comes to their romance, \u201cWe\u2019re just really crap at talking about our private lives.\u201d\n\nOf her pregnancy, the actress said she was \u201cfeeling very dodgy for about four months, but now the good bit\u2019s kicked in\u201d during an April interview on Good Morning America.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Rachel Weisz Reveals She\u2019s Expecting First Child with Husband Daniel Craig\n\nA film source told PEOPLE in April the couple\u2019s decision to have children together seemed like a no-brainer.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not surprising that they want a child together,\u201d the insider said. \u201cThey are both smart and secure and having a child is a natural next step even though both have children from other relationships.\u201d\n\nThe source added, \u201cThey admire each other and want to keep their marriage alive and exciting. She is independent and their marriage is solid. Having a child is a natural desire. They have been married long enough to know each other which is a mature step to be sure nothing goes wrong.\u201d\n\nPaul Bruinooge/Patrick McMullan via Getty\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Brigitte Nielsen, Rachel Weisz and More Celebs Who Welcomed (and Are Expecting!) Children After 45\n\nThe notoriously private couple largely keeps their relationship out of the spotlight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s just too famous,\u201d Weisz told More for its the December/January 2016 cover story when asked why she\u2019s decidedly secretive about their marriage. \u201cIt would be a betrayal. You have to protect your marriage.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re young, you tell your girlfriends everything,\u201d the star added. \u201cOne of the great pleasures of not being an adolescent is that you don\u2019t have to share everything. When you\u2019re married, that door closes. The audience goes, and you\u2019re in your own life.\u201d", "images":
