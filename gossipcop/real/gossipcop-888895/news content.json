(Feb. 1) AP\n\nWill Janet Jackson be joining Justin Timberlake at the 2018 Super Bowl halftime show?\n\n\u201cWell, no,\u201d said Timberlake at a pre-Super Bowl press conference, Thursday, Feb. 1 in Minneapolis, Minn., according to NFL.com. \u201cI had a ton of grand ideas about special guests. I think Vegas has a lot of odds on it I heard, from \u2018N Sync, to (Jay Z), to Chris Stapleton, to Janet. But this year, I\u2019m just excited, my band, the Tennessee Kids, I feel like they\u2019re my special guest this year and I\u2019m excited to rock the stage.\u201d\n\nTimberlake joined 2004 Super Bowl headliner Jackson on stage during her performance during the halftime show. He ripped off part of Jackson\u2019s top while singing the lyric \u201cgonna have you naked by the end of this song\u201d from his funk-lite hit, \u201cRock Your Body.\u201d\n\nMore: Justin Timberlake Super Bowl LII: Halftime show right note in #TimesUp era?\n\nHe said it wasn\u2019t intentional and called it a \u201cwardrobe malfunction.\u201d Afterward, his career flourished but Jackson was blacklisted by MTV and parent company Viacom, according to Rolling Stone, and she was to appear on the 2004 Grammys in a tribute to Luther Vandross, but was reportedly dropped from the broadcast in the wake of the scandal.\n\nTimberlake, who\u2019s new album \u201cMan of the Woods,\u201d comes out on Friday, Feb. 2, was not asked about the 2004 halftime show during the 25 minute press conference. He did say that he'll be performing his hit, \"Can't Stop the Feeling!\" from the movie \"Trolls,\" at the upcoming halftime show.\n\nHe was asked about Minneapolis native Prince.\n\n\u201cIn my opinion, the greatest all-around musician I can think of in popular culture,\u201d Timberlake said. \u201cHe\u2019s a huge influence on me. It seems like maybe braggadocious to say but I\u2019m going to say it anyway: The time I got to spend around him, with him, talking about music, those are memories I\u2019ll keep with me forever. Because he\u2019s always been such a big idol of mine, it feels nice to be here.\u201d\n\nHe also expanded on his friendship with New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady.\n\n\u201cTom\u2019s definitely the type of dude you invite over to watch the Super Bowl with you, the problem is that he\u2019s always at the Super Bowl,\u201d Timberlake said.\n\nA group of journalists also sang Happy Birthday to Timberlake, who turned 37 on Wednesday, Jan. 31.\n\nThe Philadelphia Eagles take on the Patriots 6:30 p.m., Sunday, Feb. 4 at U.S. Bank Stadium in Minneapolis. The game starts at 6:30 p.m. and the halftime show should begin around 8:20 p.m.\n\nChris Jordan: cjordan@app.com.
