It's important to remember that every woman is different before, during and after pregnancy\u2014and while Stage is still rocking her six-pack despite the fact that she's six months pregnant, that's not to say that all pregnant women should strive to look the way she does.\n\nBut this mama's commitment to living a healthy lifestyle throughout her pregnancy? Well, it's pretty commendable.\n\nStage makes one thing very clear: She's not putting her baby at risk by keeping up with these challenging prenatal workouts. Stage points out that she got the go-ahead from her doctor to keep exercising during pregnancy, which is really all that matters\u2014and any flack she's faced from social media users isn't cool in light of that. With that being said, Stage also reiterates that every pregnant lady has a different situation, and that there's no one-size-fits-all fitness situation that'll work for everyone. So if you want to work out like this fit preggo, talk to your doctor before you give this workout a go. (Stage also published a fitness ebook if you want to try out her full routine.)\n\nOh, and let's all keep in mind that there's no right or wrong way to look during pregnancy. So six-pack or not, the best thing you can do is work out often for your health\u2014and if you don't sculpt your own set of pregnancy abs, well, that's just fine.", "images": ["https://www.parents.com/thmb/-VP-1wJnzQGsT6Y5-FeT1Lp-SFU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/p_101604945-9e40a3bd99884b57b9e52b57c7dd61a5.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/zZjqVHbYcbIUZjphiY1GZ2tszwc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/work-on-it_1-ab5242f921524596abed584e967a1709.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/-tC23BFH-qHH0BIL6Gutu2i3Lq0=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Zara-Hanawalt-f11acb7d71c44ffdbd9e5dd571fa8f0e.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/-diV6bePY5kl8gwsxUlxtg_q1CM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1308290217-2000-072696a228d0439fbf0c693106d69e77.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/dRrSJA_gsCq617PU1tBkcVJvz1Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Preg_ToDo-1715f648a55f432da8655bf3405bd91f.png", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/_EA2Kex7-faW8KE7qyjY0LGDZBg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/nabela-pregnant-red-pink-dress-9R5wZWVHa4v9XV162_hExd-0857eb9767704c79a0378f52fce8022e.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/8my_luMeXDcuhng67LxwoeRKI3o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-524404029-27f1d2a42c3d49f19f62c947f392dc48.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/Bs1OinQv52qCzrcsMR-Ek7MwCP0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shutterstock_551260354-27ae58d9a3bb446b9342c6b2e6ae65d5.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/6kQYpj5-Fydh-eI0qWSogV9BZGQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/pelvic20floor20exercise-07d76529ba4f4e658ce024737028955d.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/LobCF0rp1PCDzgPxDTqQjzaXSJs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shutterstock_695574844-2a29da3a920b464f80c395f7f216b0f4.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/2gv3_yxBBHfJkoWMZ_mGfZsbXuI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/FP1113_FASTF_01_0-e137db2c651a44ccbbf6dc951562aa86.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/izm8O6RDrO91RJCPYpLuQlL-UkE=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/barre_0-a1463968a1ec415dbbed1f8fc9badb9c.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/FyesWjUFQmhpJccRmaZOFOvr9VA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/p_101549057-21735801266e4fc090b0aca7af3078e5.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/FV8R3E1g5Bdh-dnYFJHabMGGF-4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shutterstock_734901451-e06651332ebf49778147480be372142d.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/DeP3UuHcqWF3YaoOVINGP-Y4aQ8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/GettyImages-1348227683-2000-34e28ac54fa343c8813bd866c75c1eca.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/mrDyY8O7JNmC58YDV_iLnRPCrCY=/1500x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/barre_0-a1463968a1ec415dbbed1f8fc9badb9c.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/hZRvG5ru8TGA_bdvbvynz6wd0fc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/550_102260122-a76a80a3eee04269bba71400acf1df08.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/8wJZ0ZRokqBotAT7vZ4MKNtiW38=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/shutterstock_124625215-ba2a0c22ccbb45a9bd4be69dbbfa2476.jpg", "https://www.parents.com/thmb/6vQF4i0TcCcY0133zPwElyqie1E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/211007-Diastasis-Recti-Exercises-Dos-Donts-Your-Postpartum-Pooch-2000-a412f918ca6e49d0874cf64461d466e2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.parents.com/thmb/izm8O6RDrO91RJCPYpLuQlL-UkE=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/barre_0-a1463968a1ec415dbbed1f8fc9badb9c.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zara Hanawalt", "Our Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://www.parents.com/pregnancy/my-body/fitness/pregnant-six-pack-mom-reveals-her-impressive-workout-routine/", "title": "Fitness Model Mom Reveals Her Impressive Six-Pack Ab Workout", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Want to know how Sarah Stage has a six-pack while six months pregnant?
