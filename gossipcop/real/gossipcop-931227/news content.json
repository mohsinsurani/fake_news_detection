The country singer raised eyebrows on April 25, when he tweeted, \u201cBeen taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It\u2019s karma!!\u201d\n\nThe tweet came just one day after Us Weekly revealed that Shelton\u2019s ex-wife Miranda Lambert is dating Evan Felker. A source confirmed to Us at the time that Shelton, 41, was referring to Lambert, 34, in his tweet. However, the \u201cBoys \u2018Round Here\u201d singer is simply calling the tweet \u201cpersonal.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was a personal thing that\u2019s in a small circle of my people and that\u2019s why it was written the way it was, and then people took it and make it into what they want to make it into, which I don\u2019t want any part of that,\u201d The Voice coach told Extra on Monday, April 30. \u201cBut at the same time, I can\u2019t help but to think it\u2019s funny how these fires get lit and it takes off and I don\u2019t have time to care. That\u2019s why I\u2019ve kind of moved on.\u201d\n\nHe also told Entertainment Tonight that he meant for the \u201ccryptic\u201d message to confuse fans. \u201cI can tell you it\u2019s been, actually, very entertaining to watch the world run with it and assume what they think it\u2019s about,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ll say this, people are way off the mark. But I don\u2019t have time to worry about it.\u201d\n\nThe Turnpike Troubadours frontman filed for divorce from his estranged wife Staci Felker two weeks after meeting Lambert. Meanwhile, Lambert and country singer Anderson East split in April after two years of dating.\n\nThe drama continued on April 26 when Felker sang along to Carrie Underwood\u2019s hit \u201cBefore He Cheats\u201d on her friend\u2019s Instagram story, adding, \u201cI hope he does.\u201d\n\nShe wasn\u2019t the only one to participate in the conversation. Jeff Allen, who dated Lambert for three years before she started dating Shelton, responded to his \u201ckarma\u201d tweet.\n\n\u201cYou know, I\u2019ve always given you the benefit of the doubt and chalked it up to just being human, But you must be one arrogant SOB to pop off something like this, when I know damn good and well you were cheating on your wife and Miranda was cheating on me when you two started up,\u201d he wrote in a now-deleted tweet on April 26. \u201cI kept my mouth shut for 13 years. Sorry, his karma tweet rubbed me wrong. All of this is pointless.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?crop=21px%2C0px%2C1961px%2C1107px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-shelton-says-his-karma-tweet-was-a-personal-thing/", "title": "Blake Shelton Says His \u2018Karma\u2019 Tweet Was a \u2018Personal Thing\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Blake Shelton explains his tweet about \u2018karma,\u2019 revealing that it was a \u2018personal thing,\u2019 but not confirming that it was about ex Miranda Lambert \u2013 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton: That 'Karma' Tweet Was a 'Personal Thing\u2019", "description": "Blake Shelton explains his tweet about \u2018karma,\u2019 revealing that it was a \u2018personal thing,\u2019 but not confirming that it was about ex Miranda Lambert \u2013 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-shelton-says-his-karma-tweet-was-a-personal-thing/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-01T14:51:51+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-05-01T14:51:51+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Longeretta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blake Shelton: That 'Karma' Tweet Was a 'Personal Thing\u2019", "description": "Blake Shelton explains his tweet about \u2018karma,\u2019 revealing that it was a \u2018personal thing,\u2019 but not confirming that it was about ex Miranda Lambert \u2013 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/blake-shelton-miranda-lambert.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525186311.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
