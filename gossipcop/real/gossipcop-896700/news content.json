There is no excuse whatsoever for men to harass women in an abusive sexual manner. And, I am devastated that anyone should deem me capable of thinking otherwise.\n\n\u201cThose who have known the quality of my work and the many public statements I have made over the course of my life, must know, that I am a strong supporter of women\u2019s rights.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171117172236-01-angela-lansbury.jpg?q=x_5,y_0,h_3045,w_5412,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171128105220-02-angela-lansbury-file.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1233,w_2191,c_fill/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171117172236-01-angela-lansbury.jpg?q=x_5,y_0,h_3045,w_5412,c_crop/h_270,w_480"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171117172236-01-angela-lansbury.jpg?q=x_5,y_0,h_3045,w_5412,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Intisar Seraaj Christina Zdanowicz", "Intisar Seraaj", "Christina Zdanowicz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/28/entertainment/angela-lansbury-sexual-harassment-comments-trnd/index.html", "title": "Angela Lansbury says women must \u2018sometimes take blame\u2019 for sexual harassment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Angela Lansbury says women must 'sometimes take blame' for sexual harassment | CNN", "description": "Renowned actress Angela Lansbury is facing criticism after saying women \"must sometimes take blame\" for sexual harassment because of the way they dress.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171117172236-01-angela-lansbury.jpg?q=x_5,y_0,h_3045,w_5412,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/11/28/entertainment/angela-lansbury-sexual-harassment-comments-trnd/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Angela Lansbury says women must 'sometimes take blame' for sexual harassment | CNN", "description": "Renowned actress Angela Lansbury is facing criticism after saying women \"must sometimes take blame\" for sexual harassment because of the way they dress.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171117172236-01-angela-lansbury.jpg?q=x_5,y_0,h_3045,w_5412,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Renowned actress Angela Lansbury is facing criticism after saying women \"must sometimes take blame\" for sexual harassment because of the way they dress.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-28T18:55:42Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-30T15:21:00Z", "tag": "angela lansbury, celebrities, discrimination, sex and gender issues, sexual harassment, societal issues, society, arts and entertainment, celebrity and pop culture, crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, females (demographic group), population and demographics, sex crimes, sexual assault", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "angela lansbury, celebrities, discrimination, sex and gender issues, sexual harassment, societal issues, society, arts and entertainment, celebrity and pop culture, crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, females (demographic group), population and demographics, sex crimes, sexual assault", "author": "Intisar Seraaj,Christina Zdanowicz", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511827200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
