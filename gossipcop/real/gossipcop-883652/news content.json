Lucy\u2019s attendant supreme self-confidence (having taken the gospels of Dolly to heart), however, has proved harder to absorb.\n\nThe film, starring Jennifer Aniston and Patti Cake$ breakout Danielle Macdonald, features big hair, cute boys, dance numbers and a whole host of other hooks to hang a Parton needle drop on.\n\nWhile reaching out to Parton to ask for the rights to standards like \u201cTwo Doors Down\u201d and \u201cJolene\u201d (rights without which there wouldn\u2019t be much of a film), Aniston \u2014 who also exec produced via her banner Echo Films \u2014 and director Anne Fletcher asked Parton if she would write a theme song. And by the way, would she work with composer/producer Linda Perry? \u201cThey just kept flinging stuff at me and I just kept saying \u2018Sure!\u2019 And I didn\u2019t know Linda, actually, so I was just being a good sport,\u201d Parton says. However, when Parton and Perry met, they \u201cclicked like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d\n\nTasked with writing a song, the duo wrote five \u2014 \u201cGirl in the Movies\u201d (nominated for a Golden Globe), \u201cRed Shoes,\u201d \u201cWho,\u201d \u201cPush and Pull\u201d and \u201cIf We Don\u2019t\u201d \u2014 and Parton wrote a sixth, \u201cWhy.\u201d\n\nThe soundtrack is filled out with Perry-produced re-recordings of Parton hits, several featuring collaborators like Sia (\u201cHere I Am\u201d) and Miranda Lambert (\u201cDumb Blonde\u201d). On Nov. 30, the morning of the album\u2019s release, Parton, 72, spoke with THR about her partnership with Perry; why the song the filmmakers chose as the theme, \u201cGirl in the Movies,\u201d is getting the biggest awards push; and convincing Aniston to sing backup.\n\nWere you surprised when the producers contacted you about this project and about collaborating with Linda?\n\nI didn\u2019t know Linda, actually, so I was just being a good sport and was just flattered and honored that there was a movie being made that was paying some kind of homage to me. I got with Linda and we just clicked like you wouldn\u2019t believe. I was very surprised because I don\u2019t write with people. I\u2019m very picky about that. I\u2019ve written with very few people in my whole lifetime. We started writing and working on what we thought would be the theme song, but we were so inspired we just kept just writing and writing and writing songs they hadn\u2019t even asked for! So then we thought, \u201cWell we\u2019ll just save that for another album.\u201d But [Anne and Jennifer] kept hearing the songs and they thought, \u201cWell we can weave these in and out of the movie, and we can actually make these part of the soundtrack.\u201d So it just really came from two very strong women that love to write and love to create things, so it\u2019s been a wonderful partnership.\n\nWhen you and Linda got together, was \u201cGirl in the Movies\u201d the first song you wrote?\n\nActually, I don\u2019t think that was the first one. I told [Linda], \u201cLet\u2019s go see the movie before we start to write anything,\u201d because I have to see and feel these characters; I have to know their stories. I [had read] the book, but that\u2019s different when you see it onscreen. Jennifer Aniston took Linda and me to see a rough cut of it. I got to know all the characters \u2014 the attitudes, the emotions, the feelings of all the people. That\u2019s when we started to write the different songs for it. I wrote the lyrics mostly. Linda\u2019s very strong with music and I\u2019m good with words and feelings, so it was a very good collaboration. It was all based on what I felt the movie was about.\n\nAt some point, Miley Cyrus was going to sing \u201cGirl in the Movies\u201d or duet with you?\n\nI had hoped Miley could sing with me, and we actually did a cut of it, but we thought that this movie was coming out last year. Miley had a little bit of time and was kind of in between projects and so was I. But it kept lagging and lagging, so Miley had to start on her own projects; she was doing a new record and getting ready for her new tour. In defense of her, she did try and she did give us permission [to release the cut], but after a time we couldn\u2019t put it out as a single and it turned out that this was the [song] they wanted to use as the theme song, so we just had to take Miley off. But she will at some point record it, and I\u2019m going to sing with her on her version.\n\nWhen you write six songs, how do you decide which one to focus on for the Oscar campaign?\n\nThe record label has a lot to do with it. I know everyone just seemed to take to \u201cGirl in the Movies\u201d because it is about a girl in the movies and [the song] is in the movie. That particular song was more of a team effort. I really enjoyed it, but I never know which one of my songs is great \u2014 they\u2019re like my kids; I love \u2019em all. Some of them might be prettier in other people\u2019s eyes, but they\u2019re all beautiful to you. So that was more of a business-ended decision on which [song] should be first, what they thought would be the best contender for an Oscar. Now that we are talking about it, \u201cRed Shoes\u201d is one of my personal favorites.\n\nI really like \u201cPush and Pull.\u201d It seems like it\u2019s the most thematically linked to the movie, in my mind. It also struck me as the most classic \u201cDolly\u201d song.\n\nThere\u2019s a lot of truth in that, and actually, when I saw the movie I saw the relationship with the mother and the daughter, and they were both trying to push and pull. And I also have a sister and one of her daughters, and they\u2019re always kinda like that too; they\u2019re always pushing and pulling and they fight and they fuss and they get back together. The reason it sounded like a Dolly song is I was playing off a lot of my own emotions and family feelings \u2014 and of course everybody has that in their family: mothers and daughters and fathers and sons, they collide when the kids start getting old enough to have a mind of their own. Anyhow, that is where I came up with \u201cPush and Pull.\u201d Not only that but I got Danielle and Jennifer to come over and sing on it. The said, \u201cOh no, we don\u2019t sing!\u201d and I said \u201cYou do now! I had them both come over, Linda and I, and we worked with them. They were so nervous, but they did good! And they\u2019re on there, credited.\n\nI also wanted to ask about \u201cJolene\u201d with the new arrangement. I know you\u2019ve recorded that song a lot over the years different ways. How did this version come about?\n\nWell actually that was totally Linda\u2019s idea. She loved the song \u201cJolene\u201d and she put on Paul McCartney\u2019s version of \u201cEleanor Rigby\u201d and said, \u201cWouldn\u2019t it be cool to just do \u2018Jolene\u2019 completely different? Just you and the orchestra?\u201d I said \u201cWell, I guess!\u201d (Laughs.) And so she worked up a string arrangement with the orchestra and she said, \u201cWell, get out there and sing!\u201d I went out and it was like a one-take! It was really a magical moment. To hear it slowed down that way with the orchestra it really took it into that Elizabethan sound, like old parlour music. It took on a life of its own, and I am really proud of that. I had never thought of [the song] that way, and I cannot take any credit for it \u2014 other than to write it and to sing it. (Laughs.)\n\nWell, you know, just that!\n\nBut not for that new arrangement! It\u2019s kinda refreshing actually to get to do it differently than I always have.\n\nWhat can you say about the songs that will be featured in your eight-episode Netflix anthology series?\n\nThe series is called Heartstrings, and it\u2019s based on songs that I\u2019ve written. Some of them are famous and some of them are not. They\u2019re just the songs that make the best stories. We, of course, did \u201cJolene.\u201d Julianne Hough played Jolene, and she killed it. And Kimberly Williams-Paisley, Brad Paisley\u2019s wife, played Jolene\u2019s best friend. I actually got to star in that one: [My character owns] the bar where Jolene works \u2014 she\u2019s a singer \u2014 so I\u2019m trying to encourage her to get to Nashville and all that. We also did \u201cTwo Doors Down.\u201d We did a song called \u201cIf I Had Wings,\u201d with Gerald McRaney and Delta Burke. They\u2019re married, of course, and have been for many, many years, but it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve starred together in anything. We did one pet song \u2014 I have an old song called \u201cCracker Jack.\u201d We have one called \u201cJ.J. Sneed\u201d \u2014 it\u2019s a Western. They\u2019re all completely different. One of my favorites is called \u201cThese Old Bones.\u201d It\u2019s about an old clairvoyant country woman played by Kathleen Turner. I narrate all the shows at the front and talk about how the song came to be, and my music plays in and out \u2014 sometimes more than one song in each show.\n\nI have to ask if you did an episode based on one of my personal favorites, \u201cWildflowers\u201d?\n\nWell, you know what? I will. Because I\u2019m like you: I think \u201cWildflowers\u201d would make a wonderful one. It\u2019s kind of like my story. That\u2019s so much like \u201cThe Dolly Parton Story\u201d that I\u2019m going to make them pay me more money for that one! (Laughs.) But I will be doing ones like \u201cMy Blue Ridge Mountain Boy\u201d about the country girl that goes to New Orleans, becomes a prostitute and thinks she\u2019s going to make it big in the world and then realizes she misses that boy she left behind. If they continue with it \u2014 because they seem to like what we\u2019re doing so far \u2014 after these eight shows, which they plan to drop next fall worldwide, we\u2019ll see how it goes.\n\nWhat\u2019s that status of the 9 to 5 sequel, which is set up at Fox with Rashida Jones and Pat Resnick writing the script?\n\nActually, we are supposed to have the first scripts in our hands within days. Of course, we will have to see what our thoughts are, and it will have to be rewritten a time or two, I\u2019m sure. Hopefully, we might get a chance to start that in the new year. But it\u2019s going to really be good \u2014 after all these years, they finally came up with something that makes sense and was worthwhile to do. [The new plot focuses on] three younger women working at the same Consolidated Companies, and these three girls try to figure out who these women were who made all these changes years ago. They find us, and I am sure it will have a lot of comedy and cover some issues that still need to be touched on, but in a fun, new way. Talking about 9 to 5, they did a 9 to 5 [movie,] then they did a 9 to 5 series, which actually stars one of my sisters, Rachel. Then I had the chance to write the musical 9 to 5 for Broadway, and now they are actually opening that again in London in January. I\u2019ve written another song or two for that. I\u2019m very proud that 9 to 5 just keeps paying off. It is the song and the movie that just will not die!\n\nA version of this story first appeared in a December stand-alone issue of The Hollywood Reporter magazine.
