Year-to-year declines, particularly among younger viewers, have been positively brutal: NBC, CBS, and Fox all saw their premiere week Nielsen averages among adults under 50 decline between 16 and 24 percent. ABC claimed a victory of sorts by remaining flat compared to 2016, but that\u2019s only because last year\u2019s premiere week numbers were particularly awful.\n\nNetwork suits will note that these early numbers matter far less than they used to, and that\u2019s true \u2014 to a point. Ratings are mostly about setting rates for advertising, and advertising can now represent less than half a network\u2019s overall income. (Broadcasters also make money selling their shows to streaming outlets and international buyers, or getting folks to subscribe to streaming services they control, such as Hulu and CBS All Access.) Still, much like opening-weekend box office in the film world, how TV shows perform in the first few weeks of the season can often be predictive of their ultimate worth to a network. That makes these fall numbers worth paying attention to, and even worthy of drawing a few initial impressions from. Here are three early takeaways from the Nielsen tea leaves.\n\nNetwork Audiences Want Comfort Food\n\nAt a time when real-world events seem unrelentingly grim, audiences appear to be turning to TV for the small-screen equivalent of comfort food. The trend toward warm and fuzzy began last season with the unexpectedly huge success of NBC\u2019s This Is Us, an unashamed tearjerker whose message of family unity and love was the perfect antidote to the nastiness of the 2016 presidential election. With the state of the union even more depressing (at least for the 55 percent of the country unhappy with President Trump), the Peacock\u2019s family drama returned last week to record ratings. And although this season brought no direct This Is Us clones, there\u2019s early evidence to suggest shows that tap into the same uplifting Zeitgeist are connecting with audiences.\n\nABC\u2019s The Good Doctor, with Freddie Highmore as a pediatric surgeon with autism, is shaping up as the new season\u2019s first breakout hit, giving ABC its best numbers for a new drama since 2014\u2019s launch of How to Get Away With Murder. (It\u2019s already been picked up for a full season.) Similarly, Fox\u2019s The Orville has also generated some decent numbers during its first few weeks on the air. A couple of Sunday airings boosted by Fox\u2019s NFL lead-in exposed the Seth MacFarlane\u2013created Star Trek homage to nearly 12 million viewers; the show\u2019s debut was Fox\u2019s best drama launch since Empire. Ratings have fallen back to Earth since the show shifted to its regular Thursday slot, but even so, it\u2019s still helped Fox to its best numbers on the night in over two years. MacFarlane is known for his crass, even cynical humor, but Orville offers a more optimistic, even earnest worldview \u2014 and in 2017, his fans seem to be embracing it. Likewise, early ratings for ABC\u2019s new comedy The Mayor, in which a millennial rapper (accidentally) rides a hope-and-change message into public office, are encouraging.\n\nTo be sure, simply serving up sweetness and light doesn\u2019t guarantee an audience. ABC\u2019s pseudo-spiritual Jason Ritter drama Kevin (Probably) Saves the World, for example, probably won\u2019t be around for too long after a decidedly weak premiere on Tuesday. And dark dystopias remain popular, or at least in the cultural Zeitgeist: Hulu\u2019s The Handmaid\u2019s Tale just cleaned up at the Emmys, and while there\u2019s no way of knowing how many people are actually watching \u2014 the service doesn\u2019t release ratings \u2014 it\u2019s certainly become a pop-culture phenom. AMC\u2019s The Walking Dead franchise is also still a massive hit, even if same-day ratings for its Fear the Walking Dead spinoff are down by more than a third this season. But as one network exec told Vulture last week, viewers seem to be in the mood for shows which offer a bit of inspiration in a world gone mad. Indeed, it\u2019s probably no coincidence left-leaning MSNBC has seen a massive Nielsen surge since Trump\u2019s inauguration, or that Stephen Colbert \u2014 he of the sharply written anti-Trump monologues \u2014 is now TV\u2019s most-watched late-night show. While a riveting Rachel Maddow sermon or Colbert rant aren\u2019t exactly \u201cheartwarming,\u201d they can serve as nightly salves for angry liberals (or even some Never Trump conservatives) looking for a way to deal with the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. \u201cPeople want things that make them feel good,\u201d the exec says.\n\nFamiliarity Is Breeding Success\n\nCritics love to complain whenever a new TV reboot, revival, or spinoff is announced. Almost instinctively, these kinds of shows are dismissed as money grabs or proof of creative bankruptcy. But viewers this fall don\u2019t seem to share those concerns, at least so far. More than 15 million people checked out NBC\u2019s resurrection last week of Will & Grace, a series which limped off the air in 2006 and didn\u2019t have anywhere near the sort of successful syndicated afterlife of a Friends or Seinfeld. CBS\u2019s special sneak preview of Young Sheldon, its prequel/spinoff of The Big Bang Theory, did even better: Its audience tally is at 23 million viewers and counting, the biggest new comedy launch on TV since 2011. And over at HBO, the long-delayed ninth season of Curb Your Enthusiasm has already racked up 2.3 million viewers, a bigger number than any episode from season seven (the last time Curb aired in the fall) and on par with the show\u2019s season eight premiere (which was boosted by a True Blood lead-in).\n\nIt\u2019s early, of course. Fox\u2019s The X-Files reboot a couple years back opened huge and then faded fast, though it still did well enough to secure a renewal. NBC\u2019s Will & Grace return seems particularly likely to suffer a sharp ratings drop-off in the next few weeks now that viewers who just wanted to see what all the revival fuss about have their curiosity sated. But even if they don\u2019t do quite as spectacularly in the linear ratings going forward, the new economics of TV make these shows almost certain near-term successes. NBC renewed W&G for next season before seeing a single Nielsen number, in part because of a bigger deal with Hulu for the show\u2019s old and new episodes. Reanimating the corpses of Will Truman and Grace Adler dramatically increased the digital worth of the original W&G episodes, making the show\u2019s revival profitable from the word go. Young Sheldon, meanwhile, offers CBS the best possible chance to hold on to TBBT\u2019s ratings magic once the original show signs off in a couple seasons: Even if it does two-thirds the ratings of the mothership series, it\u2019ll represent a big win for the Eye.\n\nThe Sophomore Slump Is Real\n\nIt was once common for hit freshman shows to return the next season and score even better ratings. Viewers who heard good buzz about a newcomer would catch up with reruns over the summer and then hop on the bandwagon the next fall. Peak TV has all but buried that practice: Networks now expect almost every series, new or returning, to lose some ground each year due to increasing competition, or because audience shift to nonlinear platforms are not measured by Nielsen. But even in this age of diminished expectations, the ratings declines for some of last season\u2019s big drama \u201chits\u201d have been shocking. Sure, NBC\u2019s This Is Us actually returned stronger than ever, but that\u2019s an outlier for network dramas. Fox\u2019s Lethal Weapon, CBS\u2019s Bull, and ABC\u2019s Designated Survivor, however, all began their second seasons down around 40 percent compared to where they launched one year ago (and that\u2019s including three days of DVR replays). The Eye\u2019s MacGyver reboot did even worse, losing more than half of its 2016 premiere demo ratings when it came back last Friday.\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that all of the aforementioned shows had already suffered significant audience erosion over the course of their first seasons, losing millions of viewers after their initial launches. Lethal Weapon, after premiering in September 2016 with a 2.9 rating, was down to a 1.8 live plus three rating among adults under 50 when it signed off last March. Its premiere last week came in at a 1.7 rating, virtually on par with its finale numbers. In other words, Lethal Weapon isn\u2019t anywhere near the hit it appeared to be last fall, but it didn\u2019t bleed all that many viewers over the summer. A similar scenario played out with the other returning dramas. The question now is whether these sophomore shows stabilize, or keep declining as the season grinds on. History suggests the erosion will continue.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4ec/fab/93b55a6497b7b8a57b10f2e8457453e29a-05-fall-tv-split.rsquare.w700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4ec/fab/93b55a6497b7b8a57b10f2e8457453e29a-05-fall-tv-split.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4ec/fab/93b55a6497b7b8a57b10f2e8457453e29a-05-fall-tv-split.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josef Adalian"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/fall-tv-2017-lessons-for-network-tv.html", "title": "In the Age of Trump, Comfort Food TV Is Working", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "fall tv 2017, tv, network tv, the good doctor, young sheldon, this is us, reboots, revivals, will & grace, curb your enthusiasm, the orville, msnbc, the late show with stephen colbert, the industry, fall tv, vulture homepage lede, featuretype:news-commentary and analysis, featuretype:feature", "og": {"title": "In the Age of Trump, Comfort Food TV Is Working", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/fall-tv-2017-lessons-for-network-tv.html", "description": "And two more early lessons about the 2017 fall season.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4ec/fab/93b55a6497b7b8a57b10f2e8457453e29a-05-fall-tv-split.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "In the Age of Trump, Comfort Food TV Is Working", "description": "And two more early lessons about the 2017 fall season.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/4ec/fab/93b55a6497b7b8a57b10f2e8457453e29a-05-fall-tv-split.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@tvmojoe", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-05T14:31:33.811-04:00", "tag": "fall tv 2017, tv, network tv, the good doctor, young sheldon, this is us, reboots, revivals, will & grace, curb your enthusiasm, the orville, msnbc, the late show with stephen colbert, the industry, fall tv, vulture homepage lede", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "In the Trump era, audiences are flocking to TV comforts.
