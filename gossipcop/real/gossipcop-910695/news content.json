Could the film, perhaps, even include a glimpse at the future Hogwarts headmaster\u2019s romantic life\u2014a subject left open-ended by the original Harry Potter books, though J.K. Rowling confirmed after completing the series that Dumbledore was gay?\n\nWell, no. Director David Yates has revealed that for now, Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality will not make it to screen\u2014at least, \u201cnot explicitly.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut I think all the fans are aware of that,\u201d Yates continued, speaking to Entertainment Weekly. \u201cHe had a very intense relationship with Grindelwald when they were young men. They fell in love with each other\u2019s ideas, and ideology, and each other.\u201d\n\nRowling previously teased the idea that eventually, one of the five planned Fantastic Beasts films will address Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality\u2014but it\u2019s unclear when, or how. \u201cWell, I can\u2019t tell you everything I would like to say because this is obviously a five-part story, so there\u2019s lots to unpack in that relationship,\u201d she said at a press conference in 2016. \u201cI will say that you will see Dumbledore as a younger man, and quite a troubled man because he wasn\u2019t always the sage. He was always very clever, but we\u2019ll see what I think was the formative period of his life. As far as his sexuality is concerned, watch the space.\u201d Rowling responded to the recent controversy on Twitter, complaining that she\u2019d been \u201csent abuse about an interview that didn't involve me, about a screenplay I wrote but which none of the angry people have read, which is part of a five-movie series that's only one instalment in.\u201d\n\nWhat, exactly, are fans to make of this? Rowling first announced that Dumbledore was gay in 2007, while promoting the final book in her original series, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows. As she put it to one fan who asked if Dumbledore had ever fallen in love, \u201cI always thought of Dumbledore as gay.\u201d Three Harry Potter films were released after this announcement, but none of them made explicit mention of Dumbledore\u2019s sexuality\u2014understandably, perhaps, since their source material didn\u2019t either. As of now, Dumbledore\u2019s romantic life has been purely the stuff of fan fiction\u2014and apparently, it will remain so for the foreseeable future.\n\nThis approach speaks to a frustrating trend in blockbuster movies, one exemplified by recent films like Power Rangers and Beauty and the Beast. Both movies made headlines by teasing story lines involving explicitly gay characters\u2014or, in the case of Beauty and the Beast, an \u201cexclusively gay moment.\u201d When the movies actually made it to theaters, though, those much-touted scenes amounted to little more than throwaway moments that felt divorced from the rest of the story\u2014blink-and-you\u2019ll-miss-it fragments, rather than true examples of much-needed L.G.B.T. representation. There\u2019s something cynical about explicitly telling L.G.B.T. fans to look out for L.G.B.T. characters\u2014then responding to their attention (and ticket purchases) with weak feints at inclusion, or nothing at all.\n\nAlthough TV continues to make great strides in this arena, film has lagged far behind\u2014and few franchises make that more readily apparent than Fantastic Beasts. Obviously, it\u2019s wrong to write a film off without having seen it\u2014but at the same time, it\u2019s only natural for some fans to feel disappointment at this Dumbledore news. Legions of moviegoers are tired of being teased with the possibility of L.G.B.T. characters, only to have the prospect unceremoniously yanked out from under them. The first Fantastic Beasts already hinged on an obvious gay liberation metaphor involving Ezra Miller\u2019s character, Credence. Why, then, should it bother being coy about Dumbledore\u2019s personal life\u2014especially in a film that essentially pits the character against his terrible ex-boyfriend?\n\nMarketing divisions seem to have figured out already that representation often helps a film\u2019s bottom line; how long will it take for writers and filmmakers to follow suit?", "images":
