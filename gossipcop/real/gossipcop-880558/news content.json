{"url": "https://www.timesofisrael.com/wonder-woman-can-save-the-world-but-not-even-gal-gadot-can-save-justice-league/", "text": "Despite ample screen time and her abundant charisma, Gal Gadot, the most significant Israeli find since the Dead Sea Scrolls, is unable to rescue this meandering, dreary and pointless movie.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just dull, it\u2019s infuriating. The whole world loves these characters, and so much time, effort and money has been hurled at this property. But the story in \u201cJustice League\u201d is practically nonexistent \u2014 and, even more insulting, the big Hollywood special effects look like garbage.\n\nIf this were a low-budget matinee B-picture, I\u2019d let it slide. But this tentpole franchise picture, which opens November 16, cost more than the GDP of some small nations. What a mess.\n\nThings kick off when Batman, aka Bruce Wayne (Ben Affleck), is fighting crime in Gotham (as he does) but starts noticing more and more fly-creatures. (Parademons, they are called, if you pay close attention.) As they implode they leave behind a mark: three squares. It\u2019s something Batman remembers scribbled in Lex Luthor\u2019s notebooks, so clearly they are evil.\n\nHe decides it\u2019s time to call upon the other \u201cmetahumans\u201d that were briefly glimpsed in \u201cBatman V Superman: Dawn of Justice.\u201d\n\nGet The Times of Israel's Daily Edition by email and never miss our top stories Newsletter email address Get it By signing up, you agree to the terms\n\nFirst there\u2019s Aquaman (Jason Momoa) who is entertaining, but isn\u2019t given much to do but swim. There\u2019s also Cyborg (Ray Fisher), a gloomy kid in a hoodie, who spends most of his time staring at his hands. There\u2019s also Superman (Henry Cavil) but he\u2019s dead for the first half (unlike the drama in this story, which is dead throughout). Then there\u2019s Barry Allen, aka The Flash (Ezra Miller), but more on him later.\n\nBefore collecting the team we cut to some Wonder Woman action, in which she foils a terrorist attack at the British Museum. It\u2019s not shot as well as the action in Gal Gadot\u2019s solo film, \u201cWonder Woman,\u201d but once again she is impressive in her athletic moves, half-smiles and reaction shots.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGal Gadot may not be much of a thespian (her voice-over exposition about those three mysterious cubes later in the film sounds as if she\u2019s as confused as we are) but she\u2019s a remarkable movie star.\n\nIt isn\u2019t just that she \u201clooks good\u201d \u2014 her glances exude the confidence and grace that would have made her a legend even back in the days of silent film. She and the camera love one another. Yes, it may be ridiculous that she, in her position as an art conservator at the Louvre, dusts statues in a tight, laced-up white dress and push-up bra, but no one ever came to superhero movies for their realism.\n\nIt\u2019s lucky she doesn\u2019t need any dazzling effects to brighten the frame, because the computer imagery in \u201cJustice League\u201d is just awful. There\u2019s a green screened cornfield that had my audience laughing. The action in this movie is so video game-like I almost grabbed a controller based solely on muscle memory.\n\nThe fighting comes when the big villain, a poorly rendered Minotaur-ish ghoul called Steppenwolf, emerges from a portal to collect those three boxes I keep talking about. When he has accomplished this the \u201cUnity\u201d will be complete, and then, I dunno, I guess he\u2019ll get lower interest rates or something. His plans are very vague.\n\nWhat isn\u2019t vague is just how much Batman feels sorry for the fact that Superman got injured in the last installment. This, in addition to wanting to save the world, is what motivates him to create this new superhero team-up.\n\nAquaman, like I mentioned, is something of a breath of fresh air (ironic, as he breathes underwater) as he is played like a lovable tough guy \u2014 the type of dude who will smash beer cans on his head. Opposite him in the testosterone department is Barry Allen, and I guess it\u2019s time for the big reveal: The Flash is Jewish.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNo, I don\u2019t just mean that Ezra Miller, the actor, is Jewish. I mean the character, for the first time in its 77-year-old history, is a member of the Hebraic faith. Baruch Hashem!\n\nThe Barry Allen we see here is a motormouth kid who describes himself as an \u201cattractive Jewish boy\u201d who plays the viola, is into web design, sign language and, also, gorilla sign language. He has trouble making friends because he\u2019s always a mile ahead of everyone else. (He gets a little schtick about not understanding brunch.)\n\nHe also eats nonstop, thanks to his high metabolism, which he describes as being in a \u201csnack hole\u201d thanks to his molecules living in the Speed Force. (In case you don\u2019t know, The Flash\u2019s main deal is he can run really fast. But can he run as fast as Superman?)\n\nWhile it\u2019s great to see Jewish representation in a mainstream international film, it\u2019s undeniable that the character is meant as borderline annoying comic relief. On the one hand he\u2019s cute; on the other hand it is cringeworthy when he tries to go in for a fist-bump with the cool African-American kid (Cyborg) who looks at him like he\u2019s a big dork.\n\nThe best thing you can say about \u201cJustice League\u201d is that it is a relatively quick two hours. \u201cBatman V Superman\u201d lasted roughly 40 days and 40 nights. It\u2019ll still be a big hit, and you may even find yourself dragged to the theater with excited kids, but don\u2019t say I didn\u2019t warn you.\n\nLuckily, when a team is involved no one gets the full blame. Ezra Miller will still get a solo Flash picture and maybe that\u2019ll still be good. (The Flash that\u2019s currently on TV is, however, much better.)\n\nAn aside: With the same creative team in place for Wonder Woman\u2019s sequel there\u2019s every reason to think it\u2019ll be comparable to the first one. Heck, maybe Wonder Woman and Flash can even team up some day. What if the Justice League was \u201cjust us,\u201d huh?", "images": ["https://static.timesofisrael.com/www/uploads/2022/10/126963805_37cc61d1-bde2-4ee2-b818-2df61690ac9e-640x400.jpeg",
