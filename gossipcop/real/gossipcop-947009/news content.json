While the two are good pals, they never miss an opportunity to poke a little fun at each other or embarrass each other should the moment arise.\n\nTheir latest online exchange? KJ recently posted a meme of himself and Cole side-by-side when they were actually teens \u2014 you know, the ages Archie Andrews and Jughead Jones are supposed to be? (KJ is 21 and Cole is 25.) To accompany the pic, KJ wrote, \u201cMan, I would have absolutely crushed you at age 17. Crushed.\u201d He also added, \"And I still would now.\"\n\nWhile teen KJ does have some serious biceps and teen Cole looks a bit more like he did in his Suite Life days, that didn\u2019t mean Cole was ready to accept defeat. He hopped on to comment on the pic, writing, \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t even have survived the weight of my wallet b*tch.\u201d (Likely a reference to those Disney paychecks and a net worth built from years of being a child actor on TV and in movies like Big Daddy.)\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nKJ's post then triggered a whole Riverdale reunion. Another expert Riverdale troller, Lili Reinhart, popped in to say that she would have \u201cpummeled\u201d both of them. Lili has \u201clovingly\u201d poked fun at KJ before, so she\u2019s practically a pro at this point.\n\nCasey Cott, who plays Kevin Keller on the series, jumped in to add, \"I would have watched the fight from the sidelines wishing for peace amongst the school.\" And the Riverdale parents also got in the fun. Skeet Ulrich, who plays Jughead's father, commented, \"Neither of you would have even touched my mullet.\" And Mark Consuelos, who plays Hiram Lodge, wrote (in character), \"Kids. Keep it down.\"", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63347e804e5b2e64dd601818/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6329d08a5b0f6cb61cf8eba4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631f31eb981c3151bdf92a34/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632087da01c5838054a4ff3a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7ee01ec56ccd39b253/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee78936c7e5d44e21178/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/lede.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7ee01ec56ccd39b253/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kara Nesvig"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kj-apa-roasts-cole-sprouse-instagram-throwback-photo", "title": "KJ Apa Roasts Cole Sprouse on Instagram With a Throwback Photo", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "\"Riverdale\" star KJ Apa reposted a meme to Instagram that compares 17-year-old KJ with 17-year-old Cole Sprouse.", "id": "5b30e942f9ae477d9d3f3568", "keywords": "kj apa,cole sprouse,riverdale,lili reinhart", "news_keywords": "kj apa,cole sprouse,riverdale,lili reinhart", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b30e942f9ae477d9d3f3568", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"\\\"Riverdale\\\" star KJ Apa reposted a meme to Instagram that compares 17-year-old KJ with 17-year-old Cole Sprouse.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7a936c7e5d44e2117a/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7a936c7e5d44e2117a/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Cole, Lili Reinhart, Casey Cott, Mark Consuelos, and Lorde also weighed in.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7ee01ec56ccd39b253/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "KJ Apa Roasted Cole Sprouse With a Meme of When They Were Both 17", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/kj-apa-roasts-cole-sprouse-instagram-throwback-photo"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-25T13:35:24.615Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T13:35:24.615Z", "author": "Kara Nesvig"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Cole, Lili Reinhart, Casey Cott, Mark Consuelos, and Lorde also weighed in.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5b30ee7ee01ec56ccd39b253/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FB.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "KJ Apa Roasted Cole Sprouse With a Meme of When They Were Both 17"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529933724.615, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
