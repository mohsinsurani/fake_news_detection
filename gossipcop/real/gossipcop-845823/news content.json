Not too shabby.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube.

I'm shocked, audience not happy, how are you?\"\n\nHeather replied: \"I'm okay. You know, it's a hard competition, and I'm really happy that I got to do exactly what I wanted to do.\"\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube.

I put in a lot of work to try and come back and give her the chance.\n\n\"I'm not saying anything. I think [Helen's other pro partner] Alan [Bersten] did an amazing job. I think Heather is my inspiration moving forward.\"\n\nHeather added: \"I really, really want to say thank you to both of them because they were magical. It was fantastic.\"\n\nDancing with the Stars airs Mondays at 8pm ET on ABC.\n\nWant up-to-the-minute entertainment news and features?
