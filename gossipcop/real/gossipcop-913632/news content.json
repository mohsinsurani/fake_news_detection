I am extremely proud of being the 1st Armenian-American Housewife and sharing my culture with the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhile I faced and conquered many challenges, I\u2019m grateful for the opportunity to share my story and spread awareness of breast cancer. Dealing with the disease and the passing of my father challenged me to reassess and reflect on my life, and I\u2019ve realized what\u2019s most important is leading a healthy and happy life, surrounded by people who care and love you,\u201d she continued. \u201cAt this point, moving on seemed like the right thing to do. A few new ventures have availed themselves, and I look forward to sharing them with you soon!\u201d\n\nDuring an October interview with ET\u2019s Brice Sander, Sulahian said she would stick around for another season if she was asked to return.\n\n\u201cIf they like me, and they want class and not trash, they\u2019ll have me back,\u201d she insisted.\n\nIn January, she teased her return with fellow housewife Lydia McLaughlin on Instagram.\n\nMeanwhile, McLaughlin also recently announced her RHOC exit on her blog, explaining that the show \u201chas given me a great platform and I\u2019m grateful for that. However, I feel like I can only handle this show one season at a time. I need a break! There is a lot of good that comes from the show, but also a lot of negativity.\u201d\n\n\u201cAfter a family vote, it was unanimous that I should take a break. Sometimes the people who love us the most see things even we don\u2019t see. I trust my path and I\u2019m excited for what the future holds,\u201d she added.\n\nSulahian and McLaughlin\u2019s departures follow Meghan King Edmonds\u2019 exit last month, leaving Kelly Dodd and Shannon Beador as the only confirmed housewives returning next season.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n\u2018RHOC\u2019 Star Peggy Sulahian Names Her Biggest \u2018Bully\u2019 After Being Pushed to Her \u2018Limit\u2019 in Iceland (Exclusive)\n\n'RHOC' Star Shannon Beador Files for Divorce From Husband David After 17 Years of Marriage\n\nMeghan King Edmonds Is Leaving 'Real Housewives of Orange County' -- Here's Why", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_intv_peggy_sulahian_cancer_110217.jpg?h=76baa1dc&itok=esCUsvhk", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/GettyImages-1243560296.jpg?h=27af8da9&itok=n9B1yPno", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_intv_peggy_sulahian_cancer_110217.jpg?h=76baa1dc&itok=u6sLBtWy", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%202.01.34%20PM.png?h=597e033f&itok=1KV1Fu0Z"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_intv_peggy_sulahian_cancer_110217.jpg?h=76baa1dc&itok=esCUsvhk", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Drysdale"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/peggy-sulahian-leaving-real-housewives-of-orange-county-after-one-season-96341", "title": "Peggy Sulahian Leaving \u2018Real Housewives of Orange County\u2019 After One Season", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "Sulahian's departure follows Lydia McLaughlin and Meghan King Edmonds.", "keywords": "TV, News, The Real Housewives, The Real Housewives of Orange County, Peggy Sulahian", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/peggy-sulahian-leaving-real-housewives-of-orange-county-after-one-season-96341", "title": "Peggy Sulahian Leaving \u2018Real Housewives of Orange County\u2019 After One Season", "description": "Sulahian's departure follows Lydia McLaughlin and Meghan King Edmonds.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_intv_peggy_sulahian_cancer_110217.jpg?h=76baa1dc&itok=esCUsvhk", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Sulahian's departure follows Lydia McLaughlin and Meghan King Edmonds.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Peggy Sulahian Leaving \u2018Real Housewives of Orange County\u2019 After One Season", "creator": "Jennifer Drysdale\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/peggy-sulahian-leaving-real-housewives-of-orange-county-after-one-season-96341", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/et_intv_peggy_sulahian_cancer_110217.jpg?h=76baa1dc&itok=esCUsvhk"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
