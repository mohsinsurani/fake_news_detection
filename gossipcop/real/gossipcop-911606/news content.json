He entered halftime while riding in a Cadillac as his hit \"Kryptonite\" played. Then he got out and performed his 2003 hit \"The Way You Move\" backed up by frequent collaborator Sleepy Brown and Levine, who helped Brown sing the hook.\n\nMaroon 5 ended their set with \"Moves Like Jagger\" as Levine threw off his shirt to the crowd during the song.\n\nThe Feb. 3 game marked the Super Bowl's first return to Atlanta in 19 years. The Patriots beat the Rams 13-3.\n\nMaroon 5 at Atlanta Super Bowl draws big response\n\nI believe someday, football fans will realize the Superbowl halftime show isn't for them. Look at Maroon 5. Just look at them. \u2014 Taylor Lentz (@TLentz53) September 20, 2018\n\nMaroon 5 will be the halftime entertainment at the Super Bowl. So great news for fans who want to catch a quick nap at halftime during the Super Bowl. \u2014 Steve Sparks (@radiodjsteve) September 20, 2018\n\nJust learning that Maroon 5 will perform at Super Bowl halftime reinforces my belief that the NFL makes terrible decisions \u2014 Anya Alvarez (@anya__alvarez) September 20, 2018\n\nWTF. Outcast, Usher, Ludicrous, T.I, Migos, Yeezy, Lil Jon are ATL originals and we get Maroon 5?\ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffe\u200d\u2642\ufe0f https://t.co/7Y3XLgNh0u \u2014 shannon sharpe (@ShannonSharpe) September 19, 2018\n\n@CollectiveSoul Any chance you could play halftime at the Super Bowl, Maroon 5? come on. \u2014 luc robataille (@bruceski2020) September 20, 2018\n\nI\u2019m also hoping Outkast takes over Maroon 5\u2019s half time performance. pic.twitter.com/jkTvTdFPZI \u2014 Ryan Michaels (@RageMichaels) September 20, 2018\n\nAm I the only one not mad about Maroon 5 performing at the Super Bowl? \u2014 YOUTUBE: XOXOJezell (@xoxoJezell) September 20, 2018\n\nPeople upset about this and that Atlanta based artist aren't playing it need to realize the @NFL & @pepsi need an act that will get the most non-football fans to watch. Nation wide amongst all demographics Maroon 5 is a bigger draw than let's say Migos. They're just more known. https://t.co/vzF1wgu17k \u2014 Mohammed (@mhesen09) September 20, 2018", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/670a5af4545990e7de58a5151d6d388ddd3515b1/c=0-157-1529-1021/local/-/media/2018/08/28/TennGroup/Nashville/636710449787549815-September-Calendar-76.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/f091d26b43494a782d328ded9ddd8404adfcd684/c=0-68-1529-1218/local/-/media/2018/08/28/TennGroup/Nashville/636710449787549815-September-Calendar-76.JPG?width=320&height=240"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/670a5af4545990e7de58a5151d6d388ddd3515b1/c=0-157-1529-1021/local/-/media/2018/08/28/TennGroup/Nashville/636710449787549815-September-Calendar-76.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Staff Report"], "canonical_link": "https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/09/20/maroon-5-super-bowl-halftime-show-pick-nfl-adam-levine/1366115002/", "title": "Maroon 5 perform at Super Bowl halftime with help from Travis Scott, Big Boi", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=526094470, app-argument=https://www.tennessean.com/story/news/2018/09/20/maroon-5-super-bowl-halftime-show-pick-nfl-adam-levine/1366115002/news", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"title": "Maroon 5 perform at Super Bowl halftime with help from Travis Scott, Big Boi", "description": "Maroon 5 performed at halftime of the Super Bowl in Atlanta with Travis Scott, Big Boi", "site_name": "The Tennessean", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/670a5af4545990e7de58a5151d6d388ddd3515b1/c=0-157-1529-1021/local/-/media/2018/08/28/TennGroup/Nashville/636710449787549815-September-Calendar-76.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "description": "Maroon 5 performed at halftime of the Super Bowl in Atlanta with Travis Scott, Big Boi", "twitter": {"site": "@Tennessean", "creator": "@Tennessean", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537398000.0, "source": "https://www.tennessean.com", "summary": ""}
