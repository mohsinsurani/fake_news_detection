Samir Hussein / WireImage\n\nThe Duke of Cambridge\u2019s son, Prince George, 4, and daughter Princess Charlotte, 3, seemed to be having a ball as they cheered on their dad with their mom, the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge was there to oversee all the fun. Mark Cuthbert / UK Press via Getty Images\n\nBoth Prince William and Prince Harry have been scheduled to play in a series of polo matches this summer to raise funds and awareness for a variety of causes they support. This particular game was the Maserati Royal Charity Polo Trophy at Beaufort Park in Gloucester, England, which raised money for the Royal Marsden cancer hospital and Centrepoint, a homeless youth charity \u2014 both charities William supports.\n\nAnd while Prince William was busy on the field, his kids really stole the show from the sidelines.\n\nPrincess Charlotte had her mini sunglasses in tow. Mark Cuthbert / UK Press via Getty Images\n\nGeorge, looking casual yet preppy with his dark blue polo shirt and khaki shorts, ran around with his little sister who sported a pale pink dress and no shoes most of the time. The two looked carefree and happy as they smiled and laughed together.\n\nPrince George of Cambridge and Princess Charlotte of Cambridge were having quite the fun running around at a polo event! Samir Hussein / Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge was there to oversee all the fun, donning a pale blue dress and tan wedges as she held her kids and assisted with their activities.\n\nPrince George had some fun with playing with a slinky. Mark Cuthbert / UK Press via Getty Images\n\nAt one point, George was seen playing with a slinky, while another moment showed the two kids jumping over a curb. They may be royal, but that doesn\u2019t stop them from being just like any other kid.\n\nBoth little ones had fun jumping over a small curb too! Mark Cuthbert / UK Press via Getty Images\n\nThis weekend has been a busy one for the prince and princess as they attended their grandmother Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s annual birthday celebration yesterday. At Trooping the Colour, the two seemed to be having a blast, making silly faces with their cousin Savannah Phillips, 7, as they stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace.\n\nTheir littlest brother Louis, who was born April 23, stayed back from all the festivities, but we have a feeling when he gets bigger, he\u2019ll be right there alongside them having a grand old time!", "images":
