So here goes\u2026. I am pregnant!!\u201d Platten began in her caption. \u201cI can\u2019t believe I\u2019m finally typing these words \u2013 I have wanted to share this news for months.\u201d\n\n\u201cAs I thought about how to share what I have been experiencing, I became paralyzed about doing it the exact, perfect way \u2014 how to express all of my total bliss and yet all this fear too?\u201d she continued.\n\n\u201cI finally realized that I can\u2019t worry about making being ME comfortable for everybody else, I have to share this journey MY WAY: with honesty, vulnerability, love and an open heart,\u201d Platten wrote.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

It\u2019s a total miracle that I\u2019m growing a human and my husband and I couldn\u2019t be more thrilled,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut, I have also had an incredibly difficult spring and summer with serious nausea, exhaustion, constant sickness and all the awful symptoms no one wants to really talk about when sharing the \u2018perfect blessed journey\u2019 of pregnancy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was so afraid that if I shared that part (the difficulty of flying and performing while puking in green rooms and airplanes) that I\u2019d seem ungrateful somehow when I\u2019m actually crazy full of gratitude \u2014 I\u2019m just HUMAN,\u201d Platten explained. \u201cHuman emotions are complex. We can feel more than one thing at once you know? We can hold both love and wonder and aw and joy, but also frustration and sickness and fear and darker stuff too and it\u2019s normal!\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWith all the mystery and wonder around this, one thing that has been abundantly clear to me: this little unbelievable soul that I haven\u2019t even met yet is going to be my biggest teacher in the world and I cannot wait to learn.\u201d\n\nNeilson Barnard/Getty\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Rachel Platten Opens Up About the Emotional Stories She Receives from Her Fans\n\n\n\nThe Wildfire singer \u2014 who released her sophomore album Waves last October \u2014 previously opened up to PEOPLE about how her husband helped inspire her song \u201cCollide.\u201d\n\n\u201d \u2018Collide\u2019 is about not wanting to hide yourself and being super comfortable with the person that you\u2019re with \u2014 so comfortable that you want to leave the lights on,\u201d she said. \u201cI wrote it on a day when I was feeling extra into my husband and how he makes me feel perfect in my skin.\u201d", "images":
