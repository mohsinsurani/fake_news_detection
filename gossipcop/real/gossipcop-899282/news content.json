The shocking addition to the flood of stories regarding sexual impropriety in Hollywood, Washington and beyond began on Monday (Dec. 4) when Heller posted a lengthy tweet in which she described her alleged assault at the hands of someone she described as a close friend, later revealing it to be Martinez.\n\nExplore Explore Melanie Martinez See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news\n\nEarly Tuesday morning (Dec. 5) Martinez wrote back, categorically denying Heller\u2019s claim. \u201cI am horrified and saddened by the statements and story told tonight by Timothy Heller, Martinez wrote. \u201cWhat she and I shared was a close friendship for a period of time. We came into each other\u2019s lives as we were both starting our careers as artists, and we tried to help each other.

The thought of accepting that my best friend raped me seems insane,\u201d Heller wrote. \u201cBut I began to get responses I wasn\u2019t expecting. Concerned ones. It\u2019s hard to say someone you loved raped you.
