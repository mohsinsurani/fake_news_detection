After making it to the final 3, her ex-boyfriend Ross Jirgl showed up in Peru and proposed; Kufrin declined.[10] She was initially chosen by Luyendyk as the winner and accepted his proposal at the end of the season.[11] However, Luyendyk dumped Kufrin for the runner-up Lauren Burnham before the season finished airing.[3] The break-up was filmed and the raw, unedited footage was shown on the first night of the two-night finale,[12] a first for The Bachelor.[13]\n\nResponse [ edit ]\n\nAfter Luyendyk ended his engagement with Kufrin on air, Minnesota State Representative Drew Christensen fans raised over $6,000 for Kufrin through the Venmo app, which Kufrin in turn donated to Stand Up to Cancer. Her donation was matched by ABC[14] and later matched again by Katie Couric.[15] The Bachelor season 20 lead, Ben Higgins, also pledged to donate the profits from each bag of coffee sold from his company for a 24-hour period.[16] The day after the breakup aired, 12 billboards went up in Kufrin's hometown of Minneapolis, Minnesota, as well as 4 in Los Angeles and 1 in Times Square, all showing their support for Kufrin and disgust at Luyendyk's actions.[17] During the March 10, 2018 episode of Saturday Night Live, Cecily Strong portrayed Kufrin in the cold-open, parodying the break-up.[18]\n\nThe Bachelorette [ edit ]\n\nKufrin was announced as the Bachelorette on March 6, 2018, on ABC's After the Final Rose special.[3] The season premiered on May 28, 2018.[19] In the end, Kufrin chose Garrett Yrigoyen over runner-up Blake Horstmann.[20] During the finale, she and Yrigoyen were given a minivan from ABC as a gift.[21] The couple were engaged and moved to Carlsbad, California, where they lived with their adopted corgi, Minno.[22] On September 1, 2020, Kufrin and Yrigoyen announced the end of their engagement.[23]\n\nBachelor in Paradise [ edit ]\n\nKufrin made a brief appearance during season five of Bachelor in Paradise to give advice to the girls and give closure to Colton Underwood.[24] On August 9, 2021, Becca was confirmed to be a contestant on season seven.[25] She split from her partner Thomas Jacobs in week 6.
