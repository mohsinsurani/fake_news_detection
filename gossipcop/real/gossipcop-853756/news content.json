(Tomorrow is their first anniversary!)\n\nPippa was glowing in a mint green and pink floral \u201cHepburn\u201d silk dress by The Fold as she held her husband\u2019s hand while walking into the service with mom, Carole Middleton, dad, Michael Middleton and brother, James Middleton.\n\nNews of Pippa\u2019s (now officially Pippa Matthews) pregnancy broke just days before big sister Kate was admitted to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital in London last month, where she gave birth to Prince Louis on April 23. Pippa and James are expecting their first child together in the fall.\n\nJames Gourley/Shutterstock\n\nPippa made headlines for the dress she wore to Kate\u2019s royal wedding in 2011. For today\u2019s wedding, the mom-to-be arrived with a barely-there baby bump in a long sleeve mint dress with a drop waist, pleated blush skirt and floral designs. The dress was not a maternity dress, and Charlotte Sutcliffe-Smith, PR for The Fold told PEOPLE, \u201cWe are absolutely delighted she has worn it.\u201d\n\nShe wore her hair in a low bun with a small side braid tucked into it and her makeup natural, as she typically does.\n\nKate Middleton on her wedding day.

Be sure to keep up with all of PEOPLE\u2019s royal wedding coverage and don\u2019t forget to check out everything you need to know about Meghan Markle\u2019s perfect style.\n\nOf course, to top it all off, Pippa accessorized with a dusty rose fascinator with small white flowers, strappy heels and a small clutch of the same shade that perfectly pulled together her elegant look. Matthews looked dapper in the same pale blue suit that he wore to his wedding as he walked beside his radiant wife.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Pippa Middleton Is Reportedly Pregnant with Her First Child \u2014 at the Same Time as Sister Kate!\n\nHarry and Meghan were present at Pippa and James\u2019 wedding this time last year. While Harry didn\u2019t bring Meghan to the church ceremony, he did pick her up back in London to bring her to the larger wedding reception at the Middleton family home.\n\nTheImageDirect.com\n\nWatch our full special, Meghan and Harry \u2013 a Fairy-Tale Wedding, on PeopleTV, now available on PeopleTV.com and on your favorite streaming device.\n\nWhile Pippa\u2019s wedding wasn\u2019t a royal one, it did share a few things in common with Markle\u2019s big day \u2014 namely, Prince George and Princess Charlotte as an adorable page boy and little bridesmaid!\n\nAfter the royal ceremony, all guests are invited to attend a reception in St. George\u2019s Hall within Windsor Castle. Later tonight, the couple will change into evening clothes and join the 200 guests closest to the newlyweds for a private reception given by Prince Charles at Frogmore House on the castle grounds.",
