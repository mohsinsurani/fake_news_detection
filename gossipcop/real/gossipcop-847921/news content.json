Stay away from me.\n\nI just wanna know why you left.\n\nJames is going to work at the facility.\n\n- Can he take you there? - Please stop lying.\n\nYou act like everything is great, and it is not.\n\n- Are you okay? - My stomach.\n\n- Hello.\n\n- Oh, my god.\n\nSorry about the tie on the door.\n\nNo, you're not.\n\nThese last few days have just been killing me.\n\nI will make up for it.\n\nEvery minute we've waited.\n\nI don't think that this is the right fit anymore.\n\nAre you firing me? I'm gonna give you the movie that I've been dreaming about.\n\nMegan is your star.\n\nI'm not gonna actually act in the movie at all.\n\nOh.\n\nMegan, welcome to Creative Partners.\n\nIs that real? If you had to ask, does it matter? Sure, it does.\n\nWhy? 'cause if it's fake, it's fake.\n\nSmart, principled, no bullshit.\n\nIs that the New Yorker in you, Or is that the narrative you crafted at him? Are you with the institute? I did the weekend intensive.\n\nWe all did.\n\nTerence is an amazing talent, isn't he? Yeah.\n\nYeah, he is.\n\nUh, speaking of no bullshit, Has anyone here seen any of my work? You think we just rolled out the red carpet for you Because you're Kyle's fianc\u00c3\u00a9e? Well, I know you did, but I asked about my work.\n\nWhat there is of it, yeah.\n\nWe have seen it.\n\nYou've made the best of small opportunities, But now your time has come.\n\nWe all believe that \"Technicolor Highway\" Is gonna make you a star.\n\nSeparate and apart from kyle.\n\nSo where do you fit in? We're gonna make you an icon.\n\nOh, no, I don't need to be an icon, I Look, I just wanna get my hands on great projects That I can lose myself in.\n\nMegan, we're the biggest agency in the world.\n\nGetting your hands on great projects will not be a problem.\n\nGetting you cast is something else.\n\nYeah, that's my job.\n\nIt's true.\n\nThank god you're talented.\n\nBut listen, when you're the face of Prada, And Bulgari, and the charity of your choosing When you are a goodwill ambassador to the world, I promise you, your job gets a lot easier.\n\nIf you don't like the word \"icon\" then don't use it.\n\nThink of it as brand.\n\nMegan Morrison Like, Marilyn Monroe.\n\nShe died at 36.\n\nShe had the wrong agent.\n\nIt's not just about being sought after.\n\nYour brand, if we craft it correctly, Gives you control.\n\nAnd longevity.\n\nSo the real Megan can focus on what she wants, What really matters.\n\nDude! Why would you fire yourself from your own movie? Right? It's it's I'm sorry.\n\nIt just it seems unwise on so many levels.\n\nNo, I get it.\n\nYou know, I just I thought it was more important to focus on directing.\n\nAnd, uh And let Megan carry the film.\n\nAnd you you honestly think she can do that? Put people in the seats? Oh, Megan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s gonna blow everybody away.\n\nOh, wow.\n\nI wish I wish everybody could've seen the man's face When he said that.\n\nI-I'm so inspired I feel like I can just run Through a brick wall right now.\n\nThe power of truth, ladies and gentlemen.\n\nOkay, so tell me this.\n\nDoes Megan get a say in who takes your place? You know, we are, uh we're gonna find the perfect person.\n\nI promise.\n\nAll right, well, I happen to be available, by the way.\n\nI'd love to meet this perfect person who's replacing you.\n\nYou don't like Howie for the part? You know, that would be funny if you weren't saying no To every actor that I suggest.\n\nThey don't wanna audition, they're not doing the movie.\n\nPeriod.\n\nSo did you get the big standing o? I did, and then they promised me the world.\n\nAh, well, they pretty much represent the world.\n\nWhat do you think? It's very compelling.\n\nA little disgusting.\n\nIt's a lot to process.\n\nOkay, well, why don't we go to the beach? I'll clear my afternoon.\n\nNo, you don't have to do that.\n\nI'm on the other side of town.\n\nAnd I have a bunch of errands to run.\n\nWe could talk about it tonight.\n\nOkay, whatever you want.\n\nIs everything okay with you two? Of course.\n\nLittle stuff no big deal.\n\nYou sure? Because it would be awfully hard to choose a love interest For her if you two weren't Solid.\n\nWell, we're solid enough.\n\nJust literally trying to find the right actor, Deann.\n\nAnd there isn't a part of you that's a little worried About history repeating itself? No.\n\nAnd do me a favor Let's keep history in the past, Where it belongs.\n\nThat's one way to release stress, I guess.\n\nOh, babe, that's not what that was.\n\nNot completely.\n\nHow do you know these things? We spend one weekend a year together.\n\nThat's not nothing.\n\nSo Tell me.\n\nUgh, this movie.\n\nIt's like on existential crisis after another, And it It's just It's so personal for Kyle.\n\nIt's like he can't see things rationally.\n\nWell, like what kind of things? Well No.\n\nYou are leaving soon, and I am not gonna lie in bed with you Bitching about Kyle, because I do that with Terence.\n\nHmm.\n\nLucky him.\n\nBabe, these are our lives.\n\nI would've loved to have had you in my bed When Wes was in rehab.\n\nSo we could've talked about my failings as a mother.\n\nStop.\n\nYou know you're the only reason he's still alive.\n\nHe's alive.\n\nI don't know, I just worry.\n\nNo, we're not doing this.\n\nWhat? Worry what? Why are you laughing? Because you're right.\n\nI should save this shit for book club.\n\nYeah, book club.\n\nYeah, that's what I need.\n\nI wanna talk about you.\n\nI wanna know what you dreamt about last night.\n\nI wanna cook you dinner.\n\nSee, this is the bad part about you staying longer.\n\nIt's the worst kind of tease.\n\nWell, you know, technically, I don't have to be on site until the summer.\n\nI mean, the vineyard has plenty of business in L.\n\nA.\n\n, And Wes is close by.\n\nYou wanna stay until summer? Yeah.\n\nWhat's going on with you? It's been a tough year.\n\nI I don't know.\n\nI wanna spend more time with the people that I love.\n\nMore than just one weekend.\n\nWhy do you look so terrified at that? - No, I'm not it's not - Yeah, you do.\n\nNo, no, it's not that.\n\nIt's just that Look, when you leave Terence and I get there eventually, But it's a rough transition.\n\nIf you stay, we're talking about a full-blown affair.\n\nYeah.\n\nThat's what it would be.\n\nMace, my marriage might be dysfunctional, But I can't afford to ruin it not now.\n\nI'm not asking you to.\n\nBabe, I just don't wanna leave you right now.\n\n- So let's not be afraid to admit it.\n\n- Let's say it together I'm gonna be great.\n\nI'm gonna be great.\n\n- I'm gonna be great.\n\n- I'm gonna be great.\n\nCome on, guys, let's So are you watching the speech Or are you just counting the views? I'm gonna be great! You know, he's always had that.\n\nThat magnetic thing that people are attracted to.\n\nI saw it the day I met him.\n\nHe was nobody, he had nothing, but he had that.\n\nHmm, and you're surprised by the response you're getting? When it gets to 15 million call scholastic.\n\nOr maybe I will.\n\nUm I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m all packed up and ready to go, I just wanted to say thank you.\n\nOh, are you going somewhere?

It's momordica charantia.\n\nIt purifies the blood.\n\nThank you.\n\nAnd thank you again for having me over.\n\nThis is really lovely.\n\nUm I'm really sorry about the way I approached you the other night.\n\nI have to be careful about who I interact with.\n\nThe world is extremely toxic.\n\nBut that can't be you.\n\nKyle wouldn't love you if it was.\n\nThere are so many things I wanna ask you, um Can we start with Terence? He's done things that should've destroyed me and Kyle, And it makes me wonder if he did something To make you leave.\n\nThey poisoned my food and water.\n\nYou were poisoned? By who? - By IHM people? - They'd break into my trailer.\n\nNever the same person Not once.\n\nI mean, there were always new people That isn't normal.\n\nDid you tell Kyle about this, or anyone? Kyle wasn't there.\n\nI mean, I had to fire everybody.\n\nI still have problems eating.\n\nYou were having stomach problems, like Like sharp pains? Lisbeth? Would you like some tea? It's momordica charantia.\n\nIt purifies the blood.\n\nOh.\n\nYou already have some.\n\nWell, you were telling me that you were having Eating problems, and I've been having these sharp pains I have to be very careful about who I interact with.\n\nThe world is extremely toxic.\n\nBut that can't be you hmm.\n\nYou Kyle loves you, doesn't he? Yeah.\n\nThe cake is Godzilla attacking the city.\n\nAha, right, yes.\n\nSexy now.\n\nRight, you're a vampire, biting the tip.\n\nYes, thank you.\n\nAwesome.\n\nThank you.\n\nLet's set up for the next bit.\n\nHey I'm Kyle.\n\nHey, I'm Megan.\n\nI think we have the same agent.\n\nAh, maybe that's why we keep bumping into each other.\n\nWhat're you doing later? Just being honored at some Hollywood party Where Xavier Hughes is performing.\n\n- You know, the you-she.\n\n- Ooh, I like parties.\n\n- I like you.\n\n- Oh, you do? Did you wanna talk about schedule? - Yes.\n\n- Not really.\n\nUh, the coffee with the Twitter people tomorrow Do you think we could push them to today after 3:00? I would love to talk to them before the gala tonight.\n\nThe agency has you at the gift suite at 3:00.\n\nI thought that was after lunch.\n\nIt was, but Stacy at Balenciaga has strep throat, So the styling got pushed to 1:00.\n\nSo when are we doing the phone call? Can you do it in the car on the way? Well, it's not gonna be great for you.\n\nNo, it's fine, I could listen to music While I prep for the Seacrest thing.\n\n- Hmm.\n\n- There you go.\n\nHey, Kyle, can I steal you for a second? Yeah.\n\nI'll be back.\n\nSee if Twitter can do a call.\n\nMaybe on the way to your reads later? Thank you.\n\n- They're bluffing.\n\n- I doubt it.\n\nLook, you took yourself out of the movie.\n\nYou won't cast somebody that they like.\n\nI'd pull my money too if I were them.\n\nOkay, let's just say they back out.\n\nHow much of my own money do I have to put up? - We are not having that conversation.\n\n- It's just a question.\n\nIf you use your money, you have nobody to answer to.\n\nI love you, but I am not letting you direct Your first feature film unchecked.\n\nI'm sorry, but if we lose Jason and Vic, We are shutting down.\n\nLook, we have to cast somebody.\n\nI think it should be Logan Travers.\n\nOoh, is that the next cover of \"Esquire\"? - \"Vanity Fair.\n\n\" - Oops still, wow.\n\nI know, I know.\n\nCreative Partners does not play.\n\nI've been with them for two months, And they have me, like, everywhere.\n\nSo how are you feeling about the wedding? It is hard to say.\n\nUntil Terence is out of the picture, Everything is just temporary.\n\nYeah.\n\nI mean, Kyle and I are definitely having more fun, But, I don't know, we've been so busy, Sometimes I forget that I still don't trust him, you know? Like, not completely.\n\n- Ow.\n\n- Megan? Are you still having those? Occasionally.\n\nWell, what did the doctor say? You haven't been to the doctor? It's been two months.\n\nWhat the hell are you doing? I'm okay, and I'm doing what I need to be doing right now.\n\nYou're not okay.\n\nYou're running yourself into the ground.\n\nI'm building my brand.\n\nAnd a career, okay? When shit goes down with Terence, I'm gonna need protection.\n\nWhat's going on with James? He's finally back in town.\n\nWe're having dinner tonight.\n\n- That's my girl.\n\n- Yeah.\n\nWhat's the matter? I don't know, it's weird.\n\nJust like full-on playing someone like this? I'm not used to lying.\n\nThe key is to be as honest as possible.\n\nYou only lie if you absolutely have to.\n\nOkay.\n\nLet's identify our feelings.\n\n- Terence.\n\n- Sadness.\n\n- Deann? - Distant.\n\nKeep trying.\n\nLoneliness.\n\nGood.\n\nEverybody present.\n\nLet's talk.\n\nMisaligned narratives without pairing.\n\nMisaligned narratives is the symptom.\n\nThe root is an absence of intimacy.\n\nLet's talk about the emotional first.\n\nWell, let's talk about the physical intimacy first, Because that's truly what's been absent here.\n\nYou really just can't let her lead? It's okay.\n\nWe'll get there, one way or the other.\n\nYou aren't having sex with each other? Not since the tie on the doorknob.\n\nTwo months ago, and not much before that.\n\nIs that supposed to justify the tie on the door? I don't understand this emotional reaction.\n\nI really don't.\n\nWe're not polyamorous, we're open.\n\nFeelings for each other and nobody else.\n\nI follow the rules, and you won't have sex with me Because of a tie on the door? - It's not rational.\n\n- It was a slap in the face.\n\n- It was a head's up.\n\n- Okay.\n\nObviously there is an emotional component to the tie, But an open relationship can't work unless you are having sex With each other regularly.\n\nSo what do we need to get us there? I already called the cops.\n\nIf you run now, you can make it.\n\nKeys.\n\nAll right, man.\n\nAll right, all right, take it easy, man.\n\nTake it easy.\n\n- Give me the key.\n\n- Okay, okay.\n\nGod damn it.\n\nGet it.\n\n- Okay, okay, okay.\n\n- Get the key! Come on.\n\nI didn't say get up.\n\nDon't get up.\n\nI said, don't look at me! Uh.\n\n[INDISTINCT CHATTER AND SHOUTING.]\n\n- Kyle, Kyle! - Megan, over here.\n\n- Kyle, over here.\n\n- Meg, look over here.\n\nAre you okay? Yeah.\n\n- - It is a thrill for me.\n\nMegan is such an amazing person, And I'm just really excited that I get to watch her Accomplish so many great things.\n\nSpeaking of which, can you tell me a little bit About your wedding? Like, when is it, where, who's invited? Soon, it's a secret, and, uh, everybody we love.\n\nThanks.\n\nDomestic violence and abuse is obviously a huge issue All over the world, but by acting locally, We can directly impact the people and the families Who need it most.\n\n- Great, thanks.\n\n- Thank you.\n\n- Good night.\n\n- You were born for this.\n\nAh, well, I definitely learned a few things from you.\n\nI love you.\n\nAren't you two adorable? If I may direct your attention to the fireplace, You will see your new co-star.\n\nOh, Logan Travers.\n\n- You invited him? - I invited him.\n\nI sent him a script last week.\n\nI spent 20 minutes talking to him about his dog; It's a rescue mastiff.\n\nLook, he is interested in the part.\n\nAnd he's good.\n\nWhat do you think? Meh.\n\nOkay, more importantly, Jason and Vic are interested in him.\n\nOh, what, did you already negotiate his contract, - As well? - It's called \"teeing him up.\n\n\" Listen, just go talk to him.\n\nPlease? - He's expecting you.\n\n- It's just a conversation.\n\nIf you don't like him, you can say no.\n\nDo you remember this place? It's where we met.\n\nNot that long ago, in fact.\n\nOh, my god.\n\nThat thing for the NRDC? Yeah, you were schlepping hors d'oeuvres And mouthing off to studio heads.\n\nNow, listen to me.\n\nI knew you were special when we met.\n\nI knew you were capable of this and so much more, But \"Technicolor Highway\" is your launch pad.\n\nWithout it, none of this happens.\n\nI'm well aware.\n\nOkay, are you also aware that the investors Are fed up with Kyle and wanna pull the financing? What? No.\n\nHe didn't tell me that.\n\nOf course, he didn't.\n\nLook, he might be in denial about this, But we are out of time.\n\nIf we're gonna make this movie And keep your arrow pointing up, Logan Travers has to happen.\n\nKyle can't say no anymore.\n\n- You want me to talk to him.\n\n- Yes, talk to Kyle.\n\nTalk to Logan.\n\nWhatever it takes.\n\nMegan, this is your movie.\n\nAnd your everything else.\n\nUh, whiskey.\n\nActually, I'm pretty sure Kyle West is god.\n\nHe memorized the whole speech.\n\nI watch it every morning before I run.\n\n\"We wanna realize the greatest version of ourselves.\n\n\" \"That's how we can accomplish unimaginable things.\n\n\" No bullshit, my times are down.\n\nWhere have you been? I told you I was gonna need your help with Kyle tonight.\n\nOut and about.\n\nDrinking? What else? I didn't come here to have a goddamn discussion.\n\nHooper is seriously, like, half the dudes That I grew up with in Kentucky, man.\n\nYou know, tough on the outside, broken on the inside.\n\nAnd looking for that someone to hang onto, But they don't know how.\n\nYou know, nobody ever gave them the tools.\n\nYeah, that's definitely Hooper.\n\nI'm guessing it's you too? Little bit? Come on, we're in this business to tell our stories, right? My story's actually Clyde's.\n\nOh, the hot girl who kills herself at the end.\n\nYeah.\n\nWow, okay.\n\nThat's deep.\n\nThis is a lot of talent to process at one time.\n\nThat's exactly how I just felt.\n\nI don't know how you live with this guy.\n\nAw, he makes it easy, trust me.\n\nMegan Morrison, meet Logan Travers.\n\nKyle and I caught \"Park Circle\" At the Venice film festival last year, And we just loved it.\n\nSo nice of you to say.\n\nChardonnay, please.\n\n- Logan Travers.\n\n- Nasim.\n\nWhat're you doing here? I'll be honest, I'm straight up using you So I can meet these two.\n\nCongratulations.\n\nThis is so exciting.\n\nAnd I love your charity.\n\nThank you.\n\nKyle and Megan, meet Nasim Anand.\n\nThis is my old partner in crime.\n\nWe did a horrible movie together.\n\nBut I just have to say, I am totally obsessed With the Institute of the Higher Mind right now.\n\nOh, that sounds unhealthy.\n\nYeah, my boyfriend says the same thing.\n\nBut, you know, the speech you gave in that video Was amazing.\n\nYou're really inspirational.\n\nWho's your boyfriend? There he is.\n\nYou know, I discovered this one.\n\nI discovered you.\n\nYou were very small, But I thought to myself, he's gonna be great.\n\nThat's right.\n\nYes, this man showed me the way.\n\nCome on, let me buy you a drink.\n\nLet's go.\n\nExcuse us.\n\nOh.\n\nJeez, how much have you had? I almost died.\n\nYeah, well, tomorrow you're gonna wish you died.\n\nLook, let's get you some coffee, all right? To have him here tonight, So please welcome the incredible Xavier Hughes! That's my boyfriend.\n\n- It's cool, right? - Yeah.\n\nXavier Hughes playing at an event where you're being honored.\n\nHis first album best break-up therapy in the world.\n\nOh, my god, \"buried under a blanket and barely alive\".\n\nWhat do you think, Mr.\n\nTravers, Are we gonna do this movie together? Shoot, I hope so.\n\nIt's kind of up to el jefe at this point, though.\n\nHe's a little hard to read, huh? Kyle loves you.\n\nBelieve me.\n\nWell, you are extremely believable.\n\nJust propped your drunk husband up With a triple cappuccino.\n\nWhat the hell is wrong with him? I have no idea, But they look cute together, don't they? What do you think? Megan, Logan.\n\nCan Friendspace Live just grab a moment before the ceremony begins? - Yeah, of course! - Okay.\n\nWe are streaming live here from the Rising Women of Hollywood gala with Megan Morrison and Logan Travers.\n\n- Hi, you guys.\n\n- Hi, Friendspace.\n\nHi, there.\n\nNow, are you guys talking business or are you just appreciating how incredible Xavier Hughes is? Well, a little bit of both.\n\nMegan, you have a huge movie coming up, and you're about to marry one of the biggest stars in the entire world.\n\nTalk to us a little bit about how working with Megan? Megan, Megan.\n\nHey, Megan, Megan.\n\nHey, Megan.\n\nHey, sweetie.\n\nNot right now.\n\nThree hours since Megan Morrison collapsed at the A-list Hollywood event and we already have Conflicting insider reports of drugs, pregnancy, and an eating disorder.\n\n1.\n\n8 million live views.\n\nThe agency keeps pestering me for answers Why? Because the new client launch fell apart? Screw 'em.\n\nThis insider's going with drugs.\n\nNo, it's not drugs, all right? I would know.\n\nYeah, that's the problem You think you know everything, Until you realize you don't know anything.\n\nAnd this is Jason and Vic for the third time.\n\nWe need to talk about Logan.\n\nEh, not now we don't.\n\nKyle, this fiasco just makes things worse.\n\nPlease, just let me give them something to stop the carnage.\n\nHow is she? She'll be okay here for the night.\n\nThis is for the pain.\n\nIf you can convince her to take it.\n\nShe wouldn't accept anything from me.\n\nAny idea what's going on? I took some blood.\n\nI'll run it over the zombies At the lab and be back in the morning.\n\nShe doesn't wanna admit it, but she's wound up like a spring.\n\nWhatever you could do to keep her relaxed would be good.\n\nGood night.\n\nIt's okay.\n\nYoo-hoo.\n\nYou're very focused.\n\nYou having a hard time deciding? Um There's no rush.\n\nYou can just talk to me instead.\n\nI'm sorry, um I'm I\u00e2\u0080\u0099m excited to see you.\n\nIt's just, I feel like we've kind of skipped over something.\n\nWhat'd we skip? The explanation for why you ghosted me at work.\n\nFor weeks, and then how we got here from there.\n\nI'm sorry.\n\nYour feelings are completely valid.\n\nBut but shouldn't we just focus on moving forward? Hmm? We should, we should.\n\nI I give that advice every day.\n\n- But - Look.\n\nThis is the first job I've had Where I don't feel like I'm settling In any way.\n\nAnd I'm scared.\n\nI got scared of a personal relationship ruining that.\n\nThat's all.\n\nAnd I didn't handle it well.\n\nWell, if you're scared, then then No.\n\nI'm settled in now.\n\nAnd I think there's room for both.\n\nOrdinary stress can really cause that kind of pain? There's nothing ordinary about her narrative right now.\n\nYou need to find ways to manage the pressure.\n\nYou might start by taking something off your plate.\n\nHe's talking about the movie.\n\nHe's gonna tell them that I'm not up for it.\n\n- God damn it.\n\n- Relax.\n\nYou're jumping the gun.\n\nHe's IHM, Shaun.\n\nDon't tell me I'm wrong for thinking bad things might happen.\n\nIt's not gonna help.\n\nYou need to chill, Megan.\n\nIf you don't wanna believe the doctor, fine, But believe your body.\n\nIt's telling you the same thing.\n\nAll right, maybe I'm just getting stomach cancer, Like my mom had.\n\nWow, seriously? You need to stop spinning out.\n\nOkay? I actually have some potential good news.\n\nI think I can convince James to take me to the facility.\n\nSo dinner went well? He's going back up tomorrow.\n\nHopefully I'll learn something that can actually help us out.\n\nAnd take something off your plate.\n\nBecause he's not right for the part! How many times do I have to say it? No one's gonna force Logan down my throat.\n\nNot Jason and Vic, and not you.\n\nI will kill this movie completely.\n\nThat is exactly what you've been doing For the past two months.\n\nWhoa, whoa, what's going on? Jason and Vic want an answer on Logan Travers And apparently that answer is \"No.\n\n\" - What? Why? - You know what? I don't wanna listen to this anymore.\n\nI have worked my ass off on this movie.\n\nAnd so has she.\n\nBut none of that's gonna matter Because you let your shit get in the way.\n\nDon't look at me! I said don't look at me! When Deann said you let your shit get in the way, What'd she mean? She thinks I'm jealous about Logan.\n\nOr anybody else up for the part.\n\nSounds a little simplistic.\n\nYeah, except for when I met Lisbeth on set, I was single, and she was dating the director.\n\nLisbeth.\n\nYeah.\n\nIt got really dramatic.\n\nAnd we all got caught up in it.\n\nAnd you're afraid the same thing's gonna happen With me and Logan? That's Deann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s theory, yeah.\n\nI'm asking you.\n\nMe? Right, \"me\" as in me.\n\nYou know, I've been pretending to be other people For a long time, But when I direct, I'm not gonna be able to hide behind an image anymore.\n\nThe way I think, the way I see the world It's all gonna be exposed.\n\nAnd the movie doesn't have to be perfect.\n\nYou know, nobody's perfect.\n\nBut it has to be right.\n\nWhy would I settle for anything less? You can't.\n\nYou know, Logan\u00e2\u0080\u0099s really good.\n\nI mean, the guy's talented.\n\nYou know, why why wouldn't I pull the trigger? Maybe Deann\u00e2\u0080\u0099s right.\n\nMaybe I am jealous.\n\nYou know We have a contract That forbids me from having an affair with a co-star, Or anyone else.\n\n- Yes, I do know that.\n\n- Mm-hmm.\n\nCome on, please.\n\nContracts get broken all the time.\n\nYeah, maybe by major movie stars Last year, I was a waitress.\n\nI'm not throwing away $10 million on a piece of ass.\n\nYou're probably the first person in Hollywood Ever to say that.\n\nYou know, that was really beautiful, what you said.\n\nAbout the movie being an expression of who you are on the inside.\n\nAnd you're right, It's something that people haven't seen before, But you showed it to me.\n\nAnd I loved it.\n\nAnd look, I know things have been crazy, But I feel like we're growing closer.\n\nThat feels really good.\n\nAnd I won't let anyone anyone get in the way of that.\n\nMe neither.\n\nOkay.\n\nSo Knowing that, how do you really feel about Logan Travers? Well, guess who's in the neighborhood.\n\nI swear, Berglund just invades me.\n\nYou have amazing taste.\n\nI'm gonna go to bed in a few minutes.\n\nYou okay? I mean, she's totally nice, just a bit much right now.\n\nYeah, we'll keep it short.\n\nWell, we're so glad that you're all right.\n\nI hope it's okay that we invited ourselves over.\n\nOh, no, no, it's very sweet.\n\nAnd bringing chocolate makes everything okay, so You know, I have this very strong feeling about you guys.\n\nLike, we're supposed to be friends, you know? - Something in your gut.\n\n- Yeah, exactly.\n\nI mean, we kind of match, don't we? You and Xavier are both big stars.\n\nMegan and I are both on the rise.\n\nBaby, it's not just about where we're all at with work.\n\nYou're right.\n\nI'm just waiting to find out if they're gonna make me a series regular, so - Mm.\n\n- Ugh.\n\nStressful.\n\nNo, no, it's not.\n\nIt's it's all a blessing, and I am just gonna let it go.\n\nWhew.\n\nSo I have been told that you have a Lavoie.\n\nActually, to be honest, I read about it.\n\nIt's upstairs.\n\nYou wanna see it? Uh, god, yes.\n\n- I'll I\u00e2\u0080\u0099ll wait here.\n\n- Okay.\n\nWe'll go in a minute.\n\nI know you must be exhausted.\n\nOh, it's okay.\n\nYou know, before I humiliated myself last night, I really enjoyed your set.\n\nI really am a very big fan.\n\nThank you.\n\nYou didn't humiliate yourself.\n\nAnd you didn't just lie to make me feel better.\n\nYou play? Oh, not me.\n\nKyle.\n\nAh.\n\nHey, you think he'd mind? Not at all.\n\nI would've offered, I just thought you might get tired Of people asking you to play.\n\nNope, I'ma get worried if people stop asking me to play.\n\nHmm.\n\nIt's a very interesting choice.\n\nWhat is? To put a piece with such strong energy here.\n\nIn the bedroom.\n\nHmm, I never really thought about it being anywhere else.\n\nI'm sure it's exactly where it's supposed to be.\n\nSo is this talent of yours God-given, or did you go to Julliard? No, no Julliard.\n\nMy mom taught me to play.\n\nShe must be amazing.\n\nYeah, she was.\n\nHow old were you? When she passed? Sweet 16.\n\nI was 19 when I lost my mom.\n\nHmm.\n\nWhenever I was sick, or feeling bad, I put my ear on the piano where mom played and sang, I'd feel the strings vibrating.\n\nThe click of the pedal.\n\nHer voice.\n\nI could feel all of it.\n\nAlways made me feel better.\n\nHey.\n\nHave you ever acted before? Can I DJ? Uh, sure.\n\n- Sweet.\n\n- Um, uh first Um I have to give you this.\n\nMm, what's that? It's a blindfold.\n\nI I can take you to the facility, But I can't let you know where it is.\n\nDon't you trust me? Of course, I do.\n\nIt's just You're not authorized.\n\nI'm the in-house counsel.\n\nI'm sure Terence wouldn't mind me knowing where the facility is, right? You're not authorized.\n\nDo you, um, still wanna go? Yeah! Let's go.\n\nTake me away, captain.\n\nHey.\n\nDo you need to shower? Eventually.\n\nBut I can wait till after lunch.\n\nDo you wanna shower now? It's a free country, for people like you anyway.\n\nPeople like me? People who can pretend they don't have problems.\n\nYou don't know anything about Those aren't the lines.\n\nHe's improvising.\n\nHe's a jazz musician.\n\nKyle'll work with him.\n\nWell, I don't need to talk to a therapist or a thief About my shit.\n\nHe's got something undeniable, though.\n\nAnd a whole lot of buzz right now.\n\nIt's actually kind of genius.\n\nSo you're happy? Well, Kyle's happy.\n\nJason and Vic are happy.\n\nSo yeah, I'm happy.\n\nGood, we'll have a productive session then.\n\nOh, I cancelled with Bella.\n\n- You cancelled? - Yeah.\n\nI have a backlog of work right now, And honestly, I don't think we need it.\n\nOkay, did we have sex at some point that I'm not aware of? We'll get there.\n\nI promise.\n\nLook, for me, it's just the stress of this movie More than anything else.\n\nBut things are headed in the right direction again.\n\nIt's not the sex that he's missing.\n\nIt's having things his way.\n\nControl.\n\nPersonally, I'd miss the sex.\n\nWhat? It's just easier.\n\nWhy make things complicated? You make everything easier.\n\nMm.\n\nI said don't look at me!
