He was charged with driving under the influence, possession of less than one ounce of marijuana and possession of drug-related objects.\n\nHis girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the car with him and was also arrested, PEOPLE confirms. She was charged with possession of marijuana, obstruction of law enforcement officers and possession of drug-related objects, according to the sheriff\u2019s office.\n\nBackstreet Boy Nick Carter shared a message to his younger brother on Twitter following news of the incident.\n\n\u201cTo my brother: I love u no matter what & if u feel the need to reach for help, I am here and willing to help you get better,\u201d Nick, 37, wrote. \u201cFamily isn\u2019t always easy, [but] we\u2019re all here for you.\u201d\n\nHabersham County Sheriff's Office via AP\n\nIn a public statement posted on Twitter Sunday night, Aaron made it clear that he didn\u2019t think his brother went about the situation in the right away.\n\n\u201cIf my own blood truly cared about my well-being, why wouldn\u2019t he call me directly and have a conversation instead of making this about him through a very public forum?\u201d he said in the statement. \u201cThat\u2019s not cool at all to use me for his PR and kick me while I am down. I love my family despite it through thick and thin.\u201d\n\nNick seemingly responded to the message by retweeting a post by Nick\u2019s wife, Lauren, which read, \u201cHey @aaroncarter have @itsmadisonp text me your new number since you changed it again!\u201d\n\nAaron\u2019s rep Jonathan Ward tells PEOPLE the popstar is reachable by his family \u2014 \u201cwhom he loves\u201d \u2014 at any time.\n\n\u201cNick and Lauren have his number \u2013 it hasn\u2019t changed. They last spoke on July 6,\u201d Ward tells PEOPLE exclusively. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t feel it was proper, what happened. You don\u2019t reach out through Twitter.\u201d\n\nAaron Carter also professed his innocence of all charges \u2013 and claimed he was targeted by police because he was famous.\n\nAccording to the statement, Carter said he was at an AutoZone in Georgia to fix a tire that was out of alignment on his car when police officers arrested him \u201cwith aggression.\u201d\n\nHe added that he has a license for medical marijuana for his anxiety and feels he was marked due to his fame.\n\n\u201cHe feels his \u2018celebrity\u2019 was targeted and an attorney will be retained in this matter,\u201d the statement said. \u201cThe video from AutoZone will prove that Aaron was not in a moving vehicle while arrested and charged with a DUI.\u201d\n\nMedical marijuana is legal in Georgia with a license. However, anxiety is not one of the 14 specific conditions covered.\n\nAllen Berezovsky/Getty Image\n\nThe singer was previously arrested for investigation of marijuana possession in 2008.\n\nCarter has previously said he \u201csmokes bud,\u201d but denied drinking or doing any other drugs.\n\nDuring a candid interview for an episode of Oprah: Where Are They Now? last year, Aaron admitted that he turned to drugs and alcohol to self-medicate for depression he experienced after his parents\u2019 divorce and his time on Dancing with the Stars.\n\n\u201cI started getting really heavy into drinking and was telling people, \u2018I\u2019m on a real bad path right now. I need help,\u2019 \u201d he explained.\n\nIn 2011, Aaron checked himself into the Betty Ford Center in Rancho Mirage, California \u201cto heal some emotional and spiritual issues he was dealing with,\u201d his manager at the time, Johnny Wright, previously said in a statement.\n\nAaron has been in the spotlight since recording his first album at age seven. He was just 12 when his song \u201cAaron\u2019s Party (Come Get It)\u201d dropped. It went triple platinum and made him an international sensation.", "images":
