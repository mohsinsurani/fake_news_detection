I said if I had fallen anywhere else, I would have been absolutely fine, but it\u2019s just because there was \u2026 I went to catch myself and I missed \u2026 I thought I just busted my lip. Then I walked inside and took the dog leashes off and took my coat off and went to go survey the damage and was like, \u201cOh, no!\u201d \u2026 It wasn\u2019t pretty.
