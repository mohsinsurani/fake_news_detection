She did not specify when the alleged incident took place.\n\n\u201cI never said yes. I said no, repeatedly,\u201d Heller wrote. \u201cBut she used her power over me, and broke me down. Just so there is no confusion, I was molested by my best friend.\u201d\n\nHeller said the recent wave of women coming forward with their stories of harassment and assault gave her encouragement that her account would be believed.\n\n\u201cGirls can rape girls,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBest friends can rape best friends.\u201d\n\nIn her statement, Martinez said both she and Heller were in pain and \u201cdealing with our individual demons\u201d at the time.\n\n\u201cShe never said no to what we chose to do together,\u201d Martinez said. \u201cAnd although we parted ways, I am sending her love and light always.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to both Heller and Martinez for additional comment.\n\nA rep for Martinez pointed CNN to the singer\u2019s statement on Twitter and said there was no additional comment at this time.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929104601-lisa-france-profile-image.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171206102554-melanie-martinez-timothy-heller-rape-allegations.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171206102554-melanie-martinez-timothy-heller-rape-allegations.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171206102554-melanie-martinez-timothy-heller-rape-allegations.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/entertainment/melanie-martinez-timothy-heller-rape/index.html", "title": "Melanie Martinez, former 'Voice' contestant, responds to Timothy Heller's rape allegation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Melanie Martinez, former 'Voice' contestant, responds to rape allegation | CNN", "description": "A former contestant from \"The Voice\" is denying a rape accusation made by another female singer.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171206102554-melanie-martinez-timothy-heller-rape-allegations.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/06/entertainment/melanie-martinez-timothy-heller-rape/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Melanie Martinez, former 'Voice' contestant, responds to rape allegation | CNN", "description": "A former contestant from \"The Voice\" is denying a rape accusation made by another female singer.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171206102554-melanie-martinez-timothy-heller-rape-allegations.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "A former contestant from \"The Voice\" is denying a rape accusation made by another female singer.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-06T22:02:26Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-06T22:02:26Z", "tag": "crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, sex and gender issues, sex crimes, sexual assault, society", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, sex and gender issues, sex crimes, sexual assault, society", "author": "Lisa Respers France", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512518400.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
