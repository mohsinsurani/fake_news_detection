The promo features snide comments from Shelton when he talks about Hudson\u2019s rookie win as a coach on The Voice U.K.\n\n\u201cI feel like Jennifer Hudson is coming from the minor leagues into the big-time boys here,\u201d says Shelton. \u201cShe was on The Voice UK, and she won, but this is different.\u201d\n\nWhich Coach will be the SHORE thing? #TheVoice returns September 25. A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice) on Aug 11, 2017 at 4:59pm PDT\n\nThe Dreamgirls star and former American Idol contestant is not intimidated by the country superstar\u2019s remarks. She is confident that her time on the British version of the show has prepared for a win in the States.\n\nThe question is, though, is the feud just all in fun for a promo video, or are Hudson\u2019s diva ways really causing problems on the set?\n\nAccording to reports Hudson is not getting along with the other judges, the contestants, or the crew. A source claims she is being intolerable by screaming at people to get her way, being disruptive, and causing delays. Hudson is so hard to work with that the insider claims everyone is hoping this will be her only season on the show.\n\nGirl looks like a dream. \ud83d\ude0d #TheVoice A post shared by NBC's The Voice (@nbcthevoice) on Sep 9, 2017 at 3:45pm PDT\n\nIf there really are problems on the set, the show is keeping it on the down low, and instead presenting a fun and playful, yet competitive vibe for the upcoming season.\n\nFor example, Shelton reveals at the end of the promo that he and his former rival turned best friend, coach Adam Levine, have decided to try to get along this season. The video featured the two professing their love for one another in a sarcastic attempt to mend fences.\n\nShelton and Levine have battled for years on the reality competition, but everyone knows the relationship is more of a bromance than a feud.\n\nCatch Blake Shelton, Jennifer Hudson, Miley Cyrus, and Adam Levine in action.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSeason 13 of The Voice premieres on Monday on NBC.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170926223309im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png",
