How are you feeling about the show\u2019s popularity? Was this something you expected?\n\nMichelle Cole: I\u2019m extremely proud of it. For me personally when I\u2019m doing a show at all \u2014 and I\u2019ve been doing this for about thirty-five years \u2014 I don\u2019t do a show thinking about what will happen next. I\u2019m always thinking, \u201cHow can I do my job?\u201d And I think that has worked well for me, as I\u2019m always giving it one hundred and twenty percent. Fortunately, most of the pilots I\u2019ve worked on have been picked up, but I do it because I enjoy it and I have a love for it. Even if this hadn\u2019t been picked up, I know it would have still looked great. When we were doing the pilot, we were under a little bit of pressure because we were shooting it in four days and we had a lot of setup. And we didn\u2019t quite know the show because we were trying to figure out characters. Every week, you\u2019re trying to develop your characters because every week you get that script that reveals them a little bit more. It\u2019s like dating. The exciting part is that I\u2019m unfolding these different layers of different characters. With Zoey, coming from her parents' home and going to college, we\u2019re seeing her blossom in front of us. When she was on black-ish, she had her other siblings that she was with, but we\u2019re getting to see her blossom on her own in this show. I\u2019m extremely proud of our hard work. Hair and makeup make me look great and I give them a huge shout out because they make the outfits look as I\u2019d like to call it \u201cmo\u2019 better\u201d. And Yara has a lot of input. I didn\u2019t know what to expect, but I know what I expected from me and my team.\n\nTV: It\u2019s one of my favorite new shows, so I\u2019d say all your hard work has absolutely paid off.\n\nMC: And that\u2019s the good part! It pretty much always pays off because whether it\u2019s good or bad, it\u2019s a learning process. Did we know it was going to be so big? Well, I think the best surprise is how successful it is.\n\nTV: And what you said before about black-ish, how Zoey has grown up and that transition going off on her own at school, I\u2019m wondering how you approached that. She\u2019s definitely taking more style risks and it\u2019s noticeable, but it still feels like her. How are you approaching the different phases of her life?\n\nMC: We did a lot of boards on each character and Yara does have a lot of input on how she feels. I\u2019ve also known her since the pilot, when she was fourteen years old. I\u2019ve seen in her own life and how she approaches style personally. When we see her take off to college in the first episode, she tells her father to get a life and that she\u2019s on her own. She hangs up on him and I think we see her start to take these risks. She\u2019s always had beautiful clothes and it\u2019s always been great fun to dress Zoey because she was already very stylish on black-ish. But here she\u2019s grown-up. She\u2019ll wear a robe with a Sade t-shirt underneath and then a scarf and big hoop earrings. We did take a bit more risks with a Gucci loafer and Zara PJ outfit, which was one of my favorites. I love that when she gets up in the morning that she doesn\u2019t really think about it: she just puts it on. She wears what she feels like wearing that day. She\u2019ll go from a sweater with a cotton blouse underneath to a fake fur, jeans, and some boots the next time we see her. We feature a lot of wonderful, big brand names, but it\u2019s more about her look and her style. We like mixing it up. Her risk is showing that she\u2019s growing up. When you see her in the first scenes of the show, she\u2019s trying on different tops when she\u2019s going to her night class. She ends up going with a sweatshirt.\n\nWe also start to see her in really cute dresses coming up. We\u2019ve started to show her legs and her shape in some of these outfits, which we didn\u2019t do on black-ish. She\u2019s in college, so that\u2019s a transition. Her mother is played by Tracee Ellis Ross, so come on. She dresses amazing on black-ish and is wearing all these great clothes as well, so of course she has style when she comes from two fashionable parents on the show. It\u2019s Zoey putting her own look together now. She doesn\u2019t have her parents: it\u2019s just her. And she depends on herself to get the right look.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632c858b34ed4e1e15fc9eb0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a84abfe0853d54aeb731201/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/yara-fb.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a847122adfa794183b57470/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/147945_4042.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a846d9ec98c2d46de010826/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/147945_3777.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a8470e3c98c2d46de010828/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/147945_3466.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63220c643a185ccd16675aab/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6321e445a0f6f5da88ae8667/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63237745c9f3a82503992bf6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a847ad0c98c2d46de01082a/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/147945_4206.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a84abfe0853d54aeb731201/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/yara-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Faith Cummings"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/grownish-costume-designer-michelle-cole-interview", "title": "grown-ish Costume Designer Michelle Cole Talks Style, Inspiration and Career Advice", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "In an exclusive interview, grown-ish costume designer Michelle Cole talks style, inspiration and career advice ahead of Zoey's fellowship at Teen Vogue.", "id": "5a8467020853d54aeb7311e8", "keywords": "grownish,yara shahidi,michelle cole,fashion, style", "news_keywords": "grownish,yara shahidi,michelle cole,fashion, style", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "gallery", "parsely-post-id": "5a8467020853d54aeb7311e8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In an exclusive interview, grown-ish costume designer Michelle Cole talks style, inspiration and career advice ahead of Zoey's fellowship at Teen Vogue.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a846d9ec98c2d46de010826/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/147945_3777.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a846d9ec98c2d46de010826/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/147945_3777.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Michelle Cole spills all, ahead of Zoey's return to Teen Vogue for a dream fellowship.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a84abfe0853d54aeb731201/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/yara-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "The grown-ish Costume Designer Draws Inspiration from HBCU Street Style", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/grownish-costume-designer-michelle-cole-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-02-14T21:37:16.483Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-14T21:37:16.483Z", "author": "Faith Cummings"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "Michelle Cole spills all, ahead of Zoey's return to Teen Vogue for a dream fellowship.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a84abfe0853d54aeb731201/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/yara-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "The grown-ish Costume Designer Draws Inspiration from HBCU Street Style"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518644236.483, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
