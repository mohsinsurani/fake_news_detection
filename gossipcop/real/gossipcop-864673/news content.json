The void of her absence is felt by many, especially now as yesterday would have been Rivera\u2019s 48th birthday.\n\nTo commemorate the special occasion, Rivera\u2019s family celebrated at the grand opening of the Jenni Rivera Boutique in Huntington Park, California on Sunday, July 2. The store is focused on \u201cexecuting Jenni\u2019s dream by providing fun, sporty, high-quality clothing and accessories for the voluptuous, bold, beautiful woman.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWDIzXcgSOF/?taken-by=chiquisoficial&hl=en\n\nFans turned out to show their love and support for the late diva de la banda.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWDjq6WjCHY/?tagged=jenniriveraboutique\n\nIt was an emotional scene as family members cut the ribbon at the new store. Fortunately a mariachi band was there to help keep spirits high.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWEUrB_Dnl7/?tagged=jenniriveraboutique\n\nLater that day Rivera\u2019s eldest daughter Chiquis posted a sweet birthday message to \u2018the most important woman in my life.\u2019\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWD9mPOARMg/?taken-by=chiquisoficial&hl=en\n\nChiquis has been open about the struggles she shared with her mother in the past. Prior to her mother\u2019s passing, the two women weren\u2019t on speaking terms due to a nasty rumor that tore them apart. Despite the fact that they were never able to mend their relationship in person, Chiquis still feels an incredible closeness to her mom. \u201cEvery day I feel like she\u2019s with me\u2026 she\u2019s always in my heart.\u201d", "images": ["https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossy,ret_img/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21_mobile.png", "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/jenni-rivera.jpg", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lqip,ret_wait/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21_wide-1.png", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lqip,ret_wait,w_620,h_160/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21-1.png", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lqip,ret_wait,w_453,h_431/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/453px-Jenni_Rivera_performing_in_2009_1-e1610730424970.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21175322&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lqip,ret_wait/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21_mobile.png", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossy,ret_img,w_453,h_431/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/453px-Jenni_Rivera_performing_in_2009_1-e1610730424970.png", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossy,ret_img/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21_wide-1.png", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossy,ret_img/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21-1.png", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/to_auto,q_lossy,ret_img,w_620,h_160/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21-1.png", "https://sp-ao.shortpixel.ai/client/q_lqip,ret_wait/https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/09/hl_logo_21-1.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2141896119462672&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/jenni-rivera.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hiplatina.com/jenni-rivera-birthday-boutique-opening/", "title": "Jenni Rivera Was Honored With a Boutique Grand Opening", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The late singer was honored by her family with the grand opening of the Jenni Rivera boutique in Huntington Park, California.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jenni Rivera's Family Celebrated the Late Singer's Birthday in Such a Sweet Way", "description": "The late singer was honored by her family with the grand opening of the Jenni Rivera boutique in Huntington Park, California.", "url": "https://hiplatina.com/jenni-rivera-birthday-boutique-opening/", "site_name": "HipLatina", "image": {"identifier": "https://1qxya61uvyue18mpsx3zc8om-wpengine.netdna-ssl.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/07/jenni-rivera.jpg", "width": 1245, "height": 552, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/hiplatinas/", "published_time": "2017-07-03T07:01:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-01-15T17:07:12+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Jenni Rivera's Family Celebrated Her Birthday at a Boutique Opening Inspired By the Late Singer", "creator": "@hip_latina", "site": "@hip_latina", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Jessica Molina", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "BridPlugin": "oauth_token:01110011 01100101 01100011 01110010 01100101 01110100|ver:2.7|site:7400|unit:2380|width:1400|height:788|autoplay:1|aspect:1|user_id:6834|default_channel:123|visual:0|ovr_def:0|player:15848|unit_width:480|unit_height:270|video_image:|async_embed:1|widget:1|channels:Array|google_seo:0|disable_video_autosave:|raw_embed:0", "fb": {"app_id": 348280475330978}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499065299.0, "source": "https://hiplatina.com", "summary": ""}
