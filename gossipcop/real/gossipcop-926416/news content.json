He\u2019s like, \u2018No, I\u2019m not taking accountability for this. This isn\u2019t right.\u2019 There\u2019s something wrong here with the narrative that\u2019s put after,\u201d Tyler Henry, 22, told the One Tree Hill alum.\n\n\u201cFor some reason, they\u2019re having me talk about grandma. They\u2019re having me talk about a fall for some reason. I don\u2019t know what this is,\u201d Henry explained.\n\n\u201cThe speculation from the stories that I got from my grandfather was that he was arrested for her murder,\u201d the actor said. \u201cShe died at 17 and she just had my mother. She was found with her hands tied behind her back, hung in the basement. So there was a fall, just in a different way.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd then after that, he was cleared and they didn\u2019t really have enough evidence to say, \u2018It was you that did it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut according to Henry, Murray\u2019s late grandmother died by suicide.\n\n\u201cBefore I got here, there was this woman who came through who I acknowledged passing away tragically. But it came through in a way of like, taking accountability to some extent for her actions,\u201d Henry informed the American Drifter author. \u201cBut I\u2019m thinking that it might have been even her way of kinda trying to come through and say, \u2018Hey, this is something that I\u2019m putting more on myself.\u2019 So, I don\u2019t think he killed your grandmother.\u201d\n\nE!\n\nAfter speaking with Henry and learning the details about his late grandmother\u2019s death, Murray revealed, \u201cI am, without a doubt, a believer,\u201d adding, \u201cHe\u2019s pretty damn good at it.\u201d\n\nHollywood Medium airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on E!\n\nIf you or someone you know is showing warning signs of suicide, consider contacting the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at
