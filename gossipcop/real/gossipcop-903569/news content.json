How could I possibly have been more popular?\u201d Chalamet also pointed out that Elgort was a star in the musical theater performances, while he was reduced to making rap videos about statistics.\n\nElgort had a caveat that Chalamet couldn\u2019t deny, however.\n\n\u201cNo one disliked Timmy,\u201d he said. \u201cSome people disliked me. Everyone loves Timmy.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?quality=85", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/http://assets.time.com/images/dianomi-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/http://assets.time.com/images/idealmedia.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1850_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/time-newsletter-tout-footer.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?quality=85", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037/http://time.com/5096112/ansel-elgort-and-timothee-chalamet/", "title": "Timothee Chalamet and Ansel Elgort on Who Was More Popular", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Timothee Chalamet, Timothee Chalamet 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort friends, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort high school", "news_keywords": "Timothee Chalamet, Timothee Chalamet 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort, Ansel Elgort 2018, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort friends, Timothee Chalamet Ansel Elgort high school", "description": "Former classmates Timothee Chalamet and Ansel Elgort can't agree over who was more popular while they attended LaGuardia High School.", "og": {"title": "Timothee Chalamet, Ansel Elgort Discuss Who Was More Popular", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037/http://time.com/5096112/ansel-elgort-and-timothee-chalamet/", "description": "LaGuardia's finest", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?quality=85", "width": 1024, "height": 698}}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://time.com/5096112/ansel-elgort-and-timothee-chalamet/", "description": "Former classmates Timothee Chalamet and Ansel Elgort can't agree over who was more popular while they attended LaGuardia High School.", "media": "https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?quality=85"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/http://time.com/5096112/ansel-elgort-and-timothee-chalamet/", "title": "Timothee Chalamet, Ansel Elgort Discuss Who Was More Popular", "description": "LaGuardia's finest", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180112112037im_/https://timedotcom.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ansel-elgort-timothee-chalamet-friends-high-school.jpg?quality=85"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
