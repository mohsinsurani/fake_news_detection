{"url": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "text": "American singer (born 1981)\n\nBritney Jean Spears (born December 2, 1981) is an American singer, songwriter, and dancer. Often referred to as the \"Princess of Pop\", she is credited with influencing the revival of teen pop during the late 1990s and early 2000s. After appearing in stage productions and television series, Spears signed with Jive Records in 1997 at age fifteen. Her first two studio albums, ...Baby One More Time (1999) and Oops!... I Did It Again (2000), are among the best-selling albums of all time and made Spears the best-selling teenage artist of all time. With first-week sales of over 1.3 million copies, Oops!... I Did It Again held the record for the fastest-selling album by a female artist in the United States for fifteen years. Spears adopted a more mature and provocative style for her albums Britney (2001) and In the Zone (2003), and starred in the 2002 film Crossroads.\n\nSpears was executive producer of her fifth studio album Blackout (2007), often referred to as her best work.[2] Following a series of highly publicized personal problems, promotion for the album was limited, and Spears was involuntarily placed in a conservatorship. Since then, she released the chart-topping albums, Circus (2008) and Femme Fatale (2011), the latter of which became her most successful era of singles in the US charts. She embarked on a four-year concert residency, Britney: Piece of Me, at Planet Hollywood Resort & Casino in Las Vegas to promote her next two albums Britney Jean (2013) and Glory (2016). In 2019, Spears's legal battle over her conservatorship became more publicized and led to the establishment of the #FreeBritney movement.[3] In 2021, the conservatorship was terminated following her public testimony in which she accused her management team and family of abuse.[4]\n\nRegarded as a pop icon, Spears has sold over 100 million records worldwide, including over 70 million in the United States, making her one of the world's best-selling music artists.[5][6] She has achieved six number-one albums on the Billboard 200[7] and four number-one singles on the US Billboard Hot 100: \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Womanizer\", \"3\", and \"Hold It Against Me\". The \"S&M\" remix also topped the Billboard chart. Her singles \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", \"Toxic\", and \"Scream & Shout\" topped the charts in most countries. With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, Spears became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs. Her heavily choreographed videos earned her the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award. She has earned numerous other awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award, 15 Guinness World Records, six MTV Video Music Awards, seven Billboard Music Awards (including the Millennium Award), the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award, and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.\n\nSpears was ranked by Billboard as the eighth-biggest artist of the 2000s.[8] In the United States, she is the fourth best-selling female album artist of the Nielsen SoundScan era[9] as well as the best-selling female album artist of the 2000s.[10][11][12] \"...Baby One More Time\" was named the greatest debut single of all time by Rolling Stone in 2020. In 2004, Spears launched a perfume brand with Elizabeth Arden, Inc.; sales exceeded $1.5 billion as of 2012 .[13] Forbes has reported Spears as the highest-earning female musician of 2001 and 2012.[14][15] By 2012, she had topped Yahoo!'s list of most searched celebrities seven times in twelve years.[16] Time named Spears one of the 100 most influential people in the world in 2021, while also winning the reader poll by receiving the highest number of votes.[17][18]\n\nLife and career\n\n1981\u20131997: Early life and career beginnings\n\nBritney Jean Spears was born on December 2, 1981, in McComb, Mississippi,[19] the second child of James \"Jamie\" Parnell Spears and Lynne Irene Bridges.[20] Her maternal grandmother, Lillian Portell, was English (born in London), and one of Spears's maternal great-great-grandfathers was Maltese.[21] Her siblings are Bryan James Spears and Jamie Lynn Spears.[22] Born in the Bible Belt, where socially conservative evangelical Protestantism is a particularly strong religious influence,[23] she was baptized as a Southern Baptist and sang in a church choir as a child.[24] As an adult, she has studied Kabbalist teachings.[25] On August 5, 2021, Spears announced that she had converted to Catholicism. Her mother, sister, and nieces Maddie Aldridge and Ivey Joan Watson, are also Catholic.[26] However, on September 5, 2022, after Spears's youngest son and ex-husband, Kevin Federline, did an interview defending her father's actions during her conservatorship, she stated: \"I don't believe in God anymore because of the way my children and my family have treated me. There is nothing to believe in anymore. I'm an atheist y'all\".[27]\n\nAt age three, Spears began attending dance lessons in her hometown of Kentwood, Louisiana, and was selected to perform as a solo artist at the annual recital. Aged five she made her local stage debut, singing \"What Child Is This?\" at her kindergarten graduation. During her childhood, she also had gymnastics and voice lessons, and won many state-level competitions and children's talent shows.[28][29][30] In gymnastics, Spears attended B\u00e9la K\u00e1rolyi's training camp.[31] She said of her ambition as a child, \"I was in my own world, ... I found out what I'm supposed to do at an early age\".[29]\n\nWhen Spears was eight, she and her mother Lynne traveled to Atlanta, Georgia, to audition for the 1990s revival of The Mickey Mouse Club. Casting director Matt Casella rejected her as too young, but introduced her to Nancy Carson, a New York City talent agent. Carson was impressed with Spears's singing and suggested enrolling her at the Professional Performing Arts School; shortly afterward, Lynne and her daughters moved to a sublet apartment in New York.[citation needed]\n\nSpears was hired for her first professional role as the understudy for the lead role of Tina Denmark in the off-Broadway musical Ruthless! She also appeared as a contestant on the popular television show Star Search and was cast in a number of commercials.[32][33] In December 1992, she was cast in The Mickey Mouse Club alongside Christina Aguilera, Justin Timberlake, Ryan Gosling, and Keri Russell. After the show was canceled in 1994, she returned to Mississippi and enrolled at McComb's Parklane Academy. Although she made friends with most of her classmates, she compared the school to \"the opening scene in Clueless with all the cliques. ... I was so bored. I was the point guard on the basketball team. I had my boyfriend, and I went to homecoming and Christmas formal. But I wanted more.\"[29][34]\n\nIn June 1997, Spears was in talks with manager Lou Pearlman to join the female pop group Innosense. Lynne asked family friend and entertainment lawyer Larry Rudolph for his opinion and submitted a tape of Spears singing over a Whitney Houston karaoke song along with some pictures. Rudolph decided that he wanted to pitch her to record labels, for which she needed a professional demo made. He sent Spears an unused song of Toni Braxton; she rehearsed for a week and recorded her vocals in a studio. Spears traveled to New York with the demo and met with executives from four labels, returning to Kentwood the same day. Three of the labels rejected her, saying that audiences wanted pop bands such as the Backstreet Boys and the Spice Girls, and \"there wasn't going to be another Madonna, another Debbie Gibson, or another Tiffany.\"[35]\n\nTwo weeks later, executives from Jive Records returned calls to Rudolph.[35] Senior vice president of A&R Jeff Fenster said about Spears's audition that \"it's very rare to hear someone that age who can deliver emotional content and commercial appeal ... For any artist, the motivation\u2014the 'eye of the tiger'\u2014is extremely important. And Britney had that.\"[29] Spears sang Houston's \"I Have Nothing\" (1992) for the executives, and was subsequently signed to the label.[36] They assigned her to work with producer Eric Foster White for a month; he reportedly shaped her voice from \"lower and less poppy\" delivery to \"distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[37] After hearing the recorded material, president Clive Calder ordered a full album. Spears had originally envisioned \"Sheryl Crow music, but younger; more adult contemporary\". She felt secure with her label's appointment of producers, since \"It made more sense to go pop, because I can dance to it\u2014it's more me.\"[29] She flew to Cheiron Studios in Stockholm, Sweden, where half of the album was recorded from March to April 1998, with producers Max Martin, Denniz Pop, and Rami Yacoub, among others.[29]\n\n1998\u20132000: ...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again\n\nAfter Spears returned to the United States, she embarked on a shopping mall promotional tour, titled L'Oreal Hair Zone Mall Tour, to promote her upcoming debut album. Her show was a four-song set and she was accompanied by two back-up dancers. Her first concert tour followed, as an opening act for NSYNC.[38] Her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, was released on January 12, 1999.[29] It debuted at number one on the U.S. Billboard 200 and was certified two-times platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America after a month. Worldwide, the album topped the charts in fifteen countries and sold over 10 million copies in a year.[39] It became the biggest-selling album ever by a teenage artist.[30]\n\n\"...Baby One More Time\" was released as the lead single from the album. Originally, Jive Records wanted its music video to be animated; however, Spears rejected it, and suggested the final concept of a Catholic schoolgirl.[37] The single sold 500,000 copies on its first day, and peaked at number one on the Billboard Hot 100, topping the chart for two consecutive weeks. It has sold more than 10 million copies, making it one of the best-selling singles of all time.[40][41] \"...Baby One More Time\" later received a Grammy nomination for Best Female Pop Vocal Performance.[42] The title track also topped the singles chart for two weeks in the United Kingdom, and became the fastest-selling single ever by a female artist, shipping over 460,000 copies.[43] It would later become the 25th-most successful song of all time in British chart history.[44] Spears is the youngest female artist to have a million seller in the UK.[45] The album's third single \"(You Drive Me) Crazy\" became a top-ten hit worldwide and further propelled the success of the ...Baby One More Time album. The album has sold 25 million copies worldwide,[46][47] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is the best-selling debut album by any artist.[48][49][50]\n\nOn June 28, 1999, Spears began her first headlining ...Baby One More Time Tour in North America, which was positively received by critics.[51] It also generated some controversy due to her racy outfits.[52] An extension of the tour, titled (You Drive Me) Crazy Tour, followed in March 2000. Spears premiered songs from her upcoming second album during the show.[34]\n\nOops!... I Did It Again, Spears's second studio album, was released in May 2000. It debuted at number one in the US, selling 1.3 million copies, breaking the Nielsen SoundScan record for the highest debut sales by any solo artist.[53] It has sold over 20 million copies worldwide to date,[54] making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone said that \"the great thing about Oops! \u2013 under the cheese surface, Britney's demand for satisfaction is complex, fierce and downright scary, making her a true child of rock & roll tradition.\"[55] The album's lead single, \"Oops!... I Did It Again\", peaked at the top of the charts in Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and many other European nations,[45][56] while the second single \"Lucky\", peaked at number one in Austria, Germany, Sweden, and Switzerland. The album as well as the title track received Grammy nominations for Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance, respectively.[57]\n\nThe same year, Spears embarked on the Oops!... I Did It Again Tour, which grossed $40.5 million; she also released her first book, Britney Spears' Heart to Heart, co-written with her mother.[30][58] On September 7, 2000, Spears performed at the 2000 MTV Video Music Awards. Halfway through the performance, she ripped off her black suit to reveal a sequined flesh-colored bodysuit, followed by heavy dance routine. It is noted by critics as the moment that Spears showed signs of becoming a more provocative performer.[59] Amidst media speculation, Spears confirmed she was dating NSYNC member Justin Timberlake.[30] Spears and Timberlake both graduated from high school via distance learning from the University of Nebraska High School.[60][61] She also bought a home in Destin, Florida.[62]\n\n2001\u20132002: Britney and Crossroads\n\nIn January 2001, Spears hosted the 28th Annual American Music Awards, and performed as a special guest in the Super Bowl XXXV halftime show headlined by Aerosmith and NSYNC.[63][64] In February 2001, she signed a $7\u20138 million promotional deal with Pepsi, and released another book co-written with her mother, titled A Mother's Gift.[30] Her self-titled third studio album, Britney, was released in November 2001. While on tour, she felt inspired by hip hop artists such as Jay-Z and The Neptunes and wanted to create a record with a funkier sound.[65] The album debuted at number one in the Billboard 200 and reached top five positions in Australia, the United Kingdom, and mainland Europe, and has sold 10 million copies worldwide.[45][66][67]\n\nStephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic called Britney \"the record where she strives to deepen her persona, making it more adult while still recognizably Britney. ... It does sound like the work of a star who has now found and refined her voice, resulting in her best record yet.\"[68] The album was honored with two Grammy nominations\u2014Best Pop Vocal Album and Best Female Pop Vocal Performance for \"Overprotected\"\u2014and was listed in 2007 as one of Entertainment Weekly's \"100 Best Albums from the Past 25 Years\".[69][70] The album's lead single, \"I'm a Slave 4 U\", became a top ten hit worldwide.[71]\n\nSpears's performance of the single at the 2001 MTV Video Music Awards featured a caged tiger (wrangled by Bhagavan Antle) and a large albino python draped over her shoulders.[72] It was harshly received by animal rights organization PETA, who claimed the animals were mistreated and scrapped plans for an anti-fur billboard that was to feature Spears.[59] Jocelyn Vena of MTV summarized Spears's performance at the ceremony, saying, \"draping herself in a white python and slithering around a steamy garden setting \u2013 surrounded by dancers in zebra and tiger outfits \u2013 Spears created one of the most striking visuals in the 27-year history of the show.\"[73]\n\nTo support the album, Spears embarked on the Dream Within a Dream Tour. The show was critically praised for its technical innovations, the pi\u00e8ce de r\u00e9sistance being a water screen that pumped two tons of water into the stage.[74][75] The tour grossed $43.7 million, becoming the second highest-grossing tour of 2002 by a female artist, behind Cher's Farewell Tour.[76] Her career success was highlighted by Forbes in 2002, as Spears was ranked the world's most powerful celebrity.[77] Spears also landed her first starring role in Crossroads, released in February 2002. Although the film was largely panned, critics praised Spears's acting and the film was a box office success.[78][79][80] Crossroads, which had a $12 million budget, went on to gross over $61.1 million worldwide.[80]\n\nIn June 2002, Spears opened her first restaurant, Nyla, in New York City, but terminated her relationship in November, citing mismanagement and \"management's failure to keep her fully apprised\".[81] In July 2002, Spears announced she would take a six-month break from her career; however, she went back into the studio in November to record her new album.[82] Spears's relationship with Justin Timberlake ended after three years.[83] In November 2002, Timberlake released the song \"Cry Me a River\" as the second single from his solo debut album. The music video featured a Spears look-alike and fueled the rumors that she had been unfaithful to him.[84][85] As a response, Spears wrote the ballad \"Everytime\" with her backing vocalist and friend Annet Artani.[86] The same year, Limp Bizkit frontman Fred Durst said that he was in a relationship with Spears. However, Spears denied Durst's claims. In a 2009 interview, he explained that \"I just guess at the time it was taboo for a guy like me to be associated with a gal like her.\"[87]\n\n2003\u20132005: In the Zone and first two marriages\n\nSpears performing at the NFL Kickoff Live in September 2003\n\nIn August 2003, Spears opened the MTV Video Music Awards with Christina Aguilera, performing \"Like a Virgin\". Halfway through they were joined by Madonna, with whom they both kissed. The incident was highly publicized. In 2008, MTV listed the performance as the number-one opening moment in the history of MTV Video Music Awards,[88] while Blender magazine cited it as one of the twenty-five sexiest music moments on television history.[89] Spears released her fourth studio album, In the Zone, in November 2003. She assumed more creative control by writing and co-producing most of the material.[30] Vibe called it \"A supremely confident dance record that also illustrates Spears's development as a songwriter.\"[90]\n\nNPR listed the album as one of \"The 50 Most Important Recording of the Decade\", adding that \"the decade's history of impeccably crafted pop is written on her body of work.\"[91] In the Zone sold over 609,000 copies in the United States during its first week of availability in the United States, debuting at the top of the charts, making Spears the first female artist in the SoundScan era to have her first four studio albums to debut at number one.[30] It also debuted at the top of the charts in France and the top ten in Belgium, Denmark, Sweden, and the Netherlands.[92] The album produced four singles: \"Me Against the Music\", a collaboration with Madonna; \"Toxic\"\u2014which won Spears her first Grammy for Best Dance Recording; \"Everytime\", and \"Outrageous\".[30]\n\nIn January 2004, Spears married childhood friend Jason Allen Alexander at A Little White Wedding Chapel in Las Vegas, Nevada. The marriage was annulled 55 hours later, following a petition to the court that stated that Spears \"lacked understanding of her actions\".[93]\n\nIn March 2004, she embarked on The Onyx Hotel Tour in support of In the Zone.[94] In June 2004, Spears fell and injured her left knee during the music video shoot for \"Outrageous\". Spears underwent arthroscopic surgery. She was forced to remain six weeks with a thigh brace, followed by eight to twelve weeks of rehabilitation, which caused The Onyx Hotel Tour to be canceled.[95] During 2004, Spears became involved in the Kabbalah Centre through her friendship with Madonna.[96]\n\nIn July 2004, Spears became engaged to dancer Kevin Federline, whom she had met three months earlier. The romance was the subject of intense media attention, since Federline had recently broken up with actress Shar Jackson, who was still pregnant with their second child at the time.[30] The stages of their relationship were chronicled in Spears's first reality show Britney and Kevin: Chaotic, which premiered on May 17, 2005, on UPN. Spears later referred to the show in a 2013 interview as \"probably the worst thing I've done in my career\".[97] They held a wedding ceremony on September 18, 2004, but were not legally married until three weeks later on October 6 due to a delay finalizing the couple's prenuptial agreement.[98]\n\nShortly after, she released her first perfume, Curious, with Elizabeth Arden, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[30] In October 2004, Spears took a career break to start a family.[99] Greatest Hits: My Prerogative, her first greatest hits compilation album, was released in November 2004.[100] Spears's cover version of Bobby Brown's \"My Prerogative\" was released as the lead single from the album, reaching the top of the charts in Finland, Ireland, Italy, and Norway.[101]\n\nThe second single, \"Do Somethin'\", was a top ten hit in Australia, the United Kingdom, and other countries of mainland Europe.[102][103] In August 2005, Spears released \"Someday (I Will Understand)\", which was dedicated to her first child, a son named Sean Preston, who was born the following month.[104] In November 2005, she released her first remix compilation, B in the Mix: The Remixes, which consists of 11 remixes.[105]\n\n2006\u20132007: Personal problems and Blackout\n\nSpears leaving court surrounded in October 2007\n\nIn February 2006, pictures surfaced of Spears driving with her son, Sean, on her lap instead of in a car seat. Child advocates were horrified by the photos of her holding the wheel with one hand and Sean with the other. Spears claimed that the situation happened because of a frightening encounter with paparazzi, and that it was a mistake on her part.[30] The following month, she guest-starred on the Will & Grace episode \"Buy, Buy Baby\" as closeted lesbian Amber-Louise.[106] She announced she no longer studied Kabbalah in May 2006, explaining, \"my baby is my religion\".[96] Spears posed nude for the August 2006 cover of Harper's Bazaar; the photograph was compared to Demi Moore's August 1991 Vanity Fair cover.[30] In September 2006, she gave birth to her second son, Jayden James.[107] In November 2006, Spears filed for divorce from Federline, citing irreconcilable differences.[108] Their divorce was finalized in July 2007, when the two reached a global settlement and agreed to share joint custody of their sons.[109]\n\nSpears's maternal aunt Sandra Bridges Covington, with whom she had been very close, died of ovarian cancer in January 2007.[110] In February, Spears stayed in a drug rehabilitation facility in Antigua for less than a day. The following night, she shaved her head with electric clippers at a hair salon in Tarzana, Los Angeles. She admitted herself to other treatment facilities during the following weeks.[111] In May 2007, she produced a series of promotional concerts at House of Blues venues, titled The M+M's Tour.[112] In October 2007, Spears lost physical custody of her sons to Federline. The reasons of the court ruling were not revealed to the public.[113] Spears was also sued by Louis Vuitton over her 2005 music video \"Do Somethin'\" for upholstering her Hummer interior in counterfeit Louis Vuitton cherry blossom fabric, which resulted in the video being banned on European TV stations.[114]\n\nIn October 2007, Spears released her fifth studio album, Blackout. The album debuted atop the charts in Canada and Ireland, at number two in the U.S. Billboard 200, France, Japan, Mexico, and the United Kingdom, and the top ten in Australia, South Korea, New Zealand, and many European nations.

The third single \"Break the Ice\" was released the following year,[123] and respectively reached numbers seven and nine in Ireland and Canada.[124][125] In December 2007, Spears began a relationship with paparazzo Adnan Ghalib.[126]\n\n2008\u20132010: Conservatorship and Circus\n\nIn January 2008, Spears refused to relinquish custody of her sons to Federline's representatives. She was hospitalized at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center after police that had arrived at her house noted she appeared to be under the influence of an unidentified substance. The following day, Spears's visitation rights were suspended at an emergency court hearing, and Federline was given sole physical and legal custody of their sons. She was committed to the psychiatric ward of Ronald Reagan UCLA Medical Center and put on 5150 involuntary psychiatric hold under California state law. The court placed her under a conservatorship led by her father, Jamie Spears, and attorney Andrew Wallet, giving them complete control of her assets.[30][127] She was released five days later.[128][129]\n\nThe following month, Spears guest-starred on the How I Met Your Mother episode \"Ten Sessions\" as receptionist Abby.

They alleged that Jamie had canceled the residency due to Spears's refusal to take her medication, that he had been holding her in the facility against her will since January 2019 after she violated a no-driving rule, and that her conservatorship was supposed to have ended in 2009.[258][259] The allegations gave rise to a movement to terminate the conservatorship, #FreeBritney,[260] which received support from celebrities including singers Cher, Paris Hilton, and Miley Cyrus, and the nonprofit organization American Civil Liberties Union.[261][262][263][264] On April 22, 2019, fans protested outside the West Hollywood City Hall and demanded Spears's release.[257] Spears said \"all [was] well\" two days later and left the facility later that month.[265][266]\n\nThe #FreeBritney movement in front of the Lincoln Memorial , 2021\n\nIn a May 2019 hearing, Judge Brenda Penny ordered a professional evaluation of the conservatorship.[267] In September, Spears's ex-husband Federline obtained a restraining order against Britney's father, Jamie, following an alleged physical altercation between Jamie and one of her sons.[268] Spears's longtime care manager, Jodi Montgomery, temporarily replaced Jamie as her conservator that same month,[269] which also saw a hearing where no decisions about the arrangement were reached.[270] An interactive pop-up museum dedicated to Spears, dubbed \"The Zone\", opened in Los Angeles in February 2020, though it was later suspended in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic.[271][272] She released Glory's Japanese-exclusive bonus track, \"Mood Ring\" as a single, and debuted a new cover of the album to streaming and digital platforms worldwide in May 2020.[273] In August, Jamie called the #FreeBritney movement \"a joke\" and its organizers \"conspiracy theorists\".[274]\n\nOn August 17, 2020, Spears's court-appointed lawyer, Samuel D.

According to Spears: \"I know when I was younger, I looked up to people ... like, you know, Janet Jackson and Madonna. And they were major inspirations for me. But I also had my own identity and I knew who I was.\"[318]\n\nIn the 2002 book Madonnastyle by Carol Clerk, she is quoted saying: \"I have been a huge fan of Madonna since I was a little girl. She's the person that I've really looked up to. I would really, really like to be a legend like Madonna.\"[319] Spears cited \"That's the Way Love Goes\" as the inspiration for her song \"Touch of My Hand\" from her album In the Zone, saying \"I like to compare it to 'That's the Way Love Goes,' kind of a Janet Jackson thing.\"[320] She also said her song \"Just Luv Me\" from her Glory album also reminded her of \"That's the Way Love Goes\".[321]\n\nAfter meeting Spears face to face, Janet Jackson stated: \"she said to me, 'I'm such a big fan; I really admire you.' That's so flattering. Everyone gets inspiration from some place. And it's awesome to see someone else coming up who's dancing and singing, and seeing how all these kids relate to her. A lot of people put it down, but what she does is a positive thing.\"[322] Madonna said of Spears in the documentary Britney: For the Record: \"I admire her talent as an artist ... There are aspects about her that I recognize in myself when I first started out in my career\".[323] Spears has also named Michael Jackson, Mariah Carey, Sheryl Crow, Otis Redding, Shania Twain, Brandy, Beyonc\u00e9, Natalie Imbruglia, Cher, and Prince as inspirations,[324][325][326][327][328] and younger artists such as Selena Gomez and Ariana Grande.[329][330]\n\nMusical style\n\nSpears is described as a pop artist[19] and generally explores the genre in the form of dance-pop.[333] Following her debut, she was credited with influencing the revival of teen pop in the late 1990s.[334] Rob Sheffield of Rolling Stone wrote: \"Spears carries on the classic archetype of the rock & roll teen queen, the dungaree doll, the angel baby who just has to make a scene.\"[335] In a review of ...Baby One More Time, Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic described her music as a \"blend of infectious, rap-inflected dance-pop and smooth balladry.\"[336] Oops!... I Did It Again saw Spears working with several R&B producers to create \"a combination of bubblegum, urban soul, and raga\".[337] Her third studio album, Britney derived from the teen pop niche \"[r]hythmically and melodically\", but was described as \"sharper, tougher than what came before\", incorporating genres such as R&B, disco, and funk.[68][338]\n\nSpears has explored and heavily incorporated the genres of electropop[339][340] and dance music in her records, as well as influences of urban and hip hop, which are most present on In the Zone and Blackout. In the Zone also experiments with Euro trance, reggae, and Middle Eastern music.[340][341][342] Femme Fatale and Britney Jean were also heavily influenced by electronic music genres.[343][344] Spears's ninth studio album Glory is more eclectic and experimental than her previous released work. She commented that it \"took a lot of time ... it's really different ... there are like two or three songs that go in the direction of more urban that I've wanted to do for a long time now, and I just haven't really done that.\"[345]\n\n...Baby One More Time and Oops!... I Did It Again address themes such as love and relationships from a teenager's point of view.[346][347] Following the massive commercial success of her first two studio albums, Spears's team and producers wanted to maintain the formula that took her to the top of the charts.[346] Spears, however, was no longer satisfied with the sound and themes covered on her records. She co-wrote five songs and choose each track's producer on her third studio album, Britney, which lyrics address the subjects of reaching adulthood, sexuality, and self-discovery.[68][346][338] Sex, dancing, freedom, and love continued to be Spears's music main subjects on her subsequent albums.[341][342][344][343] Her fifth studio effort, Blackout, also addresses issues such as fame and media scrutiny, including on the song \"Piece of Me\".[342][348]\n\nSpears's music has also been noted for some catchphrases. The opening in her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\", \"Oh, baby baby\" is considered to be one of her signature lines and has been parodied in the media by various artists such as Nicole Scherzinger and Ariana Grande.[349] It has been used in variating forms throughout her music, such as simply, \"baby\" and \"oh baby\", as well as the Blackout track, \"Ooh Ooh Baby\". On the initial development of \"...Baby One More Time\", Barry Weiss noted Spears's inception of the catchphrase from her strange ad-libbing during the recording of the song. He commented further, \"We thought it was really weird at first. It was strange. It was not the way Max wrote it. But it worked! We thought it could be a really good opening salvo for her.\"[350] The opening line in \"Gimme More\", \"It's Britney, bitch\" has become another signature phrase.[351] An early review of Blackout suggested the phrase was \"simply laughable\".[351] Amy Roberts of Bustle called it \"an indelible cultural turning point, transforming a frenetic, floundering moment in the superstars career to one of strength and empowerment\".[351]\n\nVoice\n\nSpears is a soprano.[356][357][358][359] Other sources state that she possesses a contralto vocal range.[360][361] Prior to her breakthrough success, she is described as having sung \"much deeper than her highly recognizable trademark voice of today\", with Eric Foster White, who worked with Spears on her debut album ...Baby One More Time, being cited as \"[shaping] her voice over the course of a month\" upon being signed to Jive Records \"to where it is today\u2014distinctively, unmistakably Britney\".[35] Rami Yacoub who co-produced Spears's debut album with lyricist Max Martin, commented, \"I know from Denniz Pop and Max's previous productions, when we do songs, there's kind of a nasal thing. With N' Sync and the Backstreet Boys, we had to push for that mid-nasal voice. When Britney did that, she got this kind of raspy, sexy voice.\"\n\nGuy Blackman of The Age wrote that \"[t]he thing about Spears, though, is that her biggest songs, no matter how committee-created or impossibly polished, have always been convincing because of her delivery, her commitment and her presence. ... Spears expresses perfectly the conflicting urges of adolescence, the tension between chastity and sexual experience, between hedonism and responsibility, between confidence and vulnerability.\"[363] Producer William Orbit, who worked with Spears on her album Britney Jean, stated regarding her vocals: \"[Britney] didn't get so big just because [she] put on great shows; [she] got to be that way because [her voice is] unique: you hear two words and you know who is singing\".[364]\n\nSpears has also been criticized for her reliance on Auto-Tune[365] and her vocals being \"over-processed\" on records.[366] Erlewine criticized Spears's singing abilities in a review of her Blackout album, stating: \"Never the greatest vocalist, her thin squawk could be dismissed early in her career as an adolescent learning the ropes, but nearly a decade later her singing hasn't gotten any better, even if the studio tools to masquerade her weaknesses have.\"[342] Joan Anderman of The Boston Globe remarked that \"Spears sounds robotic, nearly inhuman, on her records, so processed is her voice by digital pitch-shifters and synthesizers.\"[367]\n\nKayla Upadhyaya of The Michigan Daily has provided a different point of view, stating: \"Auto-tuned and over-processed vocals define [Spears]'s voice as an artist, and in her music, auto-tune isn't so much a gimmick as it is an instrument used to highlight, contort and make a statement.\"[368] Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly opines that \"Spears is no technical singer, that's for sure. But backed by Martin and Dr. Luke's wall of pound, her vocals melt into a mix of babytalk coo and coital panting that is, in its own overprocessed way, just as iconic and propulsive as Michael Jackson's yips or Eminem's snarls.\"[369]\n\nStage performances and videos\n\nSpears is known for her stage performances, particularly the elaborate dance routines which incorporate \"belly-dancing and tempered erotic moves\" that are credited with influencing \"dance-heavy acts\" such as Danity Kane and the Pussycat Dolls.[370][371] Rolling Stone readers voted Spears their second-favorite dancing musician.[372] Spears is described as being much more shy than her stage persona suggests.[97][373][374] She said that performing is \"a boost to [her] confidence. It's like an alter-ego type thing. Something clicks and I go and turn into this different person. I think it's kind of a gift to be able to do that.\"[375] Her 2000, 2001, and 2003 MTV Video Music Awards performances were lauded,[376] while her 2007 presentation was widely panned by critics, as she \"teetered through her dance steps and mouthed only occasional words\".[377] Billboard called her 2016 \"comeback\" performance at the show \"an effective, but not entirely glorious, bid to regain pop superstardom\".[358]\n\nAfter her knee injuries and personal problems, Spears's \"showmanship\" and dance abilities came under criticism.[370][378] Serge F. Kovaleski of The New York Times watched her Las Vegas concert residency in 2016 and stated: \"Once a fluid, natural dancer, Ms. Spears can appear stiff, even robotic, today, relying on flailing arms and flashy sets.\"[379] Las Vegas Sun's Robin Leach seemed more impressed over Spears's efforts on the concert by saying that she delivered a \"flawless performance\" on the residency's opening night.[380]\n\nIt has been widely reported that Spears lip-syncs during live performances,[371][381][382] which often prompts criticism from music critics and concert goers.[378][383][384] Some, however, claimed that, although she \"got plenty of digital support\", she \"doesn't merely lip-sync\" during her live shows.[385] In 2016, Sabrina Weiss of Refinery29 referred to her lip-syncing as a \"well-known fact that's not even taboo anymore.\"[386] Noting on the prevalence of lip-syncing, the Los Angeles Daily News opined: \"In the context of a Britney Spears concert, does it really matter? ... you [just] go for the somewhat-ridiculous spectacle of it all\".[387] Spears herself has commented on the topic, arguing: \"Because I'm dancing so much, I do have a little bit of playback, but there's a mixture of my voice and the playback. ... It really pisses me off because I'm busting my ass out there and singing at the same time and nobody ever gives me credit for it\".[381]\n\nIn 2012, VH1 ranked Spears as the fourth Greatest Woman of the Video Era,[388] while Billboard ranked her as the eight Greatest Music Video Artist of All Time in 2020, explaining: \"The storylines, the dancing, the outfits. Right from the start, the pop princess established the lengths of her creativity with some of the most memorable videos of the last three decades.\"[389] She has been retroactively noted as the pioneer for her early career videography.[390] She conceptualized the \"iconic Catholic schoolgirl and cheerleader motif\" in the \"...Baby One More Time\" video, rejecting the animation video idea. She also made the \"Oops!... I Did It Again\" video \"dance-centric rather than space-centric as her producers suggested\". She also used her dancer's intuition to help select the beats for each track.[390]\n\nPublic image\n\n[391] Wax figure of Spears on display at Madame Tussauds in London\n\nUpon launching her music career with ...Baby One More Time, Spears was labeled a teen idol,[392] and Rolling Stone described her as \"the latest model of a classic product: the unneurotic pop star who performs her duties with vaudevillian pluck and spokesmodel charm.\"[29] The April 1999 cover of Rolling Stone featured Spears lying on her bed, wearing an open top revealing her bra, and shorts, while clutching a Teletubby.[29][393] The American Family Association (AFA) referred to the shoot as \"a disturbing mix of childhood innocence and adult sexuality\" and called on \"God-loving Americans to boycott stores selling Britney's albums.\" Spears addressed the outcry, commenting: \"What's the big deal? I have strong morals. ... I'd do it again. I thought the pictures were fine. And I was tired of being compared to Debbie Gibson and all of this bubblegum pop all the time.\"[394] Shortly prior, Spears had announced publicly she would remain abstinent until marriage.[30][395]\n\nAn early criticism of Spears dismissed her as a \"manufactured pop star, the product of a Swedish songwriting factory that had no real hand in either her music or her persona\", which Vox editor Constance Grady assesses as being perpetuated from the fact that Spears debuted in the late 1990s, when music was dominated by rockism, that prizes \"so-called authenticity and grittiness of rock above all else\". Spears's \"slick, breezy pop was an affront to rockist sensibilities, and claiming that Spears was fake was an easy way to dismiss her.\" Ron Levy for Rolling Stone noted that \"I have to tell you, if the record company could have created more than one Britney Spears, they would have done it, and they tried!\"[390]\n\nBillboard opined that, by the time Spears released her sophomore album Oops!... I Did It Again, \"There was a shift occurring in both the music and her public image: She was sharper, sexier and singing about more grown-up fare, setting the stage for 2001's Britney, which shed her innocent skin and ushered her into adulthood.\"[396] Britney's lead single \"I'm a Slave 4 U\" and its music video were also credited for distancing her from her previous \"wholesome bubblegum star\" image.[397][398] Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic remarked, \"If 2001's Britney was a transitional album, capturing Spears at the point when she wasn't a girl and not yet a woman, its 2003 follow-up, In the Zone, is where she has finally completed that journey and turned into Britney, the Adult Woman.\" Erlewine likened Spears to fellow singer Christina Aguilera, explaining that both equated \"maturity with transparent sexuality and the pounding sounds of nightclubs\".[341] Brittany Spanos of LA Weekly stated that Spears \"set the bar for the 'adulthood' transition teen pop stars often struggle with\".[399]\n\nSpears's erratic behavior and personal problems during 2006\u20132008 were highly publicized[400] and affected both her career and public image.[342][401] Erlewine reflected on this period of her life, stating that \"each new disaster [was] stripping away any residual sexiness in her public image\".[342] In a 2008 article, Rolling Stone's Vanessa Grigoriadis described her much-publicized personal issues as \"the most public downfall of any star in history\".[401] Spears later received favorable media attention; Billboard opined that her appearance at the 2008 MTV Video Music Awards \"was a picture of professionalism and poise\" after her \"disastrous\" performance at the previous year's show,[402] while Business Insider ran an article on how she had \"lost control of her life ... and then made an incredible career comeback\".[403] Spears later reflected on this tumultuous period, saying: \"I think I had to give myself more breaks through my career and take responsibility for my mental health. ... I wrote back then, that I was lost and didn't know what to do with myself. I was trying to please everyone around me because that's who I am deep inside. There are moments where I look back and think: 'What the hell was I thinking?'\"[404]\n\nIn September 2002, Spears was placed at number eight on VH1's 100 Sexiest Artists list.[405] She was placed at number one on FHM's 100 Sexiest Women in the World list in 2004,[406] and, in December 2012, Complex ranked her 12th on its 100 Hottest Female Singers of All Time list.[407] Remarking upon her perceived image as a sex symbol, Spears stated: \"When I'm on stage, that's my time to do my thing and go there and be that \u2014 and it's fun. It's exhilarating just to be something that you're not. And people tend to believe it.\"[346] In 2003, People magazine cited her as one of the 50 Most Beautiful People.[408]\n\nSpears is recognized as a gay icon and was honored with the 2018 GLAAD Vanguard Award at the GLAAD Media Awards for her role in \"accelerating acceptance for the LGBTQ community\".[249] Spears addressed the \"unwavering loyalty\" and \"lack of judgment\" of her LGBTQ fans in Billboard's Love Letters to the LGBTQ Community. She said: \"Your stories are what inspire me, bring me joy, and make me and my sons strive to be better people.\"[409] Manuel Betancourt of Vice magazine wrote about the \"queer adoration\", especially of gay men, on Spears, and said that \"Where other gay icons exude self-possession, Spears's fragile resilience has made her an even more fascinating role model, closer to Judy Garland than to Lady Gaga ... she's a glittering mirror ball, a fractured reflection of those men on the dance floor back onto themselves.\"[373] HuffPost's Ben Appel attributed Spears's status as a gay icon to \"her oh-so-innocent/\"not that innocent\" Monroe-like sensuality, her sweet, almost saccharine nature, her beyond basic but addictive pop songs, her dance moves, her phoenix-out-of-the-fire comeback from a series of mental health crises, and her unmistakable tenderness. Britney is camp. She is a fashion plate. A doll. Britney is a drag queen.\"[410]\n\nSince her early years in the public eye, Spears has been a tabloid fixture and a paparazzi target.[396][395][411] Steve Huey of AllMusic remarked that \"among female singers of [Spears's] era ... her celebrity star power was rivaled only by Jennifer Lopez.\"[395] 'Britney Spears' was Yahoo!'s most popular search term between 2005 and 2008, and has been in a total of seven different years.[412] Spears was named as Most Searched Person in the Guinness World Records book edition 2007 and 2009.[413] She was later named as the most searched person of the decade 2000\u20132009.[414]\n\nAs a public figure, Spears \"has never been known to her fans as a politically active, committed\u2014or even aware\u2014entertainer.\"[333] In a 2003 interview with Tucker Carlson, she commented on President George W. Bush and the Iraq War, saying that \"we should just trust our president in every decision that he makes ... and be faithful in what happens\".[415] Michael Moore included the footage of Spears's answer in his \"anti-Bush\" documentary Fahrenheit 9/11, which, according to The Washington Times's James Frazier, presented her \"as an example of a naive American blindly trusting a dishonest commander in chief\" and fueled the \"urban legend\" of a \"conservative\" Spears. Frazier also said that \"the few positions she has taken can hardly be considered conservative\", such as supporting same-sex marriage.[333] In 2016, Spears posted pictures of a meeting with Hillary Clinton on social media. She described Clinton as \"an inspiration and [a] beautiful voice for women around the world\".[416]\n\nIn December 2017, Spears publicly showed support for the DREAM Act in the wake of the announcement that Donald Trump would end the DACA policy, which previously granted undocumented immigrants who came to the country as minors a renewable two-year period of deferred action from deportation. She posted a photo of herself on social media wearing a black T-shirt that reads \"We Are All Dreamers\" in white letters. The caption read, \"Tell Congress to pass the #DreamAct\".[417]\n\nIn 2020, amidst the COVID-19 pandemic, Spears posted an image on Instagram stating, \"During this time of isolation ... We will feed each other, redistribute wealth, strike. We will understand our own importance from the places we must stay\", along with three emoji roses, \"a symbol commonly used by the Democratic Socialists of America\".[418] She later voiced support for the Black Lives Matter movement and George Floyd protests in the wake of his murder, saying: \"My heart breaks for my friends in the black community ... and for everything going on in our country. Right now I think we should all do what we can to listen, learn, do better, and use our voices for good.\"[419]\n\nOn September 15, 2021, Spears was named one of the 100 most influential people of 2021 by Time magazine. A few days before the editors's list was released, Spears was put at the top of the readers voting list of which personalities should be included on the annual Time 100 list. Deemed an icon of 2021, editors highlighted the impact of her fight against her conservatorship as well as of the #FreeBritney movement.[420][421] In October 2021, Spears thanked her fans and the #FreeBritney movement for \"freeing me from my conservatorship\".[422]\n\nLegacy\n\nReferred to as the \"Princess of Pop\",[423][424] Spears was credited as one of the \"driving force[s] behind the return of teen pop in the late 1990s\".[395][334] Rolling Stone's Stacy Lambe explained that she \"help[ed] to usher in a new era for the genre that had gone dormant in the decade that followed New Kids on the Block. ... Spears would lead an army of pop stars ... built on slick Max Martin productions, plenty of sexual innuendo and dance-heavy performances. [She became] one of the most successful artists of all time\u2014and a cautionary tale for a generation, whether they paid attention or not.\"[424]\n\nGlamour magazine contributor Christopher Rosa described her as \"one of pop music's defining voices. ... When she emerged onto the scene in 1998 with ...Baby One More Time, the world hadn't seen a performer like her. Not since Madonna had a female artist affected the genre so profoundly.\"[425] Billboard's Robert Kelly observed that Spears's \"sexy and coy\" vocals on her debut single \"...Baby One More Time\" \"kicked off a new era of pop vocal stylings that would influence countless artists to come.\"[426] In 2020, Rolling Stone ranked the song at number one on a list of the 100 Greatest Debut Singles of All Time and Rob Sheffield described it as \"One of those pop manifestos that announces a new sound, a new era, a new century. But most of all, a new star ... With \"...Baby One More Time\", [Spears] changed the sound of pop forever: It's Britney, bitch. Nothing was ever the same.\"[427]\n\nSpears was at the forefront of the female teen pop explosion starting in 1999 and extending through the 2000s, leading the pack of Christina Aguilera, Jessica Simpson, and Mandy Moore.[428] All of these performers had been developing material in 1998, but the market changed dramatically in December 1998 when Spears's single and video were charting highly. RCA Records quickly signed Aguilera and rushed her debut single to capitalize on Spears's success, producing the hit single \"Genie in a Bottle\" in June 1999 and Aguilera's debut album a few months later.[429] Her album sold millions but not as many as Spears's.[430] Simpson consciously modeled her persona as more mature than Spears; her \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" charted in September 1999, and her album Sweet Kisses followed shortly after.[431][432] Moore's first single, \"Candy\", hit the airwaves a month before Simpson's single, but it did not perform as well on the charts; Moore was often seen as less accomplished than Spears and the others, coming in fourth of the \"pop princesses\".[433][434] Fueling media stories about their competition for first place, Spears and Aguilera traded barbs but also compliments through the 2000s.[435]\n\nAlim Kheraj of Dazed called Spears \"one of pop's most important pioneers\".[436] After eighteen years as a performer, Billboard described her as having \"earned her title as one of pop's reigning queens. Since her early days as a Mouseketeer, [Spears] has pushed the boundaries of 21st century sounds, paving the way for a generation of artists to shamelessly embrace glossy pop and redefine how one can accrue consistent success in the music industry.\"[396] Entertainment Weekly's Adam Markovitz described Spears as \"an American institution, as deeply sacred and messed up as pro wrestling or the filibuster.\"[369] In 2012, she was ranked as the fourth VH1's 50 Greatest Women of the Video Era show list.[388] VH1 also cited her among its choices on the 100 Greatest Women in Music in 2012[437] and the 200 Greatest Pop Culture Icons in 2003.[438] In 2020, Billboard ranked her eight on its 100 Greatest Music Video Artists of all-time list.[389]\n\nSpears and her work have influenced various artists including Katy Perry,[439] Meghan Trainor,[440] Demi Lovato,[439] Kelly Key,[441] Kristinia DeBarge,[442] Little Boots,[443] Charli XCX,[444] Marina Diamandis,[445] the Weeknd,[446] Tegan and Sara,[447] Pixie Lott,[448] Grimes,[449] Selena Gomez,[450] Hailee Steinfeld,[451] Pabllo Vittar,[452] Tinashe,[453] Victoria Justice,[454] Cassie,[455] Leah Wellbaum of Slothrust,[456] the Saturdays,[457] Normani,[458] Miley Cyrus,[459] Cheryl,[460] Lana Del Rey,[461] Ava Max,[462] Billie Eilish,[463] Sam Smith,[464] and Rina Sawayama.[465] During the 2011 MTV Video Music Awards, Lady Gaga said that Spears \"taught us all how to be fearless, and the industry wouldn't be the same without her.\"[466] Gaga has also cited Spears as an influence, calling her \"the most provocative performer of my time.\"[467]\n\nBefore Spears joined The X Factor, Simon Cowell explained that he is \"fascinated by [Britney]. The fact that she's one of the most talked about \u2013 not just pop stars \u2013 but people in the world today, means that you've got this star power. ... She's still hot, she's still having hit records and she's still controversial, there's a reason for that.\"[468] Marina Diamandis named Spears as the main influence behind her album Electra Heart.[469] Lana Del Rey has said that the music video for \"Toxic\" inspires her.[470] Spears has had a direct influence on singer Porcelain Black's work after growing up around her music as a child. Black describes her music as a \"love child between\" Spears and Marilyn Manson.[471] Rita Ora's 2019 music video for \"Only Want You\" was inspired by Spears's \"Everytime\" music video, and said in a stories from Instagram, \"Hey @britneyspears this was for you because I love you so. Pay homage to the ones who inspire! #icon.\"[472]\n\nSpears has been credited with redefining Las Vegas residencies as a retirement place for musicians. Her debut concert residency Britney: Piece of Me was described as \"the natural evolution of Celine Dion's powerhourse Vegas residency, a still-charting star of another generation redefining the role of Strip headliner.\" Forbes named Spears the sixth-highest-earning female musician of 2015.\" She is credited with influencing and paving the way for other artists's residencies such as Jennifer Lopez's Jennifer Lopez: All I Have, Bruno Mars's Bruno Mars at Park MGM, and Backstreet Boys's Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life.[473] The arrival of Spears \"saw the pop promoters finally tap into the younger crowd arriving in town for a good time.\"[474]\n\nSpears's much-publicized personal problems and her subsequent career comeback have inspired some artists. Gwyneth Paltrow's character in the 2010 film Country Strong was inspired by Spears's treatment by the media. According to film director Shana Fest, \"that's where this movie came from. I mean, I was seeing what was happening in the media to Britney Spears. I think it's tragic how we treat people who give us so much, and we love to see them knocked down to build them back up again, to knock them down again.\"[475] Nicki Minaj has cited Spears's comeback after her much-publicized personal issues as an inspiration.[476] Spears's hounding by paparazzi and personal problems also inspired Barry Manilow's album 15 Minutes. Manilow said: \"She couldn't have a life without them pulling up next to her car and following her and driving her crazy to the point where, that was around the time she shaved off her hair. ... We all looked at it in horror ... So it seemed like a thing to be writing an album about.\"[477] Bebo Norman wrote a song about Spears, called \"Britney\", which was inspired by \"culture's make-or-break treatment of celebrities.\"[478]\n\nAwards and achievements\n\nThroughout her career, Spears has earned numerous awards and accolades, including a Grammy Award; fifteen Guinness World Records; six MTV Video Music Awards, including the Michael Jackson Video Vanguard Award; seven Billboard Music Awards, including the Millennium Award;[479] the inaugural Radio Disney Icon Award; the GLAAD Media Award's Vanguard Award and a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.[480]\n\nShe is listed by the Guinness World Records as having the \"Best-selling album by a teenage solo artist\" for her debut studio album, ...Baby One More Time, which sold over thirteen million copies in the United States.[481] Melissa Ruggieri of the Richmond Times-Dispatch reported: \"She's also marked for being the best-selling teenage artist. Before she turned 20 in 2001, Spears had sold over 37 million albums worldwide\".[482]\n\nAs of 2016 , according to the BBC, she has sold over 100 million records worldwide,[5] making her one of the best-selling music artists of all time; and more than 70 million records in United States, including 36.9 million digital singles and 33.6 million digital albums.[483][484] Spears is also recognized as the best-selling female albums artist of the 2000s in the United States, as well as the fifth overall.[10] In December 2009, Billboard ranked Spears the 8th Artist of the 2000s decade in the United States.[8] She is one of the few artists in history to have had a number-one single and a number-one studio album in the US during each of the three decades of her career.[485] With \"3\" in 2009 and \"Hold It Against Me\" in 2011, she became the second artist after Mariah Carey in the Hot 100's history to debut at number one with two or more songs.[155] In 2016, Spears ranked at number twenty on Billboard's Greatest Of All Time Top Dance Club Artists list.[486]\n\nOther ventures\n\nProduct and endorsements\n\nIn 2000, Spears released a limited edition of sunglasses titled Shades of Britney.[487] In 2001, she signed a deal with shoe company Skechers,[488] and a $7\u20138 million promotional deal with Pepsi, their biggest entertainment deal at the time.[489] Aside from numerous commercials with the latter during that year, she also appeared in a 2004 Pepsi television commercial in the theme of \"Gladiators\" with singers Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, and Enrique Iglesias.[490] On June 19, 2002, she released her first multi-platform video game, Britney's Dance Beat, which received positive reviews.[491]\n\nIn March 2009, Spears was announced as the new face of clothing brand Candie's.[492] Dari Marder, chief marketing officer for the brand, said: \"Everybody loves a comeback and nobody's doing it better than Britney. She's just poised for even greater success.\"[492] In 2010, Spears designed a limited edition line for the brand, which was released in stores in July 2010.[148] In 2011, she teamed up with Sony, Make Up For Ever, and Plenty of Fish to release her music video for \"Hold It Against Me\", earning her $500,000 for the product placement.[493]\n\nSpears also teamed up with Hasbro in 2012 to release an exclusive version of Twister Dance, which includes a remix of \"Till the World Ends\". She was also featured on a commercial, which was directed by Ray Kay, to promote the game.[494] Spears was also featured on the commercial of Twister Dance Rave, and the game included a Twister remix of \"Circus\". In March 2018, it was revealed that Spears would be the face of Kenzo, a contemporary French luxury clothing house.[247]\n\nSpears's range of commercial deals and products also includes beauty care products and perfumes. She released her first perfume with Elizabeth Arden, Curious in 2004, which broke the company's first-week gross for a perfume.[30] By 2009, she had released seven more perfumes including Fantasy.[495][496] In 2010, Spears released her eighth fragrance, Radiance. In March 2011, company Brand Sense filed a lawsuit against Spears and Elizabeth Arden seeking $10 million in damages, claiming that she and her father, Jamie, stopped paying their thirty-five percent commission that was agreed as part of the contract terms.[497]\n\nIn July 2011, a Los Angeles judge denied the request by the company lawyers, claiming the fact that Spears is still under conservatorship.[498] Brand Sense, however, stated that they would appeal the decision.[498] In 2011, Radiance was reissued as a new perfume titled Cosmic Radiance.[499] Worldwide, Spears sold over one million bottles in the first five years, with gross receipts of $1.5 billion. In 2016, Spears contacted Glu Mobile to create her own role-playing game, Britney Spears: American Dream. The app officially launched in May 2016 and is compatible with iOS and Android.[218] On June 17, 2016, Spears announced the release of her twentieth fragrance, Private Show.[500] As of January 2018 , Spears has released 24 fragrances through Elizabeth Arden.[501]\n\nPhilanthropy\n\nSpears founded The Britney Spears Foundation, a charitable entity set up to help children in need. The philosophy behind the Foundation was that music and entertainment has a healing quality that can benefit children.[502] The Foundation also supported the annual Britney Spears Camp for the Performing Arts, where campers had the opportunity to explore and develop their talents.[503] In April 2002, through the efforts of Spears and The Britney Spears Foundation, a grant of $1 million was made to the Twin Towers Fund to support the children of uniformed service heroes affected by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, including New York City Fire Department and its Emergency Medical Services Command, the New York City Police Department, the Port Authority of New York and New Jersey, the New York State Office of court Administration and other government offices.[504] However, it was reported in 2008 that the Foundation had a deficit of $200,000.[505] After Spears went through conservatorship, her father and lawyer Andrew Wallet zeroed out the effort, leading to its closure in 2011.[506]\n\nOn October 30, 2001, Spears, alongside Bono and other popular recording artists under the name \"Artists Against AIDS Worldwide\", released an album consisting of multiple versions of Marvin Gaye's \"What's Going On\", with the intention to benefit AIDS programs in Africa and other impoverished regions.[507] In the wake of Hurricane Katrina in 2005, Spears donated $350,000 to Music Rising.[508] Later in 2011, she raised $200,000 during An Evening of Southern Style at a private residence in Beverly Hills to benefit the St. Bernard Project, with the help of several celebrities, including Hilary Duff, Selena Gomez, Kelly Osbourne, Kellan Lutz, and Kim Kardashian.[509] Spears has also helped several charities during her career, including Madonna's Kabbalah-based Spirituality for Kids,[510] cancer charity Gilda's Club Worldwide,[511] Promises Foundation, and United Way, with the latter two focused on giving families from various disadvantaged situations new hope and stable foundations for the future.[508]\n\nOn October 24, 2015, Spears donated $120,000 to the Nevada Childhood Cancer Foundation.[512] In addition, $1 of each ticket sale for her Las Vegas residency, Britney: Piece of Me, was donated to the nonprofit organization.[513] Spears also fundraised for the charity through social media, in addition to selling limited edition merchandise, with all proceeds going to the NCCF.[514] On October 27, 2016, Spears partnered with Zappos and XCYCLE to host the Britney Spears Piece of Me Charity Ride in Boca Park, Las Vegas to raise additional money toward her goal of $1 million for the NCCF, with $450,000 having already been raised from Spears's ticket sales and merchandise.[515] Participants were entered for a chance to win a spin class with Spears herself. The event ultimately went on to raise $553,130.[516] The fundraising ultimately led to the development of the NCCF Britney Spears Campus in Las Vegas, which saw its grand opening on November 4, 2017.[517] Spears also regularly participates in Spirit Day to combat bullying of LGBTQ youth and bullying.[518]\n\nIn March 2020, Spears was participating in the #DoYourPartChallenge, which entails helping people with anything they might need during the coronavirus crisis. She told fans to send her messages on Instagram if they need supportive words during the coronavirus pandemic, with Spears picking three fans.[519]\n\nDiscography\n\nSelected filmography\n\nConcerts and residencies\n\nTours\n\nResidencies\n\nSee also\n\nReferences\n\nCitations", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5e/Britney_Spears%2C_Roundhouse%2C_London_%28Apple_Music_Festival_2016%29_%2830072929931%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-Britney_Spears%2C_Roundhouse%2C_London_%28Apple_Music_Festival_2016%29_%2830072929931%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Curious.jpg/220px-Curious.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Flag_of_Mississippi.svg/32px-Flag_of_Mississippi.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/ff/Wikidata-logo.svg/27px-Wikidata-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/32px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fb/Britney_Spears_car_october_2007_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Britney_Spears_car_october_2007_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/42/Circus_Live_Boston.jpg/170px-Circus_Live_Boston.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/20px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/6/69/P_vip.svg/28px-P_vip.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d1/Madonna_Rebel_Heart_Tour_2015_-_Stockholm_%2823051472299%29_%28cropped_2%29.jpg/133px-Madonna_Rebel_Heart_Tour_2015_-_Stockholm_%2823051472299%29_%28cropped_2%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/37/Britney_Spears_1999.jpg/170px-Britney_Spears_1999.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Britney_Spears_%288514687036%29.jpg/170px-Britney_Spears_%288514687036%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/85/Britney_Spears_signature.svg/150px-Britney_Spears_signature.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg/200px-Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/23px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/69/BritneyPOM1.jpg/170px-BritneyPOM1.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/84/Britney_Spears.jpg/170px-Britney_Spears.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/87/Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg/50px-Gnome-mime-sound-openclipart.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/2/25/Free_Britney_Movement_in_Washington_1.jpg/220px-Free_Britney_Movement_in_Washington_1.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9d/Britney_Europe.jpg/170px-Britney_Europe.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/55/IUSA_Circus_Tour.jpg/170px-IUSA_Circus_Tour.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9c/JanetJacksonUnbreakableTourSanFran2015_%28cropped%29.jpg/133px-JanetJacksonUnbreakableTourSanFran2015_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/6/6c/Audio-input-microphone.png/28px-Audio-input-microphone.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Britney_Spears", "title": "Britney Spears", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/d/da/Britney_Spears_2013_%28Straighten_Crop%29.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 1018}, "title": "Britney Spears - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
