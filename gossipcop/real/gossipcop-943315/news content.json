Instead he tried to make out with his mom. \u201cThe one thing he took away from it, aside from all the things I was worried about, was he kept trying to French kiss me afterwards, which was very sweet,\u201d the American Woman actress explained.\n\n\u201cAnd you said, \u2019That is not appropriate?\u2019\u201d asked Colbert.\n\n\u201cI just kept my mouth closed,\u201d she replied. \u201cThat\u2019s what I did. And I just giggled. It\u2019s super sweet.\u201d\n\nBut the 54-year-old host didn\u2019t seem so sure.\n\n\u201cAre you worried?\u201d Silverstone quipped. \u201cIt\u2019s fine, he\u2019s not doing it anymore.\u201d\n\nThough Bear just recently celebrated his 7th birthday, Silverstone is already thinking about the day he moves out of her house. \u201cThe whole idea is that you love and attach to them so much so that they\u2019re free to be and leave,\u201d she told Us Weekly in May. \u201cMy kid\u2019s so fiercely independent because he is right here all the time,\u201d she added, gesturing to her heart. \u201cHe\u2019s so great.\u201d\n\nSilverstone and Bear\u2019s dad, Chris Jarecki, announced their split in February after 20 years of marriage. She filed for divorce last month.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/682483494_Alicia-Silverstone-Bear-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/682483494_Alicia-Silverstone-Bear-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/alicia-silverstones-son-tried-to-kiss-her-after-watching-clueless/", "title": "Alicia Silverstone\u2019s Son Tried to Kiss Her After Watching \u2018Clueless\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Alicia Silverstone revealed on Monday, June 11, that her son, Bear, tried to \u2018French kiss\u2019 her after watching \u2018Clueless\u2019 \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Alicia Silverstone: My Son Tried to \u2018French Kiss\u2019 Me After Seeing \u2018Clueless\u2019", "description": "Alicia Silverstone revealed on Monday, June 11, that her son, Bear, tried to \u2018French kiss\u2019 her after watching \u2018Clueless\u2019 \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/alicia-silverstones-son-tried-to-kiss-her-after-watching-clueless/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-12T15:09:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/682483494_Alicia-Silverstone-Bear-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/682483494_Alicia-Silverstone-Bear-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-12T15:09:41+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alicia Silverstone: My Son Tried to \u2018French Kiss\u2019 Me After Seeing \u2018Clueless\u2019", "description": "Alicia Silverstone revealed on Monday, June 11, that her son, Bear, tried to \u2018French kiss\u2019 her after watching \u2018Clueless\u2019 \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/682483494_Alicia-Silverstone-Bear-zoom.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1049px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@rachelpaula", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528816181.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
