According to Scott Hannah, the president and CEO of the Credit Counseling Society of Canada, the company, which was accused of \"bilking thousands of vulnerable Canadians\" grew to dominate half of the Canadian market due to Thicke being hired \"as a spokesman who was very credible to Canadians.\"[52]\n\nPhilanthropy [ edit ]\n\nAs noted, Thicke lent his name and star power to supporting the Alan Thicke Center for diabetes research.
