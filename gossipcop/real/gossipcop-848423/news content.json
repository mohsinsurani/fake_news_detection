But the real question is \u2013 what episode?\u201d\n\nI mean, c'mon, I'm actually having a hard time believing it. But the real question is - what episode? https://t.co/sqGyRT8e0z \u2014 Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) May 3, 2017\n\n@OfficialJLD @DrDayaSharma @James_Jeffrey Episode One in this new series. Where Jonah has the close shave. Pure gold, your highness!!! \u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f \u2014 Graham Perrett (@GrahamPerrettMP) May 4, 2017\n\n@GrahamPerrettMP @DrDayaSharma @James_Jeffrey Well, thank you very much. Take good care of yourself and for God's sakes - be careful! \u2014 Julia Louis-Dreyfus (@OfficialJLD) May 4, 2017\n\nPerrett later told BuzzFeed News the scene that induced the laughter that led to choking was one in the first episode of the new season in which Congressman Jonah Ryan is caught shaving his head to fake having cancer.\n\n\n\n\u201cI was laughing so hard \u2026 some of the rice went down the wrong way,\u201d Perrett told BuzzFeed News. \u201cI started choking and I kind of stumbled forward and knocked my head on the corner of the kitchen cabinet.\u201d\n\nHis wife found him unconscious on the ground, \u201cwith blood everywhere\u201d.\n\n\u201cI must have been out for only a few seconds because, when I came to again, I was still laughing at Jonah.\u201d\n\nTimothy Simons, the actor who plays Jonah, responded on Twitter: \u201chahahahahahaha oh my god. oh my god.\u201d\n\n\n\nHe promised: \u201cWe\u2019ll tone it down a bit next year for this guy\u2019s sake, or maybe send him some edited eps.\u201d\n\nDavid Mandel, the executive producer of Veep, told Guardian Australia he was \u201cvery glad someone thinks the episode was as funny as we do\u201d.\n\n\n\n\u201cI can think of a few officials in the USA that I may send the episode to,\u201d he added. \u201cWith any luck, their wives won\u2019t be home.\u201d\n\nLast year, the show\u2019s writers and stars responded with similar astonishment at news the Australian prime minister, Malcolm Turnbull, was campaigning with the slogan \u201cContinuity and change\u201d: almost word-for-word that used by Louis-Dreyfus\u2019 presidential candidate, Selina Myer, in season four.\n\n\n\nArmando Iannucci, the creator of Veep and The Thick of It, had discussed the mirroring of satire and real life in Sydney on Tuesday night. Guardian Australia has contacted him for comment on Perrett\u2019s injury via a representative.\n\n\n\nAsked whether the state of modern politics made his job harder or easier, Mandel said, oddly it was harder.\n\n\u201cWhen the world is boring, the comedy bar is lower, [but] politicians keep doing stupid/crazy and funny things. We have to compete.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/e36f06886f809750f6e2469333cefeb29fdf7cdd/0_31_3346_2009/master/3346.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2208ea13f5b2e9217254f2f45eacec41a82381c5/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7d0e2d15a6ee7482afd961cb8dbac49b", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Veep%2CAustralia+news%2CCulture%2CTV+comedy%2CTelevision%2CUS+television%2CLabor+party%2CQueensland%2CAustralian+politics%2CComedy%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CWorld+news"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2208ea13f5b2e9217254f2f45eacec41a82381c5/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7d0e2d15a6ee7482afd961cb8dbac49b", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elle Hunt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/04/veep-stars-respond-to-australian-mp-who-knocked-himself-out-laughing-at-episode", "title": "Veep stars respond to Australian MP who knocked himself out laughing at episode", "meta_data": {"description": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus tells Labor MP Graham Perrett to \u2018be careful\u2019 after mishap leaves him with black eye and stitches", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/04/veep-stars-respond-to-australian-mp-who-knocked-himself-out-laughing-at-episode", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2208ea13f5b2e9217254f2f45eacec41a82381c5/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=7d0e2d15a6ee7482afd961cb8dbac49b", "height": 720}, "title": "Veep stars respond to Australian MP who knocked himself out laughing at episode", "description": "Julia Louis-Dreyfus tells Labor MP Graham Perrett to \u2018be careful\u2019 after mishap leaves him with black eye and stitches", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/elle-hunt", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-03-13T16:13:59.000Z", "section": "Television & radio", "published_time": "2017-05-04T03:16:51.000Z", "tag": "Veep,Australia news,Culture,TV comedy,Television,US television,Labor party,Queensland,Australian politics,Comedy,Television & radio,World news"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://tv-and-radio/2017/may/04/veep-stars-respond-to-australian-mp-who-knocked-himself-out-laughing-at-episode?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/may/04/veep-stars-respond-to-australian-mp-who-knocked-himself-out-laughing-at-episode", "iphone": "gnmguardian://tv-and-radio/2017/may/04/veep-stars-respond-to-australian-mp-who-knocked-himself-out-laughing-at-episode?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://tv-and-radio/2017/may/04/veep-stars-respond-to-australian-mp-who-knocked-himself-out-laughing-at-episode?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/2208ea13f5b2e9217254f2f45eacec41a82381c5/0_112_2000_1200/master/2000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=6ba4c6db9adc68ab48de6e7f9147f642", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493852400.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
