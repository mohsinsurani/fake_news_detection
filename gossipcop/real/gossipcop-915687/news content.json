And while that may sound like something to brag about to you and me, it sparked a battle on Thursday's \"Ellen DeGeneres Show.\"\n\nThe problem? It's great to be her friend, but it's even better to be her best friend \u2014 and there can be only one, evidently.\n\n\"(Reese) somehow claims that just because she was in that movie ('A Wrinkle in Time') with you that she's your best friend,\" DeGeneres noted, having made a similar claim concerning her own closeness to Winfrey.\n\nBut all of that talk simply left Oprah wondering, \"Why do we have to have a better or a best?\"\n\nMeanwhile DeGeneres preferred to focus on her own question: Who deserves the coveted BFF title?\n\nMichael Rozman/ Warner Bros.\n\nTo settle the matter once and for all, the host brought out Witherspoon for an Oprah Winfrey trivia showdown. Whoever could answer the most Oprah-related tidbits correctly \u2014 such as what her fellow high school students voted her \"most likely to ...\" or her secret ingredient to a great margarita \u2014 would win.\n\nAlas, they got both of those questions wrong. The answers were \"most popular\" and \"fresh-squeezed limes,\" respectively.\n\n\"So far, I have no friends,\" Winfrey quipped. \"I have none.\"\n\nNot so!\n\nBefore the bid was over, Witherspoon and DeGeneres managed to get a couple of answers right, with DeGeneres taking the lead by one \u2014 thanks, in part, to the fact that she knew which 1990s sitcom Oprah played a therapist on; It was none other than \"Ellen.\"\n\nMichael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nThere you have it; DeGeneres is officially Winfrey's BFF!\n\nAlthough we have a feeling Gayle King might have something to say about.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_08/1319974/reese-oprah-on-ellen-today-inline-1-180222.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_08/1319975/reese-oprah-on-ellen-today-tease-180222.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201802/tdy_pop_klg_chat_oprah_ellen_180222_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_08/1319976/reese-oprah-on-ellen-today-inline-2-180222.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_08/1319975/reese-oprah-on-ellen-today-tease-180222.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ree Hines"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/who-s-oprah-s-bestie-ellen-degeneres-reese-witherspoon-battle-t123745", "title": "Who's Oprah's bestie?
