What an absolute angel!\"\n\nAround 130,000 are due to attend the benefit concert on Sunday which will feature performances from other stars including Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Miley Cyrus and Coldplay.\n\nTickets for the show sold out within minutes and the proceeds will raise money for victims and their families.\n\nPolice now believe Abedi acted alone in the days before the attack but are still working to establish whether he was part of a wider network.\n\nA 24-year-old man was arrested in Manchester Friday in relation to the investigation.\n\nIn total 17 people have been arrested. Six people have since been released without charge and 11 men remain in custody for questioning.\n\nPrince William was also in Manchester Friday to pay tribute to the victims of the attack. He visited police headquarters, a hospital and then attended a service at Manchester Cathedral.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_03/3190971/190708-saphora-smith-byline-753.jpg", "https://media4.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201706/tdy_jones_ariana_170603.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms", "Saphora Smith", "Saphora Smith Is A London-Based Reporter For Nbc News Digital."], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/manchester-concert-explosion/ariana-grande-visits-injured-fans-manchester-ahead-charity-concert-n767901", "title": "Ariana Grande Visits Injured Fans in Manchester Ahead of Charity Concert", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/manchester-concert-explosion/ariana-grande-visits-injured-fans-manchester-ahead-charity-concert-n767901", "title": "'Got to meet my queen today': Ariana Grande visits injured fans in Manchester", "description": "The pop star visited the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital chatting and posing for selfies with the injured children.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg", "title": "'Got to meet my queen today': Ariana Grande visits injured fans in Manchester", "description": "The pop star visited the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital chatting and posing for selfies with the injured children.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The pop star visited the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital chatting and posing for selfies with the injured children.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "'Got to meet my queen today': Ariana Grande visits injured fans in Manchester", "description": "The pop star visited the Royal Manchester Children\u2019s Hospital chatting and posing for selfies with the injured children.", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg", "type": "article", "unibrow": "World", "authorThumbnail1": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2020_03/3190971/190708-saphora-smith-byline-753.jpg", "authorName1": "Saphora Smith"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Sat Jun 03 2017 12:08:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Sat Jun 03 2017 20:31:26 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2023826/ariana.jpg", "next-head-count": 101}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496491680.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
