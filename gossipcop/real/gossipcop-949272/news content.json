The model appeared in Zayn's 2016 video for 'PILLOWTALK' and, though the two briefly split earlier this year, Zigi very much appears to be \"on\" at the moment.\n\nPicture: Instagram Stories/Gigi Hadid\n\nUnfortunately, with every public relationship comes scrutiny and even the odd \"fake couple\" accusation. Judging from a recent Instagram comment left by Gigi, the 23-year-old model has officially reached her limit with people accusing her and Zayn of being in a showmance.\n\nGigi has hit back at claims she and Zayn are in a fake relationship, calling the rumours \"negative\" and saying it would be her \"last comment on this matter\".\n\nAccording to the model, an Instagram account dedicated to \"exposing\" the couple had been tagging Gigi in posts about her and Zayn's romance being for \"promo\".\n\nGigi delivered a measured response that even included a declaration of no \"hard feelings\" toward the person running the account.\n\nPicture: via Gigi Hadid/Instagram\n\nIn the ultimate, 'i'm-not-angry-i'm-just-disappointed' move, Gigi wrote \"the energy you put into this does not serve your life in any way\" and urged the poster to \"go out and live\". Queen of mature clap backs.\n\nGigi also stated that she wasn't worried over whether Zayn was following her on Instagram because her eyes are tatted on his chest. Which, I mean, touch\u00e9, sis.\n\nPeople backed Gigi's defense of her relationship.\n\nThough, for the record, she shouldn't have to defend it to anyone.\n\nPicture: Twitter/@_leahoconnor\n\nPicture: Twitter/@Shezquad\n\n@GiGiHadid Please don't let stupid internet comments affect your relationship with Zayn, we support you and we love u. \ud83d\udc96 \u2014 Inna-Z. \ud83e\uddea\ud83d\udc99\ud83c\udde8\ud83c\uddf1 (@zmsickmarvel) July 3, 2018\n\nKeep posting pictures of Zayn, he is your man. The anti zigis are pressed losers who use their spare time to send hate against your beautiful relationship with Zayn. It's beyond pathetic. His real fans appreciate your relationship and respect it \ud83d\udc95 @GiGiHadid \u2014 Willow \ud83c\udf78 (@ZaynxRiri) June 29, 2018\n\nI can\u2019t believe she\u2019s apologizing for defending herself \ud83d\ude2d\n\n\u201cIm sorry if it came off immature\u201d\n\nWe love you @GiGiHadid \u2764\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/d5V8eqdBc1 \u2014 Zayn&Gigi News (@ZigiFacts) July 3, 2018\n\nIn a separate Instagram comment, Gigi also wrote \"I've just had enough. Just because I'm a 'celebrity' doesn't mean I don't feel.\"\n\nPicture: Getty/Pascal Le Segretain\n\nAt the end of the day, the only people who know the important details about Zayn and Gigi's relationship are Zayn and Gigi. Anyone spending any real energy on celebrity relationship conspiracies should, in the immortal words of Gigi Hadid, \"go outside and live.\"", "images": ["https://www.popbuzz.com/assets_v4r/gusto/img/twitter-share.png", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/332469?width=105&crop=1_1&signature=3HxnWZuITxONzAMnwhFLww53yS8=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10608?crop=16_9&width=660&relax=1&signature=kdteJt-AgOb1-li6f7sgpM4qE4U=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/332384?width=105&crop=1_1&signature=IJ3xbFmNpCjHzislQ5uZztSx9vg=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10598?crop=16_9&width=660&relax=1&signature=_gsXWw-u8OJXR3nwno389VEeRM0=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10615?crop=16_9&width=660&relax=1&signature=5tcUK8hlWGzpZGHN7sqW4iAgwOw=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10607?crop=16_9&width=660&relax=1&signature=svXhd6V8TRl38qvjXZR6wW1W1W4=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/324715?width=105&crop=1_1&signature=Jtm_aAVzfLAOvZ2h_8tXklw6uSY=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/332353?width=105&crop=1_1&signature=c-Db8KGmYKGD3_HJNo-vcgbnFyc=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/332398?width=105&crop=1_1&signature=BUmYDXzlhiSGMXKqdEeDA8btCIQ=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/2133?crop=1_1&width=200&signature=zjc5cpXGD_4Ju5hbmqL0xMaToFM=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10615?width=1200&crop=16_9&signature=pab2f04BCcPIkPYzaPsmOi-5oTU=", "https://www.popbuzz.com/assets_v4r/gusto/img/facebook-share.png", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/332497?width=105&crop=1_1&signature=TY7VLTpePIqBopwv7NFENbQ8IO8=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10605?crop=16_9&width=660&relax=1&signature=7vDtTxbdaxLWMfETxutOSw09ykA=", "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10599?crop=16_9&width=660&relax=1&signature=WSUKY9Tw8G0LEshvIo5zxo2osMU="], "top_img": "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10615?width=1200&crop=16_9&signature=pab2f04BCcPIkPYzaPsmOi-5oTU=", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicky Idika"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/gigi-zayn-fake-relationship-response/", "title": "Gigi Hadid Responds To Troll Who Said Her Relationship With Zayn Is Fake", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"url": "https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/gigi-zayn-fake-relationship-response/", "site_name": "PopBuzz", "domain": "www.popbuzz.com", "title": "Gigi Hadid Responds To Troll Who Said Her Relationship With Zayn Is Fake", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10615?width=1200&crop=16_9&signature=pab2f04BCcPIkPYzaPsmOi-5oTU=", "height": 675, "width": 1200}, "description": "Gigi clapped back at a person who claimed her relationship with Zayn for \"promo\"."}, "twitter": {"site": "@popbuzz", "url": "https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/gigi-zayn-fake-relationship-response/", "title": "Gigi Hadid Responds To Troll Who Said Her Relationship With Zayn Is Fake", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10615?width=1200&crop=16_9&signature=pab2f04BCcPIkPYzaPsmOi-5oTU=", "description": "Gigi clapped back at a person who claimed her relationship with Zayn for \"promo\"."}, "fb": {"admins": "627792841,551351399,716836285,1547481361,837890453,661531116", "app_id": 1590232324531551, "page_id": 1488952944702289, "pages": 1488952944702289}, "pubdate": "2018-07-04T16:51:06", "modified": "2018-07-04T16:51:10", "parsely-type": "post", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "keywords": "fake, gigi, clapped, back, hadid, responds, troll, relationship, promo, person, zayn, claimed", "description": "Gigi clapped back at a person who claimed her relationship with Zayn for \"promo\".", "parsely-author": "Nicky Idika", "parsely-link": "https://www.popbuzz.com/music/news/gigi-zayn-fake-relationship-response/", "parsely-section": "/music/news/", "parsely-title": "Gigi Hadid Responds To Troll Who Said Her Relationship With Zayn Is Fake", "parsely-post-id": 11046, "parsely-pub-date": "2018-07-04T16:51:06+01:00", "parsely-image-url": "https://images.popbuzz.com/images/10615?width=1200&crop=16_9&signature=pab2f04BCcPIkPYzaPsmOi-5oTU="}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.popbuzz.com", "summary": ""}
