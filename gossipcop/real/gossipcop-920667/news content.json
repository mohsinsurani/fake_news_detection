This is all just very frustrating and I'm only human ... I've seen the s--t on this account for just as long as u- and have too stand quiet. - I've just had enough.. just because I'm 'a celebrity' doesn't mean I don't feel, or that my time is too precious to not listen to what people have to say. I'm sure you can see how assumptions like this can be hurtful, especially about someone I love deeply- if you guys love him too, sooner or later you'll realise we're on the same team. ;)\"\n\n26 July 2018 - Yolanda Hadid shares an Instagram Story hanging out with Zayn.

Honestly, these two don't even need a professional photographer to look amazing.\n\nThe rare photo of the couple came as part of British Vogue's campaign to raise money for NHS Charities Together and the NAACP, with celebs donating their clothes to British Vogue's 'Hardly Ever Worn It' auction.
