Safe Haven, the delightfully soapy Nicholas Sparks adaptation starring Julianne Hough and Tad Hamilton Josh Duhamel is coming to Netflix in March 2017. Clear your schedule immediately: You need to watch this movie every night for three weeks straight in order to get its full effect.\n\nOK, so Safe Haven isn't exactly an Oscar winner, but it's perfect for the entertainment transition happening right now. You're over the weighty prestige films from awards season, but you're not quite ready for the mindless summer blockbusters that will flood the cinema come Memorial Day. Safe Haven\u2014with its melodrama and beachside make-out sessions\u2014is a deliriously happy medium.\n\nIn fact, several titles hitting Netflix in March 2017 fit this genre. From another season of the Netflix original series Grace and Frankie to The Craft and the third season of How to Get Away With Murder, Netflix has your \"not too heavy but not too mindless\" content on lock.
