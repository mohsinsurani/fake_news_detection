News reports that the high-end item has an estimated retail value of $820\n\nMany commenters, however, were more concerned with the comfort and safety of the carrier, suggesting that it is the wrong \"shape\" and that it looks \"unhealthy.\"\n\nPediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert told INSIDER that it's difficult to judge Stormi's safety by the photo alone, but it's possible her legs are not in the proper position.\n\n\n\nKylie Jenner has suddenly become shy about showcasing her daughter, Stormi Webster. The 20-year-old mom recently deleted every Instagram photo that gave fans a look at Stormi's face head-on.\n\nIt's not difficult to see why she may be feeling protective. From rumors about Stormi's true parentage to weirdly specific photoshop accusations, it seems that everyone with a social media account has an opinion on the 4-month-old baby. In keeping with this theme, the most recent photo of Jenner holding her daughter has predictably caught plenty of negative attention.\n\nAlthough the photo does not show Stormi's face, it does show the new mom holding her daughter in a Gucci carrier \u2014 one that has an estimated retail value of $820, according to E! News. (If you have a baby and nearly a grand to drop, you're out of luck; it's already sold out.)\n\nhappy birthday North & P.. \ud83d\udda4 A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Jun 3, 2018 at 1:31pm PDT Jun 3, 2018 at 1:31pm PDT\n\nMany fans commented to tell Jenner that she looks \"adorable\" and \"natural.\" Many others, however, took issue with the way Stormi is being cradled \u2014 specifically taking issue with the carrier itself, calling it \"awful,\" \"uncomfortable,\" and claiming that it's the wrong \"shape.\"\n\nMultiple comments chided the young mom for not choosing an \"ergonomic\" design, which essentially means that it's both comfortable for the parent and supportive for the child.\n\n\"Non ergonomic. It isn't safe. You're hurting Stormi,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"Maybe you would be able to extend this sweet moment in better comfort for both of you with an ergonomic babycarrier,\" another wrote. \"You'll find very smart ones that would respect Stormi's body and prevents you for suffering of back pain.\"\n\nOther commenters were less specific with their criticisms.\n\n\"This isn't a safe carrier, so she obviously didn't get a safe carrier for her baby. She got a Gucci carrier so she could look cool,\" one comment reads.\n\n\"OMG POOR BABY....ITS NOT HEALTHY FOR HER,\" reads another.\n\nIt's not clear exactly what aspect of the photo or carrier these comments were referencing. It's possible that they are concerned about Stormi's head and neck not seeming completely supported, but BabyCenter reports that babies are typically able to hold their own heads up at 4 months old. The skinny leather straps also seem less than comfortable for the new mom's shoulders.\n\nAnother possibility, according to pediatrician Dr. Natasha Burgert, is the positioning of Stormi's legs.\n\n\"What people may be criticizing is the baby's leg position. In a baby carrier, it is best for baby's hips to be slightly flexed when carried rather than dangling straight down,\" Burgert told INSIDER in an email. \"If the baby is carried with legs straight for a prolonged period, this puts her at risk for hip problems (developmental hip dysplasia).\n\n\"In this photo, it is not possible to tell if her legs are truly flexed, so we can leave the firm criticism at the door,\" Burgert said. \"But, the carrier itself does seem very narrow at the bottom, likely not allowing for the best infant positioning.\"\n\nBurgert also noted, understandably, that she is skeptical whether Gucci is \"known for making the best baby carriers\" \u2014 and luxury consignment websites offer little detail about its safety features.\n\nDespite this, the New York Times noted in 2010 that, while wraps and baby carriers are traditional in many parts of the world, celebrities have made it so that \"'wearing' one's baby has taken on a certain cachet,\" prompting a widespread use of \"upscale versions.\"\n\nOf course, this is not the first time Jenner has opted for designer baby goods. The reality star posted a photo in April of herself pushing Stormi in a Fendi stroller.\n\nstormi strolls \ud83e\udd11 A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Apr 12, 2018 at 5:22pm PDT Apr 12, 2018 at 5:22pm PDT\n\nAccording to Burgert, deciding to use either a stroller or baby carrier is \"simply a family decision for what works best,\" as there is no evidence-based research to suggest that one is better than the other.\n\n\n\nFor parents who do prefer baby carriers though, Burgert recommends choosing a high-quality carrier that offers butt and hip support, keeping the baby's legs in a flexed position.\n\n\"The baby's legs should be slightly spread and the carrier should support he leg from thigh to knee joint,\" she told INSIDER, adding that the baby \"should be facing the parent until at least 6 months.\" Parents should also keep in mind that babies need time to stretch out at regular intervals, and they should be diligent about applying sunscreen to the arms and legs.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b16a1bc5e48ec21008b4595?width=700", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://i.insider.com/5b16a1385e48ec19008b45c8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/5c93e81cd2ce786b837b2961?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b16a1385e48ec19008b45c8?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Callie Ahlgrim"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/kylie-jenner-stormi-gucci-carrier-how-to-hold-baby-2018-6", "title": "Kylie Jenner held Stormi in an $820 Gucci baby carrier \u2014 but people are only focused on whether it's safe", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Kylie Jenner held Stormi in an $820 Gucci baby carrier \u2014 but people are only focused on whether it's safe", "datePublished": "2018-06-05T17:47:10Z", "dateModified": "2018-06-05T17:47:13Z", "news_keywords": "Kylie Jenner, Babies, Motherhood, Parenting, Stormi Webster, Callie Ahlgrim", "description": "Kylie Jenner recently posted a photo of herself holding her 4-month-old daughter, Stormi, in a Gucci baby carrier worth $820.
