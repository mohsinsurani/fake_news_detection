Could\u2019ve fooled us.\n\nIn an all-white getup, Donald Glover poured his heart and soul into his performance of \u201cTerrified\u201d off of the acclaimed 2016 album Awaken, My Love! The singer was nominated for five Grammys and won Best Traditional R&B performance for \u201cRedbone\u201d tonight.\n\nGlover, who scared many of his fans when he vowed to retire his rap name last year, sang like it wouldn\u2019t be his last. The rapper-singer seldom performs so the falsetto was a surprise but it was welcomed. He brought the soothing voice from the end of the track on, too. The precocious nine-year-old J.D. McCrary, who\u2019s set to play Simba in the Lion King live-action film, complemented the singer with stunning vocals. The duo let their passion carry them to the end of the performance.\n\nThe multidisciplined entertainer is always hitting the world with something new and recently, he announced that there will be more music. There are no dates but it\u2019s got everyone on the edge of their seats.\n\nUntil then, expect Glover at all corners, including the new season of the FX series Atlanta on March 1.", "images": ["https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-vibe-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childish-gambino-terrified-grammy-performance-1517192871.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=710947549794527&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childish-gambino-terrified-grammy-performance-1517192871.jpg?w=910&h=511&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/childish-gambino-terrified-grammy-performance-1517192871.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lola Jacobs"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vibe.com/music/music-news/childish-gambino-terrified-grammys-2018-performance-562138/", "title": "Childish Gambino\u2019s Poignant Grammys Performance Brings The Neo-Soul We Needed", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-vibe-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.vibe.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/cropped-VIBE_favicon.png?w=270", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "First time playing the Grammys?
