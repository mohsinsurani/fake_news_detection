The gala is The Trevor Project\u2019s annual fundraiser and last night, Tom Ford and Kristin Chenoweth were among some of the night\u2019s honorees.\n\nFergie\u2019s appearances made for two very awkward moments that have left us wondering what the hell was going on. We\u2019re thinking there was a scheduling mishap, as maybe Fergie was initially planned to present Tom Ford with the night\u2019s penultimate honor, even though Armie Hammer was there to do so.\n\n\u201cI am grateful to be here supporting Trevor and what they are doing for young people in the LGBTQ community,\u201d Hammer began. \u201cI am here tonight to talk about a man whose life embodies what it means to change perceptions, to shadow stereotypes and provide a new perspective of hope.\u201d\n\nBefore the actor could continue, Fergie walked onstage and interrupted him, confusing a few attendees. \u201cOh, yes!\u201d Armie said. \u201cLadies and gentleman, Fergie!\u201d\n\nNext, he whispers something inaudible to Fergie, apologizing to her before she takes the microphone for her horribly awkward speech.\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m not Fergie; I am actually Armie Hammer. Thank you. I am going to win at the Academy Awards. Thanks!\u201d she joked. \u201cSo, this is unexpected, and in typical Tom Ford style, I think he would love that \u2014 if he was here.\u201d\n\nSomeone from the audience yelled Fergie\u2019s name. Rambling, she turns to Armie Hammer, still pretending that he was her and she was him. \u201cThey really love you,\u201d she said. \u201cThey do! They really love you!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut, uh, Tom Ford is here. He\u2019s here on this bag. He\u2019s here on this amazing T-shirt, mock-style, long-sleeve shirt and fabulous skirt and pumps. But, he\u2019s also here as a person. And the thing is, behind all the Tom Ford life, which I thrive to get \u2014 I was really embarrassed that I didn\u2019t have Tom Ford makeup in my bag, by the way; so shaming \u2014 he is a person of compassion,\u201d she said in between odd pauses. \u201cHe\u2019s a director. He loves to see people\u2019s feelings and listen.\u201d\n\nFergie told the audience, \u201cThis is not a shameless promotion; I have a lot of shame. Uh, I have a new song called \u2018A Little Work,\u2019 and I have a version that has alternate verses. And so, shamelessly \u2014 no! Shame! With shame! \u2014 I promote the Target version that has these bonus tracks with the alt verses. Um\u2026these are the alt versus. Because honestly, just sitting there with you tonight, Tom Ford \u2014 purse-bag man, the myth, the legend \u2014 it made me think of that. These are the ones that might not be heard by all, but they will be heard by you.\u201d\n\nFergie then sang a few lines from her song \u201cA Little Work.\u201d After she finished her impromptu performance, she joked, \u201cI\u2019m still Armie Hammer, and this is the first time I\u2019ve ever sang for you guys in my life. And now I\u2019m going for my Tony!\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you so much!\u201d she said, stilling pretending to be Hammer, \u201cWelcome, everybody, Fergie!\u201d\n\nHammer stepped up to the microphone and made the best of the strange situation, joking with the audience, \u201cIf I had a nickel for every time that I was confused with Fergie \u2026 By the way, Fergie!\u201d\n\nLater in the night, singer Shoshannah Bean walked offstage so the crew could address some technical issues. During that time, Fergie jumped out of her seat and got onstage, crashing the show again for a second time.\n\nFergie then led the audience in a sing-along of that song she sang the first time, \u201cA Little Work.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know the other part, but that\u2019s cool, though,\u201d Fergie told them. \u201cBut you will!\u201d\n\n\u201cJust, I guess, with full shame or no shame, I don\u2019t know, get it on iTones\u2026iTones? That\u2019s a new one. iTunes,\u201d Fergie continued. \u201cAnyway, just get it if you want. You know what? Listen if you want. If you like it, listen, if you don\u2019t \u2014 don\u2019t! But it\u2019s a song that is really personal to me and\u2026Give it up for Tom Ford! Trevor Project! This project. I wasn\u2019t even planned to speak tonight, but I guess I can\u2019t stand it when everyone else is up here singing. Um, but this project really means so much to me. I mean, honestly, reading about the suicide, uh, percentage and\u2014\u201d\n\nBefore she could finish, a voice came over the loudspeaker and said, \u201cLadies and gentlemen, the unpredictable Fergie.\u201d The voice then reintroduced Bean to the stage. \u201cAnyway, thank you, Trevor Project,\u201d Fergie just before her microphone was shut off. \u201cI\u2019m really serious about that.\u201d\n\n\u201cGive it up for Fergie,\u201d the voice said as she walked away. \u201cShoshannah is back!\u201d\n\nWe love Fergie, we really do. And while this is strange and unusual, it makes us love her even more.", "images": ["https://hornet.com/assets/images/header_logo.svg", "https://hornet.com/assets/images/icons/hornet_share_icon.svg",
