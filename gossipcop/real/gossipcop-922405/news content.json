That three-time Oscar winner says he\u2019s done with acting, and now the two-time Academy Awardee is on the record as saying the thrill is gone for him, too.\n\nIn an CBS Sunday Morning interview with Tracy Smith set to air this weekend, Penn says he really doesn\u2019t dig the whole acting thing anymore. \u201cYou know, I think that this has been true for some time,\u201d he tells Smith. \u201cIt can be great when you\u2019re working with good actors or good directors or good writing as an exercise, but do I have a belief that it has a lasting value? Maybe, I could make the argument intellectually. But I don\u2019t have a visceral \u2013 I\u2019m not in love with that anymore.\u201d\n\nMaybe all he needs are some tasty waves and a cool buzz and he\u2019ll be fine.\n\nBut there are other aspects of the industry that still do it for him, like writing \u2014 which he does in longhand. The interview is tied to the release of his first novel, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff, which is due Tuesday from Simon & Schuster. It\u2019s about a septic tank salesman-turned-assassin who kills people with a mallet. Among his other actions, Honey sends a letter containing a veiled threat to a fictional president.\n\nDoes he worry people won\u2019t get the joke?\n\n\u201cYou know, some people are going to get this book and some people are \u2013 not going to get this book,\u201d Penn says in the interview. \u201cSome people, I think, will really enjoy it, others will loathe it. And \u2013 and that really is what I\u2019d like to say about me, you know?\u201d\n\nRelated stories\n\nSean Penn's Debut Novel Set To Take On Donald Trump & #MeToo\n\nDylan Farrow Thanks Oprah, Shonda Rhimes For Woody Allen Discussion - Update\n\nSean Penn: Donald Trump Is \"An Enemy Of Compassion, An Enemy Of The State\"", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_w_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4VbDSNevtkhheFRu1FkMKQ--~B/aD00Mjg7dz02MjE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/homerun/deadline.com/8342c0f2c392345c99619d4ab2d542a2", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7241469&c5=1197800334&c7=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.yahoo.com%2Fentertainment%2Fsean-penn-acting-m-not-173114172.html&c14=-1", "https://s.yimg.com/rz/p/yahoo_entertainment_en-US_h_p_entertainmentv2.png", "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190501/placeholder.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/hJHUNwo657kG38VPoOxpOg--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTIxMjtoPTQ4/https://s.yimg.com/os/creatr-uploaded-images/2020-11/ea7626b0-2b28-11eb-a4ed-68d596abe108", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/r3T3pMjpgV0YLoIy3n3x7A--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTk2MDtoPTY2Mg--/https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4VbDSNevtkhheFRu1FkMKQ--~B/aD00Mjg7dz02MjE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/homerun/deadline.com/8342c0f2c392345c99619d4ab2d542a2"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/4VbDSNevtkhheFRu1FkMKQ--~B/aD00Mjg7dz02MjE7YXBwaWQ9eXRhY2h5b24-/http://media.zenfs.com/en-us/homerun/deadline.com/8342c0f2c392345c99619d4ab2d542a2", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erik Pedersen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.yahoo.com/entertainment/sean-penn-acting-m-not-173114172.html", "title": "Sean Penn On Acting: \u201cI\u2019m Not In Love With That Anymore\u201d", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.yahoo.com"}}, "news_keywords": "Daniel Day-Lewis, Sean Penn", "twitter": {"title": "Sean Penn On Acting: \u201cI\u2019m Not In Love With That Anymore\u201d", "description": "Is Sean Penn thinking of going the Daniel Day-Lewis route?
