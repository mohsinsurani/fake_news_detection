It\u2019s part of your beauty. And you can manage it with some patience and the right tools. Here are some tips from the pros to help you care for your naturally curly hair.\n\nKnow your hair type\n\nIf you know what kind of hair you have, it\u2019s easier to select the best shampoos and styling products. Take an online quiz and look at some photos to determine if you have wavy, curly, or coily locks. Then dig into the subtypes because those matter too. Your stylist can also help you decide.\n\nPrep before you wash\n\nBefore you shampoo, pre-shampoo. This means using conditioner to detangle your hair before you wash it. Even before you wet your hair, massage the product into the dry strands. Use your fingers to separate curls. Then wait a few minutes before you step into the shower and shampoo as normal.\n\nCo-wash or wash less\n\nSome people with curly hair find that their locks are easier to manage if they don\u2019t wash them every single day. Others extend the time between shampooings by washing with only water. That\u2019s called \u201cco-washing.\u201d\n\nUse mild shampoos without drying ingredients\n\nSince curly hair tends to be drier than straight hair, be sure to use gentle shampoos. Watch out for sulfates and alcohols that can strip essential moisture from your strands and scalp.\n\nWash with lukewarm or cool water\n\nIf you struggle with frizz, stick to using cool or lukewarm water, not hot. You\u2019ll lose less moisture that way. It will also make your hair shinier.\n\nSkip the towel\n\nDid you know that some people with curly hair don\u2019t dry it with regular cotton towels? Instead, they use a soft T-shirt or a microfiber towel. And they don\u2019t scrub it dry; they wrap their hair and let the fabric absorb the excess water for a while. This avoids roughing up the cuticle.\n\nBe kind to curls when you comb\n\nYour hair is fragile while it\u2019s wet. Don\u2019t brush it. Instead, use a good quality comb. Apply detangler if you need it to overcome snarls.\n\nAvoid styling with heat\n\nObviously, when you blow-dry your hair, you remove moisture. The same goes for curling irons and flat irons. You\u2019ll protect your hair from frizz and breakage if you let it dry naturally. You can also choose to use a diffuser, so the hot air is spread over the hair and not focused on one portion. No diffuser? No worries, you use a makeshift diffuser to keep your curls protected and looking great.\n\nSleep on silk\n\nSilk pillowcases will prevent your curly hair from looking frizzy in the morning. If you don\u2019t like the idea of silk or satin pillowcases, try wrapping your hair before you lay down at night.\n\nHow to deep condition curls\n\nSomeone once said that \u201cCurly hair is thirsty hair.\u201d So although you discovered the best shampoo for your curls, you still need to condition them.\n\nWhen you apply this product, use your fingers to work it through your hair all the way to the ends. Some products work better if they are heated. Cover your hair with a shower cap, plastic wrap, or a damp T-shirt. You can turn up the heat by using a blow dryer set to low.\n\nWait the recommended amount of time before you wash out the product. Some products can work overnight while you sleep. And when you rinse it in the morning, be sure to seal the cuticle with cool water.\n\nOne last word about shampoo\n\nWe\u2019ve mentioned avoiding sulfates in your shampoo. Pro stylists with a lot of experience caring for curly hair make the following recommendations.\n\nFirst, if your favorite shampoo has sulfates, keep it concentrated at the scalp. Avoid working it through your hair out to the ends. That way it can do its job removing extra oil from your skin and leave your strands in peace. Sodium lauryl sulfate is the most drying of all sulfates. It\u2019s practically guaranteed to make your hair like straw.\n\nNext, stick to the same brand that you choose for your shampoo for your other hair products, too. The shampoo and moisturizer are designed to work well together. And when you wash, use gentle back-and-forth movements. Unless you\u2019ve been rolling in dirt, you probably don\u2019t need to scrub to clean your scalp.\n\nFinally, take the time to experiment with co-washing if you haven\u2019t tried it yet. Using water to freshen up between shampooings is an easy way to keep your curls shiny and bouncy.\n\nConclusion\n\nIf you\u2019re anxious to have well-defined curls and bouncy, luminous locks, start with one of the best shampoos for curly hair. Occasionally use a clarifier if needed, you\u2019ll find that it\u2019s much easier to manage. If you keep your curls moisturized, you\u2019ll keep them happy.\n\nCategories: Shampoo & Conditioner, Curly Hair, Hair Care", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=518221232071421&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00JAMCO9E&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B07FTJDF2S&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0011YZMKW&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B078HHDVFY&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B01N0OMCTF&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00U1JHWR4&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0038TXGL0&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00J1FK3A2&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B00WIK96WS&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B006L21PNW&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://momcurls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Best-curly-hair-shampoo.png", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B015RJMUIS&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20", "https://momcurls.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Marcus-Francis-96x96.jpg", "https://ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=B0012EF9NQ&Format=_SL250_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=momcurlscom-20"], "top_img": "https://momcurls.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Best-curly-hair-shampoo.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Williams", "If You Browse Beauty Magazines", "Chances Are You Ve Seen Marcus S Work On The Cover.
