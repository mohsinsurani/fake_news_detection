See it here.\n\nJohn Cena always shares memes, quotes and photos on Instagram with no explanation, but he didn\u2019t need a caption for us to know what he was referring to with this post from Sunday night, April 15. The WWE star shared a meme from The Simpsons that read \u201cWorst Day Ever\u201d in capital letters, and it went up on his page shortly after he and his fiancee, Nikki Bella, confirmed to Us Weekly that they\u2019d be ending their relationship after six years together. \u201cWhile this decision was a difficult one, we continue to have a great deal of love and respect for each other,\u201d they said. \u201cWe ask that you respect our privacy during this time in our lives.\u201d\n\nThe split announcement came as quite a shock, as Nikki and John just attended the WWE Hall of Fame Induction together on April 6, and were photographed kissing on the red carpet. She also supported him at the premiere of his movie, Blockers, earlier this month. However, there were some suspicions back in March, when Nikki didn\u2019t show up to the Kids\u2019 Choice Awards, which John was hosting for the second year in a row. The shocking split comes just over a year after John famously proposed to Nikki at WrestleMania on April 2, 2017.\n\nAfter years of insisting that he would never get married again (John\u2019s first marriage to Elizabeth Huberdeau ended in divorce in 2012), John got down on one knee at the WWE\u2019s biggest event of the year and presented Nikki with a gigantic diamond ring. Their destination wedding was reportedly set for May 5, according to People.\n\nNikki has yet to comment on the breakup herself, although she did post the couple\u2019s statement to Instagram with the caption, \u201cWe love you all.\u201d Is love officially dead?!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/raelynn-acm-awards-2018-acms-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15476338&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/queens-canopy-image_banner.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F04%2F16%2Fjohn-cena-message-nikki-bella-split-breakup%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3083690", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/acmas-2018-carrie-underwood.jpg?w=200&resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://i1.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/mad-max-fury-road.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/john-cena-devastated-after-nikki-bella-split-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/the-walking-dead-finale-rick-season-8-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/james-comey-interview.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/john-cena-devastated-after-nikki-bella-split-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/e599b89c6e3391a17ea5f499b031a076?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/kane-brown-lauren-alaina-acms-2018-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/04/john-cena-devastated-after-nikki-bella-split-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Writer Reporter"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180416161207/http://hollywoodlife.com/2018/04/16/john-cena-message-nikki-bella-split-breakup/", "title": "John Cena Devastated After Nikki Bella Split: It\u2019s The \u2018Worst Day Ever\u2019 \u2014 See Message", "meta_data": {"description": "John Cena shared a heartbreaking message on Instagram after his breakup from Nikki Bella.
