After premiering her brand new video for \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d Taylor Swift gave her backup dancers a present for keeping quiet about their role in the much-anticipated music video.\n\nSwift decided to premiere the video at the MTV VMAs, right after releasing a lyrical video that helped debut the song itself. The video was pretty complex \u2014 Swift is pretty much saying goodbye to her old personas and focusing on a rebrand. She already broke a record for having the most views a day after release \u2014 43.2 million views to be exact. And that number is, obviously, still climbing.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3tmd-ClpJxA?feature=oembed\n\nAs we all know, success on projects like this happen when you\u2019ve got a solid team by your side. Which is why we\u2019re glad that Swift made sure to share her appreciation for those who helped out by sending flowers and a really sweet card. false\n\nThe card read, \u201cThanks for keeping our secret. ? I\u2019m so proud of it and I hope you will be too. Sending my love and gratitude, Taylor.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Swift has sent a bouquet to share her appreciation. She also sent flowers to those who stood by her during her recent trial. The employees at a company called Craftsy let Swift know that they were on her side by creating Post-It note messages on their windows, with motivational phrases like \u201cFree Tay,\u201d and song lyrics like \u201cPeople throw rocks at things that shine.\u201d false\n\nWe\u2019re all about the sweet gesture. It\u2019s good to know that Swift gives credit where credit\u2019s due.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/30/taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/30/taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/30/taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "title": "Taylor Swift gave her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dancers a special gift for \"keeping our secret\" - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "It's pretty sweet that Taylor Swift made sure to acknowledge her dancers for keeping her record-breaking video a secret.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift gave her \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dancers a special gift for \"keeping our secret\" - HelloGiggles", "description": "It's pretty sweet that Taylor Swift made sure to acknowledge her dancers for keeping her record-breaking video a secret.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/taylor-swift-gave-her-look-what-you-made-me-do-dancers-a-special-gift/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/08/30/taylor-swift-music-video.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 999, "height": 532, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-30T11:09:51+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-18T01:16:35+00:00"}, "author": "karen belz", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "karen belz", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504091391.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
