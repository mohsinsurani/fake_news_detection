Comparisons have been made to Heath Ledger\u2019s portrayal of The Joker, and you won\u2019t find me disagreeing.\n\nLike Ledger, Skarsg\u00e5rd took an iconic character and managed to make it even more iconic. His Pennywise is an entirely different beast than the Tim Curry version, and Skarsg\u00e5rd nailed the complexity of the character in a way that makes him so much more than just a scary clown. As presented in Stephen King\u2019s novel, Pennywise is an otherworldly monster doing his best imitation of the human clown he enjoys presenting himself as, and you get all of that from Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s impossibly creepy performance.\n\nA whole lot of credit must be given to the makeup and special effects teams for helping to make this new version of Pennywise one of the all-time scariest movie villains, but you might be surprised how much of that was actually Skarsg\u00e5rd himself. The actor, for example, really can move his eyes independently of each other, adding a subtle layer of extra creepiness to the performance.\n\nAnd then there\u2019s that whimsically sinister smile, which Skarsg\u00e5rd just showed off to a Swedish radio program\u2026 without any makeup or digital enhancement whatsoever.\n\nYup. This was the role he was born to play.", "images": ["https://bloody-disgusting.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/FREE-STREAMING-HORROR-247.png",
