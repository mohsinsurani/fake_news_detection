The former Twilight star said that she no regrets in regards to her starring role in the popular vampire saga.\n\nStewart said: \u201cEvery part that I\u2019ve ever played has shaped me in such a significant way \u2026 I know from an outsider\u2019s perspective you might have something to say about that like in general. But I kind of view it as every other thing that I\u2019ve invested in and really loved. And I\u2019m lucky to have had that experience.\u201d\n\nThe actress said this in an interview at The Museum of Modern Art Film Benefit in New York City where Stewart\u2019s \u201cStill Alice\u201d co-star Julianne Moore was being honored.\n\n\u201cI never really look back at my life and go, \u2018What did that mean?'\u201d Stewart told. \u201cI got a lot from it and it\u2019s made me who I am.\u201d\n\nTwilight Saga: Breaking Dawn\u2014Part 2 opened in theaters five years ago and Stewart was surprised to learn that it was that long ago. \u201cI didn\u2019t realize that it was five years, that\u2019s trippy,\u201d Stewart said.\n\nMeanwhile, Kristen\u2019s co-star and former boyfriend Robert Pattinson, previously said that his life has become \u201ca lot less stressful\u201d since the Twilight franchise came to an end in 2012, and that he is grateful that he no longer comes under the scrutiny at the level that he used to and is able to make more satisfying career choices.\n\nWhen asked about how life now compares with the Twilight years, Pattinson said: \u201cIt\u2019s a lot less stressful. And in terms of the work I\u2019m doing now, it feels more honest and authentic.\u201d\n\n\u201cI used to be treated like a baby bird that needed to be protected from the outside world and I hated that,\u201d said the \u201cGood Time\u201d actor. \u201cI like having my management let me know if they think I\u2019m making the wrong choices. I hate the phoniness that comes with the business sometimes.\u201d\n\nYOU MAY ALSO LIKE\n\nSelena Gomez Gets Emotional in First Interview About Life-Saving Kidney Transplant\n\n30,497 total views, 483
