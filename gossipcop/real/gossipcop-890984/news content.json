He's polished, but not stuffy or smarmy. A natural guy's guy, Nick has an instant likability and always says the right thing.\"\n\nEW added that Nick is rumored to be playing the love interest of one of the other characters. So fans are obviously wondering which character. Some are also wondering if he might be the \"Once\" version of \"Tangled\" character Flynn Rider. Just because ... why not?\n\nEarlier this week, it was revealed that \"Once\" is also adding \"Riverdale\" star Tiera Skovbye as Robin, grown-up daughter of Zelena and Robin Hood. She, too, is meant to play a love interest. Are the two castings related? She is said to be arriving in Episode 10, the winter finale, just a couple of episodes after Nick.\n\n\"Once Upon a Time\" airs Fridays at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\nWant more stuff like this?
