Baby Jack-Jack teaches us that holding any baby can be dicey, but holding a super-baby can pose special problems.\n\n\"The Incredibles\" came out in 2004, and the super-powered family consists of dad Mr. Incredible (voice of Craig T. Nelson) and mom Elastigirl (Holly Hunter) along with their kids: Violet (Sarah Vowell), Dash (Huck Milner) and Jack-Jack. Samuel L. Jackson returns as Frozone. As fans learned in July, the new film will pick up right where the first one ended, with no time passing (so Jack-Jack is still a baby, albeit a very special one).\n\nDirector Brad Bird told those at Disney's summer fan event, D23, that this film will focus on Elastigirl.\n\n\"Incredibles 2\" is set for release on June 15, 2018 in the U.S., June 13 in the U.K. and June 14 in Australia.", "images": ["https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/9a6c460098e9e5173216cd3c42a0a5294f1c8ae7/hub/2017/11/18/ae223a83-fa77-4ec5-a15a-bf8e781744f5/incrediblesbaby.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200", "https://i-cmg-amlg-prod.appspot.com/display?id=312469be-dd70-4e65-86cd-8dfa864b84c4", "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/4a2d5e639e8281b96b067d4332d16fb2ddbf8ab8/hub/2016/05/02/85948f9b-7918-477c-840f-eb31523e2b20/gaelcropped2.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=84&width=84"], "top_img": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/9a6c460098e9e5173216cd3c42a0a5294f1c8ae7/hub/2017/11/18/ae223a83-fa77-4ec5-a15a-bf8e781744f5/incrediblesbaby.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gael Fashingbauer Cooper", "See Full Bio", "Cnet Freelancer Gael Fashingbauer Cooper", "A Journalist", "Pop-Culture Junkie", "Is Co-Author Of", "Whatever Happened To Pudding Pops", "The Lost Toys", "Tastes", "Trends Of The"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/incredibles-2-trailer-jack-jack-disney-pixar-holly-hunter-craig-t-nelson-samuel-l-jackson/", "title": "'Incredibles 2' teaser launches a Jack-Jack attack", "meta_data": {"referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "theme-color": "#E71D1D", "author": "Gael Fashingbauer Cooper", "description": "The long-anticipated sequel to the 2004 Pixar hit starring the super-powered family is just around the corner.", "og": {"site_name": "CNET", "title": "'Incredibles 2' teaser launches a baby Jack-Jack attack", "description": "The long-anticipated sequel to the 2004 Pixar hit starring the super-powered family is just around the corner.", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/9a6c460098e9e5173216cd3c42a0a5294f1c8ae7/hub/2017/11/18/ae223a83-fa77-4ec5-a15a-bf8e781744f5/incrediblesbaby.jpg?auto=webp&fit=crop&height=630&width=1200", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/incredibles-2-trailer-jack-jack-disney-pixar-holly-hunter-craig-t-nelson-samuel-l-jackson/"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "facebook-domain-verification": "ac1izblyrxd6ql7y6vlex7yeuie0us", "fb": {"app_id": 16995676698, "admins": 100001036810388, "pages": 7155422274}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnet", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 30261067, "card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://www.cnet.com/culture/entertainment/incredibles-2-trailer-jack-jack-disney-pixar-holly-hunter-craig-t-nelson-samuel-l-jackson/", "title": "'Incredibles 2' teaser launches a baby Jack-Jack attack", "description": "The long-anticipated sequel to the 2004 Pixar hit starring the super-powered family is just around the corner.", "image": "https://www.cnet.com/a/img/resize/82b57443b3130f5f169b7cb127ef839513db0a40/hub/2017/11/18/ae223a83-fa77-4ec5-a15a-bf8e781744f5/incrediblesbaby.jpg?auto=webp", "site": "@CNET", "creator": "@gaelFC"}, "google-site-verification": "wNWLoFvk5wsdZQ-u75uCNiaHNa7FLFmNtH2t7dZbXmQ", "p": {"domain_verify": "47524839a64b83c951afca9ef6c838e0"}, "msapplication-tooltip": "Product reviews and prices, software downloads, and tech news - CNET", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.cnet.com/", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#424244", "viewport": "width=device-width", "news_keywords": "attack, tv and movies, tv, pixar, june", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.cnet.com", "summary": ""}
