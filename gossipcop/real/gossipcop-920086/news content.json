The couple walked in behind Prince William and Catherine, passing a troupe of dancers performing outside the abbey.\n\nThe Queen is joined by other Members of The Royal Family at @Wabbey as they celebrate #CommonwealthDay. pic.twitter.com/Vjy5gIgDZU \u2014 The Royal Family (@RoyalFamily) March 12, 2018\n\nThe queen is the head of the Commonwealth, a group of 53 nations around the world that are largely former British territories. Around 2,000 people were expected at the interfaith gathering, including Prime Minister Theresa May and British singer Liam Payne.\n\nWhile this is Markle\u2019s first time at an event together with the queen, she has had a busy few months since her engagement to Prince Harry in November. The former \u201cSuits\u201d star has had a preview of her future role as a royal, with the two meeting organizations and the public in Nottingham, London and Birmingham as well as Edinburgh, Scotland.\n\n\u201cShe is already effectively being treated as a full-blown member of the royal family, even if she hasn't married Prince Harry yet,\u201d Roya Nikkhah, royal correspondent for The Sunday Times, told NBC News. \u201cI think that gives you an indication of just how warmly she has been welcomed into the fold, but also effectively she is living as a member of the royal family.\u201d\n\nPrince Harry and his fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle, left, arrive with Prince William and Catherine at Westminster Abbey for Commonwealth Day on Monday.

Markle spoke about how women need to feel empowered to make their voices heard.\n\nPrince Harry, who is fifth in line to the throne, is to marry Markle on May 19 at St. George\u2019s Chapel, a 15th-century church on the grounds of Windsor Castle. Around 1,200 members of the general public will be included in the wedding, which will feature a carriage ride around the town after the nuptials so they can greet the public.\n\nSince her engagement to Prince Harry, Markle has been embraced by the British public. With a more casual manner than many of her fellow royals, she eagerly meets and hugs people during her engagements, an unusual gesture for royals in public.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201803/f_markle_180312.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Elbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/europe/meghan-markle-appear-first-official-event-queen-elizabeth-ii-n855681", "title": "Meghan Markle appears at first official event with Queen Elizabeth II", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/europe/meghan-markle-appear-first-official-event-queen-elizabeth-ii-n855681", "title": "Meghan Markle makes first official appearance with queen", "description": "The two were joined by other members of the royal family, including Markle's soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG", "title": "Meghan Markle makes first official appearance with queen", "description": "The two were joined by other members of the royal family, including Markle's soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The two were joined by other members of the royal family, including Markle's soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "Meghan Markle makes first official appearance with queen", "description": "The two were joined by other members of the royal family, including Markle's soon-to-be brother- and sister-in-law, Prince William and Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge.", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG", "type": "article", "unibrow": "Global Power", "authorName1": "Rachel Elbaum", "contributorName1": "Amy Perrette"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Tue Mar 13 2018 00:31:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Tue Mar 13 2018 00:31:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_11/2359256/180312-commonwealth-day-mc-1516.JPG", "next-head-count": 98}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520901060.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
