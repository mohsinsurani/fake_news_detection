Enter Andy Cohen, who had the 58-year-old rocker on Watch What Happens Live on Tuesday (June 26), broaching the subject head on. \"There are many rumours that you and Princess Diana were once romantically involved,\" the host asked. \"Her butler said that he used to sneak you into Kensington Palace. How would you characterize your relationship with Princess Diana?\"\n\nThe \"Summer of '69\" singer was quick to clear the air. First of all, \"she didn't sneak me in, I would just roll up.\" But more seriously, he insisted that the pair was just \"great friends.\" When Andy pushed further with the prospect of them being \"friends with benefits\", Bryan said: \"She was just... we were good friends.\"\n\nThe only photos to capture the royal and the \"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You\" singer together were taken at the Expo 86 Theatre in Vancouver in May 1986, during Princess Diana's tour of Canada with Prince Charles. She and Bryan were seen chatting at the gala event, which took place ten years before Diana and Charles announced their divorce, at which point rumours of her romance with the Canuck singer kicked into high gear.\n\nMORE: How Princess Diana gave back to the LGBTQ community\n\nBryan's 1985 song \"Diana\" was also cause for fans to speculate, in which he refers to the title woman as the \"Queen of all my dreams\" and urges her to leave her husband, presumably referring to Prince Charles. After Princess Diana's tragic passing, he retired the cheeky track.\n\nBryan's ex-girlfriend of 12 years, Cecilie Thomsen, spoke openly about the affair, insisting that she knew about her boyfriend's romance with the People's Princess and turned a blind eye. The 43-year-old Danish model explained, \"Bryan knew Paul Burrell very well and Paul was part of the inner circle around Bryan, and he also introduced him to Diana. The first time Bryan met Diana, I wasn't invited. Ours was a stormy relationship and Bryan's affair with Diana didn't make it easier.\"\n\nDespite this knowledge, Cecilie stayed with Bryan and even accompanied him to Diana's funeral in 1997. \"I was sitting in the church with mixed emotions.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005682&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626im_/https://www.himgs.com/css/hello/img/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1728383620790976&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626im_/https://www.himgs.com/imagenes/hello-canada/common/comscoreRogersMediaPublishingLifestyle.png?44", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626im_/https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2018/06/27/000/602/275/featured_5_3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626im_/https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=HS7uq1SZw320l9"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626im_/https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2018/06/27/000/602/275/featured_5_3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hello"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180627195626/https://ca.hellomagazine.com/royalty/02018062745923/bryan-adams-talks-princess-diana-romance", "title": "Bryan Adams talks rumoured Princess Diana romance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Bryan Adams talks rumoured Princess Diana romance", "description": "Andy Cohen asked the Canadian star flat out whether he and the royal were \"friends with benefits,\" and after decades of speculation Bryan finally revealed the truth!", "keywords": "Princess Diana, Bryan Adams, Canadian Stars, TV, British royals, Royalty, Home, bryan adams princess diana, bryan diana romance, bryan diana affair, bryan diana fling", "dc.title": "Bryan Adams talks rumoured Princess Diana romance", "origen": "ca.hellomagazine.com", "author": "HELLO!
