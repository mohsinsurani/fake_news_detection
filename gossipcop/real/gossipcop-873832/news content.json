Jimmy Kimmel proposed making Trump \"king\" of America in a lengthy monologue. \"I'm not joking when I say I would feel more comfortable if Cersei Lannister was running this country at this point,\" the ABC star said. Kimmel then spoke to viewers who voted for Trump, listing multiple controversies -- complaints about crowd size, attacks on the media, a Muslim travel ban, banning transgender troops from the military, demanding a voter fraud investigation (\"even though he won the election\") and playing chicken with North Korea -- and suggested a solution that doesn't involve impeachment.\n\n\"Instead of President, we make Donald Trump king. We make him the first King of America,\" Kimmel said. \"Think about it. England has a Queen. She lives in a palace--everyone makes a big deal when she shows up--she has no power at all. In the morning, they put a crown on her head and she stands there and waves, she goes back to bed. That's it... I'm asking you, the people who supported Donald Trump, to step in and help for the good of this country. Mike Pence is ready; he's boring. He's relatively sane. He looks like a friendly neighbor you'd borrow a lawn mower from. Let's make America Great Britain again!\"\n\nIn other news, HBO accidentally aired the next \"Game of Thrones\" episode early -- four days early. HBO Spain shared episode 6 of season 7, titled \"Death is the Enemy,\" and on-demand subscribers could watch it for a full hour before it was removed. However, fans were still able to take the episode and share it online, adding to HBO's headaches after dealing with hackers who have leaked scripts and episodes of other shows. The network has not commented on the \"GoT\" gaffe.\n\n>> Read more at the Daily Mail.\n\n\"Hocus Pocus\" star Vinessa Shaw is pregnant, and channeled the 1995 Halloween movie for an adorable announcement. The 41-year-old actress, who played Allison and is also known for roles in \"Eyes Wide Shut\" and \"Ray Ronovan,\" shared an image of a positive pregnancy test with three witches saying \"Winnie, I smell a child...\" The baby will be her first child with husband Kristopher Gifford.\n\nAnd a female-driven \"License to Drive\" reboot is in the works. For the uninitiated, the original '80s movie starred the two Coreys -- Haim and Feldman -- in a series of misadventures after one fails his driving test, sneaks out to drive to pick up his dreamy date (Heather Graham in her film debut). Producer John Davis, who also did reboots of \"The Man From U.N.C.L.E.\" and \"Victor Frankenstein,\" is developing a new version that's being described as a \"female version of Superbad.\" Sure, why not?\n\nMore Buzz:\n\nMichael Moore leads Broadway crowd to protest Trump (\n\nBritney Spears' conservators drafting new will for her kids (\n\nLionel Richie may boycott Kennedy Center Honors (\n\nElvis fans commemorate 40th anniversary of singer's death (\n\n112 returns with new single 'Dangerous Game' (\n\nJennifer Lawrence does wine reviews for charity video (\n\nLouis CK directed secret film called 'I Love You Daddy' (\n\nDMX wants out of NY to perform, pay child support (\n\nLady Gaga texts to be evidence in Kesha-Dr. Luke case (\n\nHalsey reveals miscarriage at 20 in new Playboy interview (\n\nKid Cudi announces tour dates;
