Promoting her latest film for Netflix, White Tiger, the actor spoke about what impact the pandemic has had on her relationship with husband Nick Jonas, and also reflected on their age gap.\n\nThe couple temporarily relocated to London while Priyanka filmed romantic comedy Text for You alongside Outlander's Sam Heughan and her old Quantico co-star Russell Tovey.\n\nLooking back on the year, the actor told The Sunday Times, \"Quarantine gave us the ability to spend a lot of time together, which I'm really blessed by. Because with both of our careers it's hard to find that kind of time.\"\n\nThe actor was also asked if the couple's age gap (Priyanka is 38 and Nick is 28) was a bigger gap to bridge than any cultural differences.\n\n\"Neither was a hurdle,\" Priyanka shared. \"Nick took to India like a fish to water. But just like a normal couple, you have to understand each other\u2019s habits and what each other likes. So it\u2019s more of an adventure than trying to figure out hurdles. None of it was really that hard.\"\n\nShe also praised the Jonas Brother for always being in her \"corner\", adding, \"whatever I may be in my professional life or how the world perceives me, I\u2019m just a girl trying to live her life in the best way possible, and I\u2019m so grateful to have a partner in doing that.\"\n\nGoals.\n\n25th January 2021\n\nPriyanka opens up about meeting Nick for the first time, and shares the secret to their successful marriage. \"I was shocked by his audaciousness, actually,\" the 38-year-old actress told People of their first meeting. \"He held my hand, he turned me around. I was like, 'What is happening?' He was bold, confident, [and] self-assured.\n\n\"And that was the most attractive thing about Nick and still is for me. But I was so taken in. Our courtship was such a short time. I just rode the wave because I trusted him. I'm someone who likes to have a sense of control, but he's the only one I don't feel like I need to do that with. I feel protected, calm.\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

He said that to me very early. It was before we got married. I think at some point we were disagreeing about something, and he was like, 'I'm always in your corner. We're not on different sides of the room.'\"\n\n\"And it just changed the way I was talking to him. It became the greatest thing I feel about this partnership, and what makes me feel so confident in being able to do all the things I want to do. We build each other up. There's no, like, 'I want to pull you down,' negativity, drama.\"\n\nSounds blissful.\n\n23 November: After weeks of speculation that the pair had called time on their four year romance (which, ICYMI, started when Priyanka removed Nick's surname from her Instagram profile) the Baywatch actor took to Instagram to dispel rumours that they'd split.\n\nCommenting on a video of her husband getting hot and sweaty in the gym, Priyanka said: \"Damn! I just died in your arms...\" along with the love-heart eyes and sweating emoji. How suggestive!? The comment clearly went down a real treat with Niyanka fans, racking up over 16k likes in just a few hours.\n\nPriyanka Chopra Instagram\n\nSeems like things are very much still on with these two then. We love to see it \u2764\ufe0f.\n\n1st December 2021\n\nWith their busy work schedules, which have seen them spend much of the last year apart, many fans have worried how Priyanka and Nick have made their relationship work long distance. But now, Priyanka has opened up about how the pair stay close, despite working on opposite sides of the pond.\n\nAppearing on the InStyle podcast, , the 39-year-old spilled their secrets to a happy marriage. \"We talk all the time,\" she said, \"We know each other's hearts and we prioritise each other in everything that we do.\"\n\nPriyanka continued: \"We've had individual careers and we're both very clear about never interfering in each other's professional lives because we're always partners and assets. We'll have an opinion on each other's things, we'll be each other champions \u2014 but those decisions are predominantly for both of us to take, because we've built our careers by ourselves for such a long time.\"\n\nAs for how they keep the romance alive, she says \"It's very important to keep a check on the other person's heart... You just have to prioritise each other and then everything feels right.\"\n\n\"I have to say, my husband's amazing at doing that,\" the actor added. \"Like I said, this year was hard for me being in London. He would just drop everything\u2014come in for even, like a day\u2014just to have dinner with me and fly back.\n\nSounds like these two have got it all figured out, if you ask us!\n\n21st January 2022 - Nick and Priyanka welcome their first child together\n\nHappy news!
