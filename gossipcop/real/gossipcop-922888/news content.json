I have so many things to say but I\u2019m in a state of shock.\n\n\u201cI will always love you momma. RIP my angel\u201d.\n\nIn an Instagram post in February, Haynes revealed she had been \u201cin and out of hospital since January\u201d.\n\nHe wrote: \u201cAfter multiple tests we found out she actually has advanced cirrhosis of the liver & kidney failure. A diagnosis that can be cured with a liver transplant.. however.. that bad news I mentioned before was that she doesn\u2019t have that much time to wait for a new liver.\n\n\u201cThe doctors suggested that we now focus on my mother\u2019s quality of life rather than quantity of life. It\u2019s heartbreaking. My strong mother has always been the anchor of this family and our best friend\u201d.", "images":
