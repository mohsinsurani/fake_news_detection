Mirada Kerr opened up about her pregnancy and revealed that husband Evan Spiegel, CEO and cofounder of Snapchat, won\u2019t be documenting her labor on the photo and video sharing platform.\n\n\u201cNo. My husband\u2019s a very private man,\u201d the Victoria\u2019s Secret model, 34, said during her visit to Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, February 6. Kerr later explained that she and Spiegel, 27, don\u2019t plan on showcasing their baby-to-be via Snapchat at all. \u201cOh no, No, I don\u2019t think so. What I love about Snap is you can send to your friends and family, like, you know, the little intimate moments that you\u2019re sharing. So my family in Australia, we Snap all day long. But publicly, it\u2019s like a different thing. You want to keep some things private.\u201d\n\nThe Australia native recently gushed over her brood while speaking exclusively to Us Weekly. \u201cWe\u2019re just really excited to expand our family,\u201d Kerr told Us in December 2017, noting that her 6-year-old son Flynn, whom she shares with ex-husband Orlando Bloom, is also thrilled about being an older brother. \u201cHe\u2019s very excited. It\u2019s so sweet.\u201d\n\nKerr also told Us at the time that she is experiencing more complications during her second pregnancy. \u201cI have been getting hormonal headaches, which I never got with Flynn,\u201d she revealed. \u201cApparently, my doctor said [with] the second pregnancy, your hormones kind of kick in a little stronger because they\u2019re like, \u2018Oh, yeah. I know what\u2019s happening. I know what to do.\u2019 So that\u2019s probably why.\u201d\n\nThe Treasure Yourself author and the entrepreneur tied the knot in May 2017 at their estate in L.A.\u2019s Brentwood neighborhood. Us confirmed in November 2017 that the couple are expecting their first child together.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miranda-kerr-jimmy-kimmel.jpg?crop=23px%2C32px%2C1102px%2C578px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miranda-kerr-jimmy-kimmel.jpg?crop=23px%2C32px%2C1102px%2C578px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/will-miranda-kerrs-husband-snapchat-her-labor/", "title": "Will Miranda Kerr\u2019s Husband Snapchat Her Labor?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Miranda Kerr gushed about her pregnancy and revealed whether her husband, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, will be documenting her labor \u2014 watch!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Will Miranda Kerr\u2019s Husband Be Snapchatting Her Labor?", "description": "Miranda Kerr gushed about her pregnancy and revealed whether her husband, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, will be documenting her labor \u2014 watch!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/will-miranda-kerrs-husband-snapchat-her-labor/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-07T21:52:10+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miranda-kerr-jimmy-kimmel.jpg?crop=23px%2C32px%2C1102px%2C578px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miranda-kerr-jimmy-kimmel.jpg?crop=23px%2C32px%2C1102px%2C578px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-02-07T21:52:10+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Will Miranda Kerr\u2019s Husband Be Snapchatting Her Labor?", "description": "Miranda Kerr gushed about her pregnancy and revealed whether her husband, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel, will be documenting her labor \u2014 watch!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/miranda-kerr-jimmy-kimmel.jpg?crop=23px%2C32px%2C1102px%2C578px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518040330.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
