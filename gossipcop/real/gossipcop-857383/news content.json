This was Navi\u2019s acting debut, but he has a long affinity to the king of pop.\n\nNavi has been performing as MJ for over 20 years and also worked with the artist as his decoy and was the only impersonator to be invited to Neverland Ranch on the pop icon\u2019s 45th birthday.\n\nRead: Michael Jackson's Kids: Grandma Katherine Raised The Late Pop Icon's Three Children\n\nOn Navi's official website, his biography proclaims that he's \u201cthe world's number one Michael Jackson impersonator.\u201d\n\nHis website also states \u201cNavi is the ONLY Michael Jackson tribute that Jackson has applauded on several occasions, given a standing ovation to, invited to his home Neverland, and personally chosen to work as a decoy over a period of many years.\u201d\n\n\u201cSearching for Neverland\u201d portrays the king of pop at the end of his life before he died in 2009. The movie is based on \u201cRemember The Time: Protecting Michael Jackson in His Final Days\u201d by Bill Whitfield, Javon Beard and Tanner Colby. Whitfield and Beard were Jackson\u2019s bodyguards during the last two years of the pop icon\u2019s life. The book focuses on helping Jackson and his children stay out of the paparazzi\u2019s eyes.\n\nNavi told ABC News that he had worked for Jackson as a decoy and the pop icon sometimes has even used him as a body double in order to escape the paparazzi\u2019s eyes.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got the most famous face in the world and it\u2019s not mine,\u201d Navi said adding \u201cWhen I worked for him as a decoy, you know, 2,500 people chasing me and being scared for your life.\"\n\n\u201cI worked for him during the allegations; I worked for him during the promotions of albums and tours. I went to [Jackson\u2019s ranch] Neverland, I did his birthday party, I performed at his birthday party in New York and Los Angeles,\u201d Navi further said.\n\nNavi had spent almost four hours in hair and makeup every day in order look like Jackson while filming for the movie, \u201cSearching for Neverland.\u201d However, he said it was not difficult for him to get into the character because the pop icon had encouraged him a lot during their time together.\n\n\u201cHe's very encouraging. He would say, \u2018You\u2019re an amazing dancer, do you practice every day?\u2019\u201d Navi continued.\n\n\u201cAnd I said, \u2018Mike, you\u2019re an amazing dancer.\u2019 And he was like, \u2018Really? You think so?\u2019 But he was sincere about it and I was thinking, \u2018Is this guy kidding me or what?\u2019 \u2026 He was so insecure, but when he gets on stage he\u2019s in total command.\u201d\n\nNavi also told ABC News that he accepted the offer to act in the movie because he wanted a platform to let the world know about the man he knew so well. \u201cHe\u2019s human, he\u2019s a person, he has emotions and feelings,\u201d Navi said.\n\nDuring an interview with Entertainment Weekly, Navi said that after playing his idol for 28 years on stage, he would retire from the role after the movie airs. He told Entertainment Weekly that he feels as if his career had been leading up to this moment where he could make this film to \u201cdo something back for Jackson\u201d and get a chance to show people the last few years of the pop star's life.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the Michael fan who stood outside the trial at the courthouse in Santa Maria with a sign that said, \u2018Smooth, but not a criminal,\u2019\u201d Navi said. \u201cWhen Michael passed away, I was at the Conrad Murray trial\u2026 because I\u2019m a Michael fan and I wear it on my sleeve,\u201d he added.\n\nHe continued, \u201cYou\u2019d think that would be the best swan song, but for me, it was this opportunity. If these 28 years [of impersonation] were building up to have this one moment, I\u2019ll accept that, and I\u2019m happy to walk away from the Jackson thing now. I\u2019m happy to be done because I had an opportunity to do something back for Michael.\u201d\n\nNavi underwent plastic surgery to transform into Jackson. However, he stopped the procedures in 2015 and said he would never be able to look exactly like the star, Stuff.co.nz reported.\n\n\u201cI could have gone thinner with the nose, I could have gone bigger with the jawline,\u201d Navi said in 2015. \u201cI could have been precise but I wouldn\u2019t have been Michael Jackson and I wouldn\u2019t have been able to pull it off like him. Even though he went over the top with it and he knew that himself. I always wanted to be the good-looking version of Michael Jackson,\u201d he added.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170530061237im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/05/29/gettyimages-71761009.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170530061237im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/05/29/gettyimages-71761009.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170530061237/http://www.ibtimes.com/who-navi-michael-jackson-impersonator-play-king-pop-lifetime-biopic-2545084", "title": "Who Is Navi?
