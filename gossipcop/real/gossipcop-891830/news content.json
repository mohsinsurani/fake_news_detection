He will also remain as host and executive producer of his syndicated radio program \u201cOn Air With Ryan Seacrest\u201d from Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s genuinely hard to put into words what \u2018American Idol\u2019 means to me,\u201d Seacrest, 42, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m so grateful for the show and all the career and life opportunities it\u2019s allowed me to experience.\u201d\n\nThe show, which was canceled by Fox Television last year, was once a ratings powerhouse, watched by more than 30 million viewers at its peak in 2005-2007.\n\nThe glitzy talent show that launched the careers of Kelly Clarkson, Adam Lambert, Jennifer Hudson and others - spiced with celebrity judges who alternately feuded and fawned - eventually fell victim to declining ratings.\n\nWithin the United States, the \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d phenomenon spawned a host of competing shows such as NBC\u2019s \u201cThe Voice,\u201d CBS\u2019s \u201cRock Star\u201d, and Fox\u2019s \u201cThe X Factor.\u201d\n\nPop star Katy Perry, who is set to judge the next generation of artists on the show, took to Twitter to express her excitement about the news and sing the praises of Seacrest.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m spicy, @RyanSeacrest is seasoned!\u201d wrote Perry. \u201cAll the right ingredients are coming together on @AmericanIdol.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170720&t=2&i=1193756011&r=LYNXMPED6J1AH&w=800"], "top_img": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170720&t=2&i=1193756011&r=LYNXMPED6J1AH&w=800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Fares"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-television-americanidol-idUSKBN1A525P", "title": "Ryan Seacrest to return as host of 'American Idol' reboot in 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ryan Seacrest to return as host of 'American Idol' reboot in 2018", "description": "Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of \"American Idol,\" the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170720&t=2&i=1193756011&r=LYNXMPED6J1AH&w=800", "src": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20170720&t=2&i=1193756011&r=LYNXMPED6J1AH&w=800"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "description": "Ryan Seacrest confirmed on Thursday that he will return as host of \"American Idol,\" the most popular music reality show in U.S. television history, when it comes back to the screen on ABC TV in 2018.", "author": "Melissa Fares", "keywords": "US,TELEVISION,AMERICANIDOL,Broadcasting (TRBC level 4),Celebrities,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,General News,Living / Lifestyle,Music,Pictures,Video Available,Entertainment Production (TRBC level 4),Television,New York", "news_keywords": "US;TELEVISION;AMERICANIDOL;Broadcasting (TRBC level 4);Celebrities;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;General News;Living / Lifestyle;Music;Pictures;Video Available;Entertainment Production (TRBC level 4);Television;New York", "REVISION_DATE": "2017-07-20T22:03:58Z", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2017-07-20T22:03:58Z", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Melissa Fares", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-television-americanidol-idUSKBN1A525P", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Ryan Seacrest to return as host of 'American Idol' reboot in 2018", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "us", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,TELEVISION,AMERICANIDOL,Broadcasting (TRBC level 4),Celebrities,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,General News,Living / Lifestyle,Music,Pictures,Video Available,Entertainment Production (TRBC level 4),Television,New York", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-TELEVISION-AMERICANIDOL", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Image-Video", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Ryan Seacrest to return as host of 'American Idol' reboot in 2018", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "News", "analyticsAttributes.contentType": "Article", "analyticsAttributes.contentChannel": "Business -
