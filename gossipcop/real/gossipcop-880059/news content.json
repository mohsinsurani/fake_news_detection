Kendall runs off backstage just before she was set to strut the catwalk. Kylie is pulled over and given a ticket before speeding off with her lavish orange Lamborghini.\n\nKirby Jenner, Kendall's faux fraternal twin brother, is also featured on the video during the Jenner sister's part. Kirby became famous on Instagram for flawlessly Photoshopping himself onto Kendall's photos.\n\nThe last part of the video shows the KarJenners being brought together on the set. This is where the nostalgic part comes in as they reenact the original opening credits of their hit reality TV show. Kim is noticeably not present yet.\n\nMomager Kris asks where Kim is as they try to find the perfect group pose. Khloe replies with \"Mom, she's always late.\" Kim suddenly arrives at the set and says \"No, I'm here\" as she gets in the middle of the shot. Her sisters pushed her to side the same way they did before.\n\nIn the recreation of the original opening credits, Bruce Jenner and Rob Kardashian are noticeably missing. The issues they have with the KarJenner family are probably one of the reasons they are out.\n\nScott Disick, Kourtney's ex-boyfriend, is reported to be fired after the season 14 of the E! show. Disick reportedly already knew that the day would come that he would be removed from the show's payroll as things are starting to get serious between Kourtney and her new boyfriend, Younes Bendjima.\n\nWatch the clip below of the all-new Keeping Up With The Kardashians Season 14 teaser.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5cb6759856dbd6e0444c2bd762e3c936?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/28fd1ecd-acc0-48fc-be3b-21a0f5ef3d90.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4509858/kardashian-jenners-recreate-the-original-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-intro-10-years-later-and-its-epic/", "title": "Kardashian-Jenners Recreate The Original 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' Intro 10 Years Later And It's Epic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kardashian-Jenners Recreate The Original 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' Intro 10 Years Later And It's Epic", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4509858/kardashian-jenners-recreate-the-original-keeping-up-with-the-kardashians-intro-10-years-later-and-its-epic/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kardashian-Jenners Recreate The Original 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' Intro 10 Years Later And It's Epic", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-09-21 07:21:41Z", "section": "Entertainment"}, "description": "Kardashian-Jenners Recreate The Original 'Keeping Up With The Kardashians' Intro 10 Years Later And It's Epic", "keywords": "Entertainment", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505978501.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
