media\n\nCNN \u2014\n\nWhen the Beatles\u2019 \u201cAbbey Road\u201d album was released 1969 \u2013 featuring the Fab Four striding through the crosswalk near their London studio \u2013 the imagery added to the persistent rumors that Paul McCartney had actually died a few years earlier and had been replaced by a lookalike.\n\nMany noted that Paul was the only one of the four to be barefoot, and John Lennon and Ringo Starr were in all white and all black, respectively, the colors of mourning in many cultures.\n\nBut McCartney says it was just hot.\n\n\u201cIt was a very hot day and I happened to be wearing sandals like I am today so I just kicked them off because it was so hot we went across barefoot,\u201d he explained. \u201cThere was no special meaning.\u201d\n\nMcCartney reenacted the walk Monday ahead of the 49th anniversary of the famous album and its cover.\n\nThe singer posted video on his official Instagram account showing fans cheering as he walked.\n\nThe photo was taken on August 8, 1969 outside of EMI Studios in Abbey Road and was used as the cover for The Beatles\u2019 11th studio album.\n\nMcCartney\u2019s daughter Mary also shared video with the caption: \u201cWhy did the Beatle cross the Abbey Road.\u201d\n\nAt 76, McCartney has new music out and he played some of the songs from his forthcoming \u201cEgypt Station\u201d album during a secret show Monday at Abbey Road studios.\n\nPaul McCartney releases new music\n\nAnother one of his daughters, designer Stella McCartney, shared video of herself, her dad and actress Liv Tyler (daughter of rocker Steven Tyler) inside the studio.\n\nThe trio joked with Tyler, saying \u201cLiv,\u201d and the elder McCartney responding: \u201cAnd let die.\u201d", "images":
