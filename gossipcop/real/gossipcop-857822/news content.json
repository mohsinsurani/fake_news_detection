That\u2019s what teenage relationships are,\u201d he said of how he envisioned his character\u2019s relationship with Bella, played by Kristen Stewart. \u201cBut everyone kind of wanted it to be, like, \u2018No they should just be, like, happy and having fun. That\u2019s what people want.\u2019\u201d\n\nProducers gave him a copy of the wildly successful book the film was based on, with every time his character smiled highlighted, Pattinson said.\n\nHis agents let him know he was about to act himself out of a job.\n\n\u201cI thought I was pretty safe,\u201d Pattinson said. \u201cThey flew up and were, like, \u2018You have to do the opposite of what you\u2019re doing now or you\u2019re going to get fired today.\u201d\n\nRobert Pattinson Was Almost Fired From \u201cTwilight\u201d\n\nHe also opened up about his relationship with singer FKA Twigs, whom Pattinson said he\u2019s \u201ckind of\u201d engaged to.\n\nFKA Twigs and Robert Pattinson at 'The Lost City of Z' UK premiere on February 16, 2017 in London, United Kingdom.

But if they start having a relationship with you, they actually realize \u2018This is not what I want at all,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s, like, you get all the crazies. You can\u2019t do anything. There\u2019s a big imbalance in the relationship and stuff. It\u2019s a tough relationship.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170726095611-fka-twigs.jpg?q=x_6,y_192,h_1773,w_3151,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150512072659-twilight-robert-pattinson-kristen-stewart.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/NrB28374Ggo/hqdefault.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/Vct9CyAp4LE/hqdefault.jpg", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929104601-lisa-france-profile-image.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/151006123244-twilight-2008.jpg?q=x_2,y_123,h_1150,w_2043,c_crop/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/151006123244-twilight-2008.jpg?q=x_2,y_123,h_1150,w_2043,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/entertainment/robert-pattinson-howard-stern/index.html", "title": "Robert Pattinson almost got fired from \u2018Twilight\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Robert Pattinson almost got fired from 'Twilight' | CNN", "description": "Shock jock Howard Stern seems to be able to get stars to tell their secrets, and he recently got Robert Pattinson to spill.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/151006123244-twilight-2008.jpg?q=x_2,y_123,h_1150,w_2043,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/26/entertainment/robert-pattinson-howard-stern/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Robert Pattinson almost got fired from 'Twilight' | CNN", "description": "Shock jock Howard Stern seems to be able to get stars to tell their secrets, and he recently got Robert Pattinson to spill.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/151006123244-twilight-2008.jpg?q=x_2,y_123,h_1150,w_2043,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Shock jock Howard Stern seems to be able to get stars to tell their secrets, and he recently got Robert Pattinson to spill.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-26T17:02:42Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-26T17:02:42Z", "tag": "celebrities, robert pattinson", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "celebrities, robert pattinson", "author": "Lisa Respers France", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501023600.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
