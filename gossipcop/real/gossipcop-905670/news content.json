Hardy has explained his excitement for taking on the role, telling IGN at Brazil Comic Con, \u201cI just wanted to say that I give you my word of honor that I\u2019m going to do everything that I can to deliver the best Venom that I can possibly muster.\u201d\n\nVenom\u2019s story distances itself from the Marvel Universe and instead offers a darker look at the iconic anti-hero. The film\u2019s director, Ruben Fleischer, said the film is inspired by the 1992 limited series Venom: Lethal Protector and the 1995 five-issue comic Planet of the Symbiotes, both written by David Michelinie.\n\nVenom: Lethal Protector follows Eddie\u2019s story as he moves from New York to San Francisco after coming to an agreement with his nemesis, Spider-Man, while Planet of the Symbiotes examines Eddie\u2019s relationship with his symbiote and the influence it has on him, resulting in a war between Venom and his allies and the symbiotes.\n\nFilming on Venom has wrapped in Atlanta, but continues in San Francisco later this month. Fleischer, the director of Zombieland, promises a true look at one of Marvel\u2019s most exciting, complex and mysterious characters. The director said at Brazil Comic Con, \u201cI can promise you badass action, Venom\u2019s dark humor, and I can also promise you an absolutely stunning performance by Tom Hardy.\u201d The film also stars Oscar nominee Michelle Williams, Golden Globe nominee Riz Ahmed and Jenny Slate.\n\nVenom arrives in theaters Oct. 5, 2018.
