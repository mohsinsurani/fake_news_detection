All those mothers [in Hollywood], become not-mothers. They become slaves to their kids.\u201d\n\nAnother source told PEOPLE on Friday Lovato\u2019s family \u201cis pushing for rehab,\u201d adding \u201cthey have looked into several options.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Demi Lovato Not Under Criminal Investigation After Apparent Overdose: Police\n\nThe \u201cStone Cold\u201d singer has battled addiction, mental illness and an eating disorder for years.
