However, Angelina surprised her by candidly apologizing for remarks she'd made in the past, including mocking Snooki's lip injections.\n\nJersey Shore: Family Vacation' Cast on Gym, Tan, Laundry and Who's Changed the Most This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.
