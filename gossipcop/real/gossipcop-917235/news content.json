Now it\u2019s a lesson he\u2019s passing on to his own children.\n\nHis support of the community is nothing new.\n\nSoon after Trump wanted to ban trans soldiers from the movie, Corden did a number supporting trans troops.\n\nThe interview describes him as an LGBT ally and he said he has an affinity with the community. However, he\u2019s aware of his own privilege too.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve always looked different, not the societal ideal, but I\u2019ve never felt like an outsider to the extent that my gay friends have felt. It would be naive of me to think I have.\u2019", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180304005333im_/https://www.gaystarnews.com/wp-content/themes/gsn/images/gaystarloves-logo.png",
