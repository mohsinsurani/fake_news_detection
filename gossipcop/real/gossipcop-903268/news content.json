I think that's disgusting and I would never sell my soul to the devil like that. It's not that serious.\"\n\n\"I have a regular marriage, and regular marriages, like everybody else, things happen, you know?\" she continued. \"In my marriage, it was just to a point where I felt like divorce was the only option that I had left. Although we're in extensive counseling and that is much needed and it still will always be, but I think the bigger picture of everything is that we have a responsibility to my amazing 4-year-old son [Logan] and just to raise him in the most comfortable, amazing, loving, secure household that we can. That's why we don't live together.\"\n\nBraxton continued on, reiterating the fact that they are not currently living together.\n\n\"I definitely filed for divorce,\" she exclaimed. \"That's not a lie.\"\n\nLater in the show, Herbert joined Braxton and her fellow co-hosts at the table, where he spoke out on the split for the first time ever. He also addressed Braxton's previous claims that he got another woman pregnant while they were still together.\n\nWhen asked if the rumors were true he said, \"Absolutely not.\"\n\n\"There's not [a bun in the oven], and all the other allegations are just not true,\" he said. \"I'm just not that kind of person. I love this lady with all my heart, I love my family with all my heart and I will never stop fighting for my family and trying to make it be great.\"\n\nBraxton revealed she now believes him, saying, \"At this point, I don't think he has anything to lie about.\"\n\n\"The pregnancy rumor came from my friends,\" she explained. \"I have to be honest about it. Vince and I have been through a lot, and the reason why I filed for divorce was not because of those rumors. I filed for divorce because we worked together, he's my baby father, we're together each and every day, we're attached at the hip, and it just got to be too much. We just couldn't figure out how to figure it out.\"\n\nHear more on what went wrong in the video below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nTamar Braxton Confesses She Got on Her Sisters' Last Nerves on 'Braxton Family Values' (Exclusive)\n\nTamar Braxton Deletes Instagram Account Amid Vincent Herbert Drama\n\n'Tamar & Vince': Tamar Braxton Admits Her Days Are Better When Vincent Herbert Isn\u2019t Around (Exclusive)\n\nTamar Braxton Deletes Instagram Account Amid Drama With Estranged Husband Vincent Herbert This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566846.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566425.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-568811.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566417.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567192.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566171.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2017-11/Jonny_Mitchell_Stephanie_Pratt_1280_GettyImages-877191140.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=Q3Ha0B9r", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566831.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Kaye_GettyImages-1429667472_300.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=79-eWDg7", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567063.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566844.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/1280_tamar_vince_022318.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=AjKZZ3oy", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567203.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567230.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567075.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%202.01.34%20PM.png?h=597e033f&itok=1KV1Fu0Z", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_tamar_braxton_getty527134098.jpg?itok=EG7JoTj4", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567077.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566814.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566534.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566845.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-569421.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566030.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_tamar_braxton_getty527134098.jpg?itok=EG7JoTj4", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/tamar-braxton-gets-candid-about-split-from-vincent-herbert-on-the-view-96983", "title": "Tamar Braxton Gets Candid About Split From Vincent Herbert on 'The View'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "Plus, her estranged husband speaks out on their divorce for the first time.", "keywords": "News, News, Tamar & Vince, Tamar Braxton", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tamar-braxton-gets-candid-about-split-from-vincent-herbert-on-the-view-96983", "title": "Tamar Braxton Gets Candid About Split From Vincent Herbert on 'The View'", "description": "Plus, her estranged husband speaks out on their divorce for the first time.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_tamar_braxton_getty527134098.jpg?itok=EG7JoTj4", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Plus, her estranged husband speaks out on their divorce for the first time.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Tamar Braxton Gets Candid About Split From Vincent Herbert on 'The View'", "creator": "Desiree Murphy\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/tamar-braxton-gets-candid-about-split-from-vincent-herbert-on-the-view-96983", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-05/1280_tamar_braxton_getty527134098.jpg?itok=EG7JoTj4"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
