{"url": "https://www.thedailybeast.com/rupaul-is-ready-for-his-legacy", "text": "\u201cYou don\u2019t question the motherfucking queen, bitch.\u201d\n\nRuPaul Charles, at this point on a first-name basis with the world much like his fellow \u201cUnapologetic Bitch,\u201d Madonna, is nothing if not direct.\n\nThe host of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race\u2014not to mention drag icon, activist, actor, recording artist, spiritual leader to a horde of fabulous worshippers, and, thanks to a recent, provocative as it was profound \u201creal talk\u201d interview with Vulture, the newest dream candidate for president\u2014is on the phone the week after a rare and shocking elimination on his cult hit reality show.\n\nAsked to explain the atypical twist, RuPaul concluded his answer bluntly. \u201cBecause the show\u2019s called RuPaul\u2019s Motherfucking Drag Race, bitch. I get to do whatever the fuck I want.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s an intimidating-bordering-on-terrifying reaction to a question, to be sure, were it not for the warm cackle he immediately delivers to diffuse any heart attacks. After all, the pulsing heart of nurturing compassion underwriting RuPaul\u2019s unabashed realness is the driving force of his nickname, Mama Ru.\n\nBesides, this is the RuPaul who, since the 1992 release of \u201cSupermodel (You Better Work)\u201d has become the face of drag, launched a long-running talk show, and became a spokesperson for MAC Cosmetics 20 freaking years ago, at a time when any conversation about drag going mainstream would have gotten you murdered with shade.\n\nTo that end, RuPaul just celebrated the 100th episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, now in the prime of its eighth popular-as-ever season, in an age when talent competitions are wheezing their last breaths. (So long, American Idol.)\n\nSo yes, to be fair, RuPaul can do \u201cwhatever the fuck\u201d he wants.\n\nLately, that involves starting a new game show. Gay For Play, which he hosts and executive produces, launches Monday night on Logo and is, as he describes, a combination of Hollywood Squares, Match Game, Deal or No Deal, and the \u201980s dance show Solid Gold. But, you know, for the gays, and those who love them.\n\n(As Ru says on the show, \u201cYou don\u2019t have to be gay to play. But it shore do help.\u201d)\n\nMore than that, as becomes increasingly clear over the course of our conversation, what RuPaul motherfucking wants is to make an impact, to leave a little something behind should he ever sashay away to the catwalk in the sky.\n\nHe\u2019s passionate about it, too, as soberly earnest as he was playfully intimidating at the start of our talk. \u201cThe fame, the money, all the stuff: after a while\u2014I\u2019ve been doing this 34 years\u2014it\u2019s about the legacy work,\u201d he says.\n\nReferencing the Drag Race contestants, he continues, \u201cThe legacy lives through these girls. And the kids who love the show and who have learned so much about themselves and about the history of the bohemian through our show.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, Gay For Play is a very silly show\u2014loud and giggly and naughty and campy and, because of all those things, a whole lot of fun. But it\u2019s also part of that legacy. Watch an episode and listen to the language, the proud way the celebrity contestants talk so very, well, gay.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve seen this language being tapped into by mainstream culture everywhere,\u201d RuPaul says.\n\nHe remembers when he first heard everyday people on the street saying, \u201cYou go girl!\u201d and \u201cHey, girlfriend!\u201d which has been taken \u201cstraight from gay vernacular.\u201d It used to take about 10 years, he says, for the phrases \u201cto get to Betty and Joe Beer Can, the masses,\u201d but now because of social media the turnover is exponentially faster.\n\nSo with Gay For Play he thought, \u201cYou know what? We\u2019ve seen other television shows take our vernacular and use what we\u2019re doing to create new TV shows, so why not do it to ourselves? Why not take what we\u2019re doing and turn it into something that is very aware of its base?\u201d\n\nAnd so you have celebrities like Amber Rose and Ross Matthews being quizzed about Meryl Streep and Shonda Rhimes shows, with innuendos and entendres abound. There are hot, mostly naked male dancers everywhere. Michelle Visage, as always, reigns queen.\n\nIn many ways, RuPaul expects the appeal of Gay For Play to mirror what has become one of the more powerful hooks of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. Again, it\u2019s that vernacular. It\u2019s that language.\n\n\u201cWe encrypt Drag Race with the secret language that kept gay people linked for many years before the \u201980s,\u201d he says. \u201cGay people had to be secretive. There was a certain way, a certain vernacular, a certain approach to pop culture that we maintained. We lost that in recent years, but we encrypt our shows with that secret language of our gay brothers and sisters past.\u201d\n\nAnd for all of the shade, reads, and spilled tea that defines any stellar season of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race, the show and Gay For Play share another crucial element\u2014again, one that sets it apart from other talent competitions and game shows that populate TV.\n\nThere\u2019s a palpable sense of fun that radiates from it. These people are enjoying themselves. In some ways, they feel free. The word that Ru uses: Joy.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s happening is that these kids are outsiders, and they\u2019re coming together with other outsiders on this show,\u201d he says, speaking specifically about Drag Race.\n\nEarlier in our conversation, he talks about the show being, at its core, about the \u201ctenacity of the human spirit,\u201d which is something that connects not just the contestants, but the fans who obsessively watch it as well. \u201cEspecially those who feel disenfranchised from society,\u201d he says. \u201cLike, wow, here is my tribe.\u201d\n\nHe again brings up the secret code, the shared vernacular and shared spirit. \u201cIt\u2019s why Judy Garland and Joan Crawford speak to us so much,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain desperate, dark, painful element to these people that we can relate to. And in spite of that, they have overcome it and become glamorous, joyous, beautiful fun-loving people.\u201d\n\nHe pauses again, breaking a rule of his not to think about the past and reflect. \u201cAlways think forward\u201d is a rule of his, as is not to have any expectations, a lesson learned the hard way in three decades of show business.\n\nAnd certainly, there\u2019s no way he could have expected to launch the careers of 100 drag queens, or a fanbase that debates every lip sync, drag look, and challenge performance with rabid sincerity\u2014some becoming encyclopedic scholars of the show\u2019s history. (Not to mention who worship the show even if they\u2019re given a disappointing Snatch Game episode.)\n\nIt\u2019s the tribe, RuPaul says, that they\u2019re all connecting to, whether they realize that or not.\n\n\u201cThese are boys who were ostracized from everyone in the community and against all odds they were like, \u2018Fuck it I\u2019m going to do this anyway,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThey made all the way to RuPaul\u2019s Fucking Drag Race and here they are. It\u2019s so fucking awesome, I love it.\u201d\n\nOn Monday night, the night that Gay For Play premieres, RuPaul will host the 107th episode of RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race. And, for the 107th time, at least on Logo, he will preach his famous affirmation to end the episode: \u201cIf you can\u2019t love yourself how the hell are you going to love somebody else? Can I get an amen?\u201d\n\nRuPaul has been saying that at every performance, not just on Drag Race, for 30 years, along with two other phrases he refers to as his doctrine: \u201cEverybody say, \u2018Love!\u2019\u201d and \u201cYou were born naked and the rest is drag.\u201d\n\nWhat is it like after all this time\u201434 years and 107 episodes\u2014to say those words? Does he still feel them? Does the message change?\n\n\u201cThe truth is that I say that every single time not for the audience,\u201d he says. \u201cI say it to remind myself.\u201d\n\nAgain, he reflects. This time, back to when he was 14, maybe 15.\n\n\u201cI was going through such a hard time thinking, \u2018I\u2019m becoming a young adult, how am I going to manage this fucking mediocre hypocritical world? Well, Ru, the only way I can do this is to make a pact to never drink the Kool-Aid, to never join the matrix.\u201d\n\nThen RuPaul starts invoking the film Inception\u2014I know, I was surprised, too.\n\nSpecifically, he references the totems that the characters in the film set to remind themselves that they\u2019re in a dream. Ru has his totems, too. They\u2019re those three phrases. His doctrine.\n\nYou\u2019re born naked and the rest is drag: \u201cDon\u2019t believe the hype, don\u2019t believe what it tells you on your driver\u2019s license. You are an extension of the power that created this whole universe. Don\u2019t forget it, and don\u2019t take any of this bullshit too seriously, because it\u2019s hypocritical and mediocre at best.\u201d\n\nThe love yourself mantra, he says, is to remind you that it comes from the inside out.\n\nThe meaning behind \u201cEverybody say, \u2018Love!\u2019\u201d after our conversation, becomes more essential.\n\nThis is RuPaul, who began our interview with such\u2014how should I say\u2014verve. Whose interview with Vulture \u201cclapped back\u201d at (and for good reason): Ellen Degeneres, David Letterman, \u201cthe mainstream,\u201d the Emmys, Lip Sync Battle, the relationship between the drag and trans communities, educating youths, political correctness, and the wigs in The Danish Girl.\n\nEverybody say love, indeed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a neutralizing mantra to say to everybody, \u2018I come in peace,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cI come in peace. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important.\u201d\n\nCan I get an amen?", "images": ["https://www.thedailybeast.com/static/media/TDB-SM-Nav-Product-Callout.d6e4084e.png",
