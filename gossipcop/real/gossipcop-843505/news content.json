Skip the hummus/sauce that comes with it, and just get the balsamic vinaigrette packet.\n\n\n\nPRO TIP: Get their standard beef patty lettuce-wrapped, which comes with tomato and onion\u2014sans cheese and mayo. If you\u2019re craving French fries, go for an OG baked potato (leave the sour cream, take the chives).", "images":
