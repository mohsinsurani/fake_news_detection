News about her love of motherhood and shared that while she is exhausted, she wouldn\u2019t change anything about it.\n\n\u201c[I\u2019m] happy as a clam! Exhausted and overjoyed,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, check with me in a couple weeks and see how I\u2019m doing, but I\u2019m feeling good.\u201d\n\nKotb shared that she does still indulge in her \u201cwine time\u201d on the weekends and with her on-air BFF Kathie Lee Gifford before and after their show. Kotb also shared that fellow mom Savannah Guthrie has been helping her learn the tricks of the trade.\n\nRELATED: Adam Levine shared an emotional tribute to Christina Grimmie on \u201cThe Voice\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gave me some swaddling advice, and she\u2019s trying to help me make sure I balance my day out better than I do,\u201d Kotb said. \u201cShe\u2019s great. She\u2019s got great advice, and she\u2019s a wonderful person.\u201d\n\nIn February, Kotb announced she and her boyfriend Joel Schiffman adopted a baby girl. The new mom took a few weeks off to bond with her baby before returning to \u201cTODAY\u201d last week.\n\nOn her first day back, Kotb had a hard time fighting back the tears.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m scared to be sitting here,\u201d she admitted at the time. \u201cI\u2019m a little afraid that I might explode into tears.\u201d", "images": ["https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gender-reveal-e1663594236141.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RARE-32.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-35.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avatar_user_33_1655400475-40x40.png", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RARE-36.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-kylie-jenner.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ap_297978813140.jpg?w=150", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Loretta-Lynn-e1664721624312.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wwii-vet.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-50.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KpNhwJ0RxTQPU.gif", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tank-drift.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rare-logo-white-highres.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=351158200285883&ev=PageView&noscript=1&eid=351158200285883&cd%5Btags%5D=celebrity+babies%2C+entertainment%2C+Hoda+Kotb%2C+Motherhood%2C+television%2C+Today+Show%2C+TV&cd%5Bpost_category%5D=All+News%2C+Rare+People&cd%5Bpage_title%5D=Hoda+Kotb+just+can%27t+stop+gushing+about+the+joys+of+motherhood&cd%5Bpost_type%5D=post&cd%5Bpost_id%5D=559797&cd%5Bplugin%5D=PixelYourSite&cd%5Bevent_url%5D=rare.us%2Fpeople%2Fhoda-kotb-just-cant-stop-gushing-about-the-joys-of-motherhood%2F&cd%5Buser_role%5D=guest", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-30-1.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-31.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/twitter_hoda-kotb-kathie-lee-gifford.jpg?w=662", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Haunted-School.png?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/ap_070325036286.jpg?w=150", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/veteran_reunion.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RARE-63.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-33.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-34.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/twitter_hoda-kotb-kathie-lee-gifford.jpg?w=662", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rare News Desk"], "canonical_link": "https://rare.us/people/hoda-kotb-just-cant-stop-gushing-about-the-joys-of-motherhood/", "title": "Hoda Kotb just can\u2019t stop gushing about the joys of motherhood", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, height=device-height, width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hoda Kotb just can't stop gushing about the joys of motherhood", "description": "Her baby is the light of her life!
