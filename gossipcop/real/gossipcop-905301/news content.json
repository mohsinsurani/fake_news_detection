However, that excitement \u201cquickly evaporated\u201d after he saw the \u201cdisturbing image.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhether an oblivious oversight or not, it\u2019s truly sad and disturbing that in 2018, something so racially and culturally insensitive could pass by the eyes of so many (stylist, photographer, creative and marketing teams) and be deemed acceptable,\u201d he added. \u201cI can\u2019t allow for my name and brand to be associated with a company that could let this happen. I hope that this situation will serve as the wake up call that H&M and other companies need to get on track and become racially and culturally aware, as well as more diverse at every level.\u201d\n\nThe Weeknd tweeted on Monday: \u201cWoke up this morning shocked and embarrassed by this photo.

H&M quickly responded by apologizing, pulling the photo and removing the product from sale.\n\nThe company issued another apology on Tuesday, admitting they \u201cgot this wrong and are deeply sorry.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur standards are high and we feel that we have made real progress over the years in playing our part in promoting diversity and inclusion,\u201d they wrote. \u201cBut we clearly haven\u2019t come far enough \u2026 We agree with all the criticism that this has generated \u2013 we have got this wrong and we agree that, even if unintentional, passive or casual racism needs to be eradicated wherever it exists.
