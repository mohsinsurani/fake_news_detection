Though you\u2019re on your own when it comes to costumes, Dunkin Donuts is coming in clutch with some spectacular seasonal treats. When you\u2019re inevitably put on trick or treat duty \u2014 whether you\u2019re chaperoning the little superhero in your life or answering the door for four hours straight \u2014 you\u2019ll need the Almond Joy Hot Chocolate to keep you company.\n\nThe drink, which comes hot or cold, is the perfect infusion of milk chocolate, almond and coconut flavors. While, we definitely picture ourselves drinking this new hot chocolate during a snowstorm, we need this in our lives right now.\n\nBut Dunkin Donuts knows how to get into the Halloween spirit \u2014 it is a Massachusetts-based company, after all \u2014 so it\u2019s also giving your favorite donuts a Halloween update. Forget about your regular old jelly donut because now, with a spooky upgrade it\u2019s become Vampire\u2019s Delight. Similarly, powder donuts are now Full moon, complete with orange powdered sugar.\n\nEven the glazed donut has gotten a fun monster-themed change called Goulish Glazed. The Boston Kreme Donut, which is scary enough on it\u2019s own, comes with a fun new decoration and a name: Boston Scream Donut. We\u2019re sure the Sanderson sisters are going to be popping into their local Salem Dunkin\u2019 to get their hands on a dozen or two.\n\nWhile we\u2019ll be drinking the Almond Joy Hot Chocolate as the weather turns even colder, we\u2019re really hoping Dunkin Donuts keeps the flavor in stock all winter long.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/apple-icon-57x57.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/dunkin-donuts-almond-joy-coffee/", "title": "Dunkin Donuts just dropped a new hot chocolate flavor for Halloween, but TBH this feels perfect for Christmas - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Dunkin Donuts just released a new Almond Joy Hot Chocolate and new donut flavors for the Halloween but we could use them around the holidays.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dunkin Donuts just dropped a new hot chocolate flavor for Halloween, but TBH this feels perfect for Christmas - HelloGiggles", "description": "Dunkin Donuts just released a new Almond Joy Hot Chocolate and new donut flavors for the Halloween but we could use them around the holidays.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/dunkin-donuts-almond-joy-coffee/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-16T20:25:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T21:34:04+00:00"}, "author": "meaghankirby", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "meaghankirby", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508185502.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
