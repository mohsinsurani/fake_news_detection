Here, she responds to the blackface Twitter storm and explains how her own beauty evolution is reflected in KKW Beauty.\n\nYou\u2019re not the first social media star to start her own line. Why were you slower to the game?\n\nI had a line with my sisters, and we were in a licensing deal and a partnership, and it took time to get out of that. Right after, I said, \u201cHey guys, I want to do something on my own.\u201d Kylie had just started her lip kits, my mom and Kylie had found a really great business model and found great partners. I learned so much from them.\n\nDoes that mean you\u2019re going to work with the same manufacturer as Kylie?\n\nYes, I\u2019m working with the same manufacturer. I\u2019ve had a relationship with them for a while actually. But the lines, they\u2019re totally separate. We don\u2019t really talk to each other about what we\u2019re doing and what our formulas are.\n\nMario, your makeup artist, recently signed on with Laura Mercier. With the introduction of your line, will you continue to work together?", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=77330e6bea580978c91ce3ba59568a34ae66a785e2daf44b88e86c8a3438b6b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=77330e6bea580978c91ce3ba59568a34ae66a785e2daf44b88e86c8a3438b6b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bee Shapiro"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/fashion/kim-kardashian-beauty-line-blackface-allegations.html", "title": "Kim Kardashian West on Her New Beauty Line and Those Blackface Allegations", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "With KKW Beauty, the social media celebrity follows in her sister Kylie Jenner\u2019s footsteps.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/19/fashion/kim-kardashian-beauty-line-blackface-allegations.html", "type": "article", "title": "Kim Kardashian West on Her New Beauty Line and Those Blackface Allegations (Published 2017)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/fashion/19KIMweb5/19KIMweb5-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=77330e6bea580978c91ce3ba59568a34ae66a785e2daf44b88e86c8a3438b6b8&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Kim Kardashian West at the Forbes Women\u2019s Summit in New York earlier this month.
