Kelly Ripa visited Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, Oct. 26, and vented about her feisty 16-year-old daughter Lola Consuelos. The stories she shared are absolutely hilarious and totally relatable, especially one where Lola blew a fuse after Kelly posted a #TBT Halloween photo of her on Instagram.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m never allowed to post a photo of her \u2014 ever,\u201d she said to Jimmy. \u201cI was like, \u2018You know what? She can\u2019t get mad at an eight-year-old photo. It\u2019s a Halloween throwback Thursday.'\u201d However, as soon as she heard her phone ring she instantly knew she made a mistake. \u201cI was debating [answering],\u201d she laughed. \u201cI was like, \u2018Maybe I shouldn\u2019t answer it\u2026 but what if it\u2019s an emergency?'\u201d\n\nLola Consuelos (right)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s like, \u2018You take it down right now! My friends follow you for some reason and they will see this!\u2019 I was like, \u2018You know what? I will take it down. I\u2019ll take it down for you.\u2019 And that was the end of the discussion,\u201d explained Kelly while Jimmy cracked up. However, we\u2019re sure Lola will be even more infuriated after the show, because Jimmy showed the photo in question! In it, Lola is just eight years old, and is dressed up like an adorable little firefighter. It\u2019s so cute! You can watch the interview, here.\n\nKelly also joked about how Lola begrudgingly admitted she likes Riverdale, which her dad Mark Consuelos appears in as Mr. Lodge, Veronica\u2019s dad. Kelly revealed that Lola doesn\u2019t seem to understand that what goes on in the show isn\u2019t real life. \u201cMy daughter\u2019s like, \u2018Dad never lets me drink mimosas at breakfast!'\u201d Kelly quipped. \u201cAnd I go, \u2018Yeah, \u2019cause he\u2019s a real father and that\u2019s a character on TV!\u2019 She also joked that one of Jimmy\u2019s most famous characters reminds her of the teen.\u201dWhen I watch you do \u2018Ew!,\u2019 I believe you were hanging out with my daughter and her friends when you came up with this character,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/lola-consuelos.png?fit=400%2C225&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C225", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TITANIC_300x490_7_11r.gif?fit=300%2C490&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kelly-ripa-lola-consuelos.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/kelly-ripa-lola-consuelos.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emy Lacroix"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/kelly-ripa-lola-consuelos-tbt-halloween-photo-145426/", "title": "Kelly Ripa Says Lola Consuelos Freaked Over a Halloween #TBT Photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Teenagers will be teenagers, even if their parents are famous.
