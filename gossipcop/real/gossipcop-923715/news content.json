You start a family and it\u2019s like, \u2018Wow!\u2019 Becoming a mother has been the most humbling experience of my life,\u201d she told Harper's Bazaar Arabia. \u201cWhen you have a baby, your whole life changes. Your priorities and what\u2019s important is different to before.\u201d\n\nHuntington-Whiteley and actor Jason Statham welcomed their son Jack 10 months ago, and while the new mama did take a maternity leave, she\u2019s now back at it. \u201cI tried to take the time at home to enjoy those first special months with my family,\u201d Huntington-Whiteley explains, adding that coming back to work was a bit of a reality check and has involved some tough decisions.\n\nAs an actress and model, she considers herself (like many entrepreneurial moms) to be \u2018self-employed,\u2019 and says, \u201cYou never know when your last job is going to be. You always feel like the phone could stop ringing, and that is where a lot of my drive comes from.\u201d\n\n\u00f0\u009f\u009b\u00a9 A post shared by Rosie HW (@rosiehw) on Jan 12, 2018 at 6:31am PST\n\nThat\u2019s why her first instinct is to say yes to opportunities, but when she became a mom another instinct took over. \u201cThe first thing in your mind before accepting a job is, what\u2019s right for my family? Whereas before, I\u2019d get on a plane anywhere,\u201d she says. \u201cThe new thing is getting used to having a lot of responsibilities in my personal life and career.\u201d\n\nBecoming a mom sometimes feels like you\u2019re being pulled in multiple directions. You want to get on that plane, or take on a big project at work, but you miss your little one and want to be with them too.\n\nFor Huntington-Whiteley, part of motherhood is understanding that \u201cyou can\u2019t just wear one hat in life,\u201d but also not obsessing over the idea of perfect balance at all times. \u201cWork, for me, is my passion,\u201d she says, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s any such thing as balance. Something is always compromised.\u201d\n\nHuntington-Whiteley\u2019s comments are part of a growing trend of moms rejecting the idea of work-life balance and embracing the chaos instead of chasing perfection.\n\nRecognizing that she can\u2019t be everything to everyone all the time while still pursuing the career she\u2019s proud of and has worked hard to establish is what works for this new mama, who says she wants Jack to grow up knowing that she is more than just his mom\u2014she\u2019s got her own identity and goals, too.\n\nResearch indicates that what she\u2019s doing will be good for Jack. Boys raised by working mothers are more likely to grow up to be men who spend time taking care of family members and doing chores around the house, according to Harvard researchers.\n\nBy continuing to \u201ckeep on the grind, keep working hard,\u201d Huntington-Whiteley is modeling a passion that will serve Jack in the future and is serving her whole family in the present\u2014even if that means making some tough decisions and missing her baby some days.\n\n\u201cYou can\u2019t have it all,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can\u2019t be 100% all the time to everybody. Maybe when you accept that, that\u2019s the best.\u201d\n\nWell said, Rosie. ?\n\nYou might also like:", "images": ["https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mom-feeding-baby.jpg", "https://res.cloudinary.com/barrel/image/fetch/w_1440,f_auto/https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/legacy-images/new-mama-model-rosie-huntington-whiteley-says-compromise-is-key-to-working-motherhood-featured.jpg", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/motherly-logo.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1106024069411107&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20273%20487'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/themes/motherly/assets/svg/hero-flower-1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mom-feeding-baby.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Marcoux"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/new-mama-model-rosie-huntington-whiteley-says-compromise-is-key-to-working-motherhood/", "title": "New mama + model Rosie Huntington-Whitley has some advice for working moms", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, viewport-fit=cover", "description": "She recognizes that she can\u2019t be everything to everyone *all the time.* Category : Celebrity News, Work & Motherhood", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "New mama + model Rosie Huntington-Whitley has some advice for working moms", "description": "She recognizes that she can\u2019t be everything to everyone *all the time.* Category : Celebrity News, Work & Motherhood", "url": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/new-mama-model-rosie-huntington-whiteley-says-compromise-is-key-to-working-motherhood/", "site_name": "Motherly", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mom-feeding-baby.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mom-feeding-baby.jpg", "width": 1340, "height": 670, "alt": "mom feeding baby, who is a picky toddler", "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/motherlymedia", "section": "Celebrity News", "published_time": "2018-03-29T00:00:00-04:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 407282234107977, "pages": 1595847887360603}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "New mama + model Rosie Huntington-Whitley has some advice for working moms", "description": "She recognizes that she can\u2019t be everything to everyone *all the time.* Category : Celebrity News, Work & Motherhood", "site": "@MotherlyMedia", "creator": "@MotherlyMedia", "image": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/mom-feeding-baby.jpg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Heather Marcoux", "label2": "Time to read", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "Site Kit by Google 1.84.0", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.mother.ly/news/celebrity-news/new-mama-model-rosie-huntington-whiteley-says-compromise-is-key-to-working-motherhood/?wpna_ia_markup=true"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.mother.ly/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Favicon.svg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522296000.0, "source": "https://www.mother.ly", "summary": ""}
