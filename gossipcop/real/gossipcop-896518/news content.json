If you buy a product we have recommended, we may receive affiliate commission, which in turn supports our work.\n\nIf you follow Shay Mitchell on Instagram, you've probably noticed that the actress is constantly on the go. It seems like she's always traveling to amazing destinations like Morocco and Dubai, all while posting one million lust-worthy #Shaycation pictures. So when I heard that she was launching a travel essentials line, I couldn't help but think, \"About damn time!\" I sat down with the actress to learn more about her new line, B\u00e9is, which comprises seven silhouettes: the Duffle, the Weekender, the Backpack, the Dopp Kit, the Makeup Case, the Passport Holder, and the Luggage Tag.\n\nNot only is the collection chic and unisex, but I was also genuinely surprised to see how many tiny, thoughtful details were added to make life a whole lot easier when traveling. From the compartment on the makeup case that's perfect for storing your shampoos (pshhh, a little leakage is no longer going to ruin your trip!) to the section under the duffel bag that's great for stashing your shoes, it seems like Shay has thought of it all. Plus, this collection won't break the bank because it ranges from $12 to $83. Scroll on for Shay's best tips and to see pieces from the collection, which is available now on the B\u00e9is and at Nordstrom.", "images": ["https://www.popsugar.com/static/ck.php?nids[]=45387816&p=&u=0", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=258101201039378&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/s3JSrfLHCTN5Fkv5PzCenbs3PAw/0x0:4500x4500/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/10/06/741/n/1922564/03228b10633f0697bfbde7.98620453_/i/michaela-coel-vogue-cover-looks-november-2022.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/v4773/themes/onsugar_themes/lightspeed/imgs/push_notification_icon.png", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/Cc3lNAo4iHgMX4yHCox3NABHFbQ/150x150/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:sharpen-!1,0,true!-/2017/03/01/668/n/1922398/0f673d3758b6e2783a1bf5.56177758_14362632_10154299447966558_4593916872369849351_o/i/Nikita-Ramsinghani-avatar.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/TAfyapd8sl_2vd7ncMpoXU7Gr3c/0x0:2780x2780/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/09/29/765/n/1922153/4e379ec56335d471c57795.74832207_/i/bella-hadid-90s-headband-hairstyle.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/4mMnuPCFWZKcPQYdDlPat1dSuZA/514x270:2414x2170/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/09/27/783/n/1922564/08b98f8b63333781c1cb45.02058866_/i/blonde-movie-costume-designer-interview.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/NmdSdtFSqQM9GNM5XSec2pVywM4/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/10/05/652/n/1922564/afc0f02e633d97284cb787.64145600_/i/hocus-pocus-2-fashion.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/teA8BsskrWUzMS71flLXXChqvqk/75x75/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:sharpen-!1,0,true!-/2017/08/25/774/n/1922564/21d5874f59a05fb91400c6.04282072_edit_img_image_18660688_1503682285/i/Shay-Mitchell-Black-One-Piece.jpg", "https://ts.popsugar.com/b/ss/popsugarglobalprod/1/H.26--NS/?v1=fab%3Aus:nojs", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/O9qqHI1WH4nXwsWiypwwTNfZcwQ/1135x0:6386x5251/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/10/06/645/n/1922564/6bfe2f2a633ee62f20b967.51253563_/i/lil-nas-x-coach-courage-to-be-real.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/L54IixGPefCBls7O8MQvmLhka54/fit-in/1024x1024/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2018/10/16/827/n/1922564/94d354705bc6334eecf4b7.43398471_/i/Shay-Mitchell-Travel-Collection-B\u00e9.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/soDB91lR9-RIbb6qEtRxnrN3fjY/0x214:2091x1076/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/07/25/028/n/1922283/232a5cdd62df2a00058cb0.90984547_/i/britney-spears-elton-john-tiny-dancer.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/docs/exit_2020_fashion.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035900&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=1", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/N7FxendS6XTJnZ5Vym8G43NYpyI/1862x1061:6265x5464/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/09/30/723/n/1922564/1fe9160e63371795a8f4c8.89197236_/i/lizzo-yitty-shaping-ass-out-capris.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/v4773/static/imgs/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_135x40.svg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/imId_AycRF3V5gjr4u9HSNagxHM/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2018/10/16/827/n/1922564/de85f9e05bc6335101a0f7.34176836_.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/imId_AycRF3V5gjr4u9HSNagxHM/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2018/10/16/827/n/1922564/de85f9e05bc6335101a0f7.34176836_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nikita Charuza"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/fashion/Shay-Mitchell-Travel-Collection-B\u00e9-45387816", "title": "Shay Mitchell, Queen of Traveling, Created a Luggage Line That's Practical and Under $100!", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=1120, maximum-scale=1.0", "article": {"author": "Nikita Charuza", "published_time": "2018-10-26T08:24:04-07:00"}, "author": "Nikita Charuza", "description": "If you follow Shay Mitchell on Instagram, you've probably noticed that the actress is constantly on the go.
