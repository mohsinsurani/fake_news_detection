Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day. She was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still cant believe it. Its a rough world out there people, try to hang on.\"\n\nAnd then this past week, Spade went back to work, addressing the loss further during a stand-up routine in Southern California.\n\n\"Thank you for coming. It was a rough week, but I didn't want to cancel and I appreciate you all coming out here,\" he told the audience, according to E! News. \"And, if my jokes don't work then I get sort of a free pass.\"\n\nKate Spade and David Spade attend The 69th Annual Academy Awards in Los Angeles, March 24, 1997.

There was no indication and no warning that she would do this,\" he told the New York Times. \"It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn\u2019t her. There were personal demons she was battling.\"\n\nAnyone in crisis, or who knows someone in crisis, please call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255) or contact the Crisis Text Line by texting TALK to 741-741.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/vegas-stabbings_hpMain_20221007-090546_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/bridge-gty-ml-221008_1665242585018_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/john-lynch-points-house-damage-abc-jt-221007_1665185645263_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/uvalde-1-gty-er-221007_1665161778549_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/kate-david-spade2-gty-ml-180606_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/david-spade-kate-spade-2-gty-jt-180610_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-white-house-oval-office-gty-jt-221004_1664919462010_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/david-spade-kate-spade-2-gty-jt-180610_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/david-spade-donates-100000-mental-health-organization-kates-55893227", "title": "David Spade donates $100,000 to mental health organization following Kate's death", "meta_data": {"description": "One week after his sister-in-law's death, David Spade has donated $100,000 to help those affected by mental illness.", "keywords": "david spade, kate spade, movies, laws, mental health, Kate Spade, David Spade, social media, mass media, death", "copyright": "2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.
