It\u2019s just hard for me to find the balance in my life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI do feel like I do a lot of s\u2014 by myself,\u201d Jenner says\n\n\u201cI do come to a lot of places though,\u201d Woods insists.\n\n\u201cBut I don\u2019t see you!\u201d Jenner says.\n\nWoods is quick to defend herself, bringing up a recent trip to Miami the girls took.\n\n\u201cBecause you are occupied,\u201d she points out. \u201cIn Miami was I supposed to just sit in my room and wait until you guys are ready to go?\u201d\n\n\u201cI was doing my makeup!\u201d Jenner exclaims. \u201cNo, Jordyn. I was going to go in your room and do my makeup with you and get ready and we were going to leave. It was just a miscommunication. I literally called you and you were like: \u2018I just left.\u2019 Remember?!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo \u2014 I left because I waited two hours,\u201d Woods says. \u201cI knocked on the door and you were just like: \u2018No.\u2019 And I was like: \u2018K.\u2019 You just have to look at it from my side, too.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Naomi Watts Talks 26-Year Friendship with Nicole Kidman\n\nJenner, 20, insists that she is doing her best to see things from Woods\u2019 perspective.\n\n\u201cI never force you to do anything,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve always been the \u2018stan\u2019 for you, like, always do what you want. Don\u2019t make me seem like I\u2019m forcing you to do s\u2014.\u201d\n\nBut of course, all\u2019s well that ends well \u2014 and Woods admits that she is equally responsible in this case.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like I am saying you\u2019re dragging me to these places, because it\u2019s all me,\u201d she says. \u201cEven being around you I feel pressured. Not even from you.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe should all strive to be great,\u201d Jenner says.\n\n\u201cI need to be the best me I can be,\u201d Woods says. \u201cAnd you help me become the best me I can be.\u201d\n\nThe season finale of Life of Kylie airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET on E!", "images":
