I remember, before she was born, thinking about her features and if she\u2019d have hair. I was born bald.

I\u2019m just so honored to be her mom.\u201d\n\n\u201cSeeing my daughter for the first time was so overwhelming,\u201d Pierre adds. \u201cWatching Shawniece push her out drew me to tears. Watching her birth has to be the best moment of my young life.
