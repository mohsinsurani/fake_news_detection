We were up against the holidays, but I said I could do it, and the first person I called was my partner-in-crime, [Los Angeles jewelry designer] Michael Schmidt.\u201d\n\nPhillips and Schmidt, who has made custom clothing and jewelry for every pop star under the sun from Madonna to Miley Cyrus, first put their heads together with a few other creatives to design the Time\u2019s Up logo, then designed the pin and had 500 of them manufactured in the U.S.A. in just two weeks\u2019 time. \u201cI met so many great women, and it was such an honor to be called to action,\u201d Phillips says of the experience.\n\nThe Time\u2019s Up plan includes a legal defense fund for victims in all industries, legislative initiatives and a request that women wear black to the Globes ceremony. Phillips is now expanding her role with the group and calling on the fashion industry to donate to the fund, set up to help \u201cany person in the workplace who has been harassed,\u201d with the first $13 million seeded by Witherspoon and other Hollywood insiders. (The public can also donate via a GoFundMe site.)\n\n\u201cI can\u2019t think of anything more appropriate than fashion brands who have built careers on the red carpet donating to the Time\u2019s Up legal fund, because as we\u2019ve learned in the last year, there\u2019s nothing more powerful than how we spend our money,\u201d says Phillips. \u201cI will take notice of these brands and want to do business with them.\u201d\n\nShe\u2019s not alone. Other stylists have expressed similar sentiments about wanting to work with brands throughout awards season who pledge to donate. \u201cEven though our initial goal is $15 million, this is going to be a nationwide legal defense fund to help everyone from domestic workers to farm workers to students,\u201d adds Phillips, who is organizing a Time\u2019s Up Golden Globes viewing party with fashion-world friends, including Schmidt, stylist Karla Welch and Jeremy Scott to \u201ctoast and post\u201d about the movement.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-902321522_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-643585102-embed.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/img_1995-embed_2.jpg?w=928", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-902321522_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-902321522_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Booth Moore"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/time-s-up-pin-golden-globes-timely-red-carpet-accessory-revealed-1071639/", "title": "Time\u2019s Up Pin: The Story Behind Golden Globes\u2019 Timely Red-Carpet Accessory", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "To design the button, Reese Witherspoon tapped designer Arianne Phillips, who is now calling on the fashion industry to donate money to the Time's Up fund, too.", "news_keywords": "Arianne Phillips, Golden Globes, reese witherspoon, Style News", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Booth Moore", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1071639, "title": "Time\u2019s Up Pin: The Story Behind Golden Globes\u2019 Timely Red-Carpet Accessory", "published_at": "2018-01-04 14:14:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-902321522_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Style News", "topics": "News", "body": "The hottest accessory on the Golden Globes red carpet on Sunday will be the Time\u2019s Up pin, expected to be worn by leading ladies and men alike to draw attention to the sexual harassment prevention initiative launched Monday by Shonda Rhimes, Reese Witherspoon, Emma Stone and other prominent Hollywood women.\u00a0\r\nWitherspoon asked costume designer and stylist Arianne Phillips (Kingsman,\u00a0Nocturnal Animals,\u00a0W.E.)\u00a0to design the pin during a private meeting last month at CAA where the Time\u2019s Up initiative was hatched by studio heads, producers, agents and actresses who split into discussion groups to tackle different aspects of the issue.\r\n\r\n\u201cI was probably one of very few women there who would be considered below-the-line,\u201d says Phillips, referring to her role as a costume designer; she also has worked on fashion projects with Prada, Mr. Porter and Jeremy Scott over the years, and with pop stars Madonna and Lenny Kravitz on their onstage wardrobe.\r\n\u201cReese asked me to come to the actors' group, and told me they were going to be wearing black and would I consider creating a pin for the nominees and male presenters.
