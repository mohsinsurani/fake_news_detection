The book is not authorized or endorsed by Parton herself, but rather is a collection of interviews published over five decades of the 71-year-old country legend\u2019s career and compiled by editor Randy L. Schmidt.\n\nHere are some of the most surprising revelations detailed in the project:\n\nHer dog Popeye stopped her from committing suicide\n\nIn the early 1980s, Parton contemplated suicide after having an \u201caffair of the heart\u201d that ended in heartbreak. As a result, she struggled with her weight, suffered from serious health issues and had to cancel a tour due to death threats \u2014 all while trying to get over the \u201cnightmare\u201d that was working with Burt Reynolds on the 1982 film, The Best Little Whorehouse in Texas.\n\nParton says she was sitting in her bedroom one day when she eyed her handgun for a long time, before finally picking it up. At that moment, she says, her dog Popeye came running up the stairs.\n\n\u201cThe tap-tap-tap of his paws jolted me back to reality [and] I suddenly froze,\u201d Parton said in an interview. \u201cI put the gun down. Then I prayed. I kinda believe Popeye was a spiritual messenger from God.\u201d\n\nShe called peeing the bed a \u201cpleasure\u201d growing up\n\nParton has long been open about growing up poor in her hometown of Sevierville, Tennessee, but the book goes into further detail about how desperate the times were for her family.\n\nIn the summer, the kids would bathe in the river and then in the winter, they would bathe themselves with a pan of water. Parton was the fourth born of 12 kids, and she would have to bathe every night because three to four kids slept in a bed at a time and someone would ultimately pee the bed.\n\n\u201cThat was the only warm thing we knew in the wintertime. That was our most pleasure to get peed on,\u201d she described.\n\nShe has always had an open mind about sex\n\nThough Parton won\u2019t reveal the age when she lost her virginity, she admitted that she grew up fast and learned about sex from her older cousins and uncles.\n\n\u201cI always had an open mind about sex,\u201d she said. \u201cWe all did. It was not a vulgar thing.\u201d\n\nShe once threatened to shoot a man\n\nAt the age of 21, Parton and her friend were walking to a theater in Manhattan when men approached them thinking they were hookers.\n\nAs a man started grabbing Parton and offered her money, she pulled out a pistol and promised that if he touched her again, that she\u2019d shoot him.\n\n\u201cI would have shot his feet off or shot at the ground,\u201d she said. \u201cThat cooled the man\u2019s jets and he took off.\u201d\n\nShe thinks of her trademark appearance as a \u201cgimmick\u201d\n\nParton is known for her signature style, but she calls it all a \u201cgimmick.\u201d\n\n\u201d I\u2019ve never thought of myself as being a sex symbol and I don\u2019t want to have to be a beautiful woman, like Raquel Welch,\u201d she said.\n\nAs far as surgery goes, Parton said that her breasts are real although she has had them lifted. She admits, though, to nips and tucks, liposuction and collagen injections.\n\n\u201cIt costs a lot of money to look this cheap,\u201d she famously said.", "images":
