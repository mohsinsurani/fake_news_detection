Abrams is working on with the upcoming Episode IX. No release dates have been set for the series from the HBO power duo.\n\n\u201cIn the summer of 1977 we traveled to a galaxy far, far away, and we\u2019ve been dreaming of it ever since,\u201d Benioff and Weiss said in a joint statement. \u201cWe are honored by the opportunity, a little terrified by the responsibility, and so excited to get started as soon as the final season of Game of Thrones is complete.\u201d\n\nBenioff and Weiss\u2019 Star Wars involvement immediately puts the future of HBO\u2019s controversial slave drama Confederate in question.
