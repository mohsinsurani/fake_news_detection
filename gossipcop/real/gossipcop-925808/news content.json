F\u2013k you all.\u201d\n\nLisa tried to calm him down and get him to leave but Jax was having none of it. As for what set him off, it had to do with a number of issues with his costars. He was upset with Scheana Marie for trying to hook up his girlfriend Brittany Cartwright with Adam, another SUR bartender.\n\nJax was also angry that he was being accused of making up the rumor about James Kennedy and Kristen Doute hooking up in Mexico.\n\nUnderstandably, Lisa was highly upset with Jax\u2019s behavior.\n\n\u201cOf hundreds of employees, I\u2019ve never had anybody speak to me the way you speak to me,\u201d said Lisa to Jax after he refused to leave, choosing instead to flip off the entire restaurant. \u201cYou\u2019re arrogant and you\u2019re obnoxious. You\u2019re acting like a little f\u2013king baby.\u201d\n\nThe episode ended with Jax ultimately walking out of the restaurant after being asked repeatedly by Lisa to leave.\n\nSo what does this all mean? Did Jax get fired from SUR? Is he leaving Vanderpump Rules? Well, according to Jax, fans have nothing to worry about.\n\nRight after the episode aired, Jax tweeted: \u201cOh I ain\u2019t going anywhere buddy,\u201d after a fan tweeted to him that he had gotten the boot. That tweet is below.\n\noh I ain\u2019t going anywhere buddy. https://t.co/qUkF9yXvAf \u2014 Jax (@mrjaxtaylor) April 10, 2018\n\nAnd when it comes to the James and Kristen drama, Jax insists he did not invent the rumor.\n\nOh cause you where around us all day, we didn\u2019t start filming till noon some of us. we talked all mornin and got 47738 answers out of his mouth I can\u2019t help they only showed the one where he said \u201chung out\u201d\u2026you will see who is right in the end. ???? https://t.co/nlz4RpXVRC \u2014 Jax (@mrjaxtaylor) April 10, 2018\n\nSo it would appear Jax did not lose his job at SUR nor was he fired from Vanderpump Rules after his shocking meltdown.\n\nPhoto Credit: Bravo\n\nTELL US \u2013 SHOULD LISA FIRE JAX FOR THE WAY HE BEHAVED?", "images": ["https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/themes/soledad/images/penci-holder.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20534'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/feed-logo.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jax-taylor-and-lisa-vanderpump.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/jax-taylor-and-lisa-vanderpump.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sola Delano"], "canonical_link": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/04/09/was-jax-taylor-fired-by-did-lisa-vanderpump-fire-after-sur-meltdown-on-vanderpump-rules-jax-speaks-out/", "title": "Was Jax Taylor Fired After SUR Meltdown On Vanderpump Rules?
