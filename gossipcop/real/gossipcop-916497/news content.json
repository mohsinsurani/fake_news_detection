The newborn siblings had to stay in the Neonatal Intensive Care Unit for 47 days before they were able to be brought home.\n\nPendergrast released a statement to ET about what he's looking forward to sharing with his adorable babies, who were welcomed at Baptist Health Louisville in Louisville, Kentucky.\n\n\"Now that they are home I am most excited for them to start crawling and developing into little humans. I\u2019ve already started catching up on Disney movies and cartoons and can\u2019t wait to watch them with Layla and Logan,\" the excited new dad stated. \"Oh, and of course, I can\u2019t wait to take them golfing!\"\n\nYerrid also reflected on her new role as a mom in a statement to ET, sharing, \"When you become a mother you lose yourself. Your life is no longer your own, it belongs to your children. It\u2019s not about you, it\u2019s about them and that has been refreshing for me.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: 'Married at First Sight' Season 3 Couples Explain Why They Wanted to Wed a Stranger This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.

Now that they are a little older, we can all see that Logan looks like Nick and Layla looks like me!\" she explained. \"If they end up with his good looks and my personality then I\u2019d say we made perfection.\"\n\nYerrid also opened up about her hopes for her children's future, sharing, \"My dream for Layla and Logan is to go through life having total acceptance of who they are. I want them to be comfortable in their own skin and approach life with confidence knowing that at the end of the day, their parents want them to win.\"\n\nThe happy couple -- who first shared their baby news with People -- took to Instagram to post some adorable snapshots of their new bundles of joy.\n\n\"It was hard keeping this in the dark for so long. The birth of our twins was something we chose not to share with everyone until they came home from the NICU happy and healthy,\" Pendergrast wrote on Instagram. \"I appreciate my friends and family for supporting me through this experience. Our beautiful twins, Layla Rae and Logan Joseph arrived on December 10th and we couldn\u2019t be more tired and happy!\"\n\nPendergrast, 33, was the star of the fourth season of Lifetime's hit reality series Married at First Sight, where he tied the knot with Sonia Granados.
