Everything that makes her special was on display in a recent photoshoot for InStyle in which Drew recreated her iconic childhood photos, and we can\u2019t get enough of it.\n\nIt\u2019s pretty nuts that Drew has been in the public eye for the vast majority of her life \u2014 who else could carry a movie when they were only three? And while her childhood may have been tumultuous, her fashion was always on point.\n\nA total \u201980s baby and \u201990s kid, Drew\u2019s wild, bright clothing was the perfect way for a precocious and love-filled child to express herself. The fact that she still has that child-like sparkle in her eye even as an adult speaks to her lightness of being and joyous spirit.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t get much better than the recreation of these gorgeous throwback photos. Her fairy tale childhood was definitely a unique experience, and these photos are a window into her singular experiences.\n\nWe can\u2019t get enough of all the InStyle photos \u2014 even as a tiny kid Drew Barrymore had impeccable style.\n\nWhat do we have to do to get that wild and fancy-free hair?\n\nWho among us didn\u2019t have a flower-embroidered bucket hat back in the day? Drew makes it look better than we ever could, TBH.\n\nWe have to admit that fancy-baby Drew Barrymore is our favorite.\n\nThis photo captures how surreal and fantasy-like her childhood really was. Drew looks so wise as her younger self \u2014 and even more so now. That inner beauty is just always shining through.\n\nThese are the ultimate #TBT.\n\nWhich cover photo is your favorite? We can\u2019t pick because, well, they\u2019re all so adorable. Leave it to Drew and the team at InStyle to come up with the most dazzling shoot concept ever.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/02/drew.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/02/drew.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/02/drew.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/drew-barrymore-recreated-iconic-childhood-fashion-instyle-magazine-2018/", "title": "Drew Barrymore recreated her childhood fashion for \"InStyle\" and it will speak to your '80s heart", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Drew Barrymore is gracing the cover of \"InStyle\" this month in a cover shoot that re-created her iconic childhood fashion and it's adorable.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Drew Barrymore recreated her childhood fashion for \"InStyle\" and it will speak to your '80s heart", "description": "Drew Barrymore is gracing the cover of \"InStyle\" this month in a cover shoot that re-created her iconic childhood fashion and it's adorable.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/drew-barrymore-recreated-iconic-childhood-fashion-instyle-magazine-2018/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/02/drew.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1000, "height": 1377, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-02T18:04:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T16:08:52+00:00"}, "author": "lourdesuribe", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "lourdesuribe", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514916288.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
