The series, developed for television by Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, ran on The CW network for six seasons from September 19, 2007, to December 17, 2012.\n\nNarrated by the unknown, omniscient blogger \"Gossip Girl\" (voiced by Kristen Bell), the series revolves around the lives of privileged upper-class adolescents living in Manhattan's Upper East Side (UES). The series begins with the return of Upper East Side teenage \"it girl\" Serena van der Woodsen (Blake Lively) from a mysterious absence. She is reunited with her frenemy Blair Waldorf (Leighton Meester) and her mother Lily (Kelly Rutherford), and she also meets Dan Humphrey (Penn Badgley)\u2014an aspiring writer from Brooklyn who is one of Serena's main love interests throughout the show. Other main characters include Nate Archibald (Chace Crawford), Chuck Bass (Ed Westwick), Jenny Humphrey (Taylor Momsen), Vanessa Abrams (Jessica Szohr), Rufus Humphrey (Matthew Settle) and Ivy Dickens (Kaylee DeFer).\n\nThe success of Gossip Girl led to many adaptations outside the United States. The show received numerous award nominations and won 18 Teen Choice Awards. The CW officially renewed Gossip Girl for a sixth and final season on May 11, 2012.[1] The final season, consisting of 10 episodes, premiered on October 8, 2012, and ended on December 17, 2012.[2][3]\n\nA sequel series, also titled Gossip Girl and headed by original executive producers Schwartz, Savage and Safran, premiered on July 8, 2021 on HBO Max.[4] While set in the same continuity and retaining Kristen Bell as narrator, this series focuses on a new cast of characters from a different perspective in the same setting\u2014likened to that of a shared universe.\n\nSeries overview [ edit ]\n\nThe show centers on the scandalous lives of attractive, privileged and very affluent teens who reside in Manhattan's Upper East Side (UES) and how they betray one another while being constantly observed by a vicious but well-known blogger.\n\nCast and characters [ edit ]\n\nMain cast [ edit ]\n\nThe series is narrated by Kristen Bell as the voice of \"Gossip Girl\", an online anonymous figure. Bell appears via voice-over in every episodes but is uncredited. She also appears in person as herself in the series finale.\n\nSelected recurring cast [ edit ]\n\n\n\n\n\nProduction [ edit ]\n\nDevelopment [ edit ]\n\nThe Gossip Girl book series was originally supposed to be adapted into a film starring Lindsay Lohan with head Gilmore Girls creator Amy Sherman-Palladino.[5] When the film project did not get off the ground, Stephanie Savage and Josh Schwartz took over the project to create a television series. As of October 2006, Schwartz was working on the pilot. He said, \"I was very skeptical. I don't want to do The O.C. NYC. But I thought the books were smart. The characters are worldly in a way that Orange County kids aren't.\"[6] The characteristics for each character in the pilot were based on the first Gossip Girl book.[7] In January 2007, the show was given the green light by The CW.[8]\n\nProduction team [ edit ]\n\nThe O.C. creator Josh Schwartz and fellow writer Stephanie Savage served as the show's executive producers throughout the series' run, followed by Bob Levy and Leslie Morgenstein of Alloy Entertainment, who were assigned in aiding the adaptation of the novels into the series.[8] Following the success of Gossip Girl, Gilmore Girls co-producer, John Stephens was approached by Schwartz and Savage, having previously worked with him on The O.C., and hired him as an executive producer.[9] Joshua Safran, who started as a writer/consulting producer before becoming co-executive producer, was later added as an executive producer. On April 24, 2012, it was announced that he would leave the show at the end of the fifth season to be the new showrunner of NBC's now-cancelled musical series Smash.[10] To fill in Safran's void, co-executive producer Sara Goodman was promoted to executive producer for the sixth season.[11] Alexandra Patsavas who worked with Schwartz on The O.C. was in charge of the music.[12] Eric Daman was at the head of the costume department; he previously had assisted Patricia Field on Sex and the City.[13]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nFeaturing nine regular speaking roles, the majority of the ensemble cast was assembled from February to April 2007. Leighton Meester and Blake Lively\u2013who started auditioning in December 2006[14]\u2013were the first two actresses to be chosen in February for the lead roles of Blair Waldorf and Serena van der Woodsen, respectively.[15] Penn Badgley, who had previously worked with Stephanie Savage on The Mountain,[14] Taylor Momsen, Chace Crawford, Kelly Rutherford, and Connor Paolo also auditioned successfully and landed roles in the series in March, as did Florencia Lozano who appeared only in the pilot, and was later replaced by Margaret Colin.[16][17][18] Badgley at first turned down the part of Dan,[19] as did Lively\u2014who planned to attend college\u2014for the role of Serena.[20] Actors for the roles of Chuck Bass and Rufus Humphrey were found in April when English actor Ed Westwick, and Matthew Settle were cast.[21] Westwick first read for the role of Nate but was then asked to try Chuck.[14] As rumors swirled about the impending cancellation of Veronica Mars, it was revealed at The CW's 2007 Upfronts on May 17, 2007, that Kristen Bell had narrated the pilot, thus making her the title character of another show on the network.[22] Of the casting, Bell said:\n\nI read [the Gossip Girl pilot], and I knew I was sort of old to play any of the kids. I called Dawn Ostroff [...] and said, \"Hey, I did so much narration on Veronica Mars, can I narrate this show?\" [...] It was so clear to me how sassy and catty she needed to be.[23]\n\nJessica Szohr was signed on to portray the recurring role of Vanessa Abrams and received regular status during the fourteenth episode of the first season.[24][25] Kaylee DeFer joined the series in the eighteenth episode of the fourth season and was promoted to series regular for the show's fifth season.[26]\n\nAt the conclusion of the fourth season, Momsen, who went on an indefinite hiatus during the season while retaining regular billing,[27] and Jessica Szohr both left the show.[28] Throughout the series' run, Connor Paolo consistently declined to elevate his recurring role of Eric van der Woodsen to regular status, citing personal reasons for his decision.[29] After becoming a regular on the ABC series Revenge, Paolo confirmed his departure from Gossip Girl in August 2011.[30]\n\nAs the show progressed, numerous recurring guest stars appeared in the show. Michelle Trachtenberg signed on to portray Georgina Sparks.[31] The role had previously been offered to Mischa Barton who declined the role.[31] Francie Swift and Sam Robards took the parental roles of Anne and Howard Archibald, respectively.[32][33] Caroline Lagerfelt portrayed Celia \"CeCe\" Rhodes, Serena and Eric's grandmother and Lily's mother.[34] Sebastian Stan made several appearances as Carter Baizen throughout the show's first three seasons.[35]\n\nFilming locations [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl filming in filming in Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s Paris , France\n\nPrimarily filming in New York, Gossip Girl has been declared by New York Magazine as the \"Most Restauranty Show Since Sex and the City\", citing the pilot episode filming locales such as the Japanese restaurant Geisha, the Campbell Apartment where Nate and Serena were filmed having sex, and the New York Palace Hotel bar Gilt.[36] Other New York City landmarks and well-known establishments were filmed throughout the first season. Victor/Victrola filmed the fictional infamous Chuck Bass burlesque club, Victrola, at The Box Manhattan, a sister club to The Box Soho in London.[37] The fictional Constance Billard-St.Judes School, based on novel writer Cecily Von Ziegesar's alma mater, Nightingale-Bamford used external shots of the Museum of the City of New York.[38]\n\nThe second season premiered at the Hamptons and began filming in mid-June. The season premiere opening montage showed a scene at Cooper's Beach that was instead filmed in Rockaway Beach followed by an elaborate white party.[39][40] For the sixth episode of the season, Columbia University was used to film the Yale campus, an episode that followed disappointment from Yale fans due to its erroneous portrayal of the admissions process and reliance on Ivy League university stereotypes.[41] During the season's seventh episode, the Brooklyn Inn was integrated into the show.[42] Remaining true to its New York locations, the show filmed at the Russian Tea Room.[43][44]\n\nThe fourth season premiered on September 13, 2010, with the first two episodes filmed in Paris.[45][46] New York Magazine revealed several locations shot at the French University, La Sorbonne in the Latin District (or Quartier Latin) of Paris on July 5.[47][48] Other locations include the Mus\u00e9e d'Orsay, the Eiffel Tower, the Gare du Nord, Avenue Montaigne.[49] and Saint-Germain-des-Pr\u00e9s. Columbia University became the primary filming location for the first few episodes of the season following the Paris story arc.[50]\n\nThe fifth season premiered on September 26, 2011, with the first two episodes filmed in Los Angeles, California.[51]\n\nBecause of its location in New York, executive producer Stephanie Savage said, \"We were quickly told it would be too expensive, too complicated\" at the beginning of the series. She said that it had been proposed to shoot in a Los Angeles studio that would recreate Central Park, but they eventually filmed the series in New York.[52] Savage explained their choice to film there, \"There's no New York City on TV, or there wasn't when we started making the pilot, except what you could see in the background behind the dead bodies on cop shows. We've never seen the city from the point of view of teenagers. It felt like a world with high stakes for young people.\" Schwartz added, \"What's funny about these teenagers is they grew up watching Sex and the City, even though it wasn't about them. And I think they've probably incorporated that into how they mythologize New York. I fought really hard to shoot the show in New York because we want New York to be a character in the show.\"[53] Many scenes were filmed in the Empire Hotel on the Upper West Side.[54]\n\nEpisode format [ edit ]\n\nEach episode begins with the home page of the Gossip Girl website and Serena's picture from the pilot episode. Afterward, a recap of events relevant to the upcoming narrative is shown, which ends again with the home page of the website, only this time with a picture from other character(s) with a text about a recent event connected with the picture.\n\nThe narrator is Gossip Girl, voiced by actress Kristen Bell. She begins the recap with the sentence, \"Gossip Girl here, your one and only source into the scandalous lives of Manhattan's elite,\" and ends the recap with whispered voices saying \"Where has she been?\" and \"Serena.\" Then, the voice of Gossip Girl says, \"And who am I? That's one secret I'll never tell! You know you love me... XOXO, Gossip Girl.\"\n\nDuring each episode, there is always a social event taking place, whether small or large. Joshua Safran explained, \"We structure it [the show] so that every week, the episode leads to an event. I feel like it is much like a procedural.\"[7]\n\nEpisode titles [ edit ]\n\nAll of the episodes' titles are based on the name of a film or a novel.[55] For example, episode \"The Wild Brunch\" evokes western film The Wild Bunch and \"Seventeen Candles\" Sixteen Candles.[55] Episode \"All About My Brother\" refers to Pedro Almod\u00f3var's All About My Mother while \"Pret-a-Poor-J\" came from Pr\u00eat-\u00e0-Porter.[55] \"There Might Be Blood\" took its title from 2007 film There Will Be Blood.[55] \"The Serena Also Rises\" was titled after novel The Sun Also Rises. The fifth-season episode \"The Big Sleep No More\" was named for the film The Big Sleep and the New York-based production Sleep No More. Episode \"Easy J\" was titled after Emma Stone's hit movie Easy A. Episode \"The Age of Dissonance\", which was titled after Edith Wharton's novel The Age of Innocence, saw a high school production of the novel taking place,[55] and \"The Blair Bitch Project\" was named after The Blair Witch Project. \"Victor, Victrola\" is named after the British-American musical comedy Victor/Victoria. \"Bad News Blair\" was named after the 1976 movie The Bad News Bears.\n\nJoshua Safran said, \"we draw from classic works like Les Liaisons Dangereuses and The Great Gatsby as much as we do from pop culture.\"[7]\n\nProduct placement [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl is known for its product placement. The show had a contract with Verizon Wireless for its first five seasons; all the characters were seen with phones chosen by the brand until the deal ended by the sixth season.[56] During their contract, Verizon Wireless offered exclusive Gossip Girl content and created a website where ringtones of the songs featured on the show could be downloaded.[57] Barbra Robin, The CW's senior vice president of Integrated Marketing, stated: \"It was really about showing features on a device. [...] Initially, it was just a wireless phone, but eventually that became a smartphone, a tablet, all these other types of technology that took them through their day and showed how they used it to get from one place to the next.\"[58]\n\nIn mid-2008, executives of VitaminWater approached The CW for a placement deal. During the second season, the drinks were mentioned several times in dialogues. The partnership helped pay the costs of shooting on location in the Hamptons.[59] An HP TouchPad was prominently displayed in an episode of the sixth season.[60] According to OneNewsNow.com, other sponsors have included Procter & Gamble, L'Oreal, Target and Johnson & Johnson, which allowed the series to earn $28.2 million in advertising revenue in 2007.[61]\n\nDistribution and release [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl aired on The CW on Mondays.[62] In addition to the television broadcast of the show, episodes of Gossip Girl have also been released on the Internet. In October 2011, The CW signed a deal allowing all Gossip Girl episodes to be streamed on Netflix.[63] The same month, the network signed a deal with Hulu. Both CWTV.com and Hulu streamed episodes for free, but only the five most recent installments were available for viewing.[64] All seasons of Gossip Girl are also available through the iTunes Store and Amazon Video where each episode can be purchased separately or in complete season sets.\n\nAs of 2012, the series was broadcast in 197 countries.[14]\n\nOn January 1, 2021, Gossip Girl moved from Netflix to parent company WarnerMedia's streaming service HBO Max.[65]\n\nSyndication [ edit ]\n\nOn July 25, 2012, Style Network announced that it had acquired the off-network rights to Gossip Girl and started airing repeats of the show on August 15, 2012.[66]\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nThe DVD sets of each season were released in various regions after their television broadcast.\n\nDVD Name Release dates Technical details Bonus Features Region\n\n1 Region\n\n2 Region\n\n3 Region\n\n4 The Complete First Season August 19, 2008 August 18, 2008 October 22, 2008 April 15, 2009 5-Disc Set\n\nAspect ratio: 1.78:1\n\nLanguage: English\n\nSubtitles: Chinese, English, French, Korean, Portuguese, Spanish, Thai\n\nRunning time: 810 minutes Unaired Scenes\n\nThe Beginning, XOXO: Concept to Execution Featurette\n\nGossip Girl Couture Featurette;\n\nCouture Featurette; A Gossip Girl Wedding Featurette\n\nWedding Featurette LOL: Gag Reel\n\nThe Pierces \"Secret\" and \"Boring\" Music Videos\n\nDownloadable Audiobook of the Original Best-selling Novel, read by Christina Ricci.

Part one was released on April 13, 2009, and part two was released on August 10, 2009, while the complete season was released later, on September 28, 2009.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nGossip Girl poster featuring a negative review poster featuring a negative review\n\nGossip Girl initially received positive reviews. Due to the show's pedigree as an adaptation of The New York Times best-selling novel series, the show was considered to be one of the more anticipated new shows of the 2007\u20132008 television season. An August 2007 survey by OTX, a global media research and consulting firm, placed the show on the list of top ten new shows that viewers were aware of.[68] Though the pilot was the recipient of many positive reviews from publications such as Variety, The Washington Post, San Francisco Chronicle and the Boston Globe, other reviewers described it as a guilty pleasure rather than an hour's worth of must-watch television.[69][70][71][72] Metacritic gave it a score of 59, based on the reviews of 40 different publications.[73]\n\nToward the conclusion of the first season, Janet Malcolm of The New Yorker criticized the show for its deviations from the novels. She has stated that the series was \"related to the original only in the names and outlines of the characters\". She further asserted that, \"Without von Ziegesar's fast, mocking commentary to propel them, the TV episodes are sluggish and crass\u2014a move from Barneys to Kmart.\"[74] However, author Cecily von Ziegesar has expressed support for the show, noting that all of her major plot points were present in the pilot.[75]\n\nAs the show continued its first season, the response became considerably more positive, and by the second season critical response was favorable. Metacritic gave the new season an improved score of 71. \"Summer's been good to this girl,\" claimed Entertainment Weekly, who awarded the series its highest grade of \"A\".[76] The New York Daily News claimed the show had found its footing by stating \"It knows exactly what it wants and needs its new hybrid product to be. The hockey fights video of teen romance drama.\"[77] Gossip Girl was designated the \"Greatest Teen Drama of All Time\" by New York magazine.[78] The magazine wrote, \"the show has resurrected the potential for scripted dramas to be effective social satire\u2014to present a world more accurately than a 'reality' program can. Gossip Girl presents a wealth-eye view of the city, but because it is a cartoon we can laugh along with the conspicuousness of the consumption.\"[78]\n\nThe Christian Parents Television Council has shown particular criticism of the series, especially with its \"OMFG\" ad campaign from April 2008.[79] It also named the episode \"Victor/Victrola\" the worst television program of the week in which the episode originally was broadcast.[80] Quotes from the Parents Television Council review, as well as negative quotes from the San Diego Union-Tribune, New York Post and the Boston Herald, were used on various advertisements for the second season. The Hartford Courant chronicled a variety of negative responses to the ads. The ads included quotes like \"Every Parent's Nightmare\", \"Mind-Blowingly Inappropriate\" and \"A Nasty Piece of Work\" in what appears to be an effort to continue the \"rebellious teen\" style of the show.[81][82]\n\nWith the approach of the fifth season, New York magazine reviewed the life expectancy of the show, noting its waning cultural relevancy despite the growing prominence of its actors, and the loss of its status as The CW's number-one show, having been beaten out in terms of ratings by other shows of the network like Supernatural and 90210. \"The series itself hasn't quite kept up, even if its plotting is as juicy and lunatic as ever.\" and that \"The cast would all rather be making movies, while the showrunners are focusing on launching new projects via their nascent Fake Empire production company (including CW newcomer Hart of Dixie). Barring an unexpected brand reboot or another stab at a spinoff, we're afraid the end is near. XOXO.\"[83] AOL TV ranked Gossip Girl the 20th Best School Show of All Time and the 4th TV's Biggest Guilty Pleasure.[84][85] The show was declared the tenth highest-rated show for the first ten years of IMDb.com Pro (2002\u20132012).[86]\n\nThere was much controversy around Dan being revealed as Gossip Girl in the season finale. Dan had always struggled to be an insider among the Upper East Side and had supposedly created Gossip Girl to gain more power and had been the one \"pulling the strings the whole time,\" as mentioned by Serena in the finale. However, there was much speculation and controversy regarding this decision. Penn Badgley, who played Dan, stated in an interview that he himself found it funny that the writers had decided to make him be Gossip Girl and that he did not know about the reveal before shooting the series finale. Badgley cited the numerous instances of Dan appearing to be shocked by a Gossip Girl blast while alone, which would not make sense if Dan had been the one posting on Gossip Girl.[87]\n\nCultural influence [ edit ]\n\nCW executive Dawn Ostroff later compared Gossip Girl's role as the show that defined its network to House of Cards for Netflix. Its television audience was never very large, but the show was influential on culture; Savage recalled that the crew likened working on it to working for a lifestyle magazine. Bell stated, \"[Schwartz and Savage] were spearheading: 'What if the Internet is just a place to judge people? What if that's what it turns into?' And they turned out to be Nostradamus.\"[20]\n\nA hairstylist for the show compared media interest in Lively's hair to that for Jennifer Aniston's \"The Rachel\".[20] In 2008, The New York Times reported the show has had a profound impact on retail, saying Gossip Girl is probably \"the first [show] to have been conceived, in part, as a fashion marketing vehicle\". While it has had middling success in terms of ratings, it \"may well be the biggest influence in the youth culture market\", said a trendspotter.[88] However, for Maheen Humayun of The Tempest, the show emphasized toxic cultural traits, like rape culture, that \"messed up a whole generation.\"[89] According to Zoe Fox of Mashable, the show popularized social media networks and mobile communication, becoming \"a pioneer in its use of mobile\".[90] In 2008, New York Magazine named the series as \"Best Show Ever\".[78] In 2009, Rolling Stone named the series as \"TV's Hottest Show\".[91]\n\nOn January 26, 2012, in honor of the series' 100th episode, New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg visited the set and proclaimed the date Gossip Girl Day, citing the show's cultural influence and impact on the economy of the city. \"Gossip Girl has made New York a central character. While Gossip Girl is drawing fans in with its plot twists, the show also attracts many of them to visit New York, contributing to our incredible 50.5 million visitors last year. In fact, the economic impact of Gossip Girl and other television shows and films that are made in New York really can be felt directly in all five boroughs. The 100th episode of Gossip Girl is a real landmark, and I want to congratulate the show's cast and crew,\" he stated.[92]\n\nThe popularity of the series was also indirectly responsible for the creation of the reality series NYC Prep, which ran for one season on Bravo.[93][94] The series has been referenced in films such as Fired Up!, Get Him To The Greek, Vampires Suck, Easy A, Just Go With It and Horrible Bosses, and TV series such as Royal Pains, Entourage, Parks and Recreation, Skam, 30 Rock, Skins, and Shameless, among others.[95]\n\nPopular among teenagers and young adults, the Gossip Girl cast has posed on the cover of numerous mainstream magazines, including Rolling Stone, People, Nylon, New York Magazine, TV Guide, New York Post, Vogue, Out Magazine, Details, and Entertainment Weekly.\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nThe series premiere was watched by 3.50 million viewers and achieved a 1.6 Adults 18\u201349, coming in last place in its 9:00 pm timeslot on Wednesday nights.[96] However, the show was noted to have held the best audience retention of America's Next Top Model.[97] Benefiting from the network rerunning the show during the 2008 WGA strike,[20] the season ended with 3.00 million viewers.[98] The second season premiered with 3.43 million viewers.[99] The second season ended with 2.23 million viewers.[100] The third season premiered with 2.55 million viewers.[101] The third season ended with 1.96 million viewers.[102] The fourth season premiered to 1.83 million viewers and a 1.0 for adults 18\u201349.[103] Episode 4.04 hit season highs in all categories with a 2.8 rating in The CW's target of Women 18\u201334, a 1.7 in Adults 18\u201334 and 1.1 in Adults 18\u201349.[104] The fourth season ended with 1.36 million viewers.[105] The fifth season premiered with 1.37 million viewers.[106] The fifth season ended with 1.44 million viewers.[107]\n\nDespite this, throughout the fifth season, Gossip Girl continued to see a decrease in viewers.
