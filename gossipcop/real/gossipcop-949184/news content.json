In a social media post, Halsey wrote, \u201cI normally keep this kind of thing private but provided our public. nature I feel the need to inform my fans. G-Eazy and I are taking some time apart.\u201d She continued on to say, \u201cI\u2019m eager to continue the upcoming passage of time dedicating myself to my art and my career, and the duration of my tour. I wish him the best. Thanks for respecting our privacy at this time.\u201d Now, it appears as if Halsey may have her eyes on another tall wild boy, Machine Gun Kelly.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the Halsey/G-Eazy break up was anticipated by friends close to the couple. Post Malone performed at the Hollywood Bowl last week, and during his performance, he called G-Eazy on stage. Halsey was in the audience for the show, but she and G-Eazy were not spotted together after the concert. That occurrence alone is odd, since the two were basically inseparable in public. Halsey made her way over to Poppy, a popular club in Hollywood, after the show for an after party. Keen-eyed fans and excited photographers were quick to notice that Eazy was nowhere in sight, but Machine Gun Kelly and Halsey were spotted hanging out. The two were rumored to have a thing before Eazy came into the picture.", "images": ["https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/favicon.ico"], "top_img": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karlton Jahmal"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/110973-halsey-seen-with-machine-gun-kelly-before-announcing-split-with-g-eazy-news", "title": "Halsey Seen With Machine Gun Kelly Before Announcing Split With G-Eazy", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#000000", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no;user-scalable=0;", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Halsey Seen With Machine Gun Kelly Before Announcing Split With G-Eazy", "description": "Halsey seems to have a type.", "url": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com/110973-halsey-seen-with-machine-gun-kelly-before-announcing-split-with-g-eazy-news", "site_name": "HotNewHipHop"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/realhotnewhiphop/", "published_time": "2018-07-04T09:43:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-26T05:19:05+00:00"}, "author": "Karlton Jahmal", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://editor.urbanlinx.net/wp-content/uploads/cover/19/98/1530709819_67b882ef6610b7ea4d813a8b0301225f.jpg", "creator": "@HotNewHipHop", "site": "@HotNewHipHop", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Karlton Jahmal", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "next-head-count": 34}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530697400.0, "source": "https://www.hotnewhiphop.com", "summary": ""}
