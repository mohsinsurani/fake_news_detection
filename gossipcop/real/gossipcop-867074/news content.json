Pays Tribute to Ex Tiny on Her Birthday With Message of Love\n\nby 0 Shares\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrue love never dies. T.I. wrote a message of love to his ex Tiny Harris for her birthday on July 14. In the Instagram post, he declared his feelings for the mother of his children, despite the fact they're currently going through a divorce.\n\n\"Happy Gday to my beautiful lovely lil loud mouth, argumentative know it all, s--t kickin, Cap ass Southside Patna,\" T.I. wrote on Instagram Friday. He posted a slideshow of photos of the two throughout the years.\n\n\"@majorgirl As a couple We've experienced some of the greatest moments in our lives together,\" he continued. \"And while I may have f\u2014ked up & still have so many more f\u2014k ups in me on so many levels, one thing that's never gon change is how I consider you.... You are, have been, & always will be one of the Best Friends I have in the world.\"\n\n\"We have 7 amazing kids who all have enough skills, smarts, talent and ability to take care of us in our old age....Now That's awesome!!!\" T.I. wrote. \"And while most of these nosey, no business havin, overly-opinionated, fake caring ass people would see it as a break up... I see it differently. In my eyes, we didn't break up, we EVOLVED into something unconditional. A relationship that supersedes fidelity, physical presence, or any other disagreement we may have faced. What we have is stronger than the bulls--t & for that I'm thankful.\"\n\nTiny responded by commenting, \"Awe Big Daddy...can't do nothing but say I will always love u forever & day! Always said u were the man to make all my dreams come true!\" \"U still MY King...Mr. Harris..they should all know that,\" she added.\n\nYassss #Tiny & #TI doing it for the gram on her birthday!

We straight. Everybody else got the problem,\" he said. \"We see each other. We speak. We talk. We spend time together. We're good.\"\n\n\"That's still one of the best friends I have in the world,\" he said. \"I can just be a better best friend than a husband.\"\n\nLayin Low & Lurkin on that bag Shhhhh.... don't scare it off.
