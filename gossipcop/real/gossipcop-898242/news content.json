Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight In tweets, the \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d star laid out his own claims of experiencing sexual harassment. At a party in 2016, a \u201chigh-level Hollywood executive\u201d came up to Crews and \u201cgroped my privates,\u201d the actor wrote. Crews later publicly identified the executive as Adam Venit, a longtime industry power-player who represented marquee names such as Adam Sandler, Sylvester Stallone, Eddie Murphy and Vince Vaughn. Crews went on to file a police report about the incident, as well as a lawsuit against Venit and his agency, William Morris Endeavor.\n\nBut Crews\u2019s revelation reverberated well beyond his own case. His public stand detonated stereotypes by showing a 240-pound former NFL player could also be the victim of sexual assault, thus widening the lens of the #MeToo movement. Time included Crews among the \u201cthe silence breakers\u201d named in the magazine\u2019s person of the year feature.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nNow, Crews\u2019s legal case has come to an end. On Thursday, William Morris Endeavor announced the lawsuit has been settled.\n\n\u201cTerry Crews, Adam Venit and WME have settled the lawsuit Mr. Crews filed last year,\u201d the agency said in a statement, according to the Hollywood Reporter. \u201cIt will be dismissed.\u201d\n\nAccording to Deadline, Venit is also planning to retire from WME on Monday. He had previously been suspended and demoted following Crews\u2019s allegation.\n\nAfter news of the settlement and Venit\u2019s exit, Crews responded on Twitter with a single word: \u201cACCOUNTABILITY,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThat was the theme Crews has continually hit on since speaking out.\n\n\u201cPeople need to be held accountable,\u201d the actor told \u201cGood Morning America\u201d last November. \u201cThis is the deal about Hollywood. It is an abuse of power. This guy, again, he\u2019s one of the most powerful [men] in Hollywood, and he looked at me at the end as if, \u2018Who is going to believe you?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cThe assault lasted only minutes, but what he was effectively telling me while he held my genitals in his hand was that he held the power. That he was in control,\u201d Crews told the Senate Judiciary Committee this summer. \u201cAs I shared my story, I was told over and over that this was not abuse. This was just a joke. This was just horseplay. But I can say one man\u2019s horseplay is another man\u2019s humiliation.\u201d\n\nIn his lawsuit, filed last December, Crews recounted his alleged encounter with the star agent. \u201cVenit, upon his first meeting Crews, viciously grabbed Crews\u2019s penis and testicles so hard that it caused Crews immediate pain in a blatant and unprovoked sexual assault,\u201d the lawsuit stated.\n\nCrews, who was not Venit\u2019s client, reportedly told his own WME agent about the assault the next day. But the agency did nothing, his lawsuit claimed, as part of \u201ccorporate culture that fosters environments in which WME agents are knowingly permitted and encouraged to engage in misconduct, including sexually predatory conduct.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn court filings, Venit denied the allegations, the Associated Press reported.\n\nAccording to the Reporter, a criminal investigation into the assault spearheaded by the Los Angeles Police Department commenced last November. In March, the prosecutors announced they were declining criminal charges because of \u201cthe lapse in statute of limitations for misdemeanor cases.\u201d\n\nBut the allegations also triggered an internal review at WME. The Reporter wrote that the agency\u2019s internal review determined that Crews\u2019s allegation about Venit was \u201cindicative of a pattern, rather than an isolated event.\u201d The agent was bumped down from his position as the head of the agency\u2019s motion picture group.\n\nVenit\u2019s demotion \u2014 and now exit \u2014 from the industry represented a significant nose dive for a man who was a considerable force within Hollywood for more than three decades. According to Deadline, the agent started out working in the mailroom at Creative Artists Agency in 1986 after dropping out of law school. He later went on to represent some of the biggest movie stars in the business.\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-11-09/Getty/872310966.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-11-09/Getty/872310966.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kyle Swenson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/07/actor-terry-crews-settles-his-lawsuit-against-the-powerful-hollywood-agent-who-allegedly-groped-him/", "title": "Actor Terry Crews settles his lawsuit against the powerful Hollywood agent who allegedly groped him", "meta_data": {"description": "The \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d star's allegations significantly readjusted the\u00a0national conversation on sexual harassment.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/07/actor-terry-crews-settles-his-lawsuit-against-the-powerful-hollywood-agent-who-allegedly-groped-him/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2017-11-09/Getty/872310966.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Actor Terry Crews settles his lawsuit against the powerful Hollywood agent who allegedly groped him", "description": "The \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d star's allegations significantly readjusted the\u00a0national conversation on sexual harassment."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Actor Terry Crews settles his lawsuit against the powerful Hollywood agent who allegedly groped him", "description": "The \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d star's allegations significantly readjusted the\u00a0national conversation on sexual harassment."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-10-25T15:26:21.792Z", "article": {"published_time": "2018-09-07T06:38:09.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-10-25T15:26:21.792Z", "section": "Morning Mix", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 70, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/morning-mix/wp/2018/09/07/actor-terry-crews-settles-his-lawsuit-against-the-powerful-hollywood-agent-who-allegedly-groped-him/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536274800.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
