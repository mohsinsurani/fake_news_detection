After posing for photos, she\u2019d later introduce the performance of The Band\u2019s Visit.\n\nSpade died by suicide on June 5. She was found dead in her New York City apartment at about 10:20 a.m. by her housekeeper. Brosnahan\u2019s father is the brother of the late designer.\n\nSpade\u2019s husband, Andy Spade, broke his silence following the news on June 6. \u201cKate was the most beautiful woman in the world. She was the kindest person I\u2019ve ever known and my best friend for 35 years. My daughter and I are devastated by her loss, and can\u2019t even begin to fathom life without her. We are deeply heartbroken and miss her already,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cKate suffered from depression and anxiety for many. She was actively seeking help and working closely with her doctors to treat her disease, one that takes far too many lives. We were in touch with her the night before and she sounded happy.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cThere was no indication and no warning that she would do this. It was a complete shock. And it clearly wasn\u2019t her. There were personal demons she was battling.\u201d\n\nThe pair, who married in 1994, are the parents of daughter Frances Beatrix, now 13. They were separated at the time of Kate\u2019s death.\n\nLike Brosnahan, Andy\u2019s brother David Spade has returned to the public eye since the tragedy. On June 8, he said during a stand-up performance that it had been a \u201crough week\u201d but he didn\u2019t want to cancel the show.", "images":
