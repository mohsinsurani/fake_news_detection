View Photos Brothers Isaac, Taylor and Zachary are celebrating their 25th anniversary as a musical group. Caption Brothers Isaac, Taylor and Zachary are celebrating their 25th anniversary as a musical group. Isaac, Zac and Taylor Hanson on Main Street in Tulsa\u2019s Brady Arts District, where the band is renovating a building to house their studio, brewery and performance space. The famed Cain\u2019s Ballroom, once home to Bob Wills and the Texas Playboys, is in the background. Shane Bevel/For The Washington Post Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nUPDATED from August 2017: You can now hear Geoff Edgers\u2019s interviews with Hanson in the \u201cEdge of Fame\u201d podcast. Look for the \u201cplay\u201d button below or subscribe on iTunes or Stitcher.\n\nOne day, during a recent rehearsal with his brothers, Zachary Hanson used the \u201cF\u201d word. This, in itself, should not be notable. Hanson has four children. He drives a pickup. He recently shed 35 pounds with Lose It! And lots of people use the \u201cF\u201d word.\n\nExcept, for many, he is still Zac, the adorable, shaggy-haired preteen pounding out \u201cMMMBop.\u201d The drummer in a boy band that sold 10 million copies of its 1997 debut album, performed on \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d and the Grammys and at the World Series (all in the same year), and appeared on the cover of Tiger Beat with teen heartthrob Jonathan Taylor Thomas.\n\nZac isn\u2019t reminiscing as he talks over a new song, \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Go Home,\u201d with his brothers, Taylor and Isaac. He\u2019s contemplating the opening verse. The narrator, in a bar during last call, sings, \u201cI\u2019m feeling dangerous.\u201d\n\nCould he switch \u201cfeeling\u201d to that more profane word with the same first letter?\n\nIn the end, Zac leaves the lyrics alone.\n\n\u201cYou put it in there and it feels really good, but it just colors the whole song,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain point when I\u2019m like, \u2018I like this song more than I like singing f---.\u2019 \u201d\n\nAs Hanson rehearses on this Sunday afternoon, it\u2019s hard to believe the brothers are preparing for a tour celebrating a quarter century as a band. Isaac, the eldest of the brood, is 36. The work, on this afternoon, is not particularly glamorous. They tighten the breaks in \u201cTragic Symphony.\u201d They smooth out a new song, \u201cI Was Born.\u201d\n\nFinally, as Isaac noodles through the intro to \u201cJohnny B. Goode\u201d and Zac offers up a figure-skating analogy that doesn\u2019t particularly make sense, Taylor grows impatient.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s not try to reinvent the wheel right now,\u201d he says, and they begin to play again.\n\nAt one time, Hanson\u2019s rise, from flyover Oklahoma to mega stardom, may have seemed stunning in itself. But the band\u2019s greatest feat may be how it has survived \u2014 and without a scandal, rehab or \u201cSharknado 4.\u201d The Hanson way has been marked by the brothers\u2019 special ability to say no \u2014 always politely, of course \u2014 to record execs who didn\u2019t get it; to a culture desperate for confessions; even, at times, to each other.\n\nAs they embark on the American leg of their anniversary tour, the brothers haven\u2019t so much reinvented themselves as merely grown into older versions of their teenage selves.\n\n\u201cThey beat the system,\u201d says Danny Goldberg, who signed Hanson while chairman of Mercury Records and both praises them and laments that they didn\u2019t listen to him more.\n\n\u201cThey used it, they got what they wanted out of it and then they\u2019ve done things completely on their own terms, without worrying about any other metrics except their own. They could have done other things to make more money, but they put their personal happiness and contentment first.\u201d\n\n\u2018Why would you do rock-and-roll?\u2019\n\nIf you were there that summer, you couldn\u2019t avoid it. \u201cMMMBop\u201d arrived April 15, 1997. By May, it had knocked off the Notorious B.I.G. and taken the top slot of the Billboard Hot 100. The single remained at No. 1 for three weeks and topped the charts in 27 countries, from Australia to Sweden.\n\nHanson mania hit. David Spade pretended to be the fourth Hanson brother at the MTV Movie Awards. Oprah had them play her talk show and, as she cut to a commercial, found herself singing the chorus. Will Ferrell and Helen Hunt took the brothers hostage in an elevator, at gunpoint, during a skit on SNL.\n\n\u201cDid you write the song \u2018MMMBop?\u2019\u201d Hunt shouts after the doors close.\n\nFerrell hands her a pair of earplugs. He looks at the boys.\n\n\u201cYou will now listen to the song as long as it takes for you to feel the pain that we felt this past summer,\u201d he tells them before the music kicks in.\n\nTwenty years later, Hanson doesn\u2019t shy away from \u201cMMMBop,\u201d even if they\u2019ve had to shift it from the key of A to E to accommodate Taylor\u2019s no longer being 14. But they embrace it. After starting a beer company in 2013, they even named their signature pale ale \u201cMmmHops.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople will often ask us the question with that tone,\u201d says Isaac. \u201c \u2018Well, do you play that song?\u2019 Of course we do.\u201d\n\nThere is one secret he shares about \u201cMMMBop.\u201d As much as it\u2019s catchy pop candy, the song also is about losing friends and always feeling a bit different. To make his point, he speaks some of the lines.\n\n\u201cSo hold onto the ones that really care. In the end they\u2019ll be the only ones there. When you get old and start losing your hair, can you tell me who will still care?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat song,\u201d he says, \u201cwas basically about getting the stink eye from a bunch of folks at our church because we wanted to do rock-and-roll, and they were like, \u2018Why would you do rock-and-roll? Why wouldn\u2019t you just sing gospel songs?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThis explains an important part of the Hanson dynamic. It\u2019s why they never totally let their guards down, never completely trust outsiders. That\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re always somewhere between embraced (by your still obsessive core of fans) and misunderstood (by the adults). The answer, for Hanson, has been to pull back, compartmentalize, to keep some spaces for themselves. Consider their approach to faith \u2014 one of the more polarizing subjects in modern culture and certainly pop music.\n\nAs kids, the boys would overhear the whispers among the mothers at their church. It\u2019s just a phase. They\u2019ll get over it. As teen stars in a secular field, they knew people wouldn\u2019t understand why they still went to church. They dodged when asked whether they prayed. They made it clear that music and religion were separate entities in their lives.\n\nIn 1997, when famed director Gus Van Sant approached Hanson as a fan and proposed making their next video, Goldberg put in a call to their father, Walker. He wanted to make sure they were okay being associated with the director of \u201cMy Own Private Idaho.\u201d\n\n\u201cI told them about Gus and explained that he was gay and told them about some of the movies he\u2019s made,\u201d Goldberg says. \u201cWithout hesitation, Walker says, \u2018If you think he\u2019ll make a great video, that\u2019s the right person.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\n\nFrom left, Isaac, 11, Taylor, 9, and Zac Hanson, 6, perform in front of a panel of local judges for the chance to do their first public show at the Mayfest Arts Festival in their home town of Tulsa in May 1992. (Walker Hanson)\n\n\n\nThe Hanson Brothers perform at the Arthur Ashe Stadium in the USTA National Tennis Center in New York in 1997. (Adam Nadel/Associated Press)\n\nHanson at a party after hosting the MTV Movie Awards in 2001. (Mark J. Terrill/Associated Press)\n\nHanson approaches interviews and publicity with a guarded warmth. They\u2019ll welcome you to their home town, chat for hours at a restaurant and let you scour their merch room. They won\u2019t take you home to hang with the family or to church on Sunday. They certainly won\u2019t let your reality show in.\n\nThat\u2019s what A&E discovered, 10 years ago, after greenlighting a pilot for a Hanson family show. The deal fell apart when the production company suggested a staged argument between the Hanson wives over what they fed their children.\n\n\u201cThe thing that would drive the ratings, all the drama around family and raising their kids, having to share all that was not acceptable to them,\u201d says Jordan Berliant, one of their managers at the time.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the difference,\u201d Isaac says when explaining why they\u2019ve never been desperate for attention. \u201cI don\u2019t think we were ever trying to be famous. That wasn\u2019t the goal. The goal was, \u2018I want people to sing my songs.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThat dynamic, of keeping things to themselves, extends to the relationship among the brothers. There\u2019s nothing special about sibling strife in rock bands, from the Everlys to the Kinks, Oasis and the Black Crowes. Isaac is loath to discuss it, though, calling it \u201cdirty laundry.\u201d Zac is more open.\n\nFor Hanson, a low point came about four years ago, when the band embarked on what was meant to be a 20th-anniversary celebration. In 2013, after releasing their sixth studio album, \u201cAnthem,\u201d and touring, they were tired of the record/tour/record cycle \u2014 and of each other. What exactly happened is unclear.\n\nBut Hanson took most of 2014 off. Ultimately, they decided to regroup.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the Davies brothers,\u201d says Zac. \u201cI don\u2019t know the Kings of Leon and how they hate or love or whatever. I have been training for this job my whole life. The idea of conflict resolution is not some new thing. It is simply what you have to do every day of your life. And so we just do it. When we yell at each other, we yell at each other until we are not yelling at each other. And when somebody says, \u2018Maybe I\u2019ll quit today,\u2019 you say, \u2018You are an idiot, and I\u2019ll see you tomorrow.\u2019 Because there is so much in it, so much you care about. The answer is not \u2018I give up.\u2019 It\u2019s just not.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom left, Issac, Zac and Taylor Hanson on Main Street in Tulsa. (Shane Bevel for The Washington Post)\n\nTeen heroes to road warriors\n\nPerhaps the most important misunderstanding \u2014 and biggest frustration for Hanson \u2014 is how their music has been viewed by the wider world. In Wiki-shorthand, they\u2019re still the teeny-boppers who ushered in the boy-band era and, in the process, tortured most of adult America.\n\nThe comparisons to \u2019N Sync and the Backstreet Boys still bother them. Their music, after all, has always had more in common with Spoon and Squeeze than anything in Lou Pearlman\u2019s stable. And Hanson\u2019s latest song, \u201cI Was Born,\u201d released this summer, is as catchy as anything the band has done. NPR praised it as nothing short of \u201cfantastic.\u201d\n\nThey do know music, having made their most formative connection via a Time/Life anthology of 1958 hits purchased by their parents. When Walker and Diana Hanson took the family to South America for a year in 1989, the boys played that tape \u2014 stuffed with Chuck Berry, Little Richard and Eddie Cochran \u2014 over and over.\n\nIsaac and Taylor also took piano lessons while abroad and started singing together, which continued when they got back to Tulsa. A family video, circa 1992, shows the boys \u2014 11, 9 and 6 \u2014 singing Bobby Darin\u2019s \u201cSplish, Splash.\u201d The Hanson Brothers, as they were called, made their first performance at an arts festival in Tulsa in 1992. By 1996, Hanson had released two self-produced albums and went to the South by Southwest festival in Austin to try to get attention. It didn\u2019t work at first.\n\nBefore their first-ever performance in 1992, Diana Hanson filmed her sons singing \"Splish Splash.\" At the time, Zac was 6, Taylor was 9 and Isaac was 11. (Courtesy of Hanson)\n\n\u201cThere was no way I was going to sign them,\u201d says Steve Greenberg, a Mercury talent scout. \u201cWe were just coming out of grunge, and everything was so dark and negative.\u201d\n\nBut then Greenberg had an epiphany while in a supermarket checkout line.\n\n\u201cI pulled out one of those teen magazines and realized as I was looking through, there were no pictures of any musicians,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was all pictures of Jonathan Taylor Thomas and actors. Of course, you can\u2019t put Eddie Vedder in there. I just realized there was a huge hole here. I thought, \u2018I wish there was somebody like that.\u2019 \u201d\n\nA Mercury colleague slipped Greenberg a tape, which included a rawer version of \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Greenberg signed Hanson and brought in the Dust Brothers, fresh off Beck\u2019s \u201cOdelay,\u201d to give the song a little extra punch. With 1997\u2019s \u201cMiddle of Nowhere,\u201d Hanson became the rare teen band on the cover of Teen and topping the Village Voice\u2019s Pazz and Jop critics poll.\n\nEven then, the brothers weren\u2019t afraid to choose their own path.\n\nGreenberg recalls how hard he and Goldberg pushed Hanson to get back into the studio to capitalize on the success of \u201cMiddle of Nowhere.\u201d Fame is fleeting, they argued. You have to take advantage of the moment. They refused, wanting instead to prove themselves on the road. Their follow-up, \u201cThis Time Around,\u201d didn\u2019t arrive until 2000. It barely cracked the Top 20.\n\n\u201cThey never regained their teen audience,\u201d says Greenberg. \u201cWhat they got was the undying loyalty of the core of their original fans. They\u2019re able to go out, able to tour, and they\u2019re a really excellent band. Instead of looking out and seeing a room of 13-year-old girls, what you see is a room full of 33-year-old women.\u201d\n\n\n\nFrom left, Zac, Taylor and Issac Hanson film an interview with the crew from Signal Factory in the middle of Main Street during their Hop Jam beer and music festival in Tulsa in May. (Shane Bevel for The Washington Post)\n\nBack to Tulsa\n\nTaylor is still deadly handsome, a wearer of skinny jeans and leather boots. He\u2019s not just the lead singer. He also sets the tone in interviews \u2014 warm, gracious but never confessional or uncontrolled. At one point, Goldberg expected him to break away from the band.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s just no question that Taylor could have gone solo right away and tried to compete with Justin Timberlake for that slot in the culture,\u201d he says. \u201cIt was just [not] going to happen.\u201d\n\nTaylor\u2019s allegiance is on full display in \u201cStrong Enough to Break,\u201d a 2006 documentary, available on YouTube, that details the band\u2019s struggles after \u201cThis Time Around.\u201d By the time Hanson was working on their third album, Mercury had been consumed by Island Def Jam Recordings. Goldberg and Greenberg were gone. Instead, they had Jeff Fenster, an executive who rejected almost everything they presented.\n\nWatching Hanson deal with Fenster is a lesson in self-control. Or self-abuse. At one point, during a phone call, the exec dismisses songs they\u2019ve recorded with Greg Wells, who would go on to produce massive hits for Adele and Twenty One Pilots.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t have an album,\u201d Fenster says.\n\nYou want Taylor to scream, smash the receiver and pull a Wilco, abandoning the major label hacks for an indie. Instead, he and Isaac weakly flip the bird to the phone and then he pleads for another chance.\n\n\u201cWe so are trying to get where you\u2019re coming from,\u201d Taylor says. \u201cSo help us out here.\u201d\n\nHanson finally split with Island Def Jam in 2003. Five years later, they moved their base of operations back to Tulsa and began releasing albums on their own and having children. (The brothers, all married, have 12 among them.) They also established what is effectively Hanson Inc.\n\n\n\nThe Hanson brothers brew, market and sell their own line of beers. (Shane Bevel for The Washington Post)\n\nFans raise their cellphones to take photos as Hanson takes the stage at Hop Jam. (Shane Bevel for The Washington Post)\n\nThey have offices in a downtown building stuffed with employees, a recording studio and everything from jewelry and T-shirts to the \u201cHansonopoly\u201d board game. They launched a beer company, and in 2014 started Hop Jam, a craft beer and music festival in Tulsa.\n\nStill, none of it is meant to replace the band\u2019s central mission \u2014 music.\n\nBackstage at this year\u2019s Hop Jam, there are Hansons everywhere. Wives, in-laws, Walker and Diana. A baby with a pink ribbon in her hair. And then they\u2019re on.\n\nThe set stretches from \u201cMMMBop\u201d to \u201cI Was Born.\u201d These days, Hanson doesn\u2019t measure success in record sales. They look at their live show. Most of the tour dates are sold out, and at Hop Jam, the street is packed.\n\nIn the front row, a line of women, most between 25 and 35, bop to the beat of \u201cGet the Girl Back\u201d and shout as Taylor emerges from a riser in the center of the crowd to sing \u201cFired Up.\u201d Zac hops out from behind his kit to perform one of his underappreciated gems, \u201cJuliet.\u201d\n\nThe next morning, at Tulsa International Airport, Jennifer Parks, 32, is still buzzing as she waits to board a flight back to Virginia. She\u2019s with a friend she met at a Hanson show four years ago.\n\nHop Jam was Parks\u2019s 60th Hanson gig since her first \u2014 Virginia Beach in 1998. What draws her is more than the music. The guys treat their fans with respect and love. They meet them before shows, pose for pictures, even allow fans to enter a contest to interview them. They\u2019re more than a band, which is why she and her friends have never moved on.\n\n\u201cWhen we come here every year, it\u2019s not just for Hanson,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s one big family.\u201d", "images": ["https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Style/Images/sa-hanson_03.JPG?uuid=r6JMuozWEeecU2oWm-sJUw", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Production/Sunday/SunArt/Images/SB052117_WPHanson_707.JPG?uuid=R84JGowQEeeR1atOS7dqOg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Production/Sunday/SunArt/Images/SB052117_WPHanson_1457.JPG?uuid=TX94MIwQEeeR1atOS7dqOg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Production/Sunday/SunArt/Images/SB052117_WPHanson_1364.JPG?uuid=WBwDOowQEeeR1atOS7dqOg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer-gray.png&w=1&h=1", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Style/Images/sa-hanson_03.JPG?t=20170517", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Style/Images/92-MayfestAuditionsHANSON.jpg?uuid=Jta8SowOEeeR1atOS7dqOg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Style/Images/sa-hanson_04.JPG?uuid=tlBhKIzWEeecU2oWm-sJUw", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Production/Sunday/SunArt/Images/SB052117_WPHanson_1524.JPG", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Production/Sunday/SunArt/Images/SB052217_WPHansonPortrait_2633.JPG?uuid=cwt9TIwQEeeR1atOS7dqOg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/08/30/Style/Images/sa-hanson_03.JPG?t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Geoff Edgers", "Reporter Covering Movies", "Museums", "Comedy", "Music", "Pop Culture", "March", "The Washington Post'S National Arts Reporter", "Covers Everything Fine Arts To Popular Culture.
