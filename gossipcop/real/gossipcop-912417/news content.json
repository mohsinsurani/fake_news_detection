Nevertheless, Guess was unable to conclusively determine the veracity of the allegations leveled against Marciano in its investigation.\n\nIn its filing, Guess said that \u201cmany of the allegations could not be corroborated,\u201d but did note that \u201con certain occasions Paul Marciano exercised poor judgment in his communications with models and photographers.\u201d In addition, the investigation found that Marciano did \u201cplace himself in situations in which plausible allegations of improper conduct could, and did, arise.\u201d\n\nGuess said that Marciano reached settlements with five individuals, totaling $500,000. The names of the individuals were not released; however, supermodel Kate Upton has been public with her allegations of harassment and unwanted advances.\n\nMarciano\u2019s resignation was reportedly voluntary. He plans to step down from the company\u2019s board at the end of his contract on Jan. 30. Marciano had already stepped away from day-to-day operations in February after the company opened its investigation into his conduct. His older brother and fellow co-founder Maurice has been appointed chairman.", "images": ["https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242585998-e1665028070836.jpg?w=256&q=75", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243767517-e1665076497696.jpg?w=256&q=75", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/paul-marciano-kate-upton-sexual-harrassment.jpg?resize=1200,600", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243581035-e1665068106964.jpg?w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/paul-marciano-kate-upton-sexual-harrassment.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://fortune.com/2018/06/13/kate-upton-paul-marciano-resigns-guess-sexual-harassment-allegations/", "title": "Model Kate Upton Accused Paul Marciano of Sexual Harassment.
