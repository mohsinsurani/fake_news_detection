Kim, who is planning this year's addition of the family tradition, revealed on the Late Late Show with James Corden that the theme of the theme of the card is \"women and kids.\" That means KUWTK fans can most likely expect not to see Rob Kardashian, Kanye West or Scott Disick this time around.\n\nPhoto Credit: E!
