{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/beyonce-gucci-kimono", "text": "Beyonc\u00e9 has always been an all-star when it comes to her maternity style game, and her last two major looks haven't let us down: When she first announced she was having twins, she donned an Agent Provocateur Lorna scalloped underwired bra and sheer veil. Shortly after, she took the stage at the Grammys in a gilded Peter Dundas custom gown and headdress, and left us breathless.\n\nNow Beyonc\u00e9 is at it again. She and Jay-Z sat courtside on Sunday at the NBA All-Star basketball game in New Orleans, and her look definitely made a statement. Queen B dressed like many of us do for a game\u2014distressed jeans, stilettos, white tee\u2014but kicked it up a (major) notch with an extravagant printed silk Gucci kimono from the S/S '17 collection. She accessorized the $21,945 robe, embroidered with tigers and tropical plants, with a $450 Gucci fan.\n\nBlue Ivy, who sat between her famous parents, complemented her mom's look by sporting a chartreuse Gucci dress, denim jacket, and Chuck Taylor kicks.\n\nHere's a view of the kimono from the side:\n\nPhoto by Jonathan Bachman/Getty Images Jonathan Bachman\n\nIt's pretty standard to wear distressed denim and a tee to a sporting event, but consider us reminded: Adding a statement piece to the simplest outfit\u2014even if it's just a pair of earrings\u2014is a great way to get some major style points. You don't need a $22,000 kimono, either.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/63287c2a1e060ccc0f5ed964/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632b18be49f9a667e4ae50d0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6324a558d35005622a70bc30/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab363c545f472d5ffd422f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-643011494.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1441213863/glamour_34-reasons-we-love-beyonce.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kelsey Lafferty"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/beyonce-gucci-kimono", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Wore a $22,000 Gucci Kimono to the NBA All-Star Game", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z sat courtside on Sunday at the NBA All-Star basketball game in New Orleans, and her look definitely made a statement", "id": "58ab3567545f472d5ffd422d", "keywords": "beyonce,fashion,outfit of the day,maternity style", "news_keywords": "beyonce,fashion,outfit of the day,maternity style", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58ab3567545f472d5ffd422d", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z sat courtside on Sunday at the NBA All-Star basketball game in New Orleans, and her look definitely made a statement\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "That's one way to upgrade jeans and a white tee.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Wore a $22,000 Gucci Kimono to the NBA All-Star Game", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/beyonce-gucci-kimono"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-02-20T20:34:16.793Z", "modified_time": "2017-02-20T20:34:16.793Z", "author": "Kelsey Lafferty"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "That's one way to upgrade jeans and a white tee.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58ab36332082ab53dfabafee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-643134454.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 Wore a $22,000 Gucci Kimono to the NBA All-Star Game"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1487622856.793, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
