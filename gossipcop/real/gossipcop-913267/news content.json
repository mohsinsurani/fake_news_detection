USA TODAY\n\nThe \"post-baby body\" is one of Hollywood's most unforgiving myths, in which women are expected to transform their bodies back to their pre-birth shapes as fast as possible.\n\nThen, there's Blake Lively, who shared on Instagram exactly how hard she worked to lose weight after giving birth to her second child in September 2016.\n\nThe 30-year-old actress revealed on Instagram Monday that she lost 61 pounds in the months since giving birth, posing in a sports bra and leggings and thanking her trainer Don Saladino for helping her with the process.\n\n\"Turns out you can\u2019t lose the 61 lbs you gained during pregnancy by just scrolling through Instagram and wondering why you don\u2019t look like all the bikini models,\" Lively wrote. \"Thanks @donsaladino for kicking my A double S into shape. 10 months to gain, 14 months to lose. Feeling very proud.\"\n\n\"Couldn\u2019t be more proud @blakelively! 61 pounds in 14 months after baby number 2!\" Saladino captioned a matching snap on his own account. \"Doesn\u2019t she look awesome?\"\n\nSaladino, who has also whipped Lively into shape for several film roles, told Cosmopolitan in 2016 how he helped the actress train forThe Shallows after giving birth to her daughter James in 2014. Lively's regimen called for five or six workouts a week, with sessions lasting from 30 to 75 minutes.\n\n\"She never questions me. She always does what I want her to do,\" Saladino said, praising his client's can-do attitude, while still being understanding of her needs as a new mom. \"If she comes in, and being like any other mom, she was up all night with the baby and didn't sleep well, I'm not going to beat the crap out of her. That's the worst thing to do for someone.\"", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e480f6330c3e7a6815fdd24b7a643f3544eec9a/c=0-21-1925-1108/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541071119702458-GTY-675605028-90617842.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5733271883001_5733257094001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e480f6330c3e7a6815fdd24b7a643f3544eec9a/c=0-21-1925-1108/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541071119702458-GTY-675605028-90617842.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maeve Mcdermott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/13/blake-lively-shows-off-61-pound-post-baby-weight-loss-feeling-very-proud/332377002/", "title": "Blake Lively shows off 61-pound post-baby weight loss: 'Feeling very proud'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/13/blake-lively-shows-off-61-pound-post-baby-weight-loss-feeling-very-proud/332377002/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Blake Lively shows off 61-pound post-baby weight loss: 'Feeling very proud'", "description": "Lively welcomed her second child in September 2016.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1e480f6330c3e7a6815fdd24b7a643f3544eec9a/c=0-21-1925-1108/local/-/media/2018/02/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636541071119702458-GTY-675605028-90617842.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Lively welcomed her second child in September 2016.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518480000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
