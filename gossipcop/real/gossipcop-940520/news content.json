Shortly after the new season launched Monday night, Yrigoyen\u2019s political beliefs and character were called into question when screengrabs of his Instagram activity were shared by another former Bachelor contestant. The images appeared to show Yrigoyen, a medical sales rep from Nevada, liking Instagram posts that mocked undocumented immigrants; the trans community; liberal feminists; and that spread misinformation about Parkland, Florida, shooting survivor David Hogg.\n\nNow, the contestant is taking responsibility for the posts.\n\n\u201cI am sorry to those who I offended, and I also take full responsibility for my \u2018likes\u2019 on Instagram that were hurtful and offensive,\u201d Yrigoyen wrote Thursday in a lengthy statement posted to his new Instagram account. He had deleted his former account after the reports. \u201cI decided to take it down and start fresh because I have learned an extremely valuable lesson and am taking steps to grow, become more educated, and be a better version of myself.\u201d\n\nHe continued, \u201cI am not perfect, and I will never be anywhere close, but now I will always be more informed and aware of what I am liking and supporting, not just on Instagram, but in life.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Yrigoyen went on to say that he \u201cdid not mean any harm\u201d by his actions. \u201cI am not the negative labels people are associating me with,\u201d he said. \u201cI do not want my social media to define who I am, and I will take better care moving forward to support all walks of life.\u201d\n\nThe comment from Yrigoyen, one of the initial 28 contestants on the new season of the long-running ABC reality franchise, is unexpected. Typically, contestants on The Bachelor and The Bachelorette do not address anything related to the season until they are eliminated. ABC and the show\u2019s producer Warner Bros. have so far declined to comment on the story.\n\nThe silence from Yrigoyen, however, only fueled the coverage of the story \u2014 especially since he is believed to be a serious contender this season. He received Kufrin\u2019s \u201cfirst impression\u201d rose and only kiss on Monday\u2019s premiere, an honor that has gone to the eventual winner on the last three seasons of The Bachelorette.\n\nKufrin herself addressed the controversy Wednesday and asked viewers to be open-minded as the season continues to air. (Yrigoyen made it past the first rose ceremony.)\n\n\u201cPeople say and do certain things. I\u2019ve done things in the past that I\u2019m sure it wasn\u2019t the best thing,\u201d she told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cI can\u2019t fault anyone for what they believe, and who\u2019s to say that anything that anyone likes is truly what they believe in if they just double tap [a picture on Instagram]. I can\u2019t speak to that because it\u2019s not me. I am a strong woman and I do believe in certain things, but again, that\u2019s what\u2019s so great about our country is that everyone is entitled to their own opinions.\u201d\n\nYrigoyen\u2019s social media history stood in contrast to that of Kufrin, who has supported Hillary Clinton and the Women\u2019s March. Now that Yrigoyen has offered his side of the story, it remains to be seen how the show will address the situation as the season continues to air. One option is host Chris Harrison discussing the off-air development during one of the specials that will air later in the season.\n\nRead Yrigoyen\u2019s full statement below.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/148893_0412-h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/148893_0412-h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Strause"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/bachelorette-frontrunner-garrett-controversial-social-media-posts-1116281/", "title": "\u2018Bachelorette\u2019 Frontrunner Apologizes for \u201cHurtful and Offensive\u201d Social Media History", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Garrett Yrigoyen, a frontrunner on Becca Kufrin's ABC season, addressed his controversial social media history on Instagram.", "news_keywords": "ABC, The Bachelorette", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Jackie Strause", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1116281, "title": "'Bachelorette' Frontrunner Apologizes for \"Hurtful and Offensive\" Social Media History", "published_at": "2018-05-31 16:33:20", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/148893_0412-h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The Bachelorette", "topics": "TV News", "body": "The\u00a0contestant at the center of The Bachelorette's week-one, off-air controversy is apologizing for his \"hurtful and offensive\" social media history.\r\nGarrett Yrigoyen, an early frontrunner on the new cycle of Becca Kufrin's Bachelorette season on ABC, has taken to his Instagram to explain his social media behavior.
