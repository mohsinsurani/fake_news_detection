The multi-talented MC opened the 2017 Billboard Music Awards with a bang, bringing out high-profile guests Lil Wayne (\u201cNo Frauds\u201d), David Guetta (\u201cLight My Body Up\u201d) and Jason Derulo (\u201cSwalla\u201d) for a four-song medley that concluded with a solo run through her recent single \u201cRegret In Your Tears.\u201d\n\nAfter an introduction that included snippets of previous hits like \u201cBeez in the Trap,\u201d \u201cStarships\u201d and \u201cMoment For Life,\u201d Minaj ripped into a forceful rendition of her much-discussed Remy Ma diss track \u201cNo Frauds,\u201d with Weezy on hand to run through his verse. Drake, who is also featured on the song, did not appear (though he watched from the crowd), but Minaj had plenty more guests to come, moving seamlessly into \u201cLight My Body Up\u201d with Guetta manning the boards behind her.\n\nDerulo then emerged, sporting long dreads and a chain over an all-black ensemble, to kick into \u201cSwalla.\u201d Minaj, seductive and sexy as always, delivered her verse while gyrating in a chair, but she still had more to come. \u201cRegret In Your Tears,\u201d another cut she released in a trilogy earlier this year that also included \u201cFrauds\u201d and the Wayne-assisted \u201cChanged It,\u201d rounded out her four-song medley and saw the MC rapping-singing while rising on a pedestal, putting an exclamation point on the superstar-charged opener.\n\nMinaj is nominated for the Billboard Chart Achievement Award Presented by Xfinity, alongside Luke Bryan, The Chainsmokers, The Weeknd and Twenty One Pilots. She\u2019s had a busy 2017 already; in addition to the songs she performed to open the show, all of which have been released this year, she\u2019s also released the song \u201cChanged It\u201d with Wayne, as well as tracks alongside Gucci Mane (\u201cMake Love\u201d), Major Lazer (\u201cRun Up\u201d), DNCE (\u201cKissing Strangers\u201d) and Katy Perry (\u201cSwish Swish\u201d), with an album thought to be on the way this year.\n\nAnd in March, Nicki earned herself a piece of history when she passed the legendary Aretha Franklin for most Hot 100 appearances among women in the history of the chart with 76. Franklin (73), Taylor Swift (70), Rihanna (58) and Madonna (57) round out the top five.
