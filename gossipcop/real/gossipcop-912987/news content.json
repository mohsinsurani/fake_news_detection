(Kardashian West debuted her icy platinum hair back in September during New York Fashion Week.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so honored to be on the cover of Vogue Taiwan. The shoot was beyond glamorous, with my voluminous hair styled by Andrew Fitzsimons and makeup by Mario. Dennis Leupold was the photographer and it was so much fun to see his vision come to life,\u201d Kardashian West said on her website and app, where she shared behind-the-scenes photos from the shoot.\n\nHer Vogue portfolio also includes Spain (August 2015), Australia (June 2016 and February 2015) and U.S. (April 2014) issues.\n\nLooking for more style content?

To promote the latest business venture, the star mailed out boxes filled with a large, hollow chocolate heart made by Chef Chris Ford (with the fragrance stashed inside) to special people in her life. Each recipient was mailed a box filled with one of the three new scents: BFF, Bae and Ride or Die.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Calls Paris Hilton \u2018the OG\u2019 as the Heiress Becomes Her Clone For Yeezy Campaign\n\nIn November, Kardashian West launched her fragrance empire with three different perfumes: Crystal Gardenia, Crystal Gardenia Citrus and Crystal Gardenia Oud.\n\nThe announcement of her Vogue Taiwan cover comes three weeks after Kim and husband Kanye West announced the birth of their third child, daughter Chicago via surrogate.\n\nThe couple is already parents to 4\u00bd-year-old daughter North and 2-year-old son Saint.", "images":
