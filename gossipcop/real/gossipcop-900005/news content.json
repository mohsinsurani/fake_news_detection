So she\u2019s out,\u201d an insider told Page Six on July 11.\n\nBlogger Tamara Tattles is also confirming the same thing, stating Kenya was unwilling to sign a contract for a part-time role and that Bravo refused to budge. Due to this, the July 9 deadline that Bravo gave Kenya to sign her contract for a smaller role on the show came and went, and it is now a done deal that Kenya will not appear on RHOA\u2019s upcoming season in any capacity.\n\nKenya\u2019s hostility with RHOA\u2019s producers began after she secretly eloped and married her husband Marc Daly without informing Bravo. Since then, Kenya\u2019s husband has been hesitant to film for the show, only appearing in one scene last season, which led to producers being frustrated.\n\nTamara adds that Marlo Hampton and Shamari DeVoe are currently in the running to replace Kenya, while earlier reports confirmed Eva Marcille will be Sheree Whitfield\u2019s replacement for season 11. If you recall, Sheree was fired immediately following last season.\n\nAt the end of last month, the cast of RHOA assembled in Miami for a filming session at the opening of NeNe Leakes\u2018 boutique without Kenya. A short time later, Kenya said she hadn\u2019t been fired and claimed to be \u201creviewing [her] latest offer.\u201d She also suggested she and husband Marc were getting their own show.\n\nIn the past, Kenya was quick to shoot down these reports but she is staying mum this time, instead posting new photos of her baby bump just moments ago.\n\nKenya began appearing on the Bravo TV reality series during its fifth season and married Marc just before season 10. Then, at the end of season 10 earlier this year, Kenya confirmed she and Marc were expecting their first child together.\n\nPhoto Credit: Shutterstock", "images": ["https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/themes/soledad/images/penci-holder.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20516'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/feed-logo.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kenya-Moore-Update-e1527284101398.jpg"], "top_img": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kenya-Moore-Update-e1527284101398.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Cronin"], "canonical_link": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/07/12/its-official-kenya-moore-will-not-return-to-rhoa-for-new-season-more-details-revealed-about-her-firing-showdown-with-bravo/", "title": "Reason Bravo Fired Kenya Moore is Revealed!
