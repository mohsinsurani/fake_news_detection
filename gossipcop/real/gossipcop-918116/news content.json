The actor, who is nominated for Best Supporting Actor for his role in the drama Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, has already taken home a Golden Globe and a SAG Award this awards season (among other accolades) for his portrayal of emotionally disturbed police officer Jason Dixon. And his partner of 10 years, Leslie Bibb, has been cheering alongside him the whole time.\n\nMichael Fisher/Instagram\n\nRockwell, 49, decided to thank his longtime love for all her support by wearing a pair of custom David Yurman \u201cLeslie Bibb\u201d cufflinks to complement his Prada tuxedo and Christian Louboutin shoes on the Oscars red carpet. According to David Yurman, the custom pieces cost about $5,500 and took a month to make. His glamorous date selected a J. Mendel gown and Neil Lane Jewelry.\n\n\u201cPrada has been supportive of Sam and Three Billboards from the very beginning,\u201d Rockwell\u2019s stylist Michael Fisher told PEOPLE. \u201cSam is a method actor and in a lot of ways, Miuccia is a method designer. I found that there was a shared aesthetic in how they both approach their crafts. It was very obvious to me that Prada and Sam would be a good match.\u201d\n\nFisher added that Sam is \u201c100 percent involved\u201d and has \u201cfinal say\u201d on everything he wears.\n\nHe also made sure to coordinate his look with Bibb.\n\n\u201cLeslie works with [stylist] Jeanann Williams, we would text images from our fittings to make sure Sam and Leslie were in in-sync,\u201d says Fisher. \u201cIt was very important for all involved that they complemented each other.\u201d\n\nJason Merritt/Getty Images; Samir Hussein/WireImage; FREDERIC J. BROWN/AFP/Getty Images)\n\nThe couple\u2019s sweet PDA-filled red carpet tour kicked off at the 2018 Golden Globes where Rockwell took home the best supporting actor statue for his performance. And Bibb could not have been more excited.\n\n\u201cI could have strangled him,\u201d Bibb, 43, said of her reaction to his big win. \u201cI hugged him so hard. I was crying, I was all of it. I just didn\u2019t expect them to say his name! It\u2019s so long coming for Sam, so it\u2019s really special to be here. \u2026 I hope the same thing happens tonight.\u201d\n\nAt the 2018 Screen Actors Guild Awards the pair revealed the secret to making their love last: \u201cCommunication and good sex,\u201d Rockwell told E! News host Giuliana Rancic.\n\n\u201cAnd a healthy sense of humor!\u201d Bibb added about keeping the spark in their romance.\n\nRockwell won the SAG Award for outstanding performance by a male actor in a supporting role for Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and thanked his \u201cbeloved\u201d partner Bibb \u201cwho puts up with me. I love you baby, I love you.\u201d\n\nThe 90th Oscars will be held on Sunday, March 4, 2018, at the Dolby Theatre at Hollywood & Highland Center in Hollywood, and will be broadcast live on the ABC Television Network at 8 p.m. ET/5 p.m. PT.", "images":
