She\u2019s so sweet and mature. I\u2019m so proud of her. I\u2019ve known her since she was born. She\u2019s a very smart girl.\u201d\n\nAs for whether Hilton thinks Disick is \u201cthe one\u201d for Richie, the Simple Life alum added: \u201cI can\u2019t comment on that, but she\u2019s beautiful, she\u2019s successful, she\u2019s killing it and I\u2019m so proud of her. So I always wish her the best.\u201d\n\nRichie and Disick began dating in 2017 following the reality star\u2019s split from ex Kourtney Kardashian, with whom he shares three kids, Mason, 8, Penelope, 6, and Reign, 3.\n\nThe Tommy Hilfiger model opened up about what makes their relationship work in an interview last month.\n\n\u201cWe are best friends and that is mainly the strongest connection we have,\u201d told Australia\u2019s Sydney Morning Herald. \u201cWe have always had that best friend connection and from there it has really worked out. I am so happy.\u201d\n\nReporting by Taylor Ferber", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scott-disick-sofia-richie-PDA.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C1946px%2C1022px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scott-disick-sofia-richie-PDA.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C1946px%2C1022px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scott-disick-sofia-richie-pack-on-the-pda-at-gallery-opening/", "title": "Scott Disick, Sofia Richie Pack on the PDA at Gallery Opening", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Scott Disick and Sofia Richie spent a date night together in West Hollywood on Thursday, October 11, and an insider tells Us Weekly that the two 'have a cute and effortless rapport' \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scott Disick, Sofia Richie Pack on the PDA During Date Night", "description": "Scott Disick and Sofia Richie spent a date night together in West Hollywood on Thursday, October 11, and an insider tells Us Weekly that the two 'have a cute and effortless rapport' \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scott-disick-sofia-richie-pack-on-the-pda-at-gallery-opening/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2019-01-09T17:52:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scott-disick-sofia-richie-PDA.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C1946px%2C1022px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scott-disick-sofia-richie-PDA.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C1946px%2C1022px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-10-12T19:11:11+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-01-09T17:52:55+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Scott Disick, Sofia Richie Pack on the PDA During Date Night", "description": "Scott Disick and Sofia Richie spent a date night together in West Hollywood on Thursday, October 11, and an insider tells Us Weekly that the two 'have a cute and effortless rapport' \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/scott-disick-sofia-richie-PDA.jpg?crop=2px%2C0px%2C1946px%2C1022px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539371471.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
