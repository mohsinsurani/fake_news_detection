However, she is taking \"the classier route\" when it comes to not responding to online haters.\n\n\"I feel like the more I share, the more relatable I am,\" she tells Us Weekly. \"I don't care how somebody looks at me or their feelings. I know how I am. I know how I treat my friends and family and kids and that's all I'm worried about.\"\n\n\"You have some people that's weak and you have some people that's strong,\" she adds. \"I consider myself a very strong person.\"\n\nChyna later opens up about her kids -- 4-year-old King, whom she shares with rapper Tyga, and 8-month-old Dream, whom she shares with Kardashian -- and says the two are doing just fine.\n\n\"King is like me; he's really strong,\" she shares. \"If he wants something, he'll demand it. He has really good common sense, and I see that in myself. He likes to figure out things.\"\n\nAs for Dream, she describes her as \"a really, really happy baby.\"\n\nAnd when it comes to having kids, Chyna isn't done yet.\n\n\"I wanna have maybe like two more,\" she shares. \"I wouldn't mind having four; I think four is a good number. No more after that. Five is too many. I'd have to get a minivan for sure, and I'm not riding in no minivan.\"\n\nWATCH: Blac Chyna Is 'Devastated' Over Rob Kardashian's Alleged 'Revenge Porn' -- 'I Felt Betrayed'\n\nDespite the restraining order, Chyna plans to share custody of Dream with Kardashian. In ET's exclusive interview with her attorney, Lisa Bloom, Bloom noted that her client isn't worried about Kardashian's parenting skills.\n\n\n\n\"Chyna is not concerned about Dream being around Rob,\" Bloom said. \"She has said he's a good father, there are nannies around when the baby is with him and she hasn't had any reason to be concerned. We did not ask for the baby to be part of the restraining order\u2026 We just want him to stay away from her and to stop cyberbullying her.\"\n\nWatch below:", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-08/GettyImages-1240426139.jpg?h=05c564aa&itok=Dkqb34Us", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_blac_chyna_GettyImages-800824674.jpg?itok=UGgk_xyj", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%2011.17.16%20AM.png?h=22ea39b5&itok=NjZh8lt3", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-07/1280_blac_chyna_GettyImages-800824674.jpg?itok=JVVN7ZOG"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_blac_chyna_GettyImages-800824674.jpg?itok=UGgk_xyj", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Antoinette Bueno"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/221362_blac_chyna_describes_her_ideal_partner_after_rob_kardashian_drama", "title": "Blac Chyna Describes Her Ideal Partner After Rob Kardashian Drama: I Want a 'Confident' and 'Healthy' Man", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "Blac Chyna Describes Her Ideal Partner After Rob Kardashian Drama: I Want a 'Confident' and 'Healthy' Man", "keywords": "News, Blac Chyna, Rob Kardashian", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/221362_blac_chyna_describes_her_ideal_partner_after_rob_kardashian_drama", "title": "Blac Chyna Describes Her Ideal Partner After Rob Kardashian Drama: I Want a 'Confident' and 'Healthy' Man", "description": "Blac Chyna Describes Her Ideal Partner After Rob Kardashian Drama: I Want a 'Confident' and 'Healthy' Man", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_blac_chyna_GettyImages-800824674.jpg?itok=UGgk_xyj", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Blac Chyna Describes Her Ideal Partner After Rob Kardashian Drama: I Want a 'Confident' and 'Healthy' Man", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Blac Chyna Describes Her Ideal Partner After Rob Kardashian Drama: I Want a 'Confident' and 'Healthy' Man", "creator": "Antoinette Bueno", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/221362_blac_chyna_describes_her_ideal_partner_after_rob_kardashian_drama", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_blac_chyna_GettyImages-800824674.jpg?itok=UGgk_xyj"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
