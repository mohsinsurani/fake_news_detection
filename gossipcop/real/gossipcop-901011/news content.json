{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/the-office-where-are-they-now/", "text": "B.J. Novak was another cast member to pull double duty as actor and member of the writing staff. He portrayed Ryan Howard, the sleazy office intern who maintained a toxic relationship with Kelly Kapoor. Prior to The Office, Novak was a comedian, perhaps best known for his time as one of Ashton Kutcher's sidekicks on the prank show Punk'd. Novak has continued to act in films like Inglourious Basterds, The Amazing Spider-Man, and Saving Mr. Banks, where he portrayed one of the Sherman brothers. He has also appeared on television shows including The Newsroom and Kaling's The Mindy Project. However, Novak has focused more on writing and business ventures since his time on the show, releasing a collection of short stories titled One More Thing: Stories and Other Stories, launching the now-defunct The List App, creating the Hulu anthology series The Premise, and writing, directing and starring in the 2022 film Vengeance.", "images":
