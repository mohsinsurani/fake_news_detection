What he actually meant to typw was \"coverage\" but by this morning the word was trending on Twitter in South Africa and has basically been trending all day, even on Google.\n\nOn the search engine, the top search was \"covfefe meaning\" followed by \"what is a covfefe?\" Luckily, the internet is always ready with the answers. The new urban dictionary definition reads: \"(n.) When you want to say \"coverage\" but your hands are too small to hit all the letters on your keyboard.\"\n\nThe Merriam-Webster dictionary also trolled Trump this morning with this tweet. Looks like they missed the whole thing.\n\nWakes up.\n\nChecks Twitter.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nUh...\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\n\ud83d\udcc8 Lookups fo...\n\n.\n\n.\n\n.\n\nRegrets checking Twitter.\n\nGoes back to bed. May 31, 2017\n\nSo there we have it, folks, maybe \"covfefe\" will follow the suit of words like \"bootylicious\" that ended up in the Oxford English Dictionary too. Or not.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/https://za.effectivemeasure.net/em_image", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.huffingtonpost.co.za/assets-h9123f4623c22b92d206a8a25e690ec6d/logos/hp_mobile.svg?h=a34390f6b169670e72bef2a4a3a0eccc", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/3e5628ce7fff2b539730bb10adc21711/205326600/Screen+Shot+2017-05-31+at+3.17.32+PM.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.huffingtonpost.co.za/assets-h9123f4623c22b92d206a8a25e690ec6d/images/highlight.gif?h=b20e6b166b1cca0e866db64bb3febc56", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/http://secure.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=f2&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/251x131+0+31/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fbd3c7677f1ddc2d571f833be253aa39f%2F205326639%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2017-05-31%2Bat%2B3.17.32%2BPM.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6723616&c3=&c4=&c5=south-africa&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.huffingtonpost.co.za/assets-h9123f4623c22b92d206a8a25e690ec6d/images/logos/HuffPost.svg?h=72d269dc9640d315c46662b8b9648af4", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/http://www.blogsmithmedia.com/www.huffingtonpost.co.za/assets-h9123f4623c22b92d206a8a25e690ec6d/images/icons/newsletter-toaster.png?h=492dcc7d4a60d293f00eb28f73829add"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/251x131+0+31/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fbd3c7677f1ddc2d571f833be253aa39f%2F205326639%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2017-05-31%2Bat%2B3.17.32%2BPM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shandukani Mulaudzi", "Engagement Editor", "Huffpost South Africa"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/05/31/donald-trumps-covfefe-typo-is-now-officially-a-word-and-th_a_22119189/", "title": "Donald Trump's 'Covfefe' Typo Is Now Officially A Word -- And The Definition Will Have You In Stitches", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The urban dictionary came up with a meaning for the late-night typo.", "og": {"type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731im_/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/251x131+0+31/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fbd3c7677f1ddc2d571f833be253aa39f%2F205326639%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2017-05-31%2Bat%2B3.17.32%2BPM.png", "site_name": "Huffington Post South Africa", "title": "Donald Trump's 'Covfefe' Typo Is Now Officially A Word -- And The Definition Will Have You In Stitches", "description": "The urban dictionary came up with a meaning for the late-night typo.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170604014731/http://www.huffingtonpost.co.za/2017/05/31/donald-trumps-covfefe-typo-is-now-officially-a-word-and-th_a_22119189/", "app_id": 309438326081685}, "fb": {"app_id": 309438326081685, "pages": 1215255121868394}, "twitter": {"site": "HuffPostSA", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Donald Trump's 'Covfefe' Typo Is Now Officially A Word -- And The Definition Will Have You In Stitches", "image": "https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/crop/251x131+0+31/resize/1200x630!/format/jpg/quality/85/http%3A%2F%2Fo.aolcdn.com%2Fhss%2Fstorage%2Fmidas%2Fbd3c7677f1ddc2d571f833be253aa39f%2F205326639%2FScreen%2BShot%2B2017-05-31%2Bat%2B3.17.32%2BPM.png", "description": "The urban dictionary came up with a meaning for the late-night typo."}, "robots": "noodp,noydir", "keywords": "covfefe,Donald Trump,Entertainment,twitter,typo", "article": {"section": "Entertainment"}, "can-recommend": "true", "taboola.category": "entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496185200.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
