Everybody\u2019s doing it, all the time. I mean, we all got here. It\u2019s funny how conservative [the other ladies appear] when you know they ain\u2019t. Come on, now!\u201d\n\nAlthough her co-stars may act prudish on the show, Erika suspects Lisa Vanderpump is actually a \u201ccloset freak.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen I see Lisa\u2019s constant sexual innuendos and jabs, I\u2019m like, what\u2019s really going on?\u201d she joked.\n\nEarlier this year, Lisa spoke to Stassi Schroeder about her bedroom antics and seemingly confirmed Erika\u2019s suspicions.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s nothing I haven\u2019t tried,\u201d Lisa told Stassi on Straight Up With Stassi. \u201cKen\u2019s a very sexy man. Ken knows what he\u2019s doing. Ken\u2019s got it going on and he\u2019s a very virile man. Very. Like a little too much!\u201d\n\nPhoto Credit: Instagram\n\nTELL US \u2013 THOUGHT ON ERIKA\u2019S COMMENTS?
