They can steal your belongings but they can\u2019t steal your memories or your love.\u201d\n\nMauricio Umansky/Instagram\n\nMauricio Umansky/Instagram\n\nThe couple\u2019s daughter, Sophia, also shared a photo of herself hugging her parents with the caption, \u201c\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3d\ud83d\ude3dall that matters \ud83d\ude0d.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s home was burglarized while the two were on vacation in Aspen, Colorado, with their children, PEOPLE confirmed.\n\nOver $1 million dollars in jewelry, including $150,000 worth of watches owned by Umansky, was stolen from the property, according to TMZ, which first reported the news.\n\nMauricio Umansky/Instagram.\n\nThe break-in was discovered by a housekeeper, TMZ reported. The property was reportedly broken into via a window, and the home security system was not armed, though a closet sensor triggered by the burglars clocked the incident around 1:15 a.m. local time. Surveillance camera footage is being investigated to help nab culprits.\n\nThe Los Angeles Police Department told PEOPLE they have no information at this time. A representative for Richards did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nRichards, 48, and Umansky, 47, bought the property in October for $8.2 million, Realtor.com reported.\n\nThe former child star told PEOPLE at the RHOBH Season 8 premiere party on Dec. 15 that her family was still in the process of moving in and renovating the house.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s taking forever,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s probably like 50 workmen in my house a day, so it doesn\u2019t feel like a home yet. It\u2019s a house still. So I\u2019m waiting to make it my home.\u201d", "images":
