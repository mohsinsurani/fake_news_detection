WWE medical director Dr. Joseph Maroon has also cleared Bryan to return.\n\nThe announcement of Bryan's return opens up the door for a possible match at WrestleMania 34 on Sunday, April 8 in New Orleans.\n\nBig fan of WWE?

He even suggested that leaving WWE once his contract expired to pursue outside options was a viable likelihood as he believed other organizations would easily clear him to wrestle based on what his personal doctors' diagnoses.\n\nBryan, who is married to WWE superstar Brie Bella, has walked out the emotional fallout of his forced retirement in a very public manner through the WWE Network tribute documentary \"Thank You Daniel\" and the E! reality series \"Total Bellas.\" He has also been relentless in his search for medical clearance by undergoing constant testing and experimental procedures from a litany of doctors.\n\nInjuries have long been a theme in Bryan's unlikely rise from underdog independent wrestler to mainstream crowd favorite on the main event level. After dramatically winning the WWE world heavyweight championship following a pair of classic matches at WrestleMania 30 in 2014, a neck injury forced Bryan to relinquish the title and miss seven months of action.\n\nBryan went on to win the intercontinental title in a ladder match at WrestleMania 31 the following year but would have his final match just one month later on SmackDown when he teamed with John Cena to defeat Cesaro and Tyson Kidd. After being sidelined with head injuries, Bryan went on to experience post-concussion seizures that he originally hid from WWE only to reveal later on the urging of his wife.\n\nSubsequent tests showed a lesion on the front of Bryan's brain, which led to his decision to retire. Bryan, who went on to undergo hyperbaric oxygen therapy treatments over the past two years, has routinely claimed the damage to his brain has healed over time.\n\nBig fan of WWE?
