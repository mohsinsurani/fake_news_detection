Tank Top and Frolicked Gleefully in a Sea of Supermodels (opens in new tab). It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was Taylor Swift's annual Fourth of July party (opens in new tab). A soiree brimming with it-girls, bemused shirtless men flopping down slides (opens in new tab), and, you know, the usual suspects: Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss, Ed Sheeran, and...wait...Blake Lively?\n\nYou may not have seen her in the Squad Yearbook, but Blake and Tay actually go way back. It all started nine months ago, when Blake innocently Instagrammed this \"Bad Blood\" reference:\n\nNaturally (by which we mean totally inexplicably), the internet assumed Blake was throwing shade, which prompted her to claim that she owns a Taylor Swift Voo Doo Doll. Like, in a fun way.\n\nBasically, she was like, \"Are you there God? It's me, Blake,\" and Taylor was was like, \"yes, sweet summer child, I hath cometh.\"\n\nFlash-forward a few months, and Taylor meandered over to Australia where Blake was filming The Shallows. Their day of Kangaroo hijinks presumably went well, because Blake attended Taylor's 1989 World Tour and gazed upon other Squad Members. She saw the future, friends, and it was rich and bountiful. \"So it's gonna be forever,\" Blake probably whispered to herself on that fated night. \"Or it's gonna go down in flames.\"\n\nWHEN @blakelively SHOWS UP AT @taylorswift13's #1989TourBrisbane SHOW. GOALS THOUGH. \ud83c\udf89 \ud83d\ude0d \ud83d\udc6fpic.twitter.com/YNEyxyRiM8December 5, 2015 See more\n\nAlso, this photo was taken:\n\nA few months later, it was Taylor's birthday. Being well versed in traveling pants-based friendship, Blake declared her love with this roller coaster picture. Note her apt use of the phrase \"goals.\" She knew, guys. SHE KNEW.\n\nBlake also sent Taylor a pie featuring her beloved cats in marzipan form. Of course, this *was* in her Preserve phase (opens in new tab), so she was especially crafty at the time.\n\nSo now we're here:\n\nAnd yeah, we're all Ryan Reynolds in this picture.\n\nFollow Marie Claire on F (opens in new tab)acebook (opens in new tab) for the latest celeb news, beauty tips, fascinating reads, livestream video, and more.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WftdyaD2QyL5Jn2ghQcLyb-1200-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/sCwa3889G4axYjtToZp2jh-415-80.jpg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/marieclaireus/missing-image.svg", "https://www.marieclaire.com/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WftdyaD2QyL5Jn2ghQcLyb-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mehera Bonner", "Entertainment Editor", "Gabrielle Ulubay", "Iris Goldsztajn", "The Editors", "Andrea Park", "Katherine J Igoe", "Bianca Rodriguez", "Neha Prakash", "Rachel Epstein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a21385/blake-lively-and-taylor-swift-friendship/", "title": "The True Story Behind Blake Lively and Taylor Swift's Friendship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2016-07-06T10:03:57+00:00", "description": "A tale of traveling pants and shade.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/l0uowirhzd1627591128.svg", "og": {"site_name": "Marie Claire Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WftdyaD2QyL5Jn2ghQcLyb-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "title": "The True Story Behind Blake Lively and Taylor Swift's Friendship", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a21385/blake-lively-and-taylor-swift-friendship/", "description": "A tale of traveling pants and shade."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire", "published_time": "2016-07-06T10:03:57Z", "modified_time": "2016-07-06T10:03:57.076Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "L93cJvFRB3Zm7jjq6HzECg", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-07-06T10:03:57Z", "parsely-title": "The True Story Behind Blake Lively and Taylor Swift's Friendship", "parsely-link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a21385/blake-lively-and-taylor-swift-friendship/", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WftdyaD2QyL5Jn2ghQcLyb.jpg", "parsely-section": "Celebrity", "parsely-tags": "Category: Celebrity,Category: News,celebrity,standard-article,serversidehawk", "parsely-author": "Mehera Bonner", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@marieclaireus", "title": "The True Story Behind Blake Lively and Taylor Swift's Friendship", "description": "A tale of traveling pants and shade.", "creator": "@marieclaireus", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/WftdyaD2QyL5Jn2ghQcLyb-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 15469402}, "google-site-verification": "G8uYPAX70T_vfdmDhxnUNSykxtjRTkSvHhloGBWT6R8", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/news/a21385/blake-lively-and-taylor-swift-friendship/"}, "botify-site-verification": "gEo2ltw4ZxjJkBcaADHlIGePpMrucY2w", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1467799437.0, "source": "https://www.marieclaire.com", "summary": ""}
