It\u2019s the A-list ladies wearing them \u2014 and the men by their sides! So many couples look adorable at the 92nd annual awards on February 9, 2020, but two of our favorites were Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos and Tom Hanks and Rita Wilson. Both sets of couples have seen many red carpets together, yet they still continue to crush it.\n\nWhether they\u2019re still crazy in love, \u00e0 la Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z, or no longer together (RIP #Brangelina), they\u2019ll always have Academy Awards photo archives. Without further ado, keep scrolling to see the most iconic Oscars couples of all time!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-a07f3412-2090-48e4-ac87-e9d0d5497070.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/promo-4dcc9565-e981-47f8-a4e3-29b974f28f6c.jpg?w=1600&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-a07f3412-2090-48e4-ac87-e9d0d5497070.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Rose"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/most-iconic-oscars-couples-on-the-red-carpet-through-the-years-w467848/", "title": "Most Iconic Oscars Couples on the Red Carpet Through the Years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "gallery", "post-tags": "Celebrity Style,Love Lives,Oscars,Red Carpet Looks,stylish", "post-cats": "Stylish", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "From Elizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, relive the most iconic Oscars red carpet couples of all time!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Most Iconic Oscars Couples of All Time", "description": "From Elizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, relive the most iconic Oscars red carpet couples of all time!", "url": "/stylish/pictures/most-iconic-oscars-couples-on-the-red-carpet-through-the-years-w467848/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2022-02-04T20:35:59+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-a07f3412-2090-48e4-ac87-e9d0d5497070.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-a07f3412-2090-48e4-ac87-e9d0d5497070.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2020-02-10T21:30:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-02-04T20:35:59+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Most Iconic Oscars Couples of All Time", "description": "From Elizabeth Taylor and Eddie Fisher to Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt, relive the most iconic Oscars red carpet couples of all time!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/chrissy-teigen-john-legend-a07f3412-2090-48e4-ac87-e9d0d5497070.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1581370205.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
