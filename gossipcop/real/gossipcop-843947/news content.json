Cooper was so committed to the project that he logged hundreds of hours learning to play the guitar and sing well enough to perform at Coachella and Glastonbury without being booed offstage. He analyzed his dreams, re-purposing certain images and ideas for art. He used his own pain and addiction\u2014which he has been reluctant to discuss in interviews\u2014to anchor his heart-aching role as an addict who, in spite of his artistic talent, is broken inside. He spent hours interviewing Lady Gaga with his co-writer Eric Roth to ensure that her character, Ally, was authentic to Gaga\u2019s own struggles. He filled his cast with people who meant something special to him\u2014including his own ear doctor! He incorporated subtle, sweet homages to previous versions of Hollywood\u2019s favorite love story. As Taffy Brodesser-Akner wrote for The New York Times, \u201cEvery detail of [the film] comes from a true thing\u2014something he\u2019s learned, something he\u2019s seen, something he knows for sure.\u201d\n\nAs a public service to better understand Cooper and his magnum opus, we compiled some of the Easter eggs, homages, and Bradley-isms that the star-slash-director lovingly planted in his version of A Star Is Born. To paraphrase the \u201cShallow\u201d lyrics belted out by Cooper\u2019s Jackson and Gaga\u2019s Ally at a stadium mic: we\u2019re off the deep end; watch as we dive in.\n\nA Judy Garland Homage\n\nGarland\u2019s starring role in 1954\u2019s A Star Is Born earned her an Oscar nomination. And in the early moments of Cooper\u2019s remake, Lady Gaga pays subtle tribute to her predecessor by humming \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d It is during this riff that the movie\u2019s title appears in klieg lights\u2014an aesthetic nod to the remakes before it.\n\nThe Drag-Bar Significance\n\nEach A Star Is Born features a different meet-cute for its lead characters. After Gaga told Cooper about her early days performing in drag bars in Manhattan\u2019s Lower East Side, Cooper decided to set the couple\u2019s consequential meeting at a drag bar\u2014a kind of tribute to his leading lady\u2019s early days and her gay fan base. As Gaga said at the Toronto Film Festival, \u201cI make a joke sometimes: behind every female icon is a gay man. I really wouldn\u2019t be here without the gay community, what they have taught me about love and acceptance and bravery.\u201d\n\nCooper also took Gaga up on her casting suggestions for drag-bar performers, including Willam Belli and D.J. \u201cShangela\u201d Pierce. Belli told Bustle that Cooper entrusted them to improv their scenes, saying, \u201cYou guys know what goes on in a drag dressing room better than me, do your thing.\u2019 He just let me go off and do a bunch of jokes.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Playlist, Cooper was so pleased with Belli and Pierce\u2019s work\u2014their scenes are hilarious and heartwarming\u2014that he convinced them to return to set and film more than what was originally scripted. One such bonus scene features Jackson\u2014while waiting for Gaga to change clothes\u2014performing for Shangela as she counts out her money after the bar has closed.\n\nEyebrows: A Brief History\n\nEyebrows have had a bit part in every iteration of A Star Is Born. In the 1937 original, for example, Janet Gaynor\u2019s character gets an elaborate studio makeover\u2014in which they paint on obnoxious eyebrows before a screen test.", "images":
