As it turns out, I spent half an hour trying to get mine in! By which time, I was so frustrated, I\u2019d lost the mood.\u201d \u2013 Selena, Homemaker\u200b\n\n\u201cHe vomited on my rented gown and I spent all night trying to clean stuff off the beading and sequins.\u201d \u2013 Winnie, PR Manager\n\n\u201cWe\u2019d knelt down so many times for the tea ceremony (See also: 6 significant Chinese wedding traditions couples need to know) that our knees and thighs were sore. In the night, although he tried his best, my husband just couldn\u2019t support himself with his knees and thighs which were shivering with overstrain. So we ended up in a sitting position, which worked out pretty well too.\u201d \u2013 Tin Li, Civil Servant\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\u201cHe took ages in the bathroom and when he finally emerged, it was obvious he\u2019d been busy with a \u2018warm-up\u2019 to prevent being overly aroused and ending our first night experience prematurely. In my nervousness I blurted, \u2018oh are you down?'\u201d \u2013 Shirlyn, Events Planner\n\nphoto: 123rf\n\n\u201cGreat wedding night sex? What sex?

Somehow, the laces got stuck and he couldn\u2019t undo me. We had to call my mum to help. She couldn\u2019t undo the corset either and called my dad. He couldn\u2019t bring himself to do it so he called my aunt and she joined the gang in trying to unlace me, which she succeeded. Then they all trooped out noisily, and I thought things couldn\u2019t get more embarrassing until mum turned at the door and said kindly, \u2018If you need any more help, just call.\u2019 So not!\u201d \u2013 Sylvia, Dealer\n\nSee also: WEDDING REGRETS! 11 BRIDES SHARE THE BIG DAY MISTAKES TO AVOID\n\n\u201cWe were mucking around with him pretending to tear off my wedding dress\u2026 and he accidentally did!

We had our wedding in a country club and he was too tired to drive out to \u2018civilisation\u2019 to buy.\u201d \u2013 Jenny, Teacher\n\nvia GIPHY\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say getting your period on your wedding night is a big turn-off for grooms. I couldn\u2019t believe it happened just as he was showing me how creative he could get with his mouth. He thought I was getting aroused but I realised that it was my period and got up to go to the bathroom, only to be overtaken by him rushing for the sink to spit, gargle and brush his teeth!\u201d -Shauna, Pharmaceutical Representative\n\nSee also: 7 WAYS NEWLYWEDS CAN KEEP THE HONEYMOON BLISS GOING AFTER THE WEDDING", "images": ["https://media.herworld.com/public/2019/09/image/wedding_night_blunders.jpg", "https://www.herworld.com/wp-content/plugins/gumlet/assets/images/pixel.png"], "top_img": "https://media.herworld.com/public/2019/09/image/wedding_night_blunders.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Felicia Tan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.herworld.com/weddings/real-weddings/wedding-night-blunders-brides-confess/", "title": "Wedding night blunders \u2013 10 brides confess", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Wedding night blunders! 10 brides confess", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Wedding night blunders - 10 brides confess", "description": "Embarrassing moments from real couples on their first night as newlyweds!", "url": "https://www.herworld.com/weddings/real-weddings/wedding-night-blunders-brides-confess/", "site_name": "Her World Singapore", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.herworld.com/public/2019/09/image/wedding_night_blunders.jpg", "width": 900, "height": 560, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/sg.Herworld", "published_time": "2019-09-27T09:20:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@herworldsg", "site": "@herworldsg", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "3 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.herworld.com/public/2020/01/hw-favicon.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1569576054.0, "source": "https://www.herworld.com", "summary": ""}
