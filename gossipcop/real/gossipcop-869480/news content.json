In the story, Pitt talked about the circumstances surrounding the divorce, admitting that he had quit drinking and was working toward becoming a better man. By nearly all accounts, the Michael Paterniti-penned profile was great for Pitt, who had taken a significant hit to his image with tabloid and TMZ reports of an alleged altercation on a private plane between Pitt and their son Maddox.\n\nJolie has kept quiet until now.\n\nToday, Vanity Fair published a cover story featuring the 42-year-old actress, filmmaker, humanitarian and mother of six. For the profile, titled \u201cAngelina Jolie Solo,\u201d she sat down with longtime Vanity Fair contributing editor Evgenia Peretz and posed for photographer duo Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott after being styled by Jessica Diehl. Vanity Fair has been something of a go-to for Jolie. She\u2019s been featured on multiple covers through the years, all with revelatory and intimate interviews. This new one is no different. Below are a few highlights.\n\nRumors\n\nJolie swatted down talk that the couple\u2019s globe-trotting lifestyle got in the way of their marriage. \u201c[Our lifestyle] was not in any way a negative,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was not the problem. That is and will remain one of the wonderful opportunities we are able to give our children \u2026 They\u2019re six very strong-minded, thoughtful, worldly individuals. I\u2019m very proud of them. \u2026 They\u2019ve been very brave. They were very brave.\u201d As for the family unit, Jolie contends that everyone is on the upswing, though she prefers to keep it vague. \u201cWe\u2019re all just healing from the events that led to the filing \u2026 They\u2019re not healing from divorce. They\u2019re healing from some \u2026 from life, from things in life.\u201d\n\nEmotions\n\n\u201cI was very worried about my mother, growing up \u2014 a lot. I do not want my children to be worried about me. I think it\u2019s very important to cry in the shower and not in front of them. They need to know that everything\u2019s going to be all right even when you\u2019re not sure it is.\u201d As for her relationship with Pitt and whether they\u2019re able to communicate now, she offers: \u201cWe care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\u201d\n\nHome\n\nShe recently settled into a new home, the 11,000-square-foot estate once owned by Cecil B. DeMille. It was listed for $25 million and features six bedrooms and 10 bathrooms. \u201cIt\u2019s just been the hardest time, and we\u2019re just kind of coming up for air. [This house] is a big jump forward for us, and we\u2019re all trying to do our best to heal our family,\u201d she says of the purchase and how it fits into this year\u2019s most talked about celebrity story.\n\nHealth\n\nJolie, who suffers from hypertension, reveals that she had developed Bell\u2019s palsy, a condition that causes one side of the face to droop as a result to damage to the facial nerves. She fully recovered thanks to acupuncture, she tells the mag. Of the scare, she notes, \u201cSometimes women in families put themselves last \u2026 until it manifests itself in their own health.\u201d The 42-year-old also opens up about finding more gray hairs. \u201cI can\u2019t tell if it\u2019s menopause or if it\u2019s just been the year I\u2019ve had,\u201d she says. \u201cI actually feel more of a woman because I feel like I\u2019m being smart about my choices, and I\u2019m putting my family first, and I\u2019m in charge of my life and my health. I think that\u2019s what makes a woman complete.\u201d\n\nFilm\n\nJolie\u2019s next project, which was recently announced to be in the lineup at this fall\u2019s Toronto International Film Festival, is the adaptation of First They Killed My Father, Loung Ung\u2019s 2000 memoir of the Khmer Rouge genocide. Shot in Cambodia and presented in the Khmer language, the film is a Netflix original. Maddox, along with the rest of the brood, had active roles on set.\n\nFamily\n\nJolie has long had a challenged relationship with her father, actor Jon Voight. The two have been estranged for some time, but she has recently welcomed him back into her life. \u201cHe\u2019s been very good at understanding they needed their grandfather at this time,\u201d Jolie explains. \u201cI had to do a therapy meeting last night and he was just around. He knows kind of the rule \u2014 don\u2019t make them play with you. Just be a cool grandpa who\u2019s creative, and hang out and tell stories and read a book in the library.\u201d\n\nFriends\n\nThe source of inspiration for her new movie, Ung, has also been her \u201csource of comfort,\u201d Peretz writes. \u201cShe\u2019s that girlfriend who rolled up her sleeves, got on a plane, and helped me on Christmas morning,\u201d says Jolie, who co-wrote the screenplay with her best pal. \u201cShe\u2019s been my closest friend. I cried on her shoulder.\u201d\n\nFuture\n\nApart from promotional duties on the Netflix film, she\u2019s got nothing on her upcoming schedule work-wise. So she\u2019ll stay home and focus on the family. \u201cI\u2019m just wanting to make the proper breakfast and keep the house. That\u2019s my passion. At the request of my kids, I\u2019m taking cooking classes. As I go to sleep at night, I think, \u2018Did I do a great job as a mom or was that an average day?\u2019 \u201d she asks. Still, it seems that living a big life filled with globe-trotting travel and major work commitments isn\u2019t gone for good. \u201cI never woke up and thought, I really want to live a bold life. I just can\u2019t do the other. It\u2019s the same as I can\u2019t make a casserole. I cannot sit still,\u201d she admits. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying for nine months to be really good at just being a homemaker and picking up dog poop and cleaning dishes and reading bedtime stories. And I\u2019m getting better at all three. But now I need to get my boots on and go hang, take a trip.\u201d\n\nTo read the full story, click here.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/09_angelina_jolie_lo_no_txt_5_by_mert__marcus-embed.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2f60df89-67c3-4270-8d3f-2cd00f2aa418.png?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2f60df89-67c3-4270-8d3f-2cd00f2aa418.png?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Gardner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/angelina-jolie-talks-brad-pitt-bells-palsy-vanity-fair-cover-story-1024589/", "title": "Angelina Jolie Talks Brad Pitt, Bell\u2019s Palsy in \u2018Vanity Fair\u2019 Cover Story", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "On her relationship with Pitt, new 'Vanity Fair' cover star Jolie shares: \"We care for each other and care about our family, and we are both working towards the same goal.\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Chris Gardner", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1024589, "title": "Angelina Jolie Talks Brad Pitt, Bell's Palsy in 'Vanity Fair' Cover Story", "published_at": "2017-07-26 14:39:58", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/2f60df89-67c3-4270-8d3f-2cd00f2aa418.png?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "topics": "News", "body": "Now, it's Angelina Jolie's turn.\r\nIn May, Brad Pitt opened up to GQ Style in a bombshell of an interview, his first following a widely publicized and relatively nasty split from longtime partner Angelina Jolie.
