Are you crazy, woman?\u201d or \u201cDo you have veiny feet? Can I have a photo of them?\u201d (Answers: Yes, Probably, and YUCK\u2026)\n\nBefore I get around to answering that question (The \u201chow to walk in high heels\u201d one, I mean, not the veiny feet thing: I should probably point out at this point that although I get a lot of messages from foot fetishes, I\u2019m not one myself, so if you\u2019re thinking of commenting or messaging me about your fetish\u2026 just don\u2019t.), though, I want to quickly dispel some myths about what some would consider the black art of walking in high heels:\n\n01. Yes, it is totally possible to walk in heels without \u201ctottering\u201d.\n\nAlmost every piece of commentary I read about women in heels includes the word \u201ctottering\u201d \u2013 almost always used in a sneering fashion, to imply that women who wear heels always \u201ctotter\u201d and are never able to walk normally. Which is absolute rubbish, basically. Until I had my son, I wore heels constantly \u2013 for work, for play, and for everything in between. (And I\u2019ll also just quickly add that I didn\u2019t stop wearing them because having a baby made me unable to walk in them: I stopped partly because they were no longer practical for my lifestyle \u2013 I loved my heels, but not even I would wear them to a muddy playpark, or a soft-play centre \u2013 but also because styles changed, and heels started looking a little bit dated to me, really.) I did not \u201ctotter\u201d, and nor did any of my friends, who also used to wear high heels on the regular. Not all people totter in heels. Some people do, sure \u2013 that\u2019s why this article exists, after all. But to \u201ctotter\u201d is not inevitable if you want to wear heels, so, you know, please stop implying that it is.\n\n02. No, they\u2019re not always comfortable.\n\nOnce I\u2019ve been asked how on EARTH I walk in my heels, the next question is almost always \u201care they comfortable\u201d? Which never fails to make me smile, because, I mean, do they LOOK comfortable? The fact is, very high heels are not designed for comfort. They\u2019re just not. They\u2019re designed for style, and while some heels can be relatively comfortable, the key word here is \u201crelatively\u201d. They can be comfortable in comparison to other very high heels. They will never be \u201ccomfortable\u201d in comparison to slippers, say: or sneakers, or Birkenstocks, or whatever kind of shoes you consider \u201ccomfortable\u201d. So, you can learn to walk in heels just fine, but if it\u2019s comfort you\u2019re looking for, these are not the shoes for you. Like, you\u2019re never going to find yourself thinking, \u201cGod, my feet are killing me, I can\u2019t wait to slip into my stilettos\u201d, you know?\n\n03. It\u2019s not about sex.\n\nFinally, a lot of people make the assumption that women wear high heels primarily \u2013 or SOLELY \u2013 because they believed they appeal to men, and they want to look \u201csexy\u201d. While I\u2019m sure that\u2019s very much the case for SOME people, it\u2019s not the case for ALL of us. I, for instance, love heels because I have short legs, and heels make them look more in proportion to the rest of my body. I don\u2019t care what men think about them. (I mean, I don\u2019t particularly care what women think of them either, to be honest, but there\u2019s a certain kind of man who likes to go around saying things like, \u201cIf you girls only knew how much us men love a women in heels you\u2019d wear them all the time!\u201d and I just want to head those comments off at the pass, because, believe it or not, not everything women do revolves around men: imagine!\n\nAnd, with all of that said, here\u2019s everything I know about how to walk in high heels\u2026\n\n01.\n\nWork your way up\n\nIf you\u2019ve never worn heels on a regular basis, a pair of 6\u2033 stilettos probably isn\u2019t the best place to start. Instead, go for something mid-height, and, once you\u2019re used to walking in those, start to gradually work your way up. Thinking about it now, I reckon this is how I \u201clearned\u201d how to walk in high heels: I wasn\u2019t aware of it as a learning process at the time, but I know the heels I considered super-high as a teenager, say, would feel pretty low to me now, so I think I started small and moved up without really noticing.\n\n02.\n\nThe thicker the heel, the easier it is to walk on it\n\nIn general, the thinner the heel, the harder it\u2019ll be to balance on it, so when you\u2019re still getting used to walking in high heels, choose thicker, sturdier heels, which will give the foot more stability and give you more confidence.\n\n03.\n\nPlatform soles make high heels feel lower\n\nPlatform shoes might look crazily high, but they can actually be much easier to walk in than non-platforms, as the platform makes the heel feel shorter. A four-inch heel with a one-inch platform, for instance, will feel like you\u2019re walking on a three-inch heel, which is a lot more reasonable!\n\n04.\n\nWedges feel like flats, but look like heels\n\nIf you\u2019re really struggling to walk in high heels, wedges are your friends. Because of the extra arch support, and the fact that the sole of the shoe is completely flat, they\u2019ll give you height (sometimes a LOT of height) without forcing you to do much in the way of balancing. They\u2019re the most comfortable type of high heels to walk in, and also probably the easiest, so they make an excellent starting point if you can\u2019t walk in high heels, and want to learn.\n\n05.\n\nIf the shoe fits\u2026\n\n\u2026it\u2019ll be a whole lot easier to walk in. Fit is particularly important with heels, because if you\u2019re struggling just to keep them on your feet (or wincing in pain every time your foot hits the ground), you\u2019ll find it practically impossible to walk in them. In fact, shoes that are constantly slipping off your foot can actually be dangerous, because you run the risk of stepping right out of them, or going over on your ankle. It\u2019s almost too obvious to write down, but buy shoes that fit, and you\u2019ll find them much easier to wear. There\u2019s no substitute for shoes which fit perfectly, but if you\u2019re having issues with the heels slipping, you can buy heel grips to make them feel a little more secure.\n\n06.\n\nNever wear new shoes without breaking them in\n\nThis goes for ANY shoes, really (The worst blisters I\u2019ve had have all come from flats!), but if you can\u2019t walk in heels, it could be because you haven\u2019t worn them in properly. A lot of people swear by just wearing them around the house, or while you\u2019re doing the vacuuming or whatever \u2013 you might feel a bit like Freddie Mercury in the \u2018I Want to Break Free\u2019 video, but it\u2019ll help you get used to walking in heels and, well, there are worse people you could look like.\n\n07.\n\nPlace your heel on the ground first\n\nHigh heels don\u2019t just make you walk taller, they also force you to walk differently. In flats, sneakers or flip flops, your full foot hits the ground more or less at the same time. In heels, however \u2013 and particularly in very high heels \u2013 this method won\u2019t only feel uncomfortable and awkward, it\u2019ll look like that, too. Instead, you need to adapt the way you walk so that your heel comes into contact with the ground first, followed by the rest of the foot. This might take a bit of getting used to, which brings me to my next point\u2026\n\n08.\n\nPractice. Then practice some more.\n\nIf you\u2019re not used to walking in high heels, it\u2019ll feel very unnatural and awkward the first time you try it. And if you simply give up after that, and don\u2019t try again for a few months or years, it\u2019ll feel awkward and unnatural the NEXT time you try it, too\u2026 and the time after that, and the time after that. Practice is the key, and as silly as it might sound, you might find it useful to try to practice in front of a mirror (or get someone to film you, even): sometimes being able to see yourself walk will help you identify anything you\u2019re doing wrong, and work out what you need to change. I know a lot of people who think they can\u2019t walk in high heels because they\u2019ve tried it a couple of times, found it tricky, and given up. Obviously no one is born knowing how to walk in high heels \u2013 when you think about it, it\u2019s a really un-natural thing to do, so it makes sense that you might have to train yourself to do it!\n\n09.\n\nBaby steps\n\nI\u2019m not still talking about practising, or working your way up here, I mean literally take baby steps. Like it or not, you can\u2019t really stride or run in heels (well, you can, and once you know how to walk in high heels, running in them won\u2019t seem like a big deal, but you\u2019re probably going to want to wait until you\u2019ve mastered the \u201cwalking\u201d bit first!), and if you try to march along with your arms swinging by your sides, it might look a little bit unnatural. Again, being able to see yourself in a mirror will really help with this, and you should instantly be able to see what looks natural, and what doesn\u2019t. In general, though, try to take smaller, slower steps than you would in lower shoes and don\u2019t try to run before you can walk!\n\n10.\n\nRelax\n\nA lot of women have a tendency to hold themselves very stiffly when they\u2019re learning how to walk in high heels. This is partly because of the different way your body moves in heels (your might think your feet and legs are doing all the work, but your lower back and abdomen are working hard too, and are often the first places you\u2019ll feel the strain if you\u2019ve been overdoing it), of course, but it\u2019s also natural to stiffen up if you\u2019re feeling off-balance. Try to relax: not only will it look more natural, it\u2019ll also be more comfortable, and make you less likely to hurt yourself.\n\n11.\n\nRough up the soles\n\nOne of the biggest issues people have when learning how to walk in high heels is slippage: a lot of high heeled shoes have soles which are completely smooth, and don\u2019t offer any grip at all, and that makes them even harder to walk in than would otherwise be the case. (Because it really needs to be even harder, right?) This is particularly true of brand new shoes, and is one of the reasons I\u2019ve talked about breaking shoes in before you wear them: if the soles are slippy, however, wearing them around the house won\u2019t help \u2013 they really need to be worn outside for the sole to roughen up enough to make it easier to grip. If you don\u2019t want to wear your new heels outdoors quite yet, you can do it yourself by gently rubbing the soles with sandpaper (yes, really) or using scissors to carefully score the soles: if you\u2019re still worried, you can also buy stick-on soles which will give your shoes more grip.\n\n12.\n\nRemember not all high heels are created equal\n\nYou\u2019d think that if you can walk easily in one pair of heels, you\u2019ll be able to walk easily in them all, but that\u2019s not actually the case. What can look like tiny differences in the design of a shoe can make a huge difference to how it feels to wear it, and how easy it is to balance in it: I have some very high shoes, for instance, which are easier to walk in than shoes that are a bit lower \u2013 it\u2019s all down to the design, so just because the first pair of heels you try don\u2019t work for you, it doesn\u2019t mean you should give up: it might just mean you need to shop around a bit and find a pair that\u2019s more suited to your foot /step.\n\n13.\n\nRemember: you don\u2019t have to learn how to walk in high heels if you don\u2019t want to\n\nFor my final point (Which should possibly have been my first point, because it\u2019s an important one\u2026), I just want to make it clear that no one should feel like they HAVE to wear high heels. I\u2019ve written this post in order to (hopefully) help those who WANT to wear them, and who\u2019ve specifically asked how to walk in high heels, but if they\u2019re just not for you, then there\u2019s no reason in the world to force yourself to wear them. It also goes without saying that if you have foot, leg or back issues, or any other kind of physical issue that would make heel-wearing difficult or dangerous, for the love of shoes, don\u2019t wear them. Your feet are more important than any pair of shoes!\n\nWhat about you? Any tips on how to walk in high heels?
