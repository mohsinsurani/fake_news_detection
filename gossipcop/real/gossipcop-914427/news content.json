It just didn\u2019t work out.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly confirmed that Hale, 29, was dating her Life Sentence costar, 40, in February after they were spotted kissing on Valentine\u2019s Day. An eyewitness told Us at the time that the two were \u201cholding hands\u201d after a \u201cromantic\u201d meal.\n\nThe actress frequently shared photos with the Life Sentence cast, including Smith, on Instagram, but The CW announced in May that the drama would not be returning for a second season.\n\n\u201cI was emotionally attached to this story and to everyone involved so I\u2019m a little shell shocked right now, but I feel fortunate that we got to tell a beautiful story,\u201d Hale wrote at the time. \u201cSometimes things don\u2019t resonate with the audience, and shows just don\u2019t work but I\u2019m so proud of what we accomplished & for the experience I had. Life Sentence was a show that a lot of us needed, and I am beyond grateful for those who gave our show a chance.\u201d\n\nThe same day a source confirmed Hale and Smith\u2019s split, the actress was spotted holding hands with Rottman at a Starbucks in Studio City, California, according to photos obtained by Just Jared. A source close to the 34-year-old actor tells Us that the twosome are \u201chooking up,\u201d but it\u2019s \u201cnew.\u201d\n\nHale has previously been linked to musician Anthony Kalabretta and actors Graham Rogers, Chris Zylka and David Henrie.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lucy-Hale-and-Riley-Smith-Split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lucy-Hale-and-Riley-Smith-Split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lucy-Hale-and-Riley-Smith-Split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lucy-hale-riley-smith-split-is-she-dating-ryan-rottman/", "title": "Lucy Hale and Riley Smith Split \u2014 Is She Dating Ryan Rottman?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Lucy Hale and her \u2018Life Sentence\u2019 costar Riley Smith have split, a source confirms to Us Weekly, the same day she was spotted with actor Ryan Rottman \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lucy Hale and Riley Smith Split \u2014 Is She Dating Ryan Rottman?", "description": "Lucy Hale and her \u2018Life Sentence\u2019 costar Riley Smith have split, a source confirms to Us Weekly, the same day she was spotted with actor Ryan Rottman \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/lucy-hale-riley-smith-split-is-she-dating-ryan-rottman/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-05T18:43:20+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lucy-Hale-and-Riley-Smith-Split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lucy-Hale-and-Riley-Smith-Split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-02T21:51:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-05T18:43:20+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lucy Hale and Riley Smith Split \u2014 Is She Dating Ryan Rottman?", "description": "Lucy Hale and her \u2018Life Sentence\u2019 costar Riley Smith have split, a source confirms to Us Weekly, the same day she was spotted with actor Ryan Rottman \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Lucy-Hale-and-Riley-Smith-Split.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530568279.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
