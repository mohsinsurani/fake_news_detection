The Academy Award winner showed off pics of his twins with wife Amal while attending a Casamigos House of Friends Dinner at TAO in L.A. on Friday, June 8.\n\nThe Tomorrowland actor, 57, was casually dressed as he attended the party solo and sipped on a pineapple margarita at the event celebrating his tequila brand.\n\nStanding with pals including Casamigos cofounder and close friend Rande Gerber, Clooney pulled out his phone, which has a background photo of his kids, Ella and Alexander, who turned 1 on June 6.\n\n\u201cGeorge told a funny story about how he and Amal have to keep the toilet seat down for the twins\u2019 sake and then he started showing his friends photos of them,\u201d an eyewitness tells Us Weekly. \u201cGeorge teased that the babies are like models and he never has to show them how to pose because they do it so naturally. He seemed like the proudest parent and just couldn\u2019t stop showing photos and talking about how much he loves the kids.\u201d\n\nClooney\u2019s wife, 40, paid tribute to her husband\u2019s parenting skills when he was presented with an AFI Lifetime Achievement Award on Thursday, June 7. Taking the stage, the British lawyer gave a sweet speech, saying that the star \u201cis the person who has my complete admiration and also the person whose smile makes me melt every time.\u201d\n\nAddressing him directly, she added, \u201cMy love, what I have found with you is the great love I always hoped existed. And seeing you with our children, Ella and Alexander, is the greatest joy in my life.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Meldman-George-Clooney-Rande-Gerber-Casamigos-House-of-Friends-Dinner.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Meldman-George-Clooney-Rande-Gerber-Casamigos-House-of-Friends-Dinner.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Meldman-George-Clooney-Rande-Gerber-Casamigos-House-of-Friends-Dinner.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/george-clooney-shows-off-pics-of-his-twins-jokes-theyre-like-models/", "title": "George Clooney Shows Off Pics of His Twins, Jokes They\u2019re Like Models", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "George Clooney showed off pics of his twins with wife Amal and joked that they pose like models \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "George Clooney Shows Off Pics of His Twins, Jokes They're Like Models", "description": "George Clooney showed off pics of his twins with wife Amal and joked that they pose like models \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/george-clooney-shows-off-pics-of-his-twins-jokes-theyre-like-models/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-10T00:19:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Meldman-George-Clooney-Rande-Gerber-Casamigos-House-of-Friends-Dinner.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Meldman-George-Clooney-Rande-Gerber-Casamigos-House-of-Friends-Dinner.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-10T00:19:08+00:00"}, "author": "Kathy Campbell", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "George Clooney Shows Off Pics of His Twins, Jokes They're Like Models", "description": "George Clooney showed off pics of his twins with wife Amal and joked that they pose like models \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Mike-Meldman-George-Clooney-Rande-Gerber-Casamigos-House-of-Friends-Dinner.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528589948.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
