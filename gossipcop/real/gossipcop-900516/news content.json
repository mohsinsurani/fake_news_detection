Harry, 37, also said that the royal family \"literally cut me off financially\" following their Jan. 2020 announcement of stepping back.\n\nCampbell Addy for The Cut\n\nHowever, Prince Charles did see Harry and Meghan \u2014 as well as have a reunion with grandson Archie Harrison, 3, and a first meeting with granddaughter Lilibet Diana, 1 \u2014 when the family visited the U.K. in June for Queen Elizabeth's Platinum Jubilee celebration.\n\nFor more on Meghan Markle, listen below to our daily podcast PEOPLE Every Day.\n\n\"It was a fantastic visit. The prince was delighted to see his grandson and meet his granddaughter for the first time,\" a royal source said, adding that it was \"wonderful\" to have Harry and Meghan back in Britain.\n\n\"The Prince and the Duchess [of Cornwall] were absolutely thrilled to see them,\" the source continued, as Charles had not seen his grandson Archie \"for a bit of time.\"\n\n\"It was very special to have some time with him. He hadn't met Lilibet, his granddaughter, and so to meet her for the first time was very emotional \u2014 it was a wonderful thing,\" the source said.\n\nSpeaking about how they run Archewell together from a shared home office, Prince Harry said, \"Most people that I know and many of my family, they aren't able to work and live together. It's actually really weird because it'd seem like a lot of pressure. But it just feels natural and normal.\"\n\nWhen asked if there was room to heal the rifts with their families, Meghan told The Cut, \"I think forgiveness is really important. It takes a lot more energy to not forgive. But it takes a lot of effort to forgive. I've really made an active effort, especially knowing that I can say anything.\"\n\n\"I have a lot to say until I don't,\" she added. \"Do you like that? Sometimes, as they say, the silent part is still part of the song.\"\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex are returning to the U.K. next week for a series of charitable events. They will also travel to Germany to kick off next year's Invictus Games in Dusseldorf.\n\nMeghan and Prince Harry \"are delighted to visit with several charities close to their hearts in early September,\" a spokesperson for the couple said.\n\nIt's unclear if the couple will see members of the royal family during their visit.\n\nMeghan Markle and Prince Harry attending the Service of Thanksgiving for the Queen's Jubilee on June 3.

talk about my whole experience and make a choice not to.\"\n\nPressed ask to why she hadn't yet divulged more, Meghan said she was \"still healing.\"", "images":
