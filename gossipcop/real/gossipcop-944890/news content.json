The public father-son spat was ignited after the 55-year-old M\u00c3\u00b6tley Cr\u00c3\u00bce star shared a post with some strong opinions about his sons and their mother, Pamela Anderson.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t long before 22-year-old Brandon Lee fired back with his own response about Tommy\u2019s absence in his life, and posted a video of his father seemingly passed out and unconscious on the floor.\n\nRelated: Tommy Lee Didn\u2019t REALLY Quit Twitter After Fight With Son\n\nAlongside an image of him and his own father, Tommy initially wrote:\n\n\u201cHappy Father\u2019s Day fellas! I\u2019m not gonna sit here and post some fluffed up bullshit for the public to read\u2026. I\u2019m gonna be honest- Being a father ain\u2019t easy! I\u2019m so tired of the fake shit I keep seeing all over IG\u2026 let\u2019s get real: It\u2019s a rollercoaster ok? My father taught me to respect everyone and everything and to take care of those that I loved. He taught me to appreciate my possessions, and to be grateful for the things I was given. I\u2019ve fucked up at times but I\u2019ve always bounced back. When I had a child, my first child, I wanted to instill those same virtues into him. Sometimes I feel like I failed as a father, because my kids don\u2019t know the value of things. If they break something, they don\u2019t care because they know they\u2019ll just get a new one, if they hurt someone, they don\u2019t care because so many people tell them it\u2019s OK. I never wanted this for my kids. I know I\u2019m not fully to blame, because their mom has a lot to do with it, enabling bad behavior and buying them things when they weren\u2019t good, but I guess I hoped at the end of the day they would end up kind. I love them dearly, don\u2019t get me wrong, but man, sometimes it\u2019s really tough to watch your kids grow up without those morals. Nothing can really prepare you for fatherhood \u2026. I love my boys but they can be assholes too\u2026and that\u2019s the truth (Cue Honest Guy music)\u201d\n\n\n\nTo which Brandon responded:\n\n\u201cRemember what happened last time you said this shit? \u00f0\u0178\u00a4\u201d night night \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00b4 You gotta show up to be a Dad big guy. If you think we\u2019re so bad (which I can assure you we are not) then you should have showed up to a few more BDays and baseball games. Someone like you couldn\u2019t raise a man like me. Once again painting our family in a negative light. Who the fuck are you? Just move on dude\u2026 WE ALL HAVE. \u00e2\u0153\u0152\u00f0\u0178\u008f\u00bcor I\u2019ll put you right back to fuckin sleep \u00f0\u0178\u02dc\u00b4\u201d\n\nHe followed up with a video of his father passed out, which is allegedly from the March night Brandon punched Tommy reportedly in self defense:\n\n\n\nWow.
