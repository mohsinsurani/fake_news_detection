The Black-ish actress chose a sculptural blue outfit from CDG\u2019s Spring 2016 \u201cBlue Witch\u201d collection. While it may not have been as constricting as Helen Lasichanh\u2019s arm-encumbering red CDG outfit, the runway piece wasn\u2019t exactly designed with practicality in mind, as is the case with much Comme des Gar\u00e7ons.\n\nStill, as Ross explained last night on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, she felt it was an honor to wear it. Should it be such a surprise that the daughter of one of pop\u2019s greatest fashion risk takers, Diana Ross, would be completely fine with exchanging her full range of arm movement for a once-in-a-lifetime red carpet moment?\n\nKimmel, of course, is not exactly enamored by the world of fashion and is often bemused at its excesses (see his feud with Kanye West over the idea of leather jogging pants, in particularly). So naturally he had to have Ross walk him through why she chose to wear the look.\n\nRoss explained she was attending as a guest of online retailer Farfetched, which just happens to carry Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons, so she actually got to wear a piece from the label (many other celebs attended as the guests of other fashion labels, and as per tradition and common courtesy, wore their host\u2019s creations, and thus explaining why so few celebs seemed to go full-out with the theme).\n\n\u201cThe designer who was the cochair was Comme Des Gar\u00e7ons, Rei Kawakubo. So she\u2019s a very avant-garde designer. Very arts meet fashion,\u201d explained an excited Ross. \u201cSo I got to wear a Comme des Gar\u00e7ons dress\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was such a big deal in fashion, and it was a huge deal for me,\u201d continued Ross. \u201cI feel like my mom taught me about glamour, and growing up I was a big fashion girl. I had magazines and loved that world, and so it was a big deal. It was a very big deal to wear that designer.\u201d\n\nAfter a picture of Ross in the outfit popped up behind the host, Ross had to convince him for a second that it was actually a big fashion moment, but did admit its particularly drawbacks.\n\n\u201cAs you can tell, there\u2019s not a lot of movement I could do in the dress,\u201d she explained. \u201cSo it was a little bit like\u2026couldn\u2019t lift me arms up, couldn\u2019t hug people because if I lift my arms up too high the dress would come up.\u201d\n\nKimmel\u2019s take away: he thought about the idea of teaming up with Kawakubo to get celebrities to wear the most ridiculous things possible in the name of fashion.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to contact Rei, and Rei and I are going to work out a scheme where we come up with the most ridiculous things and try to get famous people to wear them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to put somebody in a big Sprite bottle.\u201d\n\nActually, dressing someone in a Sprite bottle sounds more like Jeremy Scott for Moschino than Rei Kawakubo to us, but point taken.\n\nRelated: Met Gala 2017: An Early, Up-Close Look at Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art of the
