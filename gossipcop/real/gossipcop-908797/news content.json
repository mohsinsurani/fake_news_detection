{"url": "https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/super-bowl/6867098/super-bowl-national-anthem-performances-whitney-beyonce", "text": "Since the Super Bowl stands at the pinnacle of American sports, it\u2019s no surprise that the nation\u2019s most-high profile competition also boasts an iconic annual music tradition \u2014 the singing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d for a global audience in the hundreds of millions.\n\nSince its first inception in 1967, the Super Bowl has included an offering of the national anthem, and in recent decades, the visibility has only increased as music superstars take to the mic to deliver America\u2019s sacred song.\n\nWhile more than 30 performers have undertaken the roughly two-minute challenge, here are Billboard\u2019s top 10 picks for the best Super Bowl performances of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d through 2016:\n\n10. Dixie Chicks \u2013 2003\n\nThe reigning country queens with big personalities turned in a surprisingly modest but remarkable \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d in San Diego, opting for a straightforward approach strengthened with alluring harmonies. The Chicks\u2019 patriotic ode ironically preceded a major political backlash: mere weeks later, lead singer Natalie Maines\u2019 comments about President George W. Bush led to a politically-charged controversy that the Chicks\u2019 career has yet to fully recover from.\n\n9. Faith Hill \u2013 2000\n\nThe country diva seized the mic at the turn of the millennium, and offered one of the cleanest vocal renditions to date. The relatively simple backing band \u2014 compared with some of the massive orchestras in other years \u2014 lets Faith\u2019s voice take center stage, which doesn\u2019t shrink from the challenge. Perhaps the best part, though, is the final flourish: a clenched fist, candid grin and a mouthed \u201cwhoo.\u201d She\u2019s nailed it, and she knows it.\n\n8. Choirs of the Armed Forces \u2013 2005\n\nIn a break from the star-studded roster that had honored America for decades, organizers aimed the spotlight on the nation\u2019s military during the 2005 Super Bowl. With choirs from all five branches of the armed forces accompanied by the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, this poignant version resonates, particularly in the shadow of the escalating conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq at the time.\n\n7. Lady Gaga \u2013 2016\n\nBy the time Lady Gaga hit the Super Bowl stage in 2016, she\u2019d been preparing audiences for her vocal display for the better part of a year. In addition to various appearances to support Cheek to Cheek, her jazz and standards album with Tony Bennett, she also won praise for a medley of songs from The Sound of Music at the 87th Academy Awards. Little surprise, then, that Gaga painted her rendition of the anthem with a full-throated, theatrical-leaning take that was a nod to her performance roots. And for the Little Monsters who hoped for a bold outfit to complement the booming voice, Gaga rocked a glittery red pantsuit with platform shoes and blue-starred nails in a full-body tribute to the stars and stripes.\n\n6. Mariah Carey \u2013 2002\n\nAs one of the definitive voices in pop music, it\u2019s a little odd that Mimi didn\u2019t score her Super Bowl turn until more than a decade into her career. Still, Mariah\u2019s turn at the microphone held a place in history, coming as the first Super Bowl game after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks. With the memory still fresh on the American consciousness (and a commorative statue placed in the stadium), the songbird soared with an apt, solemn rendition before cresting on the song\u2019s ending, including a visit to the whistle register on \u201cthe land of the free.\u201d\n\n5. Luther Vandross \u2013 1997\n\nEverything Luther sang was smooth, and his \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d is no exception. With a velvety, R&B-laced arrangement backing him, Luther cuts out the most suave rendition since Marvin Gaye\u2019s legendary NBA All-Star interpretation in 1983. For those who prefer a little more gusto with their national anthems, Luther raises the stakes at the end, showing his mastery of both vocal purring and power.\n\n4. Kelly Clarkson \u2013 2012\n\nThe pop superstar offered a soul-tinged interpretation on the country\u2019s standard song in Indianapolis, complete with an angelic backing choir. A decade removed since her American Idol coronation, the original Idol proved she still owned the requisite chops to deliver a stirring rendition of the classic.\n\n3. Beyonc\u00e9 \u2013 2004\n\nIn 2004, NFL organizers offered Beyonc\u00e9 this choice for a Super Bowl performance in her native Houston: halftime show or national anthem. She elected to fulfill a childhood dream, and chose the anthem \u2013 a smart move. Some six months after her debut solo album Dangerously In Love dropped, the soon-to-be Queen Bey proclaimed herself a bonafide solo star. And, to be fair, Beyonce claimed both musical spotlights eventually: eight years after performing the national anthem, Bey hit the stage for a high-octane halftime show.\n\n2. Jennifer Hudson \u2013 2009\n\nJennifer Hudson sighed heavily as the first notes filled the stadium, and proceeded to blow the crowd away. The Oscar winner\u2019s take \u2014 backed by a lush orchestra \u2014 continually improves on itself, growing from its opening faintness to the final knockout notes courtesy of Hudson\u2019s trademark powerhouse vocals. For viewers at the time, the diva\u2019s deliver of the lyrics, which champion endurance and resolve, evoked a touching personal significance to this career milestone: Hudson\u2019s appearance marked her first public engagement since the murders of her mother, brother and 7-year-old nephew the previous October.\n\n1. Whitney Houston \u2013 1991\n\nWho else? Whitney, at the peak of her vocal powers, roared through a rousing rendition in 1991 that is widely considered the gold standard. The superstar\u2019s stentorian rendition suited the wave of patriotism flooding the United States at the height of the Persian Gulf War, and public demand for the rendition led Arista Records to release the recording as a commercial single. It subsequently burst onto the Billboard Hot 100, ultimately peaking at No. 20. Yet, the performance remained such a pop culture staple that Houston\u2019s interpretation later climbed into the top 10 \u2014 peaking at No. 6 \u2014 following its reissue after the Sept. 11, 2001 attacks.", "images": ["http://static.billboard.com/files/media/superbowl-2017-620x90.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/whitney-houston-performance-superbowl-1991-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/whitney-houston-performance-superbowl-1991-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Trevor Anderson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/music-news/super-bowl-national-anthem-performances-whitney-beyonce-6867098/", "title": "Top 10 Super Bowl National Anthem Performances", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Ahead of Super Bowl 50, Billboard counts down the 10 best Super Bowl national anthem renditions to date.", "news_keywords": "beyonce, Super Bowl", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "billboard", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 6867098, "author": "Trevor Anderson", "pmc-category": "Music,Music News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-02-06T12:16:47"}, "pmc-tag": "beyonce,Super Bowl", "title": "Top 10 Super Bowl National Anthem Performances", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-always-paywall": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-exclusive": "no", "pmc-breaking-news": "no", "pmc-prime": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Trevor Anderson", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Billboard", "application-name": "Billboard", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 6867098, "title": "Top 10 Super Bowl National Anthem Performances", "published_at": "2017-02-06 12:16:47", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/whitney-houston-performance-superbowl-1991-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Super Bowl", "topics": "Music News", "body": "Since the Super Bowl stands at the pinnacle of American sports, it's no surprise that the\u00a0nation\u2019s most-high profile competition also boasts an iconic annual music tradition --\u00a0the singing of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d for a global\u00a0audience in the hundreds of millions.Since its first inception in 1967, the Super Bowl has included an offering of the national anthem, and in recent decades, the visibility has only increased as\u00a0music superstars take to the mic to deliver America\u2019s sacred song.While more than 30 performers have undertaken the roughly two-minute challenge, here are Billboard\u2019s top 10 picks for the best Super Bowl performances of \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d through 2016:10.
