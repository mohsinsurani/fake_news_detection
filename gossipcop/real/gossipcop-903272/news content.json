In February 2007, a sex tape made by her sister Kim and former boyfriend Ray J in 2003, Kim Kardashian, Superstar, was leaked, which largely contributed to her rise to prominence.[14][15] Later that year, Kardashian, in addition to her mother Kris; her stepfather Bruce (now known as Caitlyn);[16] her siblings Kim, Khlo\u00e9, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.[17] The series proved successful for E!, the network on which it is broadcast, and led to several spin-offs, including Kourtney and Khlo\u00e9 Take Miami, Khlo\u00e9 & Lamar, and Kourtney and Kim Take New York .[18]\n\nKardashian and her mother opened children's clothing boutiques called Smooch in the Los Angeles area and New York City; the boutiques carry the brand Crib Rock Couture.

But my script is so long... I'm not an actress.\"[26][27] Her performance was met with negative reviews from critics.[28] In November 2011 she released a novel Dollhouse along with sisters Khloe and Kim.[29]\n\nIn September 2012, she and younger sister Kim created another spinoff reality television series, Kourtney and Kim Take Miami, which began airing in January 2013. It features their mother Kris Jenner, Kardashian's boyfriend at the time, Scott Disick, and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.[30][31]\n\nThe Kardashian sisters were spokeswomen for the diet supplement Quick Trim, for weight loss. In March 2012 the three sisters were named in a $5 million class-action lawsuit against QuickTrim.[32] The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accused the Kardashians, along with QuickTrim's manufacturer Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain, of false and deceptive marketing. The plaintiffs, from several states, brought claims under their respective states' consumer protection laws.[33]\n\nKardashian also represents the skincare line PerfectSkin with her sisters, which was developed by Dr. Ron DiSalvo for Perfect Science Labs.[34] The three sisters also released a 20-piece collection of jewelry line for the company Virgins, Saints, and Angels, in March 2010.

According to the website, the 32-piece line was inspired by Studio 54, classical Hollywood cinema, and the 1970s.[36] She endorsed Calvin Klein along with her sisters in 2018. In the same year, she partnered with her younger half-sister Kylie to launch a collection of lipsticks and palettes with Kylie Cosmetics.\n\nOn March 5, 2019, Kardashian released her lifestyle website named Poosh.[37] In November 2019, Kardashian partnered with her sisters Kim and Khlo\u00e9 to create three new perfumes (one for each sister) for Kim's brand KKW Fragrance.

During this time, Kardashian believed Disick had an alcohol problem. After regularly attending therapy and temporarily giving up alcohol, Disick and Kardashian reconciled and they continued their relationship in mid-2010.[48]\n\nIn 2011, during the final episode in the first season of Kourtney and Kim Take New York, Disick purchased an engagement ring and planned to propose to Kardashian during an evening meal in New York City. However, when Disick asked Kardashian's opinion on marriage, she responded with, \"If things are so good now...why would we want to change that?\", so he did not propose.[49]\n\nKardashian was in another on-again, off-again relationship with model Younes Bendjima from 2016 to 2020.[50]\n\nIn January 2021, it was confirmed that Kardashian was in a relationship with musician Travis Barker.[51][52] In October 2021, Kardashian and Barker got engaged after he proposed to her at a beachside hotel in Montecito, California.[53] They had an unofficial wedding on April 3, 2022 in Las Vegas, after the 64th Annual Grammy Awards.[54] The couple officially married on May 15, 2022 in Santa Barbara, California,[55] with a religious wedding ceremony in Portofino, Italy on May 22, 2022.[56]\n\nFilmography [ edit ]\n\nAs actress [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2011 One Life to Live Kassandra Kavanaugh Episode: \"March 28, 2011\" 2021 He's All That Jessica Miles Torres Movie\n\nAs herself [ edit ]\n\nWritten works [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Scott_Disick_%26_Kourtney_Kardashian_2010.jpg/220px-Scott_Disick_%26_Kourtney_Kardashian_2010.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Kourtney_Kardashian_in_2019_3.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/34/Kourtney_Kardashian_in_2019_3.jpg/220px-Kourtney_Kardashian_in_2019_3.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Kourtney_Kardashian_in_2019_3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kourtney_Kardashian", "title": "Kourtney Kardashian", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.4", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/34/Kourtney_Kardashian_in_2019_3.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 906}, "title": "Kourtney Kardashian - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
