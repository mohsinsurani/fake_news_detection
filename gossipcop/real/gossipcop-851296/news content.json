The 19-year-old beauty mogul opens up about the struggle of juggling her career and her personal life in a new trailer for her Keeping Up With the Kardashians spinoff, Life of Kylie. See what she has to say in the clip above!\n\n\u201cWhen you grow up on camera, everybody feels like they know you. But they don\u2019t,\u201d Jenner says in the sneak peek. \u201cI feel like a lot of people have misconceptions of who I am.\u201d\n\nAs scenes from her adolescence flash onscreen, the Kylie Cosmetics founder reminds viewers that she began filming KUWTK with her now-superfamous family at the age of 9. \u201cI don\u2019t think any of us knew what we were getting ourselves into,\u201d she tells the camera.\n\nJenner then goes on to explain that she has two sides: There\u2019s the glamorous social media maven with more than 93 million Instagram followers, and then there\u2019s the young girl from Calabasas who likes to kick it with her besties whenever she isn\u2019t working.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s an image that I feel constantly pressured to keep up with,\u201d she says, adding that she hopes Life of Kylie will help her fans get to know both sides of the reality TV queen. \u201cThis show is a gift to my fans. I do feel pressure to not let anybody down.\u201d\n\nThe preview also shows Jenner taking a lucky high school student to prom, posing in an array of sexy ensembles for various photo shoots and even chilling with her BFF Jordyn Woods during rare moments of downtime.\n\n\u201cThis isn\u2019t Keeping Up With the Kardashians,\u201d she says. \u201cThis is like a therapy session. Now I can find what really is gonna make me happy.\u201d\n\nLife of Kylie premieres on E!
