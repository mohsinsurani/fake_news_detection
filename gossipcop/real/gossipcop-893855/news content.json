She later pleaded not guilty to the charge.\n\nRose McGowan pleads not guilty to drug possession\n\nThe Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority obtained the warrant in February last year after authorities allegedly found traces of narcotics in her personal belongings that were left behind on a United flight in January to Washington, D.C.\n\nMcGowan tweeted about incident, asking, \u201cAre they trying to silence me?\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhat a load of HORSES**T.\u201d\n\nRose McGowan responds to arrest warrant\n\nMcGowan is one of the more than 80 women who have accused former producer Harvey Weinstein of acts of sexual harassment, sexual assault and rape.\n\nThrough a spokesperson, Weinstein has consistently denied any allegations of \u201cnon-consensual sex.\u201d\n\nAccording to a report published by The New Yorker\u2019s Ronan Farrow in November, police said a worker cleaning the plane found McGowan\u2019s wallet, and in it were two small bags of powder that later tested positive as cocaine.\n\nMcGowan told Farrow that she was afraid when an airport police detective called her to retrieve her wallet, as she was unsure whether he was actually a detective.\n\nMcGowan\u2019s spokesperson confirmed to CNN the accuracy of her published quotes at the time.\n\nMcGowan, who was traveling to Washington for the Women\u2019s March when the incident occurred, said the next day she received an Instagram message from a user she did not know that read, \u201cYou left your wallet on your Saturday flight with your 2 bags of coke.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cCharmed\u201d star and her attorney assert that she left her bag containing her wallet on the plane unattended. McGowan said she filed a lost luggage claim and tweeted United Airlines for help when she realized her wallet was missing, according to The New Yorker\u2019s report.\n\nOn October 30, McGowan first publicly responded to the existence of the warrant on Twitter.\n\nMcGowan told Farrow she has used drugs in the past, but said marijuana was her \u201cjam.\u201d\n\n\u201cImagining I\u2019m going into sisterly solidarity, I can think of nothing more opposed to that, energetically, that I would want in my body at that moment,\u201d she said referring to the cocaine.\n\nA May cover story with The Hollywood Reporter included comment from McGowan about the fact she faced a maximum of 10 years in prison if convicted, while Weinstein remained free.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m the only one who\u2019s had handcuffs on me so far in this situation,\u201d she told the publication. \u201cThat\u2019s not right.\u201d\n\nWeinstein has since been arrested on charges of rape, committing a criminal sex act, sexual abuse and sexual misconduct in New York for which has pled not guilty. The charges are unrelated to McGowan\u2019s allegations against him.\n\nCNN has reached out to McGowan\u2019s representatives for comment.", "images":
