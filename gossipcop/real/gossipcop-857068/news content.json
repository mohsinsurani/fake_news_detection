Fresh off of her striking Billboard Music Awards performance on May 21, Dion gave her Las Vegas showgoers a treat: a live performance of \u201cHow Does a Moment Last Forever\u201d from 2017\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d remake.\n\nDion \u2014 and Disney \u2014 diehards might recall that the songstress first lent her pipes to the entertainment empire in 1991. She and Peabo Bryson recorded the theme song for the animated version\u2019s \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d soundtrack. On Thursday night, Dion surprised the crowd at her Las Vegas show by announcing that for the first time, she would perform the original song written especially for Disney\u2019s 2017 live-action remake, starring Emma Watson.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very nervous and very excited at the same time,\u201d Dion said. She fittingly chose a Belle-inspired yellow dress for the occasion. \u201cTwenty five years ago, I was very fortunate to be a part of that magical movie \u2018Beauty and the Beast.\u2019 It was one of the biggest moments of my show business career actually, so, so thankful. Twenty five years later, Disney asked me again if I would like to participate in the live-action remake of \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 by recording another song. So if you put yourself in my shoes, I could not refuse. This new song is called \u2018How Does a Moment Last Forever\u2019 and I\u2019d like to sing it for you in concert tonight for the very, very first time.\u201d\n\n[protected-iframe id=\u201d4c11449840c277ae9785c76f7a526eea-81433431-110076435\u2033 info=\u201dhttps://www.facebook.com/plugins/video.php?href=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2Fcelinedion%2Fvideos%2F10154405071201651%2F&show_text=0&width=560\u2033 width=\u201d560\u2033 height=\u201d315\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 style=\u201dborder:none;overflow:hidden\u201d scrolling=\u201dno\u201d]\n\nDion garnered praise this weekend both for her performance at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards and the dress she wore for it \u2014 an haute couture design by St\u00e9phane Rolland.
