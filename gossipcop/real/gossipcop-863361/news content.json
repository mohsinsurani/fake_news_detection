He\u2019s not hot, but cute, with unassuming mannerisms and a subtly winning smile. The pair banter about books flirtatiously, and it\u2019s clear that there\u2019s an instant attraction, a *spark* if you will. The woman reaches up to grab a book off the top shelf, and the man scans her up and down.\n\n\u201cIf this was a movie, I\u2019d grab you and we\u2019d go at it right in the stacks,\u201d he says in a voiceover, invoking visions of spontaneous passion that should be familiar to anyone who\u2019s spent time watching romance films.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut it isn\u2019t a movie. And it\u2019s not quite a romance, either \u2015 at least not one to be desired. It\u2019s the pilot episode of \u201cYou,\u201d the latest of Lifetime\u2019s forays into scripted television.\n\n\u201cYou,\u201d based on the novel of the same name, follows Joe Goldberg (Badgley), the charming bookstore manager, and his increasingly terrifying obsession with Guinevere Beck (Elizabeth Lail), a grad student and writer onto whom Joe projects all of his fantasies and expectations.\n\nIn the midst of the Me Too movement, it might sound dicey, unnecessary and even counterproductive to put a charming white dude stalker front and center on television. And yet \u201cYou\u201d manages to be sharp and self-aware, skewering the very tropes you might expect to weigh it down. Much of this responsibility falls on the writing and on Badgley, who as Joe is left to narrate much of the first five episodes with his inner monologue.\n\nThe last time you saw Badgley on your television screen, it was most likely as Dan Humphrey, the moody outcast turned insider on teen juggernaut \u201cGossip Girl\u201d (2007-2012). At the end of the series\u2019 run, it was revealed (in a messy retconned twist) that Dan had been the titular Gossip Girl all along.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAt first glance, beyond their stated bookishness, heartthrob Dan and predator Joe don\u2019t seem all that similar. But then you start talking to Badgley and the similarities become clearer. As Badgley pointed out to me over the phone, \u201cIf any real person actually did the things that Gossip Girl did, is that person, no matter who they are, a sociopath? Aren\u2019t they manipulative? Aren\u2019t they abusive?\u201d\n\nAnd these sorts of observations are what make chatting with Badgley so much fun. He\u2019s a seasoned pro at doing press \u2015 he came of age in the public eye, after all \u2015 which means that he could come off as rehearsed, so media-trained as to be boring. But instead Badgley is contemplative, not only answering questions but also asking them. We talked about everything from romantic comedy conventions to the format of this interview. And really, what\u2019s more Dan Humphrey than that?\n\nSo, I\u2019ve seen the first five episodes of \u201cYou,\u201d and they are any dating woman\u2019s greatest nightmare realized.\n\nYes. Definitely.\n\nYou play Joe, the very charming stalker at the center of this show. I\u2019m curious what initially drew you to the role?\n\nI was drawn to the project through the conversations I had with [\u201cYou\u201d co-creators] Greg Berlanti and Sera Gamble. After I read the book, I could really admire the effect that Caroline [Kepnes\u2019] writing has on the reader. But [Joe is] not the sort of person that you want to live with day in, day out. I think I was actually quite cautious [going into the project], and what that has led me to do is learn to trust the other people in the process \u2015 the writers, the actors, the crew \u2015 so I\u2019m less attached to this person, this character. That\u2019s what I like about it now. Initially, I couldn\u2019t see all those things and couldn\u2019t tell exactly why I was compelled by it.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nElizabeth Lail and Penn Badgley in the pilot episode of \"You.\" Lifetime/AE\n\nI will say that the writing definitely takes the project beyond what its log line might suggest.\n\nExactly. Right now, we\u2019re doing a lot of press, and this show hasn\u2019t been seen by anybody. So all we\u2019ve got is the log line. And how much can you go beyond the log line before spoiling a lot of what the show is about? I have experienced the show to be infinitely deeper than its teaser, but that\u2019s the medium and you have to work with that in the beginning. I find myself having to say things that are vague. I can\u2019t really speak to all the things that he\u2019s done, so what is it that Joe is? Well, he does things.\n\nWhat was it like to dig into this complex and obviously disturbing character while we\u2019re in the midst of having national conversations about sexual misconduct and abuse and harassment?\n\nI am grateful to the moment and that [the show] is coming out now. I think it would be bad if this show were to come out and it wasn\u2019t scrutinized and held to the standard that it will be held to now.\n\nIt\u2019s interesting. [\u201cYou\u201d] is a show that is ultimately about a man. I mean it is about an obsession and it is about a subject, and it very much depends on this female character, this woman [Beck], but it is a show about a man. And... we\u2019re a part of it and we\u2019re trying to understand what that means now. I think what this show needs is for people to see it \u2015 that\u2019s the thing that closes the loop. Right now it\u2019s an open-ended question.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019m sure you have heard these comparisons, but is Joe the logical conclusion of Dan Humphrey, whom you played on \u201cGossip Girl\u201d? Like\u2026 is Joe Dan Humphrey with a touch more sociopath?\n\nWell, the question is, if any real person actually did the things that Gossip Girl did, is that person, no matter who they are, a sociopath? Aren\u2019t they manipulative? Aren\u2019t they abusive?\n\nAnd then, if we follow that logic, how often is it that an [online] troll says something that, if it was enacted, would actually be murder? People speak so casually about wanting to kill other people online. So, in a way, Joe \u2015 I am not trying to defend anyone\u2019s behavior, least of all Joe\u2019s \u2015 but I think what I am troubled by and interested in, which this show is dealing with, is [the question of whether Joe\u2019s behavior] is an inappropriate following of logic that is set up by our culture. And, in certain ways, it is. Of course, this does not mean that his behavior is right, but it also means that a lot of our cultural norms are wrong.\n\nI was going to ask you about that. \u201cYou\u201d is a show that explores the way that we very casually put so much personal information out into the world, and how that information can be used or manipulated against us. Do you see the show as sort of a cautionary tale about social media?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPeople might take that from it. The social media dimension is not one that I am as compelled by, personally. But I know that everybody sees this, [and] they\u2019re like, \u201cWow, it made me rethink that.\u201d I am thinking more [about the show\u2019s exploration of] gender dynamics, the cultural definition of love and relationships. What is appropriate and what is not. What is intimate, and what is not. What is humane, and what is not. And, yes, the social media thing confuses us all, honestly. So [\u201cYou\u201d] does shine a light on how it can be abused \u2015 as though we weren\u2019t aware of the end to which social media is being abused. It\u2019s pretty evident.\n\nI am also curious \u2015 you grew up in the public eye because of \u201cGossip Girl.\u201d You and I are the same age, and I just think about if people had been paying attention to my every move in 2007/2008, that would have been really rough.\n\nYeah, that was [pauses] \u2015 you\u2019re right.\n\nDid that experience impact the way you read the \u201cYou\u201d script at all?\n\nProbably. But in ways that I am not so conscious of. It affects everything about the way that I think. I actually became grateful to all that because I learned very early on how merciless and manipulative [public attention] can be.\n\nYou know, even an interviewer trying to communicate something that you\u2019ve communicated responsibly, it might get lost in translation. And then the person who reads it is a third level of translation. In the way that reflects on social media, I think I had to develop the discipline to not use it as a way to think that I can know or understand any person. I do not value it as a window into anything real. For better or worse \u2015 I\u2019m not saying that\u2019s a good thing, I\u2019m just saying I think it\u2019s the way that I see it. I just don\u2019t see [social media] as valuable, because I have been up close and personal with how... it\u2019s just untrue. It\u2019s literally not a reflection of reality. So why would I try to find out something about someone in this way when I know that if anybody tried to do the same to me, they would literally actually be getting further from understanding who I am?\n\n\u201cWould anyone else be considered unassuming on the side of the street standing there too long? It\u2019s pretty evident that no one but a young handsome white man could do that.\u201d - Penn Badgley on his character, Joe Goldberg, in \"You\"\n\nSomething I was really struck by in the pilot is when Joe has broken into Beck\u2019s house, and she comes home early, so he ends up hiding in her shower. We hear Joe say through his inner monologue, \u201cI\u2019m not worried. I\u2019ve seen enough romantic comedies to know that guys like me are always getting in jams like this.\u201d Is \u201cYou\u201d intentionally playing with the more problematic tropes of rom-coms?\n\nThat\u2019s exactly what it\u2019s doing. That\u2019s what we were talking about before, which is that [\u201cYou\u201d] is examining and scrutinizing the definitions [of love and relationships] we have and all of these cultural standards.\n\nLike, [the culture says], \u201cThis is what a relationship can look like, this is what love can look like. This is how you should be. This is what it\u2019s cool to do.\u201d And then Joe is like, \u201cAlright, I will do all those things.\u201d And then he\u2019s got blood on his hands and everyone\u2019s like, \u201cWhat did you do?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cI just did what you did!\u201d\n\nYeah, there was even a study that came out in 2016 that showed that romantic movies literally perpetuate stalking myths and make it harder to prosecute stalkers. Which is crazy.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThat\u2019s absolutely terrifying. And I mean, who is responsible for romantic comedies? It\u2019s actually a very small group of people.... So I think it\u2019s healthy that we examine these standards and be ready to cast them aside entirely, and be like, \u201cWait, that\u2019s not humane. That\u2019s not human. That\u2019s not what love is.\u201d\u2026 There\u2019s so much about our idea of love that can\u2019t be separated from American consumerism and materialism and white privilege, all of this stuff.\n\nAnd I think that Joe is a great example of that. Would anyone else be considered unassuming on the side of the street standing there too long? It\u2019s pretty evident that no one but a young handsome white man could do that. And there\u2019s a lot of ways in which we don\u2019t examine that. I am ready to have that conversation if anyone else wants to. But again, I think it\u2019s more interesting once everyone has seen the show, and then as the seasons continue. [Editor\u2019s note: \u201cYou\u201d has already been renewed for a second season.]\n\nI hope that \u201cYou\u201d prompts that conversation! Pop culture is such a great, accessible way to dive into things that people might not feel comfortable talking about otherwise.\n\nRight. Any interview that I am able to do \u2015 if we can\u2019t address these things in a real way, does that mean we should talk about them differently, or does that mean we should augment these spaces so we can have a real conversation regardless of this show?\n\nPut that in print.\n\nConsider it done! Do you have any hope for the future of the romantic leading male character? Is there a way for us to have that conversation we\u2019re discussing, about the negative tropes that have been perpetuated, and then do it differently? I don\u2019t know if you\u2019ve seen Netflix\u2019s \u201cTo All the Boys I\u2019ve Loved Before\u201d...\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI haven\u2019t, but I have heard good things.\n\nWell, it\u2019s delightful. And it has started an interesting conversation about a different mold of that male romantic lead.\n\nWe all know that tropes exist. But if we start to realize that tropes shape behavior of real human beings, I think we need to question, like, what the fuck are these tropes doing here in the first place? Do we need tropes because it\u2019s what makes advertisers comfortable? If that\u2019s the answer, fuck tropes. Get rid of the tropes if they\u2019re negatively affecting any single human being\u2019s behavior.\n\n[But] no one wants to hear that in an interview that I am in\u2026 You know, there\u2019s a lot of dots that we should always be connecting, and if we don\u2019t assume that we have the attention span for it or the patience for it, I don\u2019t know what we\u2019re doing.\n\n\u201cDo we need tropes because it\u2019s what makes advertisers comfortable? If that\u2019s the answer, fuck tropes.\u201d - Penn Badgley\n\nIt\u2019s certainly easy as interviewer and interviewee to fall into a trap of \u201cthis is what is supposed to come out of this,\u201d where we both go into the interview agreeing on the terms.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019ve been thinking about this a lot coming up to this press because the interview isn\u2019t even necessarily designed as a way to have a conversation. You have to ask questions, and I have to answer them. Maybe that should change. A conversation has to go two ways, and people have to be willing to listen. And I think the problem with a lot of, let\u2019s say, men out there, actors, famous men \u2015 particularly famous white men \u2015 is that their entire livelihood is them talking ad nauseum. I\u2019m guilty of it, too. It\u2019s just the way things are designed. And so you might try to undo that. But then you don\u2019t get support.\n\nThis is where maybe I have some empathy for Joe. He has no support to try and change. He clearly did not have it before we met him. [Editor\u2019s note: The first five episodes of \u201cYou\u201d include some flashbacks to Joe\u2019s childhood.] He had to grow up on his own, and he came to some really bad conclusions, and no one was there to be like, \u201cHey, man, that\u2019s wrong.\u201d\n\nI think as a culture we have a tendency to look at men who do things \u2015 maybe not as extreme as Joe, but things on that continuum of sexual abuse and harassment and violence \u2015 as monsters that are separate from us. But what\u2019s so interesting about Joe is that he has humanity, and so you can\u2019t just think of him as something less than human. He is, for better or worse, one of us.\n\nYou know, that\u2019s really interesting. I personally believe that one of the struggles we have these days is the second someone does something that we believe is truly wrong, we do write them off as kind of evil or inhuman, which separates them from us.\u2026 No one is an island. How are they supported in reaching these conclusions? How are they supported in continuing to behave in a certain way? ... To me, this idea of [shared] humanity is a really important one.\n\nIn the beginning, I was not interested in making Joe human. I was like, \u201cThis dude\u2019s a murderer. I don\u2019t think we need to be humanizing murderers anymore.\u201d But then I realized maybe this is the most responsible thing to do. Because if we can\u2019t turn away from Joe\u2019s humanity, then we have to accept how we\u2019ve somehow also been supportive and complicit in allowing Joe to reach the conclusions he\u2019s reached [about love]. We can\u2019t just point the finger and call people evil. It\u2019s not helpful. It\u2019s not helpful because it actually is our reality. We need to be recognizing people\u2019s humanity rather than building walls. There it is, there\u2019s the sound byte. [Laughs.]\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhat do you hope viewers take away from the show once they do see it?\n\nLet\u2019s say, theoretically, this show isn\u2019t any good. If people are able to have conversations like this around it, that\u2019s good. Is my acting great? Is the show well written? Sure, at points it is, and at points I\u2019m sure we were inconsistent, because it\u2019s like 10 hours of material. It\u2019s really hard to be consistent with 10 hours of material. You turn that into movies and that\u2019s like 10 years of a person\u2019s career.\n\nSo, you know, I just think it\u2019s great that we can be considering these [big ideas]. We have a space and a time to do it. Even though I know so much of it doesn\u2019t fit into, like, the thing you\u2019re going to have to write, to me there is a space and a time for it. And that\u2019s where social media helps us. We just have to use it better.", "images": ["https://img.huffingtonpost.com/asset/633fe09725000039004f7391.jpeg?cache=Zde865g5mA&ops=434_244%2Cquality_75",
