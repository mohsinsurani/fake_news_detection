Brown, and the hat Morgan Freeman decided to wear throughout the entire ceremony. While we appreciate the fact that the 80-year-old legend felt comfortable wearing a baseball hat indoors, we still have a few questions.\n\nFreeman accepted the Life Achievement Award and his friend Rita Moreno \u2014 who presented the big honor \u2014 was quick to point out that he accepted it while sporting the baseball cap. \u201cLift up your hat,\u201d she said, making the moment more notable. \u201cThere we go. Now we can see you,\u201d she quipped. Freeman joked about the moment, saying, \u201cYou see what I had to put up with?\u201d\n\nWhile the actor didn\u2019t reveal why he was wearing the cap, we have a few solid theories. For one, he might have just liked it (which is valid). There\u2019s also a possibility that he was paying tribute to the Time\u2019s Up movement \u2014 since the hat was black. Morgan noted that the SAG Awards still aren\u2019t gender neutral and called for change in his acceptance speech, which adds some weight to the theory.\n\nAt the end of the day, we likely won\u2019t ever know what inspired the look, but we do know people loved it.\n\nfalse\n\nfalse\n\nYou do you, sir. You\u2019ve earned it.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/Morgan-Freeman-e1516639040730.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/Morgan-Freeman-e1516639040730.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/Morgan-Freeman-e1516639040730.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/morgan-freeman-hat-2018-sag-awards/", "title": "Morgan Freeman wore a baseball hat to the 2018 SAG Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "People are all about the fact that Morgan Freeman sported a casual baseball hat with his tux at the 2018 SAG Awards.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Morgan Freeman wore a baseball hat to the 2018 SAG Awards", "description": "People are all about the fact that Morgan Freeman sported a casual baseball hat with his tux at the 2018 SAG Awards.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/morgan-freeman-hat-2018-sag-awards/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/Morgan-Freeman-e1516639040730.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1000, "height": 706, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-22T13:45:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T14:34:49+00:00"}, "author": "karen belz", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "karen belz", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516628713.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
