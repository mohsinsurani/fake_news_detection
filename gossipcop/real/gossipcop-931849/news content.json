Verne was a fantastic human being.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery day you see him, you go, \u2018Wow that is a small human,'\u201d he said. \u201cBut by the end of the day, you just saw Verne. It just sort of went away. He was part of the cast and fantastic. I miss him.\u201d\n\nMyers said he worked with Troyer for a long time, adding that he was \u201ca great comedian.\u201d\n\nMyers and Troyer shared the screen in all three \u201cAustin Powers\u201d films, with Troyer starring as the iconic Mini-Me.
