Saskia O'Donoghue reports\n\nCELEBRITIES and guests have begun to arrive for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s big day.\n\nOprah Winfrey was spotted walking into the wedding along with other celebrities like Idris Elba, James Blunt and Princess Diana\u2019s brother Earl Spencer.\n\nEarlier, Serena Williams shared pictures of herself getting ready, ending speculation over whether she had been invited to the event. She wore an elegant pink outfit with matching fascinator and posed alongside her husband Alexis Ohanian, and eight-month-old daughter, Alexis Olympia.\n\nPrince Harry\u2019s ex girlfriends Cressida Bonas and Chelsy Davy walked in together.\n\nIDRIS ELBA AND OPRAH ARE AT THE WEDDING #royalwedding pic.twitter.com/WZKNOh7ixq \u2014 Scott Bryan (@scottygb) May 19, 2018\n\nMORE: Follow all the wedding action live here\n\nMORE: Harry and Meghan\u2019s new titles announced\n\nSome of Prince Harry\u2019s best friends, including Tom Inskip, brothers Tom and Charlie Van Straubenzee, Mark Dyer and Arthur Landon were also tipped to be part of the celebrations.\n\nVictoria and David Beckham were also set to be there, along with the rest of the Spice Girls after a poor attempt at hiding it from Victoria and Mel B.\n\nElton John was also named as a guest after he cancelled his Las Vegas performances for May 18 and 19 fuelling speculation he could perform. The singer has a special connection to the royal princes, having performed Candle in the Wind at Princess Diana\u2019s funeral in 1997.\n\nMeghan\u2019s ultra-glamorous set of friends have also been the subject of much reporting, with former Suits star and wedding planner Jessica Mulroney named as a guest, along with university friend Lindsay Roth, former Miss World Priyanka Chopra and fashion designer Misha Nonoo.\n\nFollow all the latest on the royal wedding here.", "images":
