The videos, many of which are directed by filmmaker Bardia Zeinali, allow celebrities to embrace the \"play\" part of playing dress up. In one, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri actor Frances McDormand dances through the Met in that leafy green gown. Another sees Rihanna prancing around the legendary museum in her unforgettable Pope ensemble. And SZA shows off her ethereal fairytale gown in one of the venue's galleries.\n\nIn short, the celebrities become the art at the Met Gala.\n\nRihanna\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nFrances McDormand\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAnna Wintour\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nSZA\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nKaty Perry\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nAriana Grande\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nLana Del Rey\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nKim Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, and Kylie Jenner\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNicki Minaj\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nMiley Cyrus", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5af116e82f00e14afdf95850/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/vogue-video-booth-lede.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6336f251e04fa0106aa78ce6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6331b3ebd7da92f32d60fff2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5af117f778277270fe3eda2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/vogue-video-booth-fb2.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6319f70572104245c0c89f27/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6331c7d5eeba7de88590f1d8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5af117f778277270fe3eda2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/vogue-video-booth-fb2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "P.
