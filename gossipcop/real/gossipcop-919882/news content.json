Thankfully, this \u200bpregnancy isn't being hidden like her half-sister Kylie's was , so we're seeing all the action in real time.\n\nA source tells \u200bE! News the celebration was held in the Grand Ballroom at the Hotel Bel Air in Los Angeles this afternoon.\n\n\n\n\n\n\"They went all out for the shower with no expense spared and it's turned out to be stunning and gorgeous,\" the source says .\n\nThose in attendance for sure were of course Kris, Kendall, and Kylie Jenner, as well as Real Housewives of Atlanta star Kim Zolciak-Biermann, her daughter, and many more.\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd the celebration was SERIOUSLY pink! Check out the awesome photos so far.\n\nKim and Kylie took to their Snapchats to post several videos and photos of the big event. This party looks fit for a princess, which Khlo \u00e9 's daughter for sure will be!\n\nWe're now just waiting on the news of the name Khlo \u00e9 and Tristan pick for their baby girl. Will they use the \"K\" family tradition? Koko says she's considering it!\n\nI think a T but a K is an option as well. That\u2019s as far as I know https://t.co/Rs6zPdI0BT \u2014 Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) March 5, 2018\n\n\u200b\u200bWe only have a short time to find out, as Khloe is very, very pregnant right now. We can't wait for the newest family member in this power squad!\n\n\n\n\n\nKylie has also posted another video of Stormi today, with BFF Jordyn Woods.
