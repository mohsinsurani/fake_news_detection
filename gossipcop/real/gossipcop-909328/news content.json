If you take a cue from celebrities, you might find the perfect solution. Take Beyonc\u00e9 for example. She has a secret Snapchat account (that her mother, Tina, accidentally told the world about!) so that she can follow who she likes in a carefree way. Drake was also recently outed. DJ Khaled was on a radio show when he let slip that he follows Drake's classified Snapchat handle. On the other side of the pond, Daily Mail reportedly uncovered that Prince Harry has a private Instagram account so that he can follow and like his lady love Meghan Markle's posts.\n\nTHETALKO VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\nsheknows.com\n\nSinger and Twitter-lover Adele said in an interview that she created a secret Twitter account so that she could be free to say what she felt. Her PR team kicked her off the popular app because she has been known to use choice words. It's also known that NBA player Kevin Durant has a secret account to troll back at his trolls. This was reportedly uncovered by a fan when Durant responded to a tweet in the third person. His fans think that he forgot to switch from his known account to his secret account.\n\ntwitter.com\n\nSasha Obama was thrown under the bus by her former president papa when he said in an interview, \"I mean, Sasha tweets, but she doesn't think that she thereby should be sitting behind the desk!\" The desk, of course, was referring to the presidential desk in the White House. Mad Men star Jon Hamm said that he enjoys his secret Instagram account so that he can enjoy photos and videos of baby animals. Aww! \u201cI get why people like Instagram,\u201d Hamm told People. \u201cI have an Instagram account that I use to follow beautiful places and baby animals and things that make me feel joy.\u201d Some honorable celeb mentions who also are known to have secret social media accounts include Kim Kardashian, Lorde, Elle Fanning, Kate Moss, and Rose Byrne. Will you secretly follow suit?\n\nShare Share Tweet Email\n\nDrunken Kid Rock Blasts Oprah Winfrey And Joy Behar In Nashville Bar", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://www.thetalko.com/public/build/images/re-logo-full-colored-light.4b543c53.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://static1.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Beyonce-Shocked.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://www.thetalko.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-colored-light.53763959.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://www.thetalko.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-colored-light.8d65e7f9.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://www.thetalko.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-colored-light.2bae128a.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://static1.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Beyonce-Shocked.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Krissie Mcmakin"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957/https://www.thetalko.com/celebrities-secret-social-media-accounts/", "title": "Learn Which Celebrities Have Secret Social Media Accounts And Why", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Celebrities have found a way to share, follow, and post without the PR problems.", "og": {"title": "Learn Which Celebrities Have Secret Social Media Accounts And Why", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://static1.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Beyonce-Shocked.jpg", "width": 1710, "height": 900}, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957/https://www.thetalko.com/celebrities-secret-social-media-accounts/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Celebrities have found a way to share, follow, and post without the PR problems.", "site_name": "TheTalko"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-02T00:30:10Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-02T00:30:10Z", "section": "Entertainment"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thetalko", "title": "Learn Which Celebrities Have Secret Social Media Accounts And Why", "description": "Celebrities have found a way to share, follow, and post without the PR problems.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194957im_/https://static1.thetalkoimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Beyonce-Shocked.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1470061169975403}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517531410.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
