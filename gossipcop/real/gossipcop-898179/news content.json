Entertainment\n\nOn this week\u2019s episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians, our A-plot was Kris Jenner\u2019s manipulation, our B-plot was Kim Kardashian\u2019s announcement, and our C-plot was Kourtney Kardashian\u2019s new relationship. Jonathan Cheban isn\u2019t going to hate on himself, so #LEGGO!\n\nScene 1/Cold Open:\n\nKourtney Kardashian entertains Kim Kardashian, Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, and family ward Jonathan Cheban. Out of nowhere, Kourtney says that Jonathan is the one person to go to for advice. Jonathan agrees, while Khlo\u00e9 finds it funny that once upon a time, Kourtney hated Jonathan and Former Greatest Assistant of All Time Steph Shep \u2014 but now she\u2019s attached at the hip to both of them. Kourtney, too, marvels at how the tides have changed.\n\nSomehow, following this conversation, Jonathan proves that he may be the only one of the group with a sound mind: Khlo\u00e9 sneezes, and Kim says, \u201cGesundheit.\u201d Khlo\u00e9 asks who says that word in response to a sneeze, and Jonathan says it\u2019s Yiddish (which, it\u2019s not). Then Kim, Kourtney, and Khlo\u00e9 wonder aloud what Yiddish is. They all realize that they\u2019ve lived their whole lives thinking Yiddish was the cousin to \u201cgibberish\u201d and possibly had something to do with \u201cBritish.\u201d Finally, Jonathan tells them that Yiddish is a form of Hebrew, and everyone just sits in confusion. This scene was filmed on May 5, 2017.\n\nScene 3:\n\nKylie Jenner holds a Lip Kit meeting with Kourtney Kardashian and Jordyn Woods at Kris Jenner\u2019s home. Sequestered away in the kitchen with their mom are Kris\u2019s other daughters, Kim and Khlo\u00e9. Kim tells Khlo\u00e9 and Kris that the night before Saint was whispering in his sleep \u201cshoes \u2026 dada,\u201d which tracks with his love of shoes and all things Yeezy, according to Kim. Aside from discussing the littlest tastemaker in Southern California, Kim and Khlo\u00e9 wonder why Kris is knee deep in Kylie\u2019s business affairs and never bothers to check in on theirs.\n\nKris explains that she\u2019s still helping to get Kylie off the ground, which sounds like B.S. to Kim and Khlo\u00e9 since Kylie\u2019s business has been running for nearly two years and she\u2019s made billions. They suppose the real reason is that Kylie makes her the most money, therefore she\u2019s the current favorite and deserves the most attention. Kris does think that Kylie\u2019s general niceness and desire to be around her mother makes her an obvious favorite \u2014 and the success doesn\u2019t hurt. Especially since Kylie makes a point to buy Kris fun things to let her know she\u2019s thinking about her. This shocks Kim and Khlo\u00e9, who got Kris the ultimate fun thing, a surprise 60th birthday party in 2015. And on top of it all: Kendall and Kylie had no thoughts about her 60th birthday at all. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 argue that memories are better than physical gifts. Kris is beyond annoyed, and jokes that these two are now tied for her least favorite. This scene was filmed on August 16, 2017.\n\nScene 5:\n\nVying for the top spot in her mother\u2019s life, Khlo\u00e9 shows up to Kris\u2019s to reorganize her kitchen. According to Khlo\u00e9 and Kris\u2019s assistant, Jenna, Kris has always envied Khlo\u00e9\u2019s kitchen and her \u201cKhlo-C-D\u201d (still very problematic) organizational skills. Today, Khlo\u00e9\u2019s bringing her skills all the way to Kris.\n\nIn the midst of Khlo\u00e9\u2019s project, Kris shows up and is thrilled. She\u2019s excited about the organized cookies and teas, and she can\u2019t believe her luck. Interrupting their love fest, Kim arrives carrying Kris\u2019s favorite basket-weave cake from Hansen\u2019s bakery. Kris can\u2019t believe that her other daughter would be so kind as to drop off a cake just because. She\u2019s overwhelmed with gratitude. She\u2019s also overwhelmed with an idea to get more treats from her kids \u2026 so she casually throws in that this is all the cherry on top of her day of massages with Kylie. Like Scene 3, this scene was filmed on August 16, 2017. Which makes a busy day for our Kardashian and Jenner women!\n\nScene 8:\n\nStill eager to win over all of her mom\u2019s affection, Khlo\u00e9 rents out the entire Saks Fifth Avenue in Beverly Hills for a shopping spree with Kris Jenner. The ladies first start with sunglasses, and are completely stunned by a pair that has lenses that lift up to reveal another pair of clear lenses. Then they take a look at clothes, including matching jumpsuits that Kris wants to wear out on the town. Khlo\u00e9 thinks she\u2019s done it \u2014 after this trip, the other kids will be dead to Kris. Odd that Khlo\u00e9 was trying to win over her mom\u2019s affection months before her competition with Kim started, since this scene was filmed on May 19, 2017.\n\nScene 12:\n\nAt Khlo\u00e9\u2019s house, Kim and Khlo\u00e9 concoct a plan to get Kourtney to admit she has a boyfriend. Even after months of dating, Kourtney\u2019s withheld details \u2014 even from her sisters \u2014 about the young, hot model she\u2019s dating, Younes Bendjima. So they decide to FaceTime her with a possible (fake) setup with Chris Hemsworth, a.k.a. Thor. Khlo\u00e9 thinks that Chris is so hot and just the act of declining a date with him means her sister is spoken for. During the call, Kim and Khlo\u00e9 are a fit of giggles as they explain how handsome and gifted her potential suitor is, and even saying it\u2019s Chris Hemsworth. Kourtney doesn\u2019t bite. She claims to be busy, but the sisters know that\u2019s a lie. Even after the sisters reveal their prank and accuse her of being committed, Kourtney admits nothing. This scene was filmed on August 25, 2017. Which makes sense, because Kim is obviously wearing a wig to conceal the yellow hair she had to wear before going platinum blonde in early September.\n\nScene 13:\n\nPossibly pregnant sisters Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Kylie Jenner visit Kim Kardashian at her Bel Air home. The sisters struggle in the 106-degree heat as they climb the steps to Kim\u2019s home, lamenting their outfit choices. Kim\u2019s prepared salads for only herself and Kylie (unfortunately, Kim doesn\u2019t explain why a salad was not prepared for Khlo\u00e9!), but what\u2019s even more shocking than that is a rogue blender sitting on her kitchen counter.\n\nEarlier in the episode, Kris bragged to Khlo\u00e9 and Kim about a SMEG toaster that Kylie bought her \u201cjust because\u201d \u2014 now Kim is giving Kris a SMEG blender to match her other new appliance. Kylie is very confused, and tells the ladies that she never bought her mom a blender and they didn\u2019t even get massages together because Kylie doesn\u2019t like them. This admission turns on a light for Kim and Khlo\u00e9 who now realize that they\u2019ve been played! Kim and Khlo\u00e9 call their mother a \u201cmanipulator\u201d and \u201cpathological liar,\u201d and vow to get her back. This scene was filmed on August 27, 2017.\n\nScene 14:\n\nAt the home of Master Manipulator Kris Jenner, Kim and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian patiently wait for their mother to enter the kitchen so they can toss cake on her as payback. Yet again, they\u2019ve gotten basket-weave cakes from Hansen\u2019s (these cakes cost hundreds of dollars) and as soon as Kris enters, she\u2019s greeted with a fake hug and a cake to the head.\n\nAlarmed, Kris asks why she\u2019s being attacked, and Khlo\u00e9 and Kim happily explain that it\u2019s because she\u2019s a liar using her kids against one another in order to get free goods and services. Kris doesn\u2019t see what she\u2019s done as a scam, and instead thinks her daughters should view her trickery as a life lesson. Basically: Don\u2019t mess with Kris because she will turn the tables on you. Kim and Khlo\u00e9 aren\u2019t satisfied, so they toss yet another cake on their mom. I love seeing Kris covered in desserts, but what I love even more is seeing Khlo\u00e9 and Kim eat cake off the floor. That alone is worth my Spectrum cable package, as trash as it may be. Like Scene 14, this scene was filmed on August 27, 2017\n\nScene 15:\n\nAt home, Kim FaceTimes her family to let them know some great news: Her surrogate is pregnant with a baby girl! It\u2019s no surprise that she\u2019s been trying, so everyone\u2019s happy for her, especially Kris Jenner, who immediately cries.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Kourtney\u2019s reactions are a bit more measured, as they, and even Kim, are unsure of how to properly celebrate the news of a new Kardashian baby when the Kardashian isn\u2019t carrying the baby. It\u2019s a first for the family! (One official KUWTK pregnancy announcement down, two to go.) This scene was most likely filmed on May 9, 2017, considering Khlo\u00e9 mentioned \u201cTaco Tuesday\u201d during her chat with Kim, and this was the last Tuesday of May where Kim had her hair this length, and she also Snapchatted with that phone case on that same day.\n\nScene 17:\n\nAt Khlo\u00e9\u2019s house, Khlo\u00e9 entertains her sisters Kourtney and Kim. Kim drags the Daily Mail, which the previous day said she toured the home she \u201cshared with Kris Humphries.\u201d Now, Kim did tour her old home the day before, but she says the Daily Mail needs to \u201cstop reaching\u201d because \u201cboo didn\u2019t even have a toothbrush, honey!\u201d\n\nKim then moves on to the more serious topic of feeling a disconnect because of the surrogate. Her sisters admit that they even forget she\u2019s expecting a baby sometimes, especially since they don\u2019t see the surrogate. Kim says the reason for that is to protect the woman\u2019s privacy, and to keep her safe. During her previous pregnancies, Kim says, she nearly got into a car accident because of the paparazzi following her. Kim is going to every doctor\u2019s appointment, and she\u2019s hoping to find a way to better connect with her surrogate and baby. This scene was filmed on July 28, 2017.\n\nScene 18:\n\nIn the final scene of the night, Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney tell Kim about the fight they had over Kourtney\u2019s refusal to acknowledge her new boyfriend Younes. Kourtney says it\u2019s because she doesn\u2019t want to bring her relationship on the show (despite the fact that he\u2019s been featured on KUWTK already this season \u2026 ). They\u2019ve since made up, and Kourtney is now more comfortable with calling Younes by name or at the very least calling him \u201cY.\u201d She\u2019s also admitting that he is, in fact, her boyfriend. This is leaps and bounds more open than she\u2019s been in the past regarding Younes, but she\u2019s still cagey about how far her feelings go. She won\u2019t say she loves him, but she does say he\u2019ll be joining her workouts soon, which in the Kardashian family means a ring isn\u2019t too far down the line. This scene was filmed on August 27, 2017.\n\nThat\u2019s it for this week, Dolls! Can\u2019t wait to see you back here next week for another #KUWTKE recap of Keeping Up With Basket-Weave Cake. #LETTHEMEATFLOORCAKE", "images":
