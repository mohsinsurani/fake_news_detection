More info\n\nKate, who is currently pregnant with her third child, appeared with the smallest hint of a baby bump on show through her sky blue floor-length Jenny Packham gown embellished with jewels just two months after Kensington Palace confirmed the news that a new royal baby is on the way. On October 17, Kensington Palace confirmed on Twitter that the due date is in April 2018. Tonight, the Duchess was joined on the red carpet by husband Prince William for the variety performance, and wore sparkly silver stiletto heels which peeped from below her floor length gown. She also held a small silver box clutch, and wore her hair in tight chocolate brown curls which fell around her face. The royal couple arrived an hour later than scheduled for the star-studded evening gala at the London Palladium but were greeted by eager fans and a bunch of flowers for the four-month pregnant Kate.\n\nPA - REUTERS Kate shows off baby bump in glittering gown\n\nKensington Palace tweeted: \u201cThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are tonight attending the @RoyalVariety Performance. \u201cThe Royal Variety Performance takes place every year and is in aid of the @RoyalVariety Charity, of which The Queen is Patron. \u201cThe money raised from the show helps hundreds of entertainers throughout the UK, who need help and assistance.\u201d Tonight\u2019s Royal Variety performance marks a return to the London Palladium Theatre after the event moved elsewhere for the last two years. The Palladium has been home to the Royal Variety Performance more than any other venue, hosting the gala 40 times over the decades. And this year the event is being hosted by comedian Miranda Hart, with guests including the cast of 42nd Street, Paloma Faith, Michael Ball and Seal.\n\nKENSINGTON PALACE The Duchess arrived alongside Prince William\n\nREUTERS Prince William and Duchess of Cambridge were a hour late\n\nThere was a false start to the event as the curtain did not go up for the first act - a glittering tap dance bonanza from the cast of the 42nd Street stage show. Host Miranda Hart jokingly teased the audience about whether they spotted if anything had gone wrong before reintroducing the act. Kate, 35, was left in fits of giggles when her husband was forced into a spot of audience participation with the lights shining on him. Wiliam, 35, enthusiastically took part in a comedy skit with Hart, obligingly shouting her catch-phrase \"such fun\" on request.\n\nPA Kate in sky blue gown embellished with jewels\n\nREUTERS Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge, attends the Royal Variety Performance\n\nHart, who said compelling the future King to participate was on her to-do list for her Royal Variety duties, said she later hoped to see him galloping - another one of her trademarks - and \"knighting me with a lightsaber\". Singer James Blunt, who was due to the perform, was a last minute withdrawal after the delayed start meant he would not make an later concert appearance, according to a theatre spokesman. A Kensington Palace spokesman said the royal couple had been \"delayed\" but were in time for the start of the performance. The performance will be shown on ITV in December.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/884067.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/884067.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vickiie Oliphant"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/884067/kate-middleton-bump-baby-news-royal-variety-performance-prince-william", "title": "Kate Middleton baby bump in glittering gown for Royal Variety Performance", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "THE Duchess of Cambridge showed off her baby bump in a glittering gown as she stepped out with Prince William for tonight's Royal Variety Performance hours after the Oxford Circus incident.", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 823607694325129, "pages": 129617873765147}, "og": {"title": "Kate shows off baby bump in glittering gown for Royal Variety", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/884067/kate-middleton-bump-baby-news-royal-variety-performance-prince-william", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/884067.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "headlines,ctp_video,autoplay_video,kate middleton,kate middleton bump baby,prince william,oxford circus", "section": "Royal", "description": "THE Duchess of Cambridge showed off her baby bump in a glittering gown as she stepped out with Prince William for tonight's Royal Variety Performance hours after the Oxford Circus incident."}, "news_keywords": "headlines,ctp_video,autoplay_video,kate middleton,kate middleton bump baby,prince william,oxford circus", "article": {"tag": "oxford circus", "published_time": "2017-11-24T20:34:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-24T20:34:09+00:00", "expiration_time": "2017-12-24", "section": "Royal", "image_count": 5, "video_count": 1, "word_count": 744, "internal_link_count": 4, "external_link_count": 0, "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "Vickiie Oliphant", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/884067.jpg", "title": "Kate shows off baby bump in glittering gown for Royal Variety", "description": "THE Duchess of Cambridge showed off her baby bump in a glittering gown as she stepped out with Prince William for tonight's Royal Variety Performance hours after the Oxford Circus incident."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Kate shows off growing baby bump at Royal Variety Performance after Oxford Circus lockdown", "vf": {"image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/237x141/884067_1.jpg", "container_id": "express-prod-884067", "site_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0ed77b31aaaf"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all", "dataLayer": "{\"page\":{\"attributes\":{\"publicationName\":\"express\",\"ownerSite\":\"express\",\"ownerSiteDomain\":\"www.express.co.uk\",\"platformType\":\"responsive\",\"cmsPlatform\":\"Daily Express CMS\",\"pageType\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"106\"}},\"article\":{\"articleId\":\"884067\",\"articleTitle\":\"Kate shows off growing baby bump at Royal Variety Performance after Oxford Circus lockdown\",\"articleAuthor\":\"Vickiie Oliphant\",\"firstPublishDate\":\"2017-11-24\",\"firstPublishTime\":\"20:34:00\",\"attributes\":{\"primaryTag\":\"Prince William \",\"allTags\":\"Prince William |Kate, Princess of Wales, Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge|Lockdown|kate middleton|kate middleton bump baby|prince william|oxford circus\",\"isAdvertorial\":false,\"isNative\":false,\"affiliateLinks\":false,\"activeLegalProceedings\":false,\"nudity\":false,\"isSensitive\":false}}}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511555640.0, "source": "https://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
