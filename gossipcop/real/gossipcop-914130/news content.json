With pals such as Jennifer Lawrence, Jake Gyllenhaal, Judd Apatow and Chelsea Handler looking on, comedian John Early \u2014 dressed in drag as Reverend Vicky \u2014 led a casual ceremony that saw the I Feel Pretty actress, 36, reading self-penned vows to her forever valentine. Says the insider, \u201cIt was very sweet, touching and, of course, funny.\u201d\n\nThe overall vibe, says the source, could be described as \u201cchill.\u201d Due to the last-minute nature, guests filtered in and out of the 6,000-square-foot spread. Some gathered around the fireplace; others sat on the deck at round tables decorated with succulents, pink roses and anemones, or sampled oysters from the raw bar, situated beside an ice sculpture of a nude man.\n\nAs the evening wore on, Schumer slipped into a sweater and pants to belt out tunes with sister and bridesmaid Kim Caramele. \u201cEveryone was having a good time,\u201d gushes the insider. \u201cIt was very laid-back \u2014 just how Chris and Amy wanted it.\u201d\n\nFor more details \u2014 and photos! \u2014 from the mid-week wedding, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly, on stands now!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-schumer-chris-fischer-wedding-02.jpg?crop=68px%2C0px%2C861px%2C452px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-schumer-chris-fischer-wedding-02.jpg?crop=68px%2C0px%2C861px%2C452px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Grossbart"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/inside-amy-schumers-very-laid-back-wedding-to-chris-fischer/", "title": "Inside Amy Schumer\u2019s \u2018Very Laid-Back\u2019 Wedding to Chris Fischer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "In a chill February 13 Malibu affair, Amy Schumer agreed to forever with her valentine, chef Chris Fischer \u2014 Us has all the details on their wedding", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Inside Amy Schumer's 'Very Laid-Back' Wedding to Chris Fischer", "description": "In a chill February 13 Malibu affair, Amy Schumer agreed to forever with her valentine, chef Chris Fischer \u2014 Us has all the details on their wedding", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/inside-amy-schumers-very-laid-back-wedding-to-chris-fischer/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-22T14:00:31+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-schumer-chris-fischer-wedding-02.jpg?crop=68px%2C0px%2C861px%2C452px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-schumer-chris-fischer-wedding-02.jpg?crop=68px%2C0px%2C861px%2C452px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-02-22T14:00:31+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Grossbart", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Inside Amy Schumer's 'Very Laid-Back' Wedding to Chris Fischer", "description": "In a chill February 13 Malibu affair, Amy Schumer agreed to forever with her valentine, chef Chris Fischer \u2014 Us has all the details on their wedding", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amy-schumer-chris-fischer-wedding-02.jpg?crop=68px%2C0px%2C861px%2C452px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519308031.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
