Botched really does bring the drama, you guys. Meet 27-year-old Jonathan Dylan, who's seeking out the services of stars Dr. Paul Nassif and Dr. Terry Dubrow on a new episode of the show. His lips are a big deal, but not big enough apparently...\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube.

So when I was 25 I started getting botox and fillers [and] I became obsessed with lip injection.\"\n\nDylan now has so much filler in his lips that he can't close his mouth completely, a condition the doctors call \"lip incompetence.\" (Which I'm p. sure is also doctor code for, \"you clearly don't understand what this is doing to you.\") And that's not even plot twist! Dylan quickly learns that if he keeps up with his injections, his lips could LITERALLY FALL OFF. I wish I was joking. This is a thing that might actually happen.\n\nGiphy\n\nTo make matters more complicated, Dylan has made a brand for himself off of his abnormally large lips. He refers to himself as a \"Ken Doll\" on Instagram, often hashtagging his own photos with #livingkendoll. But when there's a distinct possibility your lips will actually die, that should be a solid indication enough is enough!? Hopefully Dr. Nassif and Dr. Dubrow can talk some sense into him before all lip-hell breaks loose. Literally loose.\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.
