We are.\n\nOn Tuesday, Ashley Iaconetti and Jared Haibon publicly announced that after meeting three summers ago on Bachelor in Paradise, they\u2019re finally an item \u2014 and Bachelor Nation collectively lost it. From diehard fans to reluctant ones, all were united in their joy that these two reality stars, seemingly against all odds, finally found a way to make it work.\n\n\u201cUm. Ok so here\u2019s the thing, I watch the Bachelor franchise, it\u2019s my biggest weakness of character,\u201d tweeted one fan. \u201cAnd normally it\u2019s just funny and ridiculous and a good laugh/feminist nightmare watching the bulls\u2014. BUT ASHLEY I AND JARED ARE TOGETHER AND I AM LEGIT ECSTATIC ABOUT IT.\u201d\n\n\u201cI like to think I\u2019m not Bachelor trash but then again I just saw that Ashley I and Jared are finally dating and started crying so,\u201d tweeted another.\n\n\u201cMe: Love is dead. Everyone\u2019s getting divorced. What\u2019s the point. Me after watching Jared & Ashley\u2019s \u2018The Story of Us\u2019: Wow. Love is so alive. Can\u2019t wait to fall in love and be happy forever,\u201d tweeted another.\n\n\u201cAshley I. And Jared are finally dating and honestly if that doesn\u2019t prove that true love is worth waiting for, then idk what does,\u201d tweeted another.\n\nWant to keep up with the latest from PEOPLE?

Because for as long as we\u2019ve been watching them on TV, it seemed like they were doomed to fail.\n\nThe couple met on season 2 of BIP in 2015 \u2014 and as viewers are well aware, it was pretty much love at first sight for Iaconetti. But while they went on dates (even an overnight one!), Haibon wasn\u2019t quite as enamored.\n\nRick Rowell/ABC/Getty\n\nRick Rowell/ABC/Getty\n\nThe result? A seemingly endless flow of tears from Iaconetti, who developed a reputation for sobbing in confessionals over her unrequited love.\n\nNevertheless, the two remained friends even after things didn\u2019t work out \u2014 and viewers could hardly believe their eyes when they learned that the pair would both return for season 3 of BIP the following year. But if you thought things would be different this time, think again.\n\nFor yet another summer, fans watched Iaconetti pine over Haibon, unapologetically sabotaging his chances with fellow contestant Caila Quinn. But still, Haibon resisted Iaconetti\u2019s advances, and it seemed all but obvious that these two would never work out.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ashley Iaconetti Explains Why She \u2018Friend Zoned\u2019 Former Bachelor Ben Higgins\n\nFinally, Iaconetti decided it was time to move on. In late 2017, she jetted off to filmanother ABC spinoff, The Bachelor Winter Games, where she met Kevin Wendt. The two started dating \u2014 just as Haibon had begun to realize that maybe what he was looking for had been in front of him all along.\n\nThe giddy duo recapped their journey for fans in a tear-filled episode of Iaconetti\u2019s show The Story of Us, and Haibon admitted Iaconetti\u2019s new relationship felt like \u201ca kick in the a\u2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remember I heard rumors that she might have met somebody, and I was sad,\u201d he said. \u201cSometimes I need a kick in the a\u2014. That was a big kick in the a\u2014.\u201d\n\nAfter production on Winter Games wrapped, Haibon and Iaconetti reunited for a formerly planned vacation to St. Lucia with Iaconetti\u2019s sister Lauren and Bachelor alums Tanner Tolbert and Jade Roper in January.\n\n\u201cGoing into St. Lucia, I did a lot of self-reflection \u2026 trying to figure out what I want, what I should do, if I should do anything,\u201d Haibon said of weighing whether or not to tell Iaconetti about his feelings for her. \u201cIt\u2019s so unfair for me to say anything. Ashley goes on a show, finds another guy and now I\u2019m gonna say something? What kind of a\u2014hole does that?\u201d\n\nEventually, however, he decided to come clean \u2014 and took a page right out of a romantic comedy when he planted a kiss on Iaconetti just as she was about to board her flight home.\n\nBut even after sharing a romantic smooch at the airport, Iaconetti wanted to give her relationship with Wendt a fair shot.\n\n\u201cI thought \u2018Okay, well that\u2019s everything I\u2019ve ever wanted, but I\u2019m definitely gonna continue dating this other guy,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI do like him. He\u2019s pursued me \u2026 he\u2019s been all in the entire time and I deserve to pursue somebody else and for somebody else to pursue me after all this time.\u201d\n\nAs Winter Games was airing, however, Iaconetti knew her relationship with Wendt was over, and she called it quits in early March.\n\n\u201cI just knew in my heart at that point that it wasn\u2019t right with Kevin,\u201d she said. \u201cI ended the relationship because it had run its course \u2014 and then Jared was still there.\u201d\n\nAnd the rest is history. Looks like fairytales do come true, after all!", "images":
