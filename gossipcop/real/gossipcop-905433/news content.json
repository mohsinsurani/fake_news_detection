Here's how it all went down.\n\nThough she and Ackerley tied the knot in December 2016, the couple didn't embark on their newlywed getaway until after the actress filmed I, Tonya. The pair then jetted off to Tahiti for a joint vacation, which started off with a four-day stay in a secluded part of the island in a hut, sans electricity. But for the second half of their trip, they stayed at a luxury hotel.\n\nUpon arrival, Robbie and Ackerley decided to hit the hotel gym, but for the workout, he chose to wear \"his oldest gym shorts, and they're tiny,\" the actress recalled. \"And there's nothing underneath there.\" It was fine though, the couple thought. Who could they possibly run into?\n\nLo and behold, the two find Ellen DeGeneres and her wife Portia de Rossi running on treadmills\u2014beside Barack Obama. (The former president spent time in French Polynesia to write his book.)\n\nBut that wasn't all. The five of them also took part in a small workout class together, which was equal parts uncomfortable and hilarious, considering Ackerley's lacking attire. Ellen demonstrated just how short\u2014and wide\u2014his shorts were:\n\nAnd, unfortunately for Tom, the stretch positions weren't very flattering either:\n\n\"It was a very confined space, and we then had to do this whole stretching class and Tom meanwhile is trying to like, not reveal anything,\" Robbie said, laughing. \"And he\u2019s dying and I\u2019m crying so much, I\u2019m about to crack a rib.\"\n\n\n\nThat's one workout class we're actually upset to have missed. Hear Robbie and DeGeneres tell the full story below.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2478974-012-1665067784.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-margot-robbie-ellen-index-1515606021.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/image003-1665237979.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0674xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665155826.jpg?crop=0.984xw:1.00xh;0.00962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2479931-003-1665162992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0192xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665151779.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-arriving-for-lunch-at-the-abbey-of-san-news-photo-1665070515.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0551xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-margot-robbie-ellen-index-1515606021.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.218xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-and-gisele-b-c3-bcndchen-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1664907170.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-del-castillo-teresa-mendoza-lrds3-tlmd-2-1664910940.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0566xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-margot-robbie-ellen-index-1515606021.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a15051404/margot-robbie-meeting-ellen-barack-obama/", "title": "Margot Robbie Had a Hilariously Embarrassing Encounter with Obama on Her Honeymoon", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Margot Robbie Shares Embarrassing Story of Meeting Barack Obama -
