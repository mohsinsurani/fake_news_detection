We\u2019ve covered Fashion Week in the past and it\u2019s always been a blast. This season, Lauren had her own runway show for her limited edition LC Lauren Conrad Runway Collection . It was the first time Lauren has ever had a show at NYFW, and it was literally a dream come true for all of us! The collection was even more beautiful than we could have imagined, and we were so proud of all the hard work that Lauren put into it. Being there to share in the experience had to be one of our favorite moments since we launched LaurenConrad.com almost five years ago.\n\nSo today we wanted to give you a behind-the-scenes peek at Lauren\u2019s runway show in the form of a fun little Photo Diary. We hope you\u2019ll feel like you were right there alongside us!\n\nWe arrived in New York a few days before the show to prep. Lauren spent the week leading up to the show doing model castings, fittings, walk-throughs of the space, and more. You can\u2019t beat that NYC skyline, can you?\n\nHere we are living that hotel life, and flipping through Lauren\u2019s October Cosmo cover story of course\u2026\n\nThe night of the show everything was a buzz. Here are just some of the hundreds of fresh blooms that decorated the runway\u2026\n\nMeanwhile the models were getting into hair and makeup backstage\u2026\n\nLauren\u2019s makeup artist Amy Nadine designed the soft and pretty makeup look you saw on all the girls, and Kristin Ess created the beautiful braided hair concept\u2026\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget the rose gold manicures\u2026\n\nThere were charts backstage to help the dressers get each model into the correct looks\u2026\n\nAnd Team LC had backstage passes to see how everything was coming together so beautifully\u2026\n\nBefore the show began Lauren did a first look at all the models\u2026\n\nShe was pretty excited for the show to start (we all were!)\u2026\n\nThe show itself was a dream\u2026 And when Lauren walked out on the runway at the end, we were all so proud of her. Lauren worked tirelessly on this collection, and it turned out beautifully! (We immediately started shopping the collection on our phones.)\n\nAfter that, it was time to celebrate! We had a big team dinner at Beauty & Essex with all of Lauren\u2019s friends and family\u2026\n\nWhere we sipped on these delicious cocktails\u2026\n\nThe next day Lauren did The Meredith Viera Show (you can tune in next month)\u2026\n\nAnd here\u2019s a close-up of her LC Lauren Conrad Runway Collection outfit\u2026\n\nWe hope you enjoyed this behind-the-scenes look at Lauren\u2019s runway show.
