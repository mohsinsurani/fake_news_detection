When you talk about salary, I don't think it's just about cash, but the love and respect that you give to someone. My mother has been the biggest inspiration in my life. All mothers, they just sacrifice so much for their kids. So, I believe the profession which deserves the highest salary, respect and love should be of a mother.[28][29][30]\n\nOn 18 November 2017, Chhillar was crowned Miss World 2017 by outgoing titleholder Miss World 2016, Stephanie Del Valle from Puerto Rico in the finals in Sanya, China.
