[Shaking my damn head].\u201d\n\nHart and wife \u2014 Eniko Parrish, 32 \u2014 married last August in a lavish California ceremony after a two-year engagement and many years together. \u201cI already feel married, the wedding is really just for her,\u201d he told Entertainment Weekly at the time.\n\nThe couple broke their baby news in May, telling PEOPLE that they are expecting their first child together \u2014 a little boy. \u201cWe are overjoyed about our new addition to our family,\u201d they said in a joint statement. (Hart also has two children from a previous marriage: son Hendrix, 9\u00bd, and daughter Heaven, 12.)\n\nKevin Hart/Instagram\n\nThe two lovebirds have never been shy about showing their affection for one another on social media, frequently posting sweet pics of each other from intimate family moments \u2014 including their engagement and wedding.\n\nShe shared on Wednesday that she had reached the six-month mark of her pregnancy, and was feeling \u201cGREAT.\u201d\n\nHart previously told Entertainment Weekly he always puts his family first and never wants to let fame get in the way.\n\n\u201cRegardless of my level of success, I don\u2019t ever want to lose the family feeling of a home,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be in a mansion where I have to find my kids on the east wing,\u201d he continued. \u201cI want to sit on the couch and be able to yell into the kitchen, \u2018Hey come on, let\u2019s go outside and ride a bike!\u2019 I like two dogs, I like a fence. I don\u2019t need no dolphins. I don\u2019t need a shark in my shark tank.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kevin Hart and Wife Eniko Parrish Are Expecting Their First Child Together\n\nEarlier this month, the Philadelphia-born comedian revealed that he\u2019s leaving the important task of naming his third child up to Parrish. However, he does have one stipulation for the moniker.\n\n\u201cFor me, I\u2019m just thinking about anything with a Kevin in it,\u201d Hart said. \u201cI don\u2019t care what it is as long as Kevin is in there somewhere.\u201d", "images":
