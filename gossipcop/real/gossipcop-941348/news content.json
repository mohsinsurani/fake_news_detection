{"url": "https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-west-hair-waves-ponytail-cfda-awards", "text": "Kim Kardashian typically keeps her hair sleek and straight, either down or in an Ariana-adjacent ponytail, but on Monday night, she showed up to the 2018 CFDA Fashion Awards wearing \u2014 gasp \u2014 waves. And not just any waves: these were seriously dense waves that are apparently just her natural hair texture, but enhanced.\n\nAccording to a press release, the uncharacteristic hairdo was the brainchild of Color Wow Global Creative Director Chris Appleton. To achieve the look, he first prepped Kardashian's hair with Color Wow Brass Banned Correct & Perfect Mousse for Dark Hair for texture and definition, which he further added by blowing the hair with a diffuser. After that, he applied the Color Wow Pop & Lock Gloss Treatment to make things shiny.\n\nThe final steps involve a $200 curling iron and a hair band or ponytail holder. The curling iron in question is the ghd Curve Classic Curl Iron, which Appleton used to curl random sections of hair for even more defined waves. To complete the look, according to the press release, he pulled Kardashian's hair into a high pony, softening the look by pulling out the edges and wrapping hair around the ponytail's base.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a9a4071e277a4fee6552/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967472176.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98c071e277a4fee6550/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967454982.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98c071e277a4fee6550/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-967454982.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/63330b4ab92ee9720de0b0a6/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633d9dc13a56bbe75a4ba3d2/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c41b42bebdf1fd177c06e/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633b174c05e5ae04f63d53d4/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a9925d8ffb30720c0546/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967407992.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c4a0360c6adbac3e921a3/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6331be6ac8e0f29b05646eb9/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98f7cc3af30d5faa516/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-967440786.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/63222c2f9650fe336baa57eb/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98c071e277a4fee6550/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-967454982.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Emily Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-west-hair-waves-ponytail-cfda-awards", "title": "Kim Kardashian Wears Her Hair in Natural Waves for 2018 CFDA Awards", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Straying from her signature straight hairstyle, Kim Kardashian wore her hair in a wavy ponytail to the 2018 CFDA Awards, which is apparently her natural texture.", "id": "5b16a902071e277a4fee654c", "keywords": "snd,kim kardashian west,kim kardashian,cfda awards,2018 cfda awards,hair style,wavy hair,ponytail", "news_keywords": "snd,kim kardashian west,kim kardashian,cfda awards,2018 cfda awards,hair style,wavy hair,ponytail", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b16a902071e277a4fee654c", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Straying from her signature straight hairstyle, Kim Kardashian wore her hair in a wavy ponytail to the 2018 CFDA Awards, which is apparently her natural texture.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98c071e277a4fee6550/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-967454982.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98c071e277a4fee6550/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-967454982.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Her hairstylist Chris Appleton breaks down the look.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98c071e277a4fee6550/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-967454982.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Kim Kardashian Wore Her Naturally Wavy Hair Texture to the CFDA Awards", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/kim-kardashian-west-hair-waves-ponytail-cfda-awards"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-05T16:21:33.153Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-05T16:21:33.153Z", "author": "Emily Wang"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Her hairstylist Chris Appleton breaks down the look.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b16a98c071e277a4fee6550/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-967454982.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Kim Kardashian Wore Her Naturally Wavy Hair Texture to the CFDA Awards"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528215693.153, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
