Spoiler alert! If you don't want major 'The Bachelorette' spoilers, don't read past the photo of Becca Kufrin.\n\nHarbor found himself behind center instead of his usual tight end position during the game. It can be assumed he didn't want to run over everyone.\n\nEarly in the game, Harbor showed off his arm strength by throwing a 25-yard touchdown pass to Pro Football Focus blogger Mike Renner in the back of the end zone.\n\nBut with seconds on the clock and his team trailing in the \"Becca Bowl,\" Harbor decided to take matters into his own hands.\n\n\"We've been poking at the bear all day,\" actor Leandro Dottavio said before Harbor went beast mode on the contestants. \"Finally, Clay decided to let loose and really just go insane.\"\n\nHarbor took the snap and looked downfield, but it was all a trick as he went for the ol' quarterback draw \u2014 what this sportswriter considers the best play in the playbook.\n\nHe brushed off one tackle and then another before hitting the B button on the XBOX controller for a devastating spin move.\n\nBut when Harbor decided to put the stiff arm on the last two defenders on his way to a touchdown, he immediately grabbed his left wrist and laid on the ground in the back of the end zone.\n\n\"Oh God, is he OK?\" Kufrin said in fear.\n\nHe wasn't OK and later, Kufrin wouldn't be either.\n\nHarbor later took himself out of the rose competition to address his wrist injury.\n\nHe returned and received a rose from Kufrin.\n\nSo all is well in love and football, right? Wrong.\n\nAt the end of the cocktail party, Harbor was told that he needed surgery and was faced with a difficult decision: sacrifice millions of dollars to pursue a girl he met a few weeks before, or pursue love?\n\nSitting by the fire \u2014 with a cast on his left wrist \u2014 Harbor awaited the Bachelorette.\n\n\u201cSeeing Clay at the afterparty made me smile so much, I didn\u2019t expect him to make it back from the hospital,\u201d Kufrin said. \u201cIt melts my heart that he\u2019s showing up for me and that means a lot. I\u2019m finally finding a spark for Clay\u2026 and I like it.\u201d\n\nBut then Harbor snuffed out the tender flame.\n\nWhile saying football helps him pay for his family, Harbor said he knew he had to leave the show.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m regretting it already,\u201d Harbor said while failing to look Kufrin in the eyes.\n\n\u201cI definitely think what I had with Becca was special,\u201d Harbor said in one of those reality TV interviews away from the action. \u201cIt was tough to walk away from that. I definitely could\u2019ve been the one standing there in the end with her, and that\u2019s something I\u2019m always going to wonder about.\u201d\n\nAs they kissed goodbye, Kufrin told Harbor to go take care of himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m really going to miss Clay,\u201d Kufrin said while crying. \u201cI gave him the rose last night for a reason. We were finally getting somewhere. Watching him walk away \u2014 it\u2019s just not easy.\n\n\u201cHe has such a big, big heart.\"\n\nAfter the show's airing on Monday night, Harbor updated the world on his injury while thanking \"The Bachelorette\" for the opportunity.\n\n\"I want to thank everyone for the love and support!\" Harbor tweeted. \"Definitely the hardest decision I\u2019ve ever made but I believe everything happens for a reason. I am working hard to get back on the field and turn this negative into a positive.\n\n\"I have to thank the whole @BacheloretteABC family for an amazing experience in hindsight I don\u2019t regret my decision to come on and would gladly give my wrist for a chance at love.\n\n\"That being said the show was filmed months ago and after a tough rehab I am finally ready to play some football. I look forward to finding a team and seeing you all on NFL Sunday\u2019s. Thanks for all thoughts and prayers!\"\n\nIt's curious Harber mentioned he would gladly give his wrist for a chance at love, considering he didn't give his wrist for a chance at love with Kufrin.\n\nWyatt D.
