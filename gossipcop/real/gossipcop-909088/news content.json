The announcement, made by Hasty Pudding Theatricals President Amira T. Weeks, was met with loud applause and cheers from the crowd gathered.\n\nHasty Pudding Theatricals to Let Women Join Cast\n\n\u201cWith no further fanfare, the graduate board of the Hasty Pudding Institute has determined that, commencing with the 2019 Hasty Pudding Show, that Hasty Pudding welcomes women to audition for roles in the show,\u201d Weeks read in a letter from the graduate board.\n\nThe Hasty Pudding Institute was founded in 1795 as a social club and boasts five US Presidents among its members, according to the group\u2019s website.\n\nThe Theatricals began performing in 1844, often lampooning politics and current affairs through burlesque-influenced skits. With men performing all the roles, the annual performances became known for their use of drag. Each show also ends with an all-male kick line, according to the group\u2019s site.\n\nHasty Pudding Theatricals - A Visual History!\n\nHasty Pudding had come under fire for excluding women on stage. A recent Boston Globe column encouraged Kunis to reconsider accepting the Woman of the Year award since the group did not allow women to perform.\n\nHasty Pudding Woman of the Year Mila Kunis enjoys a parade in her honor. Kris Snibbe/Harvard University\n\n\u201cHow they can continue to do so, especially now, when women in Hollywood and their allies are on a crusade against sexism and harassment, is unfathomable,\u201d columnist Yvonne Abraham wrote.\n\nIn a news conference during Thursday\u2019s Woman of the Year festivities, Kunis said she \u201cwouldn\u2019t be here\u201d if the change had not been made.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t a stipulation, it was just something that to me was very important,\u201d she said. \u201cTo clarify, this is something this program has always wanted to do. It has nothing to do with me or today. It is simply something that was going to happen inevitably.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/iysnJwjS7jM/hqdefault.jpg", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/oMHGpZDUiMQ/hqdefault.jpg", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180126121407-01-harvard-theater-troupe-mila.jpg?q=x_437,y_519,h_728,w_1295,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180126121407-01-harvard-theater-troupe-mila.jpg?q=x_437,y_519,h_728,w_1295,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180126121619-02-harvard-theater-troupe-mila.jpg?q=x_0,y_748,h_900,w_1600,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160616111914-sarah-jorgensen-profile.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180126121407-01-harvard-theater-troupe-mila.jpg?q=x_437,y_519,h_728,w_1295,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Jorgensen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/26/us/harvard-theater-troupe-casting-women-trnd/index.html", "title": "Harvard's famed Hasty Pudding troupe will cast women.
