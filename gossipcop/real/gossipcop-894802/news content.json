Seeing this brings me to tears (because) as your teammate I expected more from you ...\"\n\nRaisman's mother, Lynn, tweeted this shortly after Douglas's message began to spread.\n\nDouglas later issued an apology for her initial tweet, which had already been deleted.\n\nRaisman recently detailed her experiences with Nassar and his \"uncomfortable\" treatment sessions in her new autobiography, Fierce. Nassar is currently in jail, facing multiple charges related to alleged abuse.", "images": ["https://www.si.com/.image/MTc4NjUxNDI4MzkzMzMwNDY0/mty5ndy3njg3otk3njmwmtu3.svg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzk3ODc1NzI0MzYzNDcy/usa-curling.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/MTkyMjgyODYzNzc5OTgwODQ2/si_logo_with_extra_padding.svg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMzc5NTM2NzgyOTI3NzYy/ap22259631492689-1.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTQxMDYzMDE4Nzg0MDAw/ali-olympic-torch-lighting-lead.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_60%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_600/MTY3NDcxMDIwMjQ3MDk4OTky/si_logo_60x600_red.png", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNTgyNzIxNzUzNTg5NDk3/eliud-kipchoge.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Ch_60%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_60/MTY2OTg1MjczNjczMDAwNjIx/connor-grossman.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MTA3MDM3NTMyMzAwNjcy/gabby-douglas-tweetjpg.jpg", "https://www.si.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMjE3OTU1MDEyOTc3OTAw/beijing-olympic-rings.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.si.com/.image/t_share/MTY4MTA3MDM3NTMyMzAwNjcy/gabby-douglas-tweetjpg.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Connor Grossman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.si.com/olympics/2017/11/18/aly-raisman-gabby-douglas-usa-gymnastics-scandal", "title": "Gabby Douglas tweet to Aly Raisman called out by Simone Biles", "meta_data": {"author": "Connor Grossman", "description": "Team USA gymnast Gabby Douglas has sinced apologized for her quote-tweet of teammate\u00a0Aly Raisman, who recently detailed abuse she says she suffered from a former team doctor.", "keywords": "aly raisman,Olympics,larry nassar,usa gymnastics scandal,usa gymnastics", "section": "Olympics", "pagetype": "article", "tags": "aly raisman, larry nassar, usa gymnastics scandal, usa gymnastics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "item-id": "ci02553c88c02a2580", "published": "2017-11-18T00:23:29Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "ABG-SI LLC.
