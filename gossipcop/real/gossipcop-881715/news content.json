This time, however, the calamity struck home as the 51-year-old actress hails from Coatzacoalcos, Mexico.\n\nAfter announcing her donation to the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) to aid in their rescue and rehabilitation operations in the earthquake-struck country, she implored her fans and Instagram followers to do anything to help.\n\n\"The people of my country have now suffered three natural disasters in a row. Many children and families are hurt and in terrible need,\" Salma Hayek wrote in the Instagram post.\n\nShe also launched a crowd-sourcing campaign through Crowd Rise to raise money to aid in the aftermath of the devastating calamities that hit her home country.\n\n\"Please join me and contribute what you can and thank you,\" she added.\n\nRecalling the 1985 earthquake that struck Mexico where she was evacuated from her building, Salma said many of her friends and relatives perished during that time, emphasizing the horrifying nightmare the victims of Wednesday's tremblor may be in.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/408a7e4769d130cb16bb1c27f3d52e1d?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6fec051a-189e-48d7-b369-4d2ebfc3a189.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e494db4a-e9aa-4be6-a73c-2041f4691eb1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5d5cf9e5-a519-4c4c-a12e-46eff7aecb30.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4509613/salma-hayek-donates-100k-to-earthquake-victims-in-mexico-urges-fans-to-help-as-death-toll-rises-to-over-200/", "title": "Salma Hayek Donates $100K To Earthquake Victims In Mexico, Urges Fans To Help As Death Toll Rises To Over 200", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Salma Hayek Donates $100K To Earthquake Victims In Mexico, Urges Fans To Help As Death Toll Rises To Over 200", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4509613/salma-hayek-donates-100k-to-earthquake-victims-in-mexico-urges-fans-to-help-as-death-toll-rises-to-over-200/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Salma Hayek Donates $100K To Earthquake Victims In Mexico, Urges Fans To Help As Death Toll Rises To Over 200", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-09-20 22:15:01Z", "section": "Celebrities"}, "description": "Salma Hayek Donates $100K To Earthquake Victims In Mexico, Urges Fans To Help As Death Toll Rises To Over 200", "keywords": "Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505945701.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
