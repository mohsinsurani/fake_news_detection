Thank you, everyone, for all your love and support during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nBobby, the owner of Zarin Fabrics, beat thyroid cancer in 2009 but it returned in 2013 and spread to his lungs. In November 2016, Jill revealed that the cancer had spread to his brain, but said in a statement at the time that they were determined to \u201cremain strong.\u201d\n\nShe was hopeful after he left the hospital in August 2017 after undergoing chemotherapy. \u201cIt\u2019s been the most emotional time in our lives and couldn\u2019t have gotten to where we are without help from many,\u201d she captioned an Instagram pic that showed them out to dinner. \u201cI wake up everyday now so grateful to see Bobby getting stronger.\u201d\n\nThe couple celebrated their 18th wedding anniversary earlier this month.\n\n\u201cHappy 18th! Anniversary to the love of my life Bobby Zarin. Bobby is the most perfect man I know,\u201d the 54-year-old reality TV star captioned a photo collage of them together. \u201cHe never loses anything, never forgets anything and when I think he is wrong\u2026 he is always right!\u201d\n\nAn insider told Us Weekly in November 2017 that Bobby was \u201creally fighting\u201d as he encouraged his family to go about their daily routines. \u201cBobby\u2019s not giving up but there\u2019s not much fight left,\u201d the insider added.\n\nHe is survived by Jill, his three children from a previous relationship \u2014 Jonathan, David and Jennifer \u2014 and stepdaughter Ally.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/480466736_jill-zarin-bobby-zarin-zoom-ed540a83-96cd-48da-a3f1-651f62a9b099.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/480466736_jill-zarin-bobby-zarin-zoom-ed540a83-96cd-48da-a3f1-651f62a9b099.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bobby-zarin-dead-jill-zarins-husband-dies-at-71-after-battle-with-cancer/", "title": "Jill Zarin\u2019s Husband Bobby Dies at 71 After Battle With Cancer", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "'Real Housewives of New York City' star Jill Zarin's husband, Bobby Zarin, died at 71 on Saturday, January 13, after a long battle with cancer \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jill Zarin's Husband Bobby Dies at 71 After Battle With Cancer", "description": "'Real Housewives of New York City' star Jill Zarin's husband, Bobby Zarin, died at 71 on Saturday, January 13, after a long battle with cancer \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/bobby-zarin-dead-jill-zarins-husband-dies-at-71-after-battle-with-cancer/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-15T17:33:20+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/480466736_jill-zarin-bobby-zarin-zoom-ed540a83-96cd-48da-a3f1-651f62a9b099.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/480466736_jill-zarin-bobby-zarin-zoom-ed540a83-96cd-48da-a3f1-651f62a9b099.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-14T00:24:45+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-01-15T17:33:20+00:00"}, "author": "Kathy Campbell", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jill Zarin's Husband Bobby Dies at 71 After Battle With Cancer", "description": "'Real Housewives of New York City' star Jill Zarin's husband, Bobby Zarin, died at 71 on Saturday, January 13, after a long battle with cancer \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/480466736_jill-zarin-bobby-zarin-zoom-ed540a83-96cd-48da-a3f1-651f62a9b099.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515889485.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
