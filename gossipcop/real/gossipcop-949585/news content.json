Here\u2019s why she\u2019s \u2018happier\u2019 with a more low-key celebration.\n\nTaylor Swift, 28, has thrown some pretty epic Fourth of July parties in years past, but she\u2019s forwent the epic celebration in 2017, and now again in 2018. This year, she instead spent her time off from touring to go to Turks and Caicos with boyfriend Joe Alwyn, 27.\n\n\u201cTaylor likes keeping things a little more low key nowadays because it works for her to have alone time and she is enjoying the time she needs and has with Joe,\u201d a source close to the singer tells HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY. \u201cIt is very important for her for that to be private.\u201d\n\nThe 10-time Grammy winner has been keeping her relationship under wraps. The pair have only been photographed out together a handful of times despite dating for well over a year. Taylor also rescinded from the spotlight in 2016, and has been living more privately ever since. Our insider adds that the \u201cDelicate\u201d hitmaker intends on keeping her life this way. \u201cShe is not interested in all the craziness from previous years. She has matured to this way of life and it fits and suits her so well,\u201d our source explains. \u201cShe is happy and healthy and she\u2019ll definitely continue this moving forward.\u201d\n\nTaymerica might be a thing of the past, but fans were still delighted when paparazzi photos of their idol surfaced online on July 5. The images showed Taylor swimming and snorkeling in the ocean with Joe, and they looked incredibly happy together. The \u201cShake It Off\u201d songstress also paid tribute to her favorite holiday by rocking a red and white striped high-waisted bikini. Don\u2019t worry Swifties, the Old Taylor is still alive and well.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/taylor-swift-why-she-didnt-have-a-fourth-of-july-party-again-this-year-happier-because-of-it-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/mariah-carey-vegas-residency-lip-syncing-spl-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/emily-bikini-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F07%2F07%2Ftaylor-swift-reason-skipping-fourth-of-july-party-happier-joe-alwyn%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3233214", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/arya-stark.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://2.gravatar.com/avatar/260c1efde9e5f671381a52a12c2e3dc9?s=64&d=https%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/nora_matchcourt_1_pr.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/missing-shows-featured.jpg?w=200&resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15476338&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/taylor-swift-why-she-didnt-have-a-fourth-of-july-party-again-this-year-happier-because-of-it-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/tiny_ti-pissed.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/thumbnail-large.jpg?resize=230%2C135&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/07/taylor-swift-why-she-didnt-have-a-fourth-of-july-party-again-this-year-happier-because-of-it-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Courteney Larocca"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203/https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/07/taylor-swift-reason-skipping-fourth-of-july-party-happier-joe-alwyn/", "title": "Taylor Swift: Why She Didn\u2019t Have A Fourth Of July Party Again & Is \u2018Happier\u2019 Because Of It", "meta_data": {"description": "Here's why Taylor Swift skipped hosting a Fourth of July party for the second year in a row.", "news_keywords": "Joe Alwyn, Taylor Swift", "generator": "WordPress.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Taylor Swift: Why She Didn\ufffdt Have A Fourth Of July Party Again & Is \ufffdHappier\ufffd Because Of It", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180707220203/https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/07/07/taylor-swift-reason-skipping-fourth-of-july-party-happier-joe-alwyn/", "description": "Taylor Swift opted to skip her Fourth of July bash for the second year in a row to go snorkeling with boyfriend Joe Alwyn.
