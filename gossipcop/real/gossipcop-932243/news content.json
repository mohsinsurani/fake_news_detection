Cheryl Burke and Matthew Lawrence celebrated their impending nuptials with a sweet engagement party full of loved ones, as seen in a series of photos posted to the Dancing With the Stars alum\u2019s Instagram on Friday, July 27.\n\n\u201cThis past weekend @matthewlawrence and I celebrated our engagement with our families and some of our closest friends, and I\u2019ve been daydreaming of it ever since,\u201d the professional dancer wrote of the bash thrown by DWTS pro Kym Johnson and her husband, Shark Tank\u2018s Robert Herjaveck.\n\nOne of those friends included Lawrence\u2019s former Boy Meets World costar, Ben Savage, who shared a photo of himself next to the actor. \u201cCongratulations on your engagement @matthewlawrence,\u201d he wrote, adding, \u201cSo happy for you and @cherylburke.\u201d\n\nThe night was especially sweet for the bride-to-be, who lost her father, Stephen Burke, in March. Two months later, her now-fianc\u00e9, 38, proposed to the reality star with the same diamond that Stephen gave Cheryl\u2019s mother, Sherri.\n\n\u201cThis year has been an emotional roller coaster to say the least, but getting to share this night with the people I love most reminded me of how important it is to celebrate the joy in our lives,\u201d Burke wrote of the party. \u201cIt was perfect.\u201d\n\nScroll through to see the pics!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cheryl-Burke-Matthew-Lawrence-Engagement-Party-Kendall-Johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C149px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cheryl-Burke-Matthew-Lawrence-Engagement-Party-Kendall-Johnson.jpg?w=1200&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cheryl-Burke-Matthew-Lawrence-Engagement-Party-Kendall-Johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C149px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Briese"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/cheryl-burke-matthew-lawrence-share-engagement-party-pics/", "title": "Cheryl Burke, Matthew Lawrence Share Engagement Party Pics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "gallery", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Cheryl Burke shared photos from her engagement party with fianc\u00e9 Matthew Lawrence on Friday, July 27 \u2014 pics", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cheryl Burke and Matthew Lawrence\u2019s \u2018Perfect\u2019 Engagement Party: Pics", "description": "Cheryl Burke shared photos from her engagement party with fianc\u00e9 Matthew Lawrence on Friday, July 27 \u2014 pics", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/cheryl-burke-matthew-lawrence-share-engagement-party-pics/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-30T14:09:51+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cheryl-Burke-Matthew-Lawrence-Engagement-Party-Kendall-Johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C149px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cheryl-Burke-Matthew-Lawrence-Engagement-Party-Kendall-Johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C149px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-29T21:55:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-30T14:09:51+00:00"}, "author": "Nicole Briese", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cheryl Burke and Matthew Lawrence\u2019s \u2018Perfect\u2019 Engagement Party: Pics", "description": "Cheryl Burke shared photos from her engagement party with fianc\u00e9 Matthew Lawrence on Friday, July 27 \u2014 pics", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Cheryl-Burke-Matthew-Lawrence-Engagement-Party-Kendall-Johnson.jpg?crop=0px%2C149px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532901321.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
