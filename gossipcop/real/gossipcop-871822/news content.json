The Mom actor\u2014who announced in August 2017 that she and Pratt had broken up\u2014told Shepard she isn\u2019t sure what the purpose of marriage is anymore.\n\n\u201cIs it safety for your children? Is it convention? Is it so other people respect your relationship more?\u201d Faris mused. \u201cFor me, I\u2019m just not quite sure where [marriage] fits.\u201d\n\nFaris, who shares a five-year-old son with Pratt, said that \u201cit feels so easy to get married\u201d at first, but \u201cthe untangling\u201d of a divorce gets messy, especially when it becomes a legal ordeal. \u201cI am a romantic. I believe in partnership, I believe in companionship,\u201d she explained. \u201cI just don\u2019t know I believe in the ceremony of a wedding.\u201d (In case you forgot, Faris was first married to actor Ben Indra from 2004 to 2008.)\n\nFunnyman Shepard, 43, went on to ask Faris if she felt any pressure around her decision to split from Pratt since many fans viewed them as \u201c#couplegoals.\u201d Shepard, who is married to Kristen Bell, prefaced the question by revealing he feels pressure around his own relationship with 37-year-old Bell, since the internet also idolizes them as a couple.\n\n\u201cChris and I did talk about [letting people down],\u201d Faris said. \u201cWe got on the Twitter feed, [saw] the \u2018love is dead\u2019, \u2018relationship goals.'\u201d\n\nShe elaborated: \u201cI think what we were also guilty of, although we had an unbelievable marriage\u2026 we obviously cultivated something. And it was rewarding for awhile. It was like, \u2018Oh people seem to think we got all this shit alright.'\u201d\n\nUm, is this not the most honest discussion about the reality of Hollywood relationships you\u2019ve heard from an A-lister?!\n\nA post shared by Anna Faris (@annafaris) on Aug 6, 2017 at 8:02pm PDT\n\nShepard then asked Faris if she felt a sense of \u201cembarrassment\u201d now that the world knows her relationship with Pratt wasn\u2019t as peachy as it appeared to be from the outside, and asked if she worries about fans feeling lied to.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know if embarrassment is quite the right word, [but] something akin to that, I think,\u201d she said. \u201cI had a little bit of a childish feeling like, Oh come on f-cking grow up, like a little anger [around the idea]. But that isn\u2019t fair either, because we intentionally cultivated the idea of \u2018look at this beautiful family.'\u201d\n\nBut before you start to question everything Faris and Pratt happily posted on Instagram, Faris said their public personas were based on a meaningful relationship. \u201cThere there were so many moments that were like that,\u201d she told Shepard. \u201cBut of course, just like anything on social media, you don\u2019t post like, \u2018Where the f-ck is the toilet paper?!\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cI think [social media] is a very hard forum to be genuine on, and I think it does a disservice to people to not be.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s super refreshing that Faris is being so real about her marriage and the way social media has influenced people\u2019s perception of it. After all, we\u2019ve all been guilty of putting personal stock into her relationship with Pratt.\n\nWe wish you nothing but happiness, Anna\u2014online and off.\n\nRelated:\n\nHere\u2019s Everything We Know about Anna Faris\u2019s Rumoured New BF\n\nOlivia Munn Shut Down Rumours She\u2019s Dating Chris Pratt in the Best Way\n\nGigi and Zayn Broke Up and We Are Beside Ourselves", "images": ["https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FB_AnnaFaris.jpg", "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/INLINE_AnnaFaris.jpg", "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/info.png", "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/themes/flare.com/assets/images/logo.png", "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Laura-Hensley_avatar_1532014272.png", "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/close.png"], "top_img": "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FB_AnnaFaris.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Hensley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.flare.com/celebrity/anna-faris-dax-shepard-interview/", "title": "Anna Faris Just Said Some Heartbreaking Things About Her Marriage to Chris Pratt", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "contextly-page": "{\"title\":\"Anna Faris Just Said Some Heartbreaking Things About Her Marriage to Chris Pratt\",\"url\":\"https:\\/\\/www.flare.com\\/celebrity\\/anna-faris-dax-shepard-interview\\/\",\"pub_date\":\"2018-03-27 12:15:35\",\"mod_date\":\"2018-03-27 15:07:33\",\"type\":\"post\",\"post_id\":\"669371\",\"author_id\":\"135580\",\"author_name\":\"Laura Hensley\",\"author_display_name\":\"Laura Hensley\",\"tags\":[\"Anna Faris\",\"Celebrity Couples\",\"Instagram\"],\"categories\":[\"Celebrity\",\"Sex &amp; Relationships\"],\"image\":\"https:\\/\\/www.flare.com\\/wp-content\\/uploads\\/2018\\/03\\/FEATURE_AnnaFaris.jpg\",\"image_alt\":\"Anna Faris Dax Shepard Interview: In a photo taken while they were still together, Anna Faris smiles at the camera while Chris Pratt kisses her head.\"}", "description": "On an episode of Dax Shepard's podcast, Anna Faris opened up about her split from Chris Pratt\u2014and it was super real and emotional", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Anna Faris Just Said Some Heartbreaking Things About Her Marriage to Chris Pratt", "description": "Grab your tissues", "url": "https://www.flare.com/celebrity/anna-faris-dax-shepard-interview/", "site_name": "FLARE", "updated_time": "2018-03-27T19:07:33+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FB_AnnaFaris.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FB_AnnaFaris.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 628, "alt": "Anna Faris Dax Shepard Interview: In a photo taken while they were still together, Anna Faris smiles at the camera while Chris Pratt kisses her head."}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/FLAREFashion", "tag": "premium", "section": "Celebrity", "published_time": "2018-03-27T16:15:35+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-27T19:07:33+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Grab your tissues", "title": "Anna Faris Just Said Some Heartbreaking Things About Her Marriage to Chris Pratt", "site": "@FLAREfashion", "image": "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/FB_AnnaFaris.jpg", "creator": "@FLAREfashion"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.9.14", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.flare.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/favicon.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522167335.0, "source": "https://www.flare.com", "summary": ""}
