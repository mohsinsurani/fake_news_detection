The two are going through a divorce, but have maintained a positive, friendly relationship despite the split. And that was clear when they reminisced about the good times in Los Angeles.\n\nRelated Story How to Get a Reading With the Long Island Medium\n\nBefore they met, Larry opened up about his new life in California, and said moving away helped him distance himself from the stress of his life. He was filmed working out in the gym, where a new focus on his health has led to a whole new physique. \u201cI\u2019ve worked on myself, and I\u2019ve realized that this is a new chapter in my life and to embrace it and to make the best of it,\u201d he said.\n\nHe told his friend Kejo what he wanted out of meeting Theresa. \u201cI know there are some things that I want to say and need to tell her,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been a part of my life for so long that I just want to know how she\u2019s doing, and I\u2019m sure she\u2019d like to know how I\u2019m doing. And I want to tell her how I\u2019m doing.\u201d\n\nThe two sat down at a restaurant in Santa Monica, California to talk about the year they had lived on separate coasts. They discussed their children, their parents, and how they both look back on their decades together fondly despite how things ended.\n\nLarry wanted to clear the air about why he moved to California, but Theresa said she understood. \u201cIt seems like a long time, and what can I tell you? It\u2019s been an adjustment,\u201d Larry said. \u201cAnd I miss everybody. I don\u2019t want you to think that I just up and left and ran away.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing, Larry, it just wasn\u2019t working,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cThings were so tense between us in the end, and I feel like as hard and as difficult it was for us to separate, we could have stayed and things could have went horrifically wrong, and we might not be sitting here.\u201d\n\n\n\nIn the end, the conversation was friendly and heartfelt, and Theresa later said it \u201cset the tone\u201d for when they meet in the future. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to reflect on everything, and I just want to thank you for all our wonderful years. Because they were,\u201d Larry said. \u201cI helped you grow, and you helped me grow, and you helped me be the person I am today. I\u2019m proud of you and I\u2019m proud to have been a part of your success.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou still are,\u201d Theresa said. \u201cWe have 33 years together, you just can\u2019t dismiss that, and I wouldn\u2019t want to. At the end of the day, no matter what, we can continue as a unit for our children as role models.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gh-latinx-podcasts-1631554062.png?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.251xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/american-idol-2022-noah-thompson-girlfriend-son-instagram-1665073979.png?crop=0.357xw:0.250xh;0.282xw,0.131xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/quannah-chasinghorse-attends-the-2022-met-gala-celebrating-news-photo-1665168452.jpg?crop=0.704xw:1.00xh;0.202xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664901235.jpg?crop=0.624xw:0.934xh;0.149xw,0.0660xh&resize=180:*", "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/_assets/design-tokens/goodhousekeeping/static/images/logos/network-logo.450dbba.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/flambe-1576907206.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-middleton-heckled-1665154772.jpg?crop=0.481xw:0.962xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/787dcfa8-029c-4ade-acab-5650f77a019f.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pictured-larry-caputo-theresa-caputo-photo-by-charles-sykes-news-photo-152184247-1541523602.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.00346xh&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/where-to-watch-stream-smile-2022-movie-1665071290.png?crop=0.304xw:0.554xh;0.404xw,0.128xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/candace-cameron-bure-wild-halloween-instagram-celebrity-reactions-1665163961.jpg?crop=0.465xw:0.929xh;0.514xw,0.0513xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/theresacaputoextra-939802108-1525798628.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/best-movies-for-kids-2022-dc-super-pets-1637700741.jpg?crop=0.423xw:1.00xh;0.226xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chicago-pd-jesse-lee-soffer-emotional-goodbye-instagram-jesse-lee-soffer-as-detective-jay-halstead-in-chicago-pd-1665154985.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.316xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/theresa-larry-caputo-1541523514.png?crop=1.00xw:0.890xh;0,0.0482xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/law-and-order-svu-mariska-hargitay-kelli-giddish-instagram-1665166723.png?crop=0.486xw:0.891xh;0.00801xw,0.0853xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/74086-s6-the-great-british-bake-off-s6-17-1664288376.jpg?crop=0.669xw:1.00xh;0.175xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/greys-anatomy-season-19-ellen-pompeo-husband-leaving-reaction-1665099840.jpg?crop=0.591xw:0.419xh;0.205xw,0.0227xh&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/theresa-larry-caputo-1541523514.png?crop=1.00xw:0.890xh;0,0.0482xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.goodhousekeeping.com/life/entertainment/a24739440/theresa-larry-caputo-reunite-long-island-medium/", "title": "Theresa and Larry Caputo Discussed Separation and Divorce on \u2018Long Island Medium\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Theresa and Larry Caputo Discussed Separation and Divorce on  \u2018Long Island Medium\u2019", "description": "\"Long Island Medium\" star Theresa Caputo saw her ex, Larry, for the first time in months.
