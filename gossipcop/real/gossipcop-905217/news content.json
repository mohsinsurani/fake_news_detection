The three women said that Simmons raped them in separate incidents that spanned from 1988 to 2014.\n\nAlso Read: Russell Simmons Says He'll Prove 'Without Any Doubt' That He's Not a Rapist\n\nWednesday\u2019s report followed previous accusations made by actress and \u201cRachel Getting Married\u201d screenwriter Jenny Lumet, as well as former model Keri Claussen Khalighi, who Simmons allegedly sexually assaulted when she was 17.\n\nSimmons has denied the allegations, and on Thursday vowed to clear his name.\n\nAlso Read: Russell Simmons Accused of Rape by 3 Women\n\n\u201cToday, I begin to properly defend myself.
