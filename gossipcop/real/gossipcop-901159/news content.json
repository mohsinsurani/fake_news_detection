From bringing to life the one and only Troy Bolton in the High School Musical movies, to playing Link in the 2007 movie version of Hairspray, to now starring in The Greatest Showman, Zac knows his way around a song and dance. Or so we thought. Basically, Zac just went ahead and crushed us all by admitting that the musical life as much as he loves it, actually doesn't come all that naturally to him. WILD.\n\nIn an interview with the Los Angeles Times along with his co-star, the queen that is Zendaya, Zac pointed out that since it's been 10 years he was back in his musical roots, he wasn't all that confident in his abilities to pull it off again.\n\n\"I was nervous: Can I dance, still? Can I keep up with choreography? This was gonna be a level up from anything I\u2019d ever done before. People keep thinking I\u2019m a dancer. I\u2019m not a dancer! I do the same two-step with a little twist,\" Zac said.\n\nSo despite that fact that you know, Zac is now a full-blown movie star having been in more than 20 movies so far in his career, he was unsure of himself. Crazy to think about, he seems like such a confident guy all the time! But if anything, Zac has proven time and time again the musical life is something he had to work hard at. We all know he didn't sing in the first HSM movie although he wanted to and he said in an interview way back in 2008 when he was promoting High School Musical 3: Senior Year, learning all the dance steps for the musical numbers is a struggle.\n\n\"I'm definitely not a dancer. I grew up being into sports and I wasn't trained to move my body in the right way for dancing. I'm the last one to get any move correct. In rehearsals it's always, 'OK, one more take for Zac',\" he said. So the fact that Zac came back to musicals proves The Greatest Showman must be spectacular. And hey Z, your dance moves have always looked pretty solid to us, if we say so ourselves.\n\nLove J-14?
