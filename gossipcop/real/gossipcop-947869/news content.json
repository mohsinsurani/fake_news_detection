When Ashcraft's husband was left incapacitated by the struggles of life on the open sea, Ashcraft was forced to sail them both 700 miles across the ocean to get to the nearest land.\n\nAs you can imagine, that kind of struggle wears on you. Ashcraft said she survived only on non-perishables the couple had previously stored on the boat, and most of her meals throughout the journey consisted of sardines and Spam. Of course, when Woodley was cast in the role, she had to replicate the physical deterioration Tami actually experienced \u2014 and, contrary to her caption on this Instagram, it wasn't easy.\n\nAccording to the 26-year-old actress, in order to shed pounds for the role, she skipped dinner every night and ate nothing but \"a can of salmon, some steamed broccoli and two egg yolks every day.\" She also said she couldn't sleep when she was hungry, so she'd drink wine at night in order to \"pass the f--- out.\" Um, who wouldn't?!\n\nweek 2 of #adrift : \u2714\ufe0f. thank you #fiji, and @mrsamclaflin for making this photo look like the dream filming this movie is. A post shared by shailene woodley (@shailenewoodley) on Jul 21, 2017 at 8:43am PDT Jul 21, 2017 at 8:43am PDT\n\nAlthough Woodley's preparation for the film made her \"miserable,\" she said it was all worth it in the end because she felt very close to Ashcraft's story. She remembered reading about it when the catastrophe first occurred and recalled sobbing as she learned what had happened. Another saving grace for the actress was her costar, Sam Claflin. \"I don't know that I could do it without Sam. We both really were there for one another in our moments of extreme exhaustion and hunger,\" she said.\n\nLuckily, when filming was over, Woodley went right back to eating a healthy diet. She's now back in action, filming another season of \"Big Little Lies\" alongside stars Reese Witherspoon, Nicole Kidman, Zo\u00eb Kravitz and Meryl Streep. We'll be watching Woodley in both roles (and drinking our own glasses of wine as we imagine what it must have been like for her to go on that extreme diet).\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite
