Kris Jenner, 61, secretly plants a tracking device on her mom Mary Jo Campbell, 83, so she can, you know, keep up with her. However, as we saw in the helicopter parent horror story that is the \u201cArkangel\u201d episode of Black Mirror, this can only go terribly wrong. Watch the new clip from the Jan. 7 episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians above!\n\nKris buys MJ a new pair of shoes\u2026and neglects to tell her about the tracking device in the creepy clip. \u201cAnytime you\u2019re wearing a shoe, put this in and it\u2019ll just be more comfortable for you,\u201d Kris tells her mom. Kris! No! See more pics of Kris Jenner here.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want MJ to feel like I\u2019m breathing down her neck, but I really want to know where she is all the time so I know she\u2019s OK,\u201d Kris says in a confessional. Okay, but that\u2019s what Rosemarie DeWitt\u2018s character thought when she implanted a chip in her daughter\u2019s head, too, and we all know how that went.\n\n\u201cI bought her a pair of shoes to go with these amazing tracking devices. They will let me know exactly where Mary Jo is 24/7. I love technology,\u201d Kris gushes, totally unaware of the potential disaster that\u2019s yet to come. Oh, God.\n\nHollywoodLifers, do you think Kris has gone too far? Or is she right to want to keep tabs on MJ? Watch the clip, then tell us in the comments!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kylie-wants-to-retire-from-celebrity-life-permanently-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/http://0.gravatar.com/avatar/ffe8e0cd4423bc47b7ca39f097b6b4e8?s=64&d=http%3A%2F%2Fs0.wp.com%2Fi%2Fmu.gif&r=G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/babara_blana-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kris-jenner-pulls-a-black-mirror-plants-tracker-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F01%2F05%2Fkris-jenner-tracks-mom-kuwtk-black-mirror-video%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2934851", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/ftr.png?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/kris-jenner-pulls-a-black-mirror-plants-tracker-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gabriella Ginsberg", "Music Editor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180108073451/http://hollywoodlife.com/2018/01/05/kris-jenner-tracks-mom-kuwtk-black-mirror-video/", "title": "Kris Jenner Totally Pulls A \u2018Black Mirror\u2019 & Plants A Secret Tracking Device On Her Mom In Wild Clip", "meta_data": {"description": "Kris Jenner pulls a \"Black Mirror\" and plants a tracking device on her mom MJ -- just like the \"Arkangel\" episode!
