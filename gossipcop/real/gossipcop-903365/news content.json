The Silicon Valley actor co-wrote the romantic dramedy with wife Emily V. Gordon, based on their actual courtship (Zoe Kazan portrays her onscreen, and Holly Hunter and Ray Romano play her parents).\n\nThe titular sickness remains unnamed throughout most of the movie, as it was to Gordon for much of her life. Ten years ago, she was a therapist in Chicago who was eight months into a relationship with the standup comedian. Gordon initially thought she simply caught a stubborn cold or, at worst, pneumonia. She fainted while getting an X-ray and soon found herself in the emergency room.\n\nAfter eight days of tests while in a medically induced coma, she was diagnosed with adult-onset Still\u2019s disease (AOSD), an extremely rare form of arthritis that can shut down major organs when left untreated \u2014 as with Gordon, who had accumulated fluid in her lungs and was having trouble breathing.\n\n\u201cBasically, your organs can start getting inflamed as if they\u2019re under attacked and have an infection, but they\u2019re not,\u201d Gordon tells The Hollywood Reporter during a chat at New York City\u2019s Four Seasons Hotel. \u201cBecause I wasn\u2019t diagnosed or being treated for it, it just kept getting worse and worse. My organs kept getting more and more inflamed until I had to be hospitalized.\u201d\n\nThe autoimmune disease is extremely rare \u2014 there are an estimated 1.5 cases per 100,000 to 1,000,000 people \u2014 and usually manifests when patients are between the ages of 18 and 40. Its cause and ultimate cure are still unknown, though the condition is relatively manageable after diagnosis.\n\n\u201cI just have to practice self-care in the ways we all should be doing \u2014 get enough sleep, eat healthy and regularly, exercise and keep my stress and drinking down \u2014 but I have to be a little more diligent about it because if I slip on any of those, my immune system can act up,\u201d Gordon explains of controlling her condition, which she does with Nanjiani\u2019s help. \u201cMy parents call him my lion, and he really is. At times when I\u2019m not great at self-care, he will force me to be good about it.\u201d\n\nAOSD can either be episodic or chronic, and its symptoms, which can vary and range in severity, include high fever, skin rashes and joint pain. Gordon\u2019s condition is episodic, with relatively manageable flare-ups occurring only a few times each year.\n\nWhen an episode seems imminent, Gordon makes sure to communicate openly with Nanjiani. \u201cWhen it first happened, [I felt] the guilt of, how could I not see this happening? She was with me, and she got so sick \u2014 how could I not know?\u201d he recalls. \u201cEmily can be so stoic about it. She can be super sick and still have a great attitude. So part of the process for us has been Emily telling me, \u2018Hey, I feel something coming on,\u2019 and then me trying not to freak out for a little while.\u201d\n\nGordon then cancels all her upcoming commitments so she can rest and take medication. \u201cIf I\u2019m sick, I don\u2019t have the ability to work through it \u2014 I have to stop,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cIt\u2019s not that bad. I just can\u2019t leave the house for a few days.\u201d\n\nNanjiani \u2014 who admits that \u201cwhen I have a 99-degree fever and a sniffling nose, I\u2019m such a baby\u201d \u2014 follows suit in solidarity. \u201cI don\u2019t really take care of her in the traditional sense, but what happens is on day two, Emily is cleaning the entire house or trying on dresses!\u201d he laughs. \u201cLet\u2019s try and own this, and have a good time if we can. It\u2019s time to relax, lie on the couch and watch movies. Let\u2019s eat cakes and shit.\u201d\n\nCoincidentally, The Big Sick debuts alongside drafts of Trump\u2019s health care bill, which allows states to opt out of Obamacare\u2019s ban on refusing to cover pre-existing conditions like AOSD. \u201cThis movie wasn\u2019t supposed to be political, but [if not for my insurance coverage,] I would still have those astronomical bills,\u201d says Gordon. \u201cWe all need to take care of our health, and we all need help to do that.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/gettyimages-695404740_1_-_embed_2017.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/024a_tbs_sg_30719-h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/033_tbs_day_006__4113_r_-_embed_217.jpg?w=928", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/024a_tbs_sg_30719-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/024a_tbs_sg_30719-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Lee"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/big-sick-emilys-illness-is-real-based-a-distressing-true-story-1015698/", "title": "How Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V.
