His coach had been urging him for years to lose weight, Rippon said, and the skater thought that if he was just a little thinner, just a little leaner, he would please the judges and land more quadruple jumps.\n\n\"It makes me dizzy now to think of it,\" Rippon said of his severe diet in 2016. Getty Images\n\nRippon, 28, opened up about this difficult time in his life in a recent, candid interview with the New York Times. The skater, who just won a bronze medal in Pyeongchang as part of the figure skating team event, said he used to feel constant pressure to look like his thin, teenage rivals.\n\n\u201cI looked around and saw my competitors, they\u2019re all doing these quads,\" he told the Times, referring to skating jumps with four revolutions. \"And at the same time they\u2019re a head shorter than me, they\u2019re 10 years younger than me and they\u2019re the size of one of my legs.\"\n\nWe often hear female athletes talking about body confidence, but it\u2019s less common to hear a male athlete speak so openly about eating disorders and body image issues. Rippon said that by opening up about his past struggles, he hopes to help others.\n\nThe Olympic medalist revealed he struggled for years with eating and body image issues. Getty Images\n\nBody image issues are nothing new in the world of figure skating. Olympic skater Gracie Gold made headlines last year when she revealed she would not compete in Pyeongchang because she was in treatment for \u201cdepression, anxiety and an eating disorder.\u201d\n\n\"Definitely athletes in the spotlight \u2014 figure skaters, especially \u2014 are under pressure to fit a certain mold, and fit a certain body type,\" Gold told TODAY Style in 2017. \"It's really easy to be critical of ourselves in that way ... oh, this person's arms look a little bigger. It's easy to start playing that game. But people have different builds. I think a lot of athletes struggle with that.\"\n\nGracie Gold competing in the Trophee de France ISU Grand Prix in 2016 Joosep Martinson / Getty Images\n\nRippon struggled with body image problems for years. When he was 10, his first coach told his mom that he would never be a top figure skater because of his \u201cheavy bottom,\u201d he told the Times. In his teens, his mother confronted him when she noticed he was eating mostly vegetables, and encouraged him to adopt a more well-rounded diet.\n\nHe did \u2014 for a while. But in 2012, Rippon began training with a new coach who pushed him to lose weight. Rippon eventually adopted his punishing three-slices-of-bread-a-day diet.\n\nRippon said his coach often pressured him to lose weight. Reuters\n\nA wake-up call finally came last year, when he broke his foot during a warm-up exercise.\n\n\u201cI think I had a stress fracture before I broke my foot,\u201d Rippon told the Times. \u201cI think that was absolutely because I was not getting enough nutrients.\u201d\n\nHe began working with a nutritionist, who helped him develop a healthier attitude toward eating. As his diet improved, he began to feel more energy throughout the day.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t realize I was so tired all the time,\u201d he said.\n\nNow, Rippon weighs 150 pounds \u2014 10 more than he did in 2016 \u2014 and he has a new outlook on his body and his relationship with food. He says he can\u2019t imagine going back to his previous diet.\n\n\u201cIt makes me dizzy now to think about it,\u201d he said.", "images":
