Dear god, he is a child, he does not know any better. You did the same with Mason. What is your point?\u201d\n\nAnother simply wrote, \u201cCut that poor child\u2019s hair.\u201d\n\nOther commenters expressed frustration over having trouble telling Reign apart from his 6-year-old sister Penelope, who also has long hair of a similar color.\n\nIn addition to complaining about Reign\u2019s hair length, numerous social media users also shamed Kardashian for not giving her son a towel, as they thought he appeared to look cold in the image. \u201cDude your kid looks freezing, aren\u2019t u gonna do something,\u201d wrote one critic.\n\nOthers slammed Kardashian for saying she was shopping in the photo caption, arguing that she should have been paying more attention to her child.\n\nStill, despite the opinions of some, just as many commenters came to Kardashian\u2019s defense, pointing out that the length of a child\u2019s hair isn\u2019t important.\n\n\u201cComments regarding innocent children are so unnecessary,\u201d wrote one Instagram user. \u201cHe\u2019s a little boy for goodness sake\u2026long hair, short hair, no hair\u2026does it really matter?\u201d\n\nAnother fan pointed out that many male celebrities \u2014 including Harry Styles \u2014 have had long hair, and nobody seems confused about their sex.\n\n\u201cAll these people out here tryna say they confuse Reign for a girl simply cos he has long hair,\u201d the user wrote. \u201cOh yeah, I mistake Harry Styles and Jared Leto for women all the time smdh get a life! He looks fabulous, the same as the rest of the family.\u201d\n\n\u201cStop shaming this amazing mom!\u201d wrote another supporter. \u201cAnd for the rest of the judgmental a\u2014, this is not your son to say to cut his hair or you can\u2019t tell him or P apart; it\u2019s NOT your child! People said the same to me about my sons long hair, he loved it, I loved it, that\u2019s all that matters!\u201d\n\nAlthough Kardashian has yet to respond to the criticism over her child\u2019s hair, she did recently shut down speculation that she was pregnant, after posing with her hand on her belly during a Thanksgiving video.\n\nThe reality star spent Thanksgiving with her famous family in California, and could be seen striking a pose that had fans questioning whether she had a fourth child on the way in a video shared by sister Kendall Jenner.\n\n\u201cIs Kourt pregnant?\u201d a fan asked in the comments section, to which the non-expectant star replied jokingly, \u201cNo, but how good does my arm look in that last photo?\u201d in reference to the final image in Jenner\u2019s post that showed Kardashian loading up her plate.", "images":
