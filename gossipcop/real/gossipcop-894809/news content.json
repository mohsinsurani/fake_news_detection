Though they didn't play each other's love interests -- Astin was paired with Oscar nominee Anna Kendrick in the film -- the pair have given fans couples envy on their social media feeds with sweet snaps of their relationship. Camp also made a cameo as Aubrey, a tightly wound Barden Bella, in this summer's sequel, though it's unclear if either will appear in \"Pitch Perfect 3,\" which is set for 2017.\n\nSee more of Entertainment's top stories on Facebook >>\n\nIt'll be the second marriage for the actress.
