To close out the show, the YMCMB rapper fired off her scathing diss verse as part of Katy Perry\u2019s basketball-themed \u201cSwish Swish\u201d performance.\n\n\u201cSilly rap beefs just get me more checks,\u201d she raps on the track. \u201cSwish, swish, all my haters is obsessed / \u2018Cause I make Ms, they get much less.\u201d\n\nFollowing subliminal lyrics from both sides, Remy Ma sparked the public feud in February 2017, when she released \u201cshETHER,\u201d a song that made no attempts to hide animosity. Shortly after that, she followed up with a second shot with \u201cAnother One.\u201d\n\nAfter challenging Remy to \u201cdrop a hit,\u201d Nicki responded to these verbal taunts with \u201cNo Frauds\u201d and \u201cChanged It\u201d. Since then, the two seemed to continue going back and forth, despite claims that the beef is over.", "images": ["https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/themes/sloth/dist/images/logo-black.png", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/logo-black.png", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/r-logo.png", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/remy-ma-nicki-minaj-vmas.jpg", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/themes/sloth/dist/images/logo-white.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7513696&cv=3.6.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/remy-ma-nicki-minaj-vmas.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.rap-up.com/2017/08/28/remy-ma-reignites-nicki-minaj-beef-at-vmas/", "title": "Remy Ma Reignites Nicki Minaj Beef at VMAs", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Remy Ma Reignites Nicki Minaj Beef at VMAs", "url": "https://www.rap-up.com/2017/08/28/remy-ma-reignites-nicki-minaj-beef-at-vmas/", "site_name": "Rap-Up", "image": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/remy-ma-nicki-minaj-vmas.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rapup", "modified_time": "2022-04-30T09:13:00+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Remy Ma Reignites Nicki Minaj Beef at VMAs", "image": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/remy-ma-nicki-minaj-vmas.jpg", "site": "@rapup"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "fb": {"pages": 40433812843}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.rap-up.com/2017/08/28/remy-ma-reignites-nicki-minaj-beef-at-vmas/?ia_markup=1"}, "google-site-verification": "hg8TJjxD0R_w7C1yMhSQlqwYmfhi3W3LpVJNMA5wJNs", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rap-up-favicon.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503874800.0, "source": "https://www.rap-up.com", "summary": ""}
