Though better known for her controversial reality television series, Kardashian West is deeply entrenched in the world of fashion. She was even honored as an influencer by the Council of Fashion Designers of America this year.\n\nNorth, who turned 5 on June 15, appeared with her mother and grandmother, Kris Jenner, in the second series of an international fashion campaign to celebrate Fendi's 10th anniversary of their Peekaboo bag. The three appeared in a video and stills designed to elicit the family bond of three generations of women.\n\n\"Starting with @kimkardashian, her mother @krisjenner and daughter North West, who for the first time share a different side of their personalities through a series of candid and spontaneous shots,\" read an Instagram post from the Italian label.\n\nThe three generations of Kardashian women also starred in a heavily desaturated video that makes the cinematography of \"The Handmaid's Tale\" look downright vibrant. North, dressed in a ruffled shirt, skirt and oversized blazer, can be seen trailing her mom (sporting thigh-high Fendi logo boots, as one does on hikes) through tall grass, picking wildflowers and sitting in an open field with Granny Kris before retreating to the pool. It's all set to husband Kanye West's \"Love Lockdown.\"\n\nOn Instagram, Kardashian West wrote, \"These @fendi memories \u2728 I will always cherish shooting this campaign with my mom @krisjenner & daughter.\"", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/1362e85a9d5885dbfb84aeb59d14042fe265a19d/c=98-0-1630-1152/local/-/media/2018/02/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636542142650660964-GTY-663923238.jpg?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b9a44034f21f31d2daf67d83e39d36662c8195eb/c=0-39-1726-1014/local/-/media/2018/02/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636542142650660964-GTY-663923238.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b9a44034f21f31d2daf67d83e39d36662c8195eb/c=0-39-1726-1014/local/-/media/2018/02/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636542142650660964-GTY-663923238.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matthew Wilson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/07/10/north-west-makes-modeling-debut-kim-kardashian-and-kris-jenner/771620002/", "title": "North West makes modeling debut with Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/07/10/north-west-makes-modeling-debut-kim-kardashian-and-kris-jenner/771620002/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "North West makes modeling debut alongside mom Kim Kardashian West and  grandma Kris Jenner", "description": "North West, who is all of five years old, just made her modeling debut for Fendi alongside mother Kim Kardashian West and grandmother Kris Jenner.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/b9a44034f21f31d2daf67d83e39d36662c8195eb/c=0-39-1726-1014/local/-/media/2018/02/14/USATODAY/USATODAY/636542142650660964-GTY-663923238.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "North West, who is all of five years old, just made her modeling debut for Fendi alongside mother Kim Kardashian West and grandmother Kris Jenner.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531177200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
