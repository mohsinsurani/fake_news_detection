Overnight Ciara released her single \u201cLevel Up\u201d, which is the first single she has released since \u201cDance Like We\u2019re Making Love\u201d back in 2015. She begins the music video by stating, \u201cOK, remember I told you: Be your own boss. Love yourself. Get up and dance. Level up!\u201d.\n\nThe song\u2019s title is very clearly directed at her controversial #LevelUp social media posts. In January she had reposted a video clip from John Gray\u2019s \u201cHe Who Finds a Wife\u201d sermon, in which the she states, \u201cToo many women want to be married, but you\u2019re walking in the spirit of \u2018girlfriend.'\u201d Amid backlash, the twice-married singer explained, \u201cI was once that girl wanting to be loved a certain way but was making the wrong choices. I found myself at my lowest moment. I was a single mom sitting at home, and then I realized that the perfect love I was looking for was how God loves me, how He wants me to be loved, and who He was calling me to be as a mom and a woman. That\u2019s when I realized married or not married\u2026I needed to love myself.\u201d\u201d\n\nCiara has not yet announced when her album will be released.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/BAull_SmallAd.jpg?fit=300%2C105&ssl=1", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/image.png", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/hotgeneric-1280x389.jpeg", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/AP21260631563165-1920x1278.jpg?resize=238%2C178&ssl=1", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Maine_Celtics_Primary_Icon-2401x2401.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Hayley_SmallAd-copy.jpg?fit=300%2C105&ssl=1", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/pheelzwebsquare-558x465.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/video-ciara-charts-her-comeback.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/d86fa7af2d443d926034f94e29ba0503?s=96&d=wp_user_avatar&r=g", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/HotRadio-5TYNTK.jpg?resize=238%2C178&ssl=1", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/10/PartyMixAtNoon_SmallAd.jpg", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/Maine-Mariners-Primary-Mark-With-Logotype.png", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/HotMornings_SmallAd-min.jpg?fit=600%2C210&ssl=1", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/mobileheader.png", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/russsidesquare-600x500.jpg?fit=600%2C500&ssl=1", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/video-ciara-charts-her-comeback.jpg?resize=640%2C360&ssl=1", "https://hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Web_SideSquareliljon-558x465.jpg", "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/AP1604011532254626-1920x1263.jpg?resize=238%2C178&ssl=1"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/hotradiomaine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/video-ciara-charts-her-comeback.jpg?fit=1200%2C675&ssl=1", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hotradiomaine.com/blog/video-ciara-charts-her-comeback-with-level-up-music-video/", "title": "(Video) Ciara Charts Her Comeback With \u201cLevel Up\u201d Music Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "tec-api-version": "v1", "tec-api-origin": "https://hotradiomaine.com", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "(Video) Ciara Charts Her Comeback With \u201cLevel Up\u201d Music Video", "url": "https://hotradiomaine.com/blog/video-ciara-charts-her-comeback-with-level-up-music-video/", "description": "Ciara is back!
