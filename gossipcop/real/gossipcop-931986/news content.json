But the show, which she debuted on May 8, also delivers a surprise song on each tour stop. Swift\u2019s nightly choices have run the gamut from fan favorite \u201cAll Too Well\u201d to career throwback \u201cTeardrops on My Guitar.\u201d\n\nExplore Explore Taylor Swift See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news\n\nWhile most of Swift\u2019s performance is based on the main stage, she makes her way back to two smaller B-stages, giving more fans a chance to see her up close. There, she performs \u201cShake It Off,\u201d \u201cDancing With Our Hands Tied,\u201d \u201cBlank Space\u201d and \u201cDress\u201d \u2014 as well as the surprise song of the night on acoustic guitar.\n\nBelow, check out the list of all the special songs she\u2019s brought to the Reputation Tour B-stage. Luckily, Swifties in the crowd have been quick to upload clips of these rare live cuts.\n\n\u201cAll Too Well\u201d\n\nGlendale, Ariz., May 8; Pasadena, Calif., May 19; Arlington, Texas, Oct. 6\n\nIt\u2019s no secret among Swift fans that the emotional Red stand-out \u201cAll Too Well\u201d is widely cherished. What better surprise to sprinkle into the set list on the opening night of tour, then? \u201cI figured\u2026I would play this song you seem to request more than the others,\u201d she said, introducing the beautiful tearjerker.\n\nA post shared by Simone (@simoneyybaloneyy) on May 9, 2018 at 12:38am PDT\n\n\u201cWildest Dreams\u201d\n\nSanta Clara, Calif., May 11; Tokyo, Japan, Nov. 21\n\nSwift once performed \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d acoustic at a Grammys event, and she brought that raw, impassioned version of the 1989 song to the Reputation Stadium Tour B-stage twice \u2014 first in Santa Clara, then on the final night of tour in Tokyo.\n\nA bit of Wildest Dreams from the 1st night in Santa Clara #repTourSantaClara #TaylorSwift pic.twitter.com/FyUCIyww9i \u2014 Erica Love (@Erica_Love16) May 13, 2018\n\n\u201cThe Best Day\u201d\n\nSanta Clara, Calif., May 12\n\nOn Mother\u2019s Day weekend, Swift gifted her mom \u2014 and, apparently, tour opener Camila Cabello\u2018s mom \u2014 with this touching ode to the mother-daughter memories they\u2019ve made. The sweet Fearless track is one that is rarely performed live.\n\nA post shared by taylor swift fan page (@taylorswift_gorgeous13) on May 13, 2018 at 2:48pm PDT\n\n\u201cRed\u201d\n\nPasadena, Calif., May 18\n\nThe Rose Bowl served as inspiration for Swift\u2019s B-stage surprise on her first of two nights at the venue. \u201cRoses are red,\u201d she mused. Cue an acoustic take on \u201cRed,\u201d the title track off of her 2012 album.\n\n\u201cHoly Ground\u201d\n\nSeattle, Wash., May 22\n\n\u201cHoly Ground\u201d is all about romanticizing the time you\u2019ve shared with someone \u2014 and an excellent selection to surprise an audience full of longtime, loyal fans with. \u201cTonight I\u2019m gonna dance for all that we\u2019ve been through,\u201d she sings. \u201cBut I don\u2019t wanna dance if I\u2019m not dancing with you.\u201d\n\n@taylorswift13 sang Holy Ground in front of me so close she smiled at me she saw my outfit, my heart sign and smiled. I made eye contact. Incredible night so glad I decided to get a seat by one of the b stages! pic.twitter.com/qqxGCxguIa \u2014 Sammi May/REP hope to hug Taylor one day (@FearlessSammi13) May 23, 2018\n\n\u201cTeardrops on My Guitar\u201d\n\nDenver, Colo., May 25\n\nSwift\u2019s second single, released over a decade ago in 2007, is one she admitted she hasn\u2019t played \u201cin 100 years.\u201d The singer-songwriter went back to basics with an acoustic performance of her song about unrequited high school love, and the crowd sang along to every sentimental word.\n\nA post shared by shelbi \u2013??\u2013 (@_shelbirenee) on May 26, 2018 at 12:49am PDT\n\n\u201cOur Song\u201d\n\nChicago, June 1\n\nKicking it back to country, Swift surprised her fans on the Chicago B-stage with \u201cOur Song,\u201d her third single off her debut album. Based on this clip, the classic from her canon had just about everyone singing along. Will she \u201cplay it again\u201d?\n\n\u201c22\u201d\n\nChicago, June 2; Foxborough, Mass., July 26; Sydney, Australia, Nov. 2\n\nSwift\u2019s friend Martha Hunt says she\u2019s the one who suggested \u201c22\u201d as the surprise song on night two in Chicago, and Swift credited the enthusiastic crowd at her first night in Foxborough for her decision to perform it again. It\u2019s not every day that you get \u201c22\u201d acoustic, but Swifties got it three times so far on this tour, the most recent of which came during a rain-heavy performance in Sydney.\n\n\u201cI Knew You Were Trouble\u201d\n\nManchester, England, June 8\n\nIt\u2019s unlikely that the Manchester crowd of Swifties did not know the lyrics to \u201cI Knew You Were Trouble,\u201d but the pop star offered some advice anyway: \u201cEven if you don\u2019t know the words, it\u2019s kind of easy to remember this one part.\u201d She led them in a practice round of the post-chorus \u201coh, oh!\u201d and went on to deliver an acoustic rendition of the frenetic tune.\n\n\u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever\u201d\n\nManchester, England, June 9\n\nThose who attended the second Taylor Swift stadium show in Manchester were in for a treat: a rare live performance of \u201cI Don\u2019t Wanna Live Forever,\u201d Swift\u2019s 50 Shades duet with Zayn.\n\n\u201cMean\u201d\n\nDublin, Ireland, June 15\n\nPlaying \u201cMean\u201d live is a sure crowd-pleaser, and Swift did just that at the first of two headlining shows in Dublin. Although the song was a mainstay back in her days touring in support of Speak Now and Red, this date marked the debut of \u201cMean\u201d seeing the Reputation Stadium Tour stage.\n\n\u201cHow You Get the Girl\u201d\n\nDublin, Ireland, June 16\n\n\u201cIf you want to sing along, that would be absolutely glorious,\u201d Swift encouraged the crowd at her second night at Croke Park. She then smiled her way through a rare, acoustic performance of the 1989 track.\n\n\u201cSo It Goes\u2026\u201d\n\nLondon, England, June 22\n\nReputation album track \u201cSo It Goes\u2026\u201d has been noticeably absent from this tour\u2019s set list, making Swift\u2019s surprise addition to her Wembley Stadium set all the more special. With this acoustic treat, she perhaps hinted at what the song sounded like when she first wrote it.\n\n\u201cFifteen\u201d\n\nLondon, England, June 23\n\nJune 23 marked Swift\u2019s fifteenth show on the Reputation Stadium Tour, so what better song to play? The country-pop Fearless single was an early hit for her \u2014 and based on the crowd\u2019s reaction, it\u2019s still holds a place in fans\u2019 hearts.\n\n\u201cMine\u201d\n\nLouisville, Ky., June 30\n\nThe opening track of Speak Now wrapped the June leg of Swift\u2019s Reputation Stadium Tour. \u201cI haven\u2019t played this song in so many years, and you\u2019re singing it so loud,\u201d she beamed from the B-stage.\n\n\u201cSparks Fly\u201d\n\nColumbus, Ohio, July 7\n\nKeeping in the tradition of Speak Now, Swift moved onto the pop-country album\u2019s second track at her next tour stop. The song, about a classic crush that\u2019s so clearly a \u201cbad idea,\u201d was written when the singer was a teenager but held its own in a 2018 Taylor Swift set list.\n\n\u201cState of Grace\u201d\n\nLandover, Md., July 10\n\nFor the first of two nights in Maryland, Swift harkened back to the \u201cgolden age of something good and right and real\u201d and the acoustic guitar beginnings of \u201cState of Grace,\u201d the opening track on her Red album.\n\nState of Grace + lights ??\u2013 pic.twitter.com/EgJKAnTX6q \u2014 reptourpics (@reptourpics) July 11, 2018\n\n\u201cHaunted\u201d\n\nLandover, Md., July 11\n\nThe second Reputation Tour set in Maryland delivered a rare, understated performance of \u201cHaunted,\u201d a Speak Now track that hasn\u2019t seen Swift\u2019s stage much since 2011/2012 \u2014 back when she gave it a decidedly more dramatic treatment.\n\n\u201cNever Grow Up\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa., July 13\n\nBefore strumming the chords of \u201cNever Grow Up,\u201d Swift explained that she\u2019d just gone back to visit the nearby farm where she had actually grown up. \u201cI got especially emotional when I walked into my old bedroom,\u201d she admitted. She hinted she\u2019d be playing the song with picture of herself in her childhood room on Instagram earlier in the day, and the performance that night took on an especially sentimental tone.\n\n\u201cTreacherous\u201d\n\nPhiladelphia, Pa., July 14\n\nAfter some technical difficulties that temporarily left Swift stranded at the main stage rather than floating in her cage over the crowd to the B-stage, she bestowed fans with a highlight from her Red album.\n\n\u2014 | Another clip of Taylor singing Treacherous as the surprise song #repTourPhilly (via @lysst_) pic.twitter.com/Vx0RBjKXra \u2014 Taylor Swift News (@TSwiftNZBU) July 15, 2018\n\n\u201cBabe\u201d\n\nCleveland, Ohio, July 17\n\nA concert in Cleveland brought Swift\u2019s live debut of \u201cBabe,\u201d the Red-era-turned-2018-country-single she penned (with Train\u2019s Pat Monahan) that got away \u2014 er, was given away, to Sugarland for their latest album.\n\n\u201cWelcome to New York\u201d\n\nEast Rutherford, N.J., July 20\n\nIt was Swift\u2019s first show in New Jersey on this tour, but she gave a little shout-out to its neighbor New York with her ode to the loud sounds, bright lights and new beginnings that the big city brings.\n\nTwitter is going to ruin the quality, but here\u2019s welcome to New York!@taylorswift13 @taylornation13 pic.twitter.com/2tqifzR42K \u2014 Bekah (@volcanicheartt) July 21, 2018\n\n\u201cFearless\u201d\n\nEast Rutherford, N.J., July 21\n\nThere\u2019s somethin\u2019 bout the way a Taylor Swift show feels in the rain, or so they say.

First released in 2010, the song has rarely seen the live stage since 2011, when she was on her tour in support of that album.\n\nThis night is sparkling, don\u2019t you let it go \u2013? #repTourMetlifepic.twitter.com/pDEaDyBmxx \u2014 daniela \u2014 (@InviernoDe1989) July 23, 2018\n\n\u201cChange\u201d\n\nFoxborough, Mass., July 27\n\nAt the second of three nights playing Gillette Stadium \u2014 which is where Swift had her first-ever stadium concert, back on the Fearless Tour in 2010 \u2014 the star of the show dedicated \u201cChange\u201d to a fan she\u2019d met at her meet and greet. That fan had told the singer how much the song meant to her, and it just so happened that Swift had already been thinking of adding it into her set. The stars aligned on this Friday night as the crowd was treated to a song that hasn\u2019t been performed live in years.\n\n\u201cOurs\u201d\n\nFoxborough, Mass., July 28\n\nSwift whipped out another rarity as the surprise B-stage song for her third and final show at Gillette Stadium: \u201cOurs.\u201d This concert date marked her tenth time performing at the stadium, where she was also the first female to ever to headline three shows in a row.\n\n\u201cOut of the Woods\u201d\n\nToronto, Aug. 3\n\nFor its tour debut, Swift introduced an emotional second bridge to her acoustic performance of 1989 standout \u201cOut of the Woods.\u201d \u201cRemember when we hit the brakes too soon?\u201d she called out again. \u201cTwenty stitches in a hospital room.

The song, about the highs and lows of fame, hasn\u2019t been heard live recently, though it was a mainstay on the Red Tour.\n\nTaylor singing The Lucky One #repTourAtlanta @taylorswift13 you were amazing last night . ??\u2014- pic.twitter.com/y2AEUstTZm \u2014 CelebSheep (@CelebSheep) August 12, 2018\n\n\u201cInvisible\u201d\n\nTampa, Fla., Aug. 14\n\nBringing \u201cInvisible\u201d to the stage in 2018 is about as unheard of as it gets from the canon of Taylor Swift. Not only is the song from the era of Swift\u2019s debut album, but it\u2019s a bonus track from the deluxe version of that album. She reportedly brought \u201cInvisible\u201d back to life on a Tuesday in August for a fan who told her the song helped him come out when he was a teenager.\n\ntaylor swift singing invisible in 2018 i\u2019m so blessed pic.twitter.com/gFD0Qsanrc \u2014 taylor swift vocals (@tswiftvocals) August 15, 2018\n\n\u201cBreathe\u201d\n\nMiami, Fla., Aug. 18\n\n\u201cI\u2019m 99 percent sure I\u2019ve never played this song live,\u201d Swift admitted before performing \u201cBreathe,\u201d a deep cut from her Fearless album. The album recording of the country-pop ballad features vocals from Colbie Caillat, meaning this live solo surprise was a one-of-a-kind thing for fans to experience.\n\n\u201cBetter Man\u201d\n\nNashville, Aug. 25\n\nSwift says she wanted \u201cBetter Man\u201d to \u201chave its own moment,\u201d and it certainly did \u2014 at the Grammys, the CMAs and at Nashville\u2019s Bridgestone Arena, where she treated the crowd to a rare solo performance of the beautiful song that was written by her, but recorded by country group Little Big Town.\n\nI wish you were a Better Man\u2026 #repTourNashville pic.twitter.com/NIYJLy1POU \u2014 Taylor Nation (@taylornation13) August 26, 2018\n\n\u201cJump Then Fall\u201d\n\nDetroit, Mich., Aug. 28\n\nThe pop star unveiled the rare gem from the re-release of Fearless in Detroit, marking the first time she performed \u201cJump Then Fall\u201d in eight years. Her delivery of the love song is just as bubbly and bouncy as ever before.\n\n\u201cBegin Again\u201d\n\nMinneapolis, Minn., Aug. 31\n\nIn another return to her country roots, Swift strummed a pretty \u201cBegin Again\u201d at the first of two nights at U.S. Bank Stadium, the tour stop where she played the closing track from her Red album for the first time in 2018.\n\nAug 31 2018\n\nRep Tour Minneapolis (Night 1). ?

Still, she shouldn\u2019t have been surprised that her fans would be singing right along with her, loud and clear.\n\n@taylorswift13 SANG WONDERLAND LAST NIGHT AND IM HAVING MAJOR FOMO THAT I WAS NOT THERE TO WITNESS THIS MAJESTIC SONG LIVE \u2014-\u200d??\u2013\u200d??\u2014\u2014?\u2014\u2014\u2013#RepTourHouston pic.twitter.com/b5NLzW91ze \u2014 Michelle (@MichelleOB13) September 30, 2018\n\n\u201cWhite Horse\u201d\n\nArlington, Texas, Oct. 5\n\nWatch the clip below and you\u2019ll see it\u2019s safe to say most of the crowd at this show knew the words to the Fearless classic \u201cWhite Horse,\u201d Swift\u2019s surprise acoustic song of the night.
