Trudeau, the royal brothers and their father Prince Charles gathered at Vimy Memorial Park in northern France on Sunday for a ceremony marking the 100th anniversary of the World War I battle.\n\nFrance's president Fran\u00e7ois Hollande led the ritual, which included speeches from Trudeau and Prince Charles. An estimated 20,000 Canadians were in attendance.\n\nGetty Images\n\nBoth Prince William and Prince Harry laid down a pair of boots to commemorate those who fought in battle.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"Canada was born here,\" Trudeau said in his remarks.\n\nThe Battle of Vimy marks a significant turning point in Canadian history. Though it was led by British troops, it was mostly fought by Canadian forces. Over 10,000 were killed or wounded for the hard-earned victory.\n\nPrince Charles commended the \"strength of character\" of Canada's troops.\n\nAfterwards, both the Trudeau family and royal family toured the trenches and tunnels at the Vimy Memorial Park.\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images", "images":
