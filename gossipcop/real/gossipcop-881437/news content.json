Anyway, regardless, it kind of stung seeing that I came off as an assh\u2014 or even just was an assh\u2014, I\u2019m sorry?\u201d\n\nAccording to Stern\u2019s reading of the messages, Manson\u2019s response was: \u201cYou were just being you. No beef here.\u201d\n\nIn another text, Bieber further apologized. \u201cHonestly, I totally thought we hit it off. Again, my bad. If I was an assh\u2014, that wasn\u2019t my intention. Just want you to know that,\u201d Stern said reading parts of a text from Bieber, who later added: \u201cI don\u2019t really care about the media. I just wanted to make sure you and I were good \u2019cause I like you.\u201d\n\nThe much-talked-about shirt (designed by Fear of God\u2019s Jerry Lorenzo) was said to be created with Manson\u2019s permission. The only problem was, Manson apparently never signed off on the T-shirt \u2014 and wasn\u2019t happy to see the shirt on Bieber when they met for the first time.\n\nWATCH: Justin Bieber Focusing on \u2018Being Spiritual and Attending Church\u2019 After \u2018Disappointing\u2019 Decision to Cancel Tour: Source\n\n\u201cHe was [already] wearing the shirt that had his name on my shirt,\u201d Manson, 48, told Consequence of Sound in a recent interview.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just that Bieber was wearing the shirt \u2014 it\u2019s what he said to the goth rocker.\n\n\u201cHe said to me, \u2018I made you relevant again,\u2019 \u201d Manson recalled, adding that the \u201cLove Yourself\u201d singer had taken credit for the idea of using Manson\u2019s image on the merch. \u201cBad mistake to say to me. He was a real piece of s\u2014 in the way he had the arrogance to say that.\u201d\n\nBut it appears the T-shirt drama is all water under the bridge.\n\n\u201cWe are cool. People just made that shirt stuff into a fake feud,\u201d Stern said reading Manson\u2019s text to Bieber. \u201cLet\u2019s turn it upside down and f\u2014 the press and do something together. It will be the best. And don\u2019t apologize. You weren\u2019t an assh\u2014. They asked if you were and I sort of agreed. I wasn\u2019t out to get you. If not, I\u2019ll try to avoid more questions today on Stern.\u201d\n\nManson concluded by telling Stern: \u201cHe sassed me and he apologized, and I said I wouldn\u2019t s\u2014 talk him, so I\u2019m not going to s\u2014 talk him.\u201d", "images":
