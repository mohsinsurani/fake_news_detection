Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian says she has lost 33 lbs in the three months since she gave birth to daughter True, her first child, on April 12.\n\nIn a post on her official app, the 34-year-old reality star credited a \u201ccombination of breastfeeding and being very active\u201d for the impressive weight loss.\n\nMommy\u2019s Little Love A post shared by Khlo\u00e9 (@khloekardashian) on May 26, 2018 at 2:13pm PDT\n\n\u201cAfter I had True, I didn\u2019t put any pressure on myself to lose the baby weight,\u201d Kardashian wrote. \u201cI just wanted to get back to my regular routine from before I got pregnant, which was working out five to six times a week.\u201d\n\nThen Kardashian got down to specifics: \u201cHere is where I am at currently. True turned 3 months old on July 12. I honestly didn\u2019t give myself a number that I wanted to lose by this time, especially since I wasn\u2019t able to work out for the first six weeks. But, since then, I\u2019ve lost 33 pounds! I\u2019m shocked that I lost that much weight that quickly. I\u2019m chalking this up to the combination of breastfeeding and being very active during and after my pregnancy.\u201d\n\nShortly after she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson welcomed True, the Good American founder resumed workouts with her trainer, Joel \u201cCoach Joe\u201d Boura\u00efma, and she recently slammed speculation she was on a \u201cridiculous\u201d post-baby diet.\n\nAnd in her latest post, Kardashian emphasized the role of exercise in her life while asserting that not all mothers need to be such gym devotees. \u201cI never compare myself to other women as every woman has their own journey. We also all have different priorities in our day-to-day lives. One of mine is having that one hour where I can be selfish and alone in my place of refuge,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\u201cStaying healthy and active is something that\u2019s very important to me,\u201d she added. \u201cExercise is something I\u2019ve always used to maintain my sanity and relieve stress. And, now that I have a baby, I still want to keep something that\u2019s my time, my space, something I\u2019m doing for myself.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/khloe-kardashian3.jpg?crop=136px%2C143px%2C1420px%2C802px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/khloe-kardashian3.jpg?crop=291px%2C143px%2C1230px%2C647px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/khloe-kardashian3.jpg?crop=291px%2C143px%2C1230px%2C647px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Clarendon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/khloe-kardashian-has-lost-33-lbs-in-three-months-since-giving-birth/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Has Lost 33 Lbs in Three Months Since Giving Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Khloe Kardashian has dropped 33 lbs since the April 12 birth of her daughter, True \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Khloe Says She Has Lost 33 Lbs in Three Months Since Giving Birth", "description": "Khloe Kardashian has dropped 33 lbs since the April 12 birth of her daughter, True \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/khloe-kardashian-has-lost-33-lbs-in-three-months-since-giving-birth/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:01:29+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/khloe-kardashian3.jpg?crop=291px%2C143px%2C1230px%2C647px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/khloe-kardashian3.jpg?crop=291px%2C143px%2C1230px%2C647px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-16T21:03:46+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:01:29+00:00"}, "author": "Dan Clarendon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Khloe Says She Has Lost 33 Lbs in Three Months Since Giving Birth", "description": "Khloe Kardashian has dropped 33 lbs since the April 12 birth of her daughter, True \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/khloe-kardashian3.jpg?crop=291px%2C143px%2C1230px%2C647px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531775026.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
