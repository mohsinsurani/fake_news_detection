This is what you\u2019ve got,\u2019\u201d she said at the conference, according to Billboard. \u201cWe just talk about it. I know it\u2019s really young, but I really believe that if you start this early, there\u2019s no shame.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to tell him, \u2018Keep your private parts,\u2019 and this and that,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s a beautiful thing. You have it and mine is different and it\u2019s cool, man. We have to respect ourselves and respect each other. So I believe it starts really young.\u201d\n\nBiel\u2019s comments come just after the actress starred in a sex education PSA alongside comedian Chelsea Handler.\n\nThe PSA \u2014 titled \u201cJessica Biel and Chelsea Handler Take a Little Look-See\u201d \u2014 stresses how important it is for women to give themselves regular self-examinations.\n\n\u201cYou have to check in with your vagina! How else do you know what\u2019s going on down there?\u201d Handler instructs in the short clip.\n\n\u201cYou know, sometimes I look at my vagina, and I go, \u2018Wow, that looks like a young, smug Burt Reynolds \u2014 with the mustache,'\u201d Biel says.\n\nThe video was produced by Biel and WomanCare Global for The Tryst Network, a new organization working to \u201cimprove the sexual health IQ of women and their partners through fun, reliable and empowering online content.\u201d\n\nFollow Daniel Nussbaum on Twitter: @dznussbaum", "images": ["https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/07/AP22188735055493-200x150.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17674108&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd-640x480.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/GettyImages-902340118-1024x682.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/04/wallaceee-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/Ron-Johnson-Debates-Mandela-Jones-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2021/09/ron-johnson-mandela-barnes-ap-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=296280873867140&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/inflation-scale-meter-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/JaredKushnertrumpye-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/05/Trump-Musk-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/09/Mystal917-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/Mike-Kemp_Getty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/AP22280649799668-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/Ezra-Shaw_Getty-Images-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/fbi-agents-chuck-grassley-ap-photos-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/GettyImages-1426980102-1-200x150.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-dcxh5b8qxvs6g.gif", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1242391052-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/06/Rand-Paul-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/hunter-biden-laptop-getty-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2020/10/kanyewestrogen2-200x150.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/08/GettyImages-1242677816-200x150.png", "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2022/10/Nicole-Malliotakis-and-Max-Rose-200x150.png"], "top_img": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Nussbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/02/08/jessica-biel-starting-sex-ed-lessons-2-year-old-son/", "title": "Jessica Biel Starting Sex Education Lessons with 2-Year-Old Son", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "fb": {"pages": 95475020353, "app_id": 1243316582352556}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=722987199", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.breitbart.app", "ahrefs-site-verification": "e5213d6c4a07fe85baa34006f2a9a3c977bd8f3a50fd0ab6d2aa93844e0b3303", "description": "The actress says she has already begun teaching her son with singer Justin Timberlake about how to be comfortable with his body.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jessica Biel Starting Sex Education Lessons with 2-Year-Old Son", "description": "The actress says she has already begun teaching her son with singer Justin Timberlake about how to be comfortable with his body.", "url": "https://www.breitbart.com/entertainment/2018/02/08/jessica-biel-starting-sex-ed-lessons-2-year-old-son/", "site_name": "Breitbart", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media.breitbart.com/media/2018/02/JessicaBielTimberlakeSexEd.jpg", "width": 447, "height": 335, "alt": "BEVERLY HILLS, CA - JANUARY 07: Justin Timberlake and Jessica Biel attend The 75th Annual Golden Globe Awards at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 7, 2018 in Beverly Hills, California.
