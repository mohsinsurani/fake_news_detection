TMZ reported that he needed heart surgery.\n\n\u201cSadly, my father will not be attending our wedding,\u201d she said in the statement, which was released by Kensington Palace. \u201cI have always cared for my father and hope he can be given the space he needs to focus on his health.\"\n\nMarkle, a Los Angeles native, added: \u201cI would like to thank everyone who has offered generous messages of support. Please know how much Harry and I look forward to sharing our special day with you on Saturday.\u201d\n\nThe announcement came as a full carriage procession and military rehearsal got underway in Windsor, England, where Markle, 36, will marry Harry, 33, at St. George's Chapel.\n\nHer mother, Doria Ragland, is still due to attend and meet her soon-to-be in-laws before the ceremony.\n\nThe American TV audience for the royal wedding is expected to exceed the 23 million Americans who tuned in for Prince William's wedding to Kate Middleton in 2011.\n\nHowever, some 17 percent of Brits want to get rid of their monarchy, according to a poll.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201805/nn_kco_royal_wedding_meghan_markle_diana_influence_180517_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201805/AFP_14I7PY.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_17/2409151/180424-prince-harry-markle-mn-0820_0837a5d7dd439f92a2dfe612530378a1.focal-60x60.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_20/2435341/180517-meghan-markle-mc-1143.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_20/2435341/180517-meghan-markle-mc-1143.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alastair Jamieson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/meghan-markle-s-dad-won-t-attend-royal-wedding-prince-n874911", "title": "Meghan Markle's dad won't attend royal wedding to Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/celebrity/meghan-markle-s-dad-won-t-attend-royal-wedding-prince-n874911", "title": "Meghan Markle's ailing dad won't walk her down the aisle", "description": "The American actress said she hopes her father gets \"the space he needs to focus on his health.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_20/2435341/180517-meghan-markle-mc-1143.JPG", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_20/2435341/180517-meghan-markle-mc-1143.JPG", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_20/2435341/180517-meghan-markle-mc-1143.JPG", "title": "Meghan Markle's ailing dad won't walk her down the aisle", "description": "The American actress said she hopes her father gets \"the space he needs to focus on his health.\"", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Meghan Markle confirmed that her father, Thomas, will not attend her wedding to Prince Harry in Windsor on Saturday.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "Meghan Markle's ailing dad won't walk her down the aisle", "description": "The American actress said she hopes her father gets \"the space he needs to focus on his health.\"", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_20/2435341/180517-meghan-markle-mc-1143.JPG", "type": "article", "unibrow": "Celebrity", "authorName1": "Alastair Jamieson"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Thu May 17 2018 12:00:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Fri May 18 2018 02:34:57 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_20/2435341/180517-meghan-markle-mc-1143.JPG", "next-head-count": 105}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526558400.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
