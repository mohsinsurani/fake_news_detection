{"url": "https://www.allure.com/story/angelina-jolie-brad-pitt-kids-2018", "text": "UPDATE (February 27, 2019): It's been a little over a year since we last got a glimpse of Angelina Jolie and her six children together, but this past Monday, the actress attended a screening of Netflix's The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind in New York with the whole crew in tow. (No sign of Brad Pitt, though.) And my-oh-my, do they look grown. Anyone who's followed the star's career can likely remember when Maddox, who is now 17 (!) was just a tiny tike who Jolie would tote around in her arms and shield from paparazzi photos. Time flies, folks.\n\nThe other five children, Pax, 15; Zahara, 14; Shiloh, 12; and twins Knox and Vivienne, 10, all look markedly older as well, though it is worth noting they all were decked out in A-list event attire. For instance, Zahara wore a sleek black dress, while the others wore different suit variations with their own personal touches. Ensembles aside, though, it's obvious through their facial features and general demeanors alone that they're all growing up and coming into their own. While Pax and Maddox both put on serious faces, the younger ones showed off their beautiful smiles.\n\nNeedless to say, this was a rare treat \u2014 we hope to see more of the Jolie fam all together in the future.\n\nThis post was originally published on February 4, 2018.\n\nIt's true that they're two of the world's most famous celebrities, but Angelina Jolie and Brad Pitt have done a pretty good job at raising their six children mostly out of the Hollywood limelight. Even through their recent (and highly publicized) breakup, the two have been very open about their commitment to their children and their desire to co-parent healthy, active children. As such, Jolie was recently spotted in Paris during an outing with all six of them during a break from her Guerlain campaign. The family was enjoying some quality time together while perusing the art at the Louvre.", "images":
