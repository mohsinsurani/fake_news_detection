He shows up later in the episode in his adult version (Andrew J. West) on a motorcycle, where he collides with Cinderella (Dania Ramirez).\n\nAlso Read: Watch Best Comic-Con TV Trailers, From 'Game of Thrones' to 'American Horror Story' (Videos)\n\nKitsis pointed out that the show would introduce a new version of Alice in Wonderland, who will be different from the one that fans met in the short-lived spinoff \u201cOnce Upon a Time in Wonderland.\u201d\n\nColin O\u2019Donoghue (Hook) said that the new season has a very different feel on set for the cast.\n\n\u201cIt almost feels like we\u2019re all starting the show afresh together,\u201d the actor said. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like we\u2019re starting over.\u201d\n\n\u201cOnce Upon a Time\u201d returns to ABC on Friday, Oct. 6.", "images":
