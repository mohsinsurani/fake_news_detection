So can you blame us for wondering which of the bride's cast mates would be invited to her big day?\n\nWell, we can now reveal that the show's most lauded and best loved stars have turned up at St George's Chapel, Windsor Castle to celebrate their former colleague's wedding today, and we for one are overjoyed.\n\nRex\n\nArriving en mass at the Windsor location, the Suits cast truly brought a dash of Hollywood to the proceedings with some of the most fabulous outfits of all the wedding guests.\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nGina Torres looked statuesque in a floral dress and cream hat, whilst Sarah Rafferty worked a stunning navy dress with oversized puffball sleeves. But our style award goes to Abigail Spencer who sported a retro-style blue polka dot dress with classic red lipstick and a seriously chic Priyanka Chopra wearing lavender by her side.\n\nGetty Images\n\nMarkle's co-star and on-screen husband Patrick J Adams arrived looking seriously sharp in a black Canali suit with dark red tie, arm in arm with his wife IRL Troian Bellisario.\n\nRex\n\nTheir attendance at the wedding comes days after the stars have teased fans with updates on their stay in London this week.\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

Meghan, so happy for you, friend. Much love. \u2014 Patrick J Adams (@halfadams) November 27, 2017\n\nIn last month's two hour final Suits special episode, Markle's Rachel Zane and fianc\u00e9 Mike Ross (played by Patrick J. Adams, who has also left the series), finally tied the knot.\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.
