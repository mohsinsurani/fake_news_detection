This week Cardi B, social media star turned musician, became the first female rapper in 19 years to reach No 1 on the US Billboard chart, knocking Taylor Swift off the top spot.\n\nIt is a moment that has sent reverberations through the music industry, not only because it highlighted how few female rappers have topped the charts \u2013 before Cardi B, Lauryn Hill was the last to do it, with Doo Wop (That Thing) in 1998 \u2013 but also because of her distinctive rise to becoming a chart-topping rapper with song Bodak Yellow (Money Moves).\n\nBorn Belcalis Almanzar to a Dominican father and a Trinidadian mother, this 24-year-old New Yorker\u2019s ascent to fame, as an onslaught of think-pieces have noted, has been meteoric, even by today\u2019s standards.\n\nIt is a trajectory that moves from college drop-out to stripper to Instagram influencer to reality star to mainstream rapper with the vocal support of Missy Elliott and Nicki Minaj, and whose songs are being covered by Janet Jackson. She also has over 10 million followers on Instagram, and she hasn\u2019t released an album.\n\nCardi B performing in New York.

Yet this was not the case for Almanzar. Helped by a powerful social media following, a forceful personality and genuine rap talent, she found herself competing \u2013 and eventually beating \u2013 Taylor Swift\u2019s Look What You Made Me Do on the US chart this week.\n\nValidation from fellow female rappers also came thick and fast. Nicki Minaj tweeted:\n\nCongratulations to a fellow NEW YAWKA on a RECORD BREAKING achievement. Bardi, this is the only thing that matters!!! Enjoy it\ud83d\udc95\ud83d\udc9e\ud83c\udf80 @iamcardib \u2014 NICKI MINAJ (@NICKIMINAJ) September 25, 2017\n\nMissy Elliott added:\n\nCongratulations @iamcardib for having a #1 record in the country that's not as easy as it seem this huge\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffe May u have continued blessings\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe \u2014 Missy Elliott (@MissyElliott) September 25, 2017\n\nMuch has also been made of the fact that prior to her reality TV debut, Almanzar worked as a stripper to support herself financially. Rather than trying to hide that from the public, she has made doing everything on her own terms an key part of her narrative.\n\nHer refusal to bow down to being publicly palatable is also evident in her open discussion about having had plastic surgery (bum injections rather than implants, she emphasises), her public criticism of Donald Trump, and her shout-out of support to NFL player Colin Kaepernick at the MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nRadio 1Xtra DJ A.Dot, who is about to co-host BBC television\u2019s new live music show, was among the first to play Cardi B on UK radio, and said it was \u201cinsane\u201d to realise she was the first female rapper since 1998 to get a US No 1. She also said fan and industry acceptance of Cardi B as a legitimate rapper was a testament to how being a purist about music was an outdated idea.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not saying this should be anyone\u2019s life plan but stripper turned reality star turned No 1 artist is today\u2019s American dream,\u201d said A.Dot. \u201c I don\u2019t think you need to be one thing anymore for people to take you seriously. She\u2019s so honest as well, and I think that\u2019s a big part of what\u2019s endeared people to her. I think quite often people try to have this artist persona, where they have their artist mask on in public, but with Cardi B, it\u2019s all out there. Anyone who tried to media train her would have given up within 10 minutes, because she just says what she wants, and I think people like that and really respect that.\u201d\n\nHowever, A.Dot doesn\u2019t have much faith in Almanzar\u2019s staying power. \u201cI think the magic in that song is that it\u2019s not difficult, it\u2019s not a masterclass in lyricism but it doesn\u2019t always have to be,\u201d she said. \u201cI reckon she\u2019s a one-hit wonder, but that\u2019s fine. There\u2019s going to be pressure for her to prove she\u2019s an artist. I could be wrong but I think she\u2019s hit her peak. What a peak though.\u201d", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/06/Hannah-Ellis-Petersen,-L.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=a5a4153fc3d930106845786ddca73dc2", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456762d0f0d5ff013575e8dbc32082495a8a8779/0_112_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3fad84ac4013966e729226540a745dfd", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Rap%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CInstagram%2CUS+news%2CWorld+news%2CSocial+media%2CDigital+media%2CCardi+B", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456762d0f0d5ff013575e8dbc32082495a8a8779/0_112_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/5e73ff729361036db51ee5e438a7c53da998c42e/0_194_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=445&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456762d0f0d5ff013575e8dbc32082495a8a8779/0_112_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3fad84ac4013966e729226540a745dfd", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hannah Ellis-Petersen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/29/the-new-american-dream-cardi-bs-rise-from-instagram-to-chart-topping-rapper", "title": "The new American dream: Cardi B's rise from Instagram to chart-topping rapper", "meta_data": {"description": "Former stripper turned reality TV star with huge Instagram following becomes first female rapper to top US singles chart since Lauryn Hill", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/29/the-new-american-dream-cardi-bs-rise-from-instagram-to-chart-topping-rapper", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456762d0f0d5ff013575e8dbc32082495a8a8779/0_112_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=3fad84ac4013966e729226540a745dfd", "height": 720}, "title": "The new American dream: Cardi B's rise from Instagram to chart-topping rapper", "description": "Former stripper turned reality TV star with huge Instagram following becomes first female rapper to top US singles chart since Lauryn Hill", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/hannah-ellis-petersen", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-07-11T15:25:50.000Z", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2017-09-29T14:19:57.000Z", "tag": "Rap,Music,Culture,Instagram,US news,World news,Social media,Digital media,Cardi B"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2017/sep/29/the-new-american-dream-cardi-bs-rise-from-instagram-to-chart-topping-rapper?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2017/sep/29/the-new-american-dream-cardi-bs-rise-from-instagram-to-chart-topping-rapper", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2017/sep/29/the-new-american-dream-cardi-bs-rise-from-instagram-to-chart-topping-rapper?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2017/sep/29/the-new-american-dream-cardi-bs-rise-from-instagram-to-chart-topping-rapper?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/456762d0f0d5ff013575e8dbc32082495a8a8779/0_112_3600_2159/master/3600.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=1c44f9f01f1f241969aac2795921d52b", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506639600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
