Bure\u2019s dressing room \u2014 for fun workouts.\n\nBure says that at 40, she\u2019s in the best shape she\u2019s ever been.\n\n\u201cI feel the most fit and strong that I\u2019ve ever felt in my life,\u201d Bure told PEOPLE in February. \u201cWhat keeps me on track is that I want to feel good and have a long life with my husband [Valeri Bure, 42] and kids [daughter Natasha, 18, and sons Lev, 16, and Maksim, 15].\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Candace Cameron Bure Is in Her Best Shape at 40: \u2018I Feel the Most Fit and Strong That I\u2019ve Ever Felt in My Life\u2019\n\nShe and Stokes focus on mixing up their workouts to get the biggest benefits.\n\n\u201cOur workouts incorporate strength training with cardio, plyo work and balance,\u201d Bure said. \u201cWhat\u2019s so specific about Kira is the order of the moves that she does that complement one another, which really makes a huge difference in her workout.\u201d\n\nAnd since they started, Bure says her body has completely transformed.\n\n\u201cWhen I see muscles that are more defined that I hadn\u2019t seen before, it\u2019s exciting,\u201d she said. \u201cI love a muscular figure. It feels like an accomplishment and it makes me feel strong and I love having a strong body. When you look better, you feel better. That keeps me motivated.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/xG9PclmV63VT1HiJcVzcp7w0hdQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(474x355:476x357)/candace-cameron-bure-1-97d342febc4e43d9b0d603dc5c032af2.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/OteI2cWK2b_ECwuztPRP17gl86I=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(719x0:721x2)/candace-cameron-bure-1-9dbcbfdd3a984e409db37e80884b3177.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/JAMgkGTFwsxpOuPNxKlumDod69E=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(518x0:520x2)/Bob-Saget-Candace-Cameron05-72f4f30410774d73b074d2619673e3ff.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZBTEFaQ0kIYb8L_MJO9H5hz_tZQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(409x151:411x153)/bob-saget-5-1-c73ecd6d29254315aefabef62ff32b88.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/KGIhLVhN90cUt1TGgFfYdlwjt-c=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(638x79:640x81)/Dave-Coulier-2-0e1f5d93d7aa4f8885739ea0bbe9554d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AwRth8XvkAx9vMDZCd3Z5W5fqsY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(448x83:450x85)/ashley-graham-567dbe83f4f14ca187ec15bfc1a84411.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qIlWTWtJFhFN_phZsAS-3wFUhpk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(577x14:579x16)/Dave-Coulier-and-Candace-Cameron-Bure-33f74adefd5249fb81e8c243e426596e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/WEAEw6xKp_8FOs-mxbGKpXOFU9Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Bob-Saget-Candace-Cameron04-625d4c619f214f4dabf84bfa504618b9.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Y1CN8rZN4kr7T_h_LobvRp7TKdw=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/J.Mazziotta2334-e3daa71fe1a745929e739c08e585253f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/sUiVUpSXFYR-XB1BMYPo4bzyA6Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x59:751x61)/candace-cameron-bure-bob-sage-9625b0a6d307469198654ee98f3f489f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/zGUAVe2T2Nso7pzuML7aTnewfeI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/candace-cameron-bure-3-095e2c0ac4aa46cda3ba01418749d223.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Xu6mSkQgIJw3s71iP0WnAd1PbEA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(689x429:691x431)/Natasha-Bure_01-066394f9b5734da395015e42cf0dbb1a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/nrMGU7DU_NJfOqzV9k-kWCKdYKk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(404x252:406x254)/natasha-bure-1-08a2ff08649e4e838c29e77d5300fa47.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9vHDT6XxP-nr-8yF2oozamIEhnE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x229:676x231)/natasha-bure-1-9259af6c08ab4a909eed24a2458cdd7e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Wg9x37RKCPWnRD-SiEcJR46R3-E=/640x640/filters:fill(auto,1)/98wy8d-f466e199cddb488eabffb3b25d966695.gif", "https://people.com/thmb/KJOzzxDw4Fp5SM-vXh1JMsnyKkw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(599x0:601x2)/candace-cameron-jojo-siwa-0727-3bea111d66b44aae8498f4079e447e90.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2AbhCBm32oB11vZu5WjAXfxhSO8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(776x110:778x112)/1-brie-larson-c2eed36c670f4881a44c53aa3e132066.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/AzA_XT4jKK6GA0PH0s7osz6OcV8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/candace-bure-son-birthday-5937daaa4f754f598e339582dacbb3f2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/Wg9x37RKCPWnRD-SiEcJR46R3-E=/640x640/filters:fill(auto,1)/98wy8d-f466e199cddb488eabffb3b25d966695.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julie Mazziotta", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/candace-cameron-bure-abs-instagram/", "title": "Candace Cameron Bure Shows Off Her Abs \u2014 and Her Belly!
