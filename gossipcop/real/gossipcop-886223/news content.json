I just put down the alcohol,\u201d Robinson said on the show. \u201cI was going to detox. I had heard, I don\u2019t know how true it is, but I heard you can regenerate your liver in six months. I was like, let me see if I can go six months, and I just haven\u2019t gone back, and then [I\u2019ve been] working out and I\u2019ve been trying this vegan lifestyle, too.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s a look at Robinson\u2019s weight change over the past year. On the left is a shot from a July 2016 episode of Mr. Robot, compared to a shot from Robinson\u2019s appearance on Late Night with Seth Meyers from Sept. 27, 2017:\n\nMichael Parmelee/USA Network/NBCU Photo Bank, Lloyd Bishop/NBC/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images\n\nRobinson\u2019s known for his burly figure from projects like This Is The End, Hot Tub Time Machine, and Mr. Robot, but he\u2019s found that changing his diet hasn\u2019t been as hard as expected.\n\n\u201cThere are so many great vegan restaurants and dishes,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt\u2019s much easier than I thought it would be.\u201d\n\nThe one thing he misses the most, though? Having mac and cheese. (Maybe he should try this vegan macaroni and cashew cheese recipe from pro wrestler Austin Aries.)\n\nWant to change your body and try out some healthier or vegan options in your diet?
