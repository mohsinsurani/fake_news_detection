In the last few months he's made a secret cameo in \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" and tried his hand at off-road driving, and now he's studying up on robotic surgery.\n\nPrince William, right, speaks with surgeons during a minimally invasive robotic-assisted surgery during his visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital in London on Wednesday.

WPA Pool via Getty Images\n\nHe also sat in on a highly complex robotic cancer operation to remove a tumor from a patient's esophagus.\n\nThe minimally invasive procedures, which use da Vinci robot surgical systems, reduce surgery times by hours and allow patients to recover more quickly and without visible scars.\n\nPrince William speaks to a patient during his visit to the Royal Marsden Hospital.

Marsden Hospital staff member.\n\nHe was appointed in 2007 as president of the hospital, a position previously held by his mother, the late Princess Diana.", "images":
