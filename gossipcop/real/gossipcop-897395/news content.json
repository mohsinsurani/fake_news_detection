Us Weekly was the first to report the news, citing an unnamed source who said, \u201cIt just ran its course. He was never something serious.\u201d\n\nThe Eric Andre Show creator and The Defenders actress went public with their relationship on Valentine\u2019s Day, when each posted about the other on social media. Dawson posted two photos of her and Andre on Instagram. \u201cWishing you all a \u2018Michael Bolton\u2019s Big Sexy Valentine\u2019s Day\u2019! #HappyValentinesDay #Valentines\u201d she captioned one in which they pose with Michael Bolton. \u201cHappy Valentines Day my love! #MyCuddlyValentine #Valentines\u201d she wrote alongside the other, in which she and Andre stand in the typical \u201cprom pose\u201d next to a koala. The same day, Andre tweeted a selfie of the pair and wrote, \u201cThe undisputed most gorgeous being on the planet ????\u2764\ufe0f? @rosariodawson I love u bb?? #HappyValentinesDay,\u201d though the tweet has since been deleted, according to Us Weekly.\n\nThe PDA-filled Valentine\u2019s posts didn\u2019t convince everyone right away, though. Chance the Rapper apparently assumed it was all part of one of Andre\u2019s signature elaborate pranks, and texted Dawson to ask if the relationship was real. In response, Andre posted more photos of the duo in which their tongues were touching. \u201cI think we have to touch tongues\u2026people think this is a prank,\u201d the comedian captioned one of the now-deleted tweets, according to USA Today. Chance the Rapper could barely mask his surprise. \u201cHe tweeted this because I text Rosario asking if it was a joke ?? \u201d he tweeted in response to Andre\u2019s posts.\n\nA few months later, Dawson appeared on The Late Show and, once again, confirmed the relationship, and shared that she met Andre at the Democratic National Convention in July 2016. She also told host Stephen Colbert that she wished the tongue-touching photos hadn\u2019t been necessary to prove their love. \u201cHe started posting more pictures of like our tongues touching and stuff, like personal pictures,\u201d she said. \u201cI was like, \u2018You\u2019re still a millennial, man. You don\u2019t post the tongue pictures!'\u201d\n\nIn the same interview, she spoke about how Andre had taken care of her after an emergency surgery she underwent over Labor Day weekend in 2016 for a ruptured ovarian cyst, saying, \u201cHe took care of me in an adult diaper. That\u2019s real love.\u201d In a September 2017 Instagram post, she expressed her gratitude for Andre\u2019s support during her surgery and recovery. \u201cWhat a difference a year makes\u2026This weekend marks a year that I had to get emergency surgery to stop internal bleeding from a ruptured cyst on my ovary. It was the first time I told @ericfuckingandre that I loved him (and very much not the last),\u201d she captioned a series of photos of her and Andre in the hospital.\n\nRemembering 2017\u2019s Most Devastating Celebrity Breakups After ringing in 2017 together on New Year\u2019s Eve last year, it seems Nina Dobrev and Glen Powell will be making alternative plans come midnight for 2018, as the pair is rumored to have split after just under a year of dating.
