That\u2019s what most of the pop culture fans were asking themselves on Sunday night, as the 2017 Billboard Music Awards was aired live coast to coast on ABC.\n\nJohn Legend performed and various of his friends were there, and viewers were expecting to also see the supermodel being present in the T-Mobile Arena.\n\nBut unfortunately, she wasn\u2019t there as she decided to cheer on her loved one from the comfort of the home of a family member in Las Vegas, so we shouldn\u2019t worry.\n\n\u201cMy sister and niece live in Vegas. I\u2019m hanging out with them and not trying to force my back into a dress. but watching #bbmas,\u201d she posted on her Twitter account.\n\nAnd regarding her favorite artists in the first hour of the show, she had to give it up for both Miley Cyrus and Ed Sheeran.\n\nEven if Chrissy was not inside the arena on Sunday, she managed to watch the amazing get together between John and Florida Georgia Line.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little mash-up that\u2019s big for us. He is one of our heroes, and somebody we look up to,\u201d Tyler Hubbard stated on Live From the Red Carpet with E! News\u2019 Jason Kennedy before singing \u201cH.O.L.Y.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re going to crush it tonight.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re wondering how these two met, Brian Kelly revealed the fact that Tyler deserves all the credit and respect for making their partnership work.\n\nHe said that Tyler was the one that got to write with him no so long ago.\n\n\u201cThey hit it off then somehow it just kind of came about. The universe wanted it to happen. Of course, we would love to sing with John and strip down. Just us three and a piano, our voices. I think the fans are going to love it, and sounds really good,\u201d he continued.\n\nThat was about it, and the rest may be called history.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 2017 Billboard Music Awards was hosted at the T-Mobile Arena in Las Vegas on Sunday, May 21st, and the list of nominees was announced on April 10th this year. Non-televised awards were announced on the Billboard website the very same day as the main ceremony.
