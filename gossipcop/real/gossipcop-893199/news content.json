The accuser, Scott R. Brunton, who was 23 at the time of the alleged incident, claims that Takei took advantage of him when he was most vulnerable.\n\n\u201cThis happened a long time ago, but I have never forgotten it,\u201d Brunton tells The Hollywood Reporter in an interview. \u201cIt is one of those stories you tell with a group of people when people are recounting bizarre instances in their lives, this always comes up. I have been telling it for years, but I am suddenly very nervous telling it.\u201d\n\nBrunton says he was living in Hollywood in 1981, working as a waiter and beginning a career as a commercial actor and model when he met a 43- or 44-year-old Takei one evening at Greg\u2019s Blue Dot bar. The men exchanged numbers and would call one another from time to time as well as run into each other at clubs, Brunton says. When Brunton broke up with his then-boyfriend, he spoke with Takei. \u201cHe said, \u2018Let me know what your new number is\u2019 and I did. And not long after we broke up and I moved out, George called me,\u201d Brunton recalls.\n\nTakei, as Brunton tells it, invited him to dinner and the theater. \u201cHe was very good at consoling me and understanding that I was upset and still in love with my boyfriend,\u201d Brunton says. \u201cHe was a great ear. He was very good about me spilling my heart on my sleeve.\u201d\n\nThe two men went back to the actor\u2019s condo for a drink the same night. \u201cWe have the drink and he asks if I would like another,\u201d Brunton recalls. \u201cAnd I said sure. So, I have the second one, and then all of a sudden, I begin feeling very disoriented and dizzy, and I thought I was going to pass out. I said I need to sit down and he said sit over here and he had the giant yellow beanbag chair. So I sat down in that and leaned my head back and I must have passed out.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe next thing I remember I was coming to and he had my pants down around my ankles and he was groping my crotch and trying to get my underwear off and feeling me up at the same time, trying to get his hands down my underwear,\u201d Brunton says. \u201cI came to and said, \u2018What are you doing?!\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019 He goes, \u2018You need to relax. I am just trying to make you comfortable. Get comfortable.\u2019 And I said, \u2018No. I don\u2019t want to do this.\u2019 And I pushed him off and he said, \u2018OK, fine.\u2019 And I said I am going to go and he said, \u2018If you feel you must. You\u2019re in no condition to drive.\u2019 I said, \u2018I don\u2019t care I want to go.\u2019 So I managed to get my pants up and compose myself and I was just shocked. I walked out and went to my car until I felt well enough to drive home, and that was that.\u201d\n\nTHR spoke to four longtime friends of Brunton \u2014 Norah Roadman, Rob Donovan, Stephen Blackshear and Jan Steward \u2014 who said that he had confided in them about the Takei encounter years ago.\n\nTakei\u2019s rep, Julia Buchwald, told THR, \u201cGeorge is traveling in Japan and Australia and not reachable for comment.\u201d Takei, now 80, rose to fame playing Hikaru Sulu on the original Star Trek television series. He is also an author and activist and has been an outspoken advocate for LGBTQ rights.\n\nIn a series of tweets and in a Facebook post Saturday morning, Takei denied the allegations.\n\n\u201cThe events he describes back in the 1980s simply did not occur, and I do not know why he has claimed them now. I have wracked my brain to ask if I remember Mr. Brunton, and I cannot say I do,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now it is a he said / he said situation, over alleged events nearly 40 years ago. But those that know me understand that non-consensual acts are so antithetical to my values and my practices, the very idea that someone would accuse me of this is quite personally painful.\u201d\n\nBrunton claims that he met up with Takei years after the incident in Portland, Brunton\u2019s current home, while the actor was there on a book tour. \u201cI wanted to see him,\u201d Brunton says. \u201cI always wanted to ask him \u2014 I just felt really betrayed. I thought I was a friend and here I am later, just another piece of meat. So I called him up at the hotel \u2014 I figured out which hotel he was at \u2014 and he said \u2018Hi, Scott. I remember you.\u2019 I wanted to ask him why. We met for coffee, and I just couldn\u2019t bring myself to do it. It was just too uncomfortable.\u201d\n\nBrunton says he considered going to the media with the story for years, but he assumed no one would take him seriously. \u201cWho\u2019s going to believe me? It\u2019s my word against his,\u201d he says.\n\nBrunton\u2019s reasoning changed after the Harvey Weinstein scandal, and specifically when Takei spoke out regarding allegations leveled against Kevin Spacey.\n\nOn Oct. 29, Anthony Rapp, an actor starring in the latest Star Trek series, claimed to BuzzFeed News that Spacey sexually assaulted him while he was a minor in 1986. Spacey later apologized and came out as gay in response. \u201cWhen power is used in a non-consensual situation, it is a wrong,\u201d Takei said of the Spacey claim in a statement to THR on Oct. 30. \u201cFor Anthony Rapp, he has had to live with the memory of this experience of decades ago. For Kevin Spacey, who claims not to remember the incident, he was the older, dominant one who had his way. Men who improperly harass or assault do not do so because they are gay or straight \u2014 that is a deflection. They do so because they have the power, and they chose to abuse it.\u201d\n\nBrunton says he found Takei\u2019s response infuriating. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything from him but an apology,\u201d he says. \u201cI am sure he\u2019ll disown all this, I don\u2019t know, maybe not.\u201d\n\nFriends, I\u2019m writing to respond to the accusations made by Scott R. Bruton.
