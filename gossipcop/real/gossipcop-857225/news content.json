{"url": "https://outeast.com/stories/hamptons-celebrities-homes/", "text": "The Hamptons are a major hotspot for celebrity real estate. Hollywood\u2019s most famous flock to eastern Long Island every summer to live as only Hamptons celebrities can: soaking up sun on the beach, relaxing in their sprawling mansions, and hitting up adorable farm stands. It\u2019s enough to make us all a little envious. But we can always dream, right? Let\u2019s take a look at some of the most amazing celebrity homes in the Hamptons, including some formerly celebrity-owned homes that are currently for sale or rent.\n\nBrooke Shields in Southampton\n\nAmerica\u2019s sweetheart owns this charming cottage in Southampton: one of the more classic, historic neighborhoods in the Hamptons, and also one of the wealthiest. This 6-bedroom, 8-bath home has two laundry rooms and a library. Its covered outdoor dining area and huge freshwater pool look like they\u2019d make great places to take it easy.\n\nAnderson Cooper in Westhampton\n\nOur favorite CNN personality used to own this beautiful home in the quieter, more relaxed town of Westhampton. With those waterfront views and three acres of land, it\u2019s a wonder Cooper ever managed to leave. The place also has a ton of great designer touches, including built-ins, fireplaces, and Viking appliances.\n\nAnthony Scaramucci in Water Mill\n\nAnthony Scaramucci\u2019s stint in the Trump administration wasn\u2019t much shorter than his stint as the owner of this Water Mill house. Though he and his wife bought the new construction home in 2018 \u2014 for a whopping $9 million \u2014 they put it back on the market almost immediately as they searched for a home on the waterfront. The price isn\u2019t out of the norm for this hamlet on the South Fork, which has a bustling art scene. And here it buys 8 bedrooms, a huge pool with a hot tub, separate guest and staff suites, a media room, and a gym. Not to mention style and charm galore. The house sold in March 2020 for $7.5 million.\n\nNeil Patrick Harris in East Hampton\n\nNeil Patrick Harris hit it big when he and husband David Burtka bought a $5.5 million-house that sits on 13.5 acres of land in East Hampton. With a tennis court, pool, cabana, garage, and a location adjacent to 10 acres of town-owned, conserved land, he is truly living in the lap of luxury \u2014 and privacy.\n\nBethenny Frankel in Bridgehampton\n\nSkinnygirl magnate and reality TV star Bethenny Frankel put her Bridgehampton home up for sale in 2018 for just shy of $3 million, only seven months after she purchased it. A shingle-style classic, the house has 7 bedrooms, a pool, stone patio, a chef\u2019s kitchen, and much, much more. The house officially sold in February 2020 for $2.28 million.\n\nRamona Singer in Southampton\n\nOK, so maybe Ramona Singer doesn\u2019t live at this Southampton manse anymore. But that only means we regulars have an opportunity to rent one of the Real Housewives\u2019 Hamptons homes. In addition to having a ridiculously nice interior, the waterfront property also comes with a heated pool, covered decks, a bocce ball court, a sunken tennis court, and more. What a place to spend the summer.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z on Georgica Pond\n\nThe couple who could very well take over the world (their combined net worth is well over $1 billion) have a lovely home in East Hampton, one of the most exclusive towns in the Hamptons. Their house fits right in. Known as \u201cPond House,\u201d it\u2019s located next to Georgica Pond and sits near 17 acres of meadow preserve. With an infinity pool, hand-carved and heated marble bathtubs, and parquet de Versailles flooring, it\u2019s no wonder Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z shelled out $25 million for the place in 2017.\n\nJulianne Moore in Montauk\n\nJulianne Moore sold her airy Montauk cottage in May 2021 for $2.85 million. Moore and her husband, director Bart Freundlich, originally bought the property in 2007 for $1.05 million. The new owners will have access to the beach just past the backyard and all the fun activities that come with it, from kayaking to paddle boarding. And we love the wood-paneled walls and screened-in porch.\n\nAlec Baldwin in East Hampton\n\nAlec Baldwin has been spending much of his time in East Hampton since way back in the 1980s, when he started renting there. He purchased this house in 1995, and he and his wife Hilaria have since renovated it into a gorgeous family home.\n\nKelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos in Southampton\n\nKelly Ripa and husband Mark Consuelos bought their Southampton house in 2004 for $2.35 million. They have since put a whole lot of work into it. From a few glimpses in Instagram posts, we can surmise it has a gorgeous pool and backyard. Ripa and Consuelos put their Hamptons experience to good use when they sold a TV drama about the Hamptons to Freeform in 2018. The network hasn\u2019t made any updates on the program since, unfortunately.\n\nRobert Downey, Jr. in East Hampton\n\nIron Man himself owns the famous \u201cWindmill Cottage\u201d in East Hampton. (It doesn\u2019t feature a truly working windmill, but rather a replica of a classic Hamptons one.) The historic house, built in 1885, was apparently used to film the movie \u201cDeathtrap\u201d during the \u201880s. There\u2019s also a separate guesthouse onsite, in addition to a tennis court and pool.\n\nRobert De Niro in Montauk\n\nRobert De Niro owns this oceanfront property in Montauk, which his father passed down to him in the \u201890s. De Niro got permission from the town in 2017 to knock down the existing house and build something smaller. While we\u2019re not sure that has happened yet, we\u2019re excited to see what De Niro might do.\n\nCalvin Klein in Southampton\n\nFashion icon Calvin Klein reportedly spent more than $75 million building this house out on Meadow Lane in Southampton. In 2020, he sold the house to billionaire hedge fund manager Ken Griffin for an undisclosed price. (The Wall Street Journal speculated it could have been over $100 million.) From this Google Street View image, the house looks a bit like a big glass box. But of course it\u2019s more than that: The home sits right on the water, and sliding glass doors in every room look out over expertly landscaped sand dunes.\n\n\n\nChristie Brinkley in Bridgehampton\n\nIn 2018, the actress and model actually listed both of her Hamptons homes, deciding that she would live in whichever one didn\u2019t sell. The result? She still calls Tower Hill \u2014 an 11,000-square-foot historic home on 20 acres \u2014 home.\n\nJill Martin in Southampton\n\nWhen the TV personality and sportscaster needs a little break, she heads to a 6-bedroom, 6-bath Southampton home that was built in 2016. The 5,300-square-foot hideaway also includes a wine cellar and sauna.\n\nLouis CK on Shelter Island\n\nThe comedian dropped $2.44 million in 2014 for a charming Tudor from the 1900s dubbed Primrose Cottage. The historic home boasts plenty of original details and impressive old-world craftsmanship. And the two acres of waterfront escape, complete with a dock, make it an ideal retreat.\n\nElie Tahari in Sagaponack\n\nThis Sagaponack oceanfront home is everything you\u2019d expect from one of the world\u2019s top fashion designers. Spread out over 4,500 square feet are 3 bedrooms and bathrooms, a great room with soaring ceilings, a chef\u2019s kitchen, and a primary bedroom suite with unobstructed views of the Atlantic Ocean. And the 60-foot swimming pool is perfectly secluded by Russian olive trees. Tahari has been trying to sell the house since 2017, and relisted in 2019 at $39 million. It\u2019s not clear whether or not the house, which was listed with Sotheby\u2019s, ever sold.\n\nIna Garten in East Hampton\n\nWhen it comes to a celebrity chef\u2019s home, an eat-in kitchen with professional appliances and doors opening to an outdoor dining terrace are par for the course. The rest of the cozy space includes a primary bedroom suite with a balcony, a wraparound porch, and a formal dining room with French doors leading out to an arbor. Garten did list the three acre lot in prime East Hampton Village in 2019, but the listing has since been removed. It seems that she and Jeffrey still call the place home.\n\n[This post has been updated and republished.]\n\n\u2014\n\nFor the best of the Hamptons and North Fork, follow us on Facebook and Instagram.", "images": ["https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Scaramucci-New-Water-Mill-House-3555c5-118444.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/juliane-moore-hamptons-house-0d2286.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/robert-de-niro-montauk-house-2ebbbe.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/ramona-singer-hamptons-house-702c28.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/alec-baldwin-house-1a9441.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/OE-Hamptons-celebrities-brooke-shields-2021-f7cd73.png", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/louis-8c4ce7.png", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Christie-3874ab.png", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/kelly-ripa-and-mark-consuelos-hamptons-house-0e119f.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Bethenny-Frankel-Lists-Morning-Glory-House-f88442-c823d6.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/elie-4a723a.png", "https://outeast.com/wp-content/themes/outeast/assets/images/i-logo.svg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Robert-Downey-Jr-Hamptons-7d67ae.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Anderson-Cooper-house-hamptons-471a93.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/bedrock/app/uploads/sites/11/OE_avatar-a545e6-150x150.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/bedrock/app/uploads/sites/11/CelebHouses_Thumbnail-95eefd.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/jay-bey-pond-house-5f8c0c-1024x462-a78a94.jpg", "https://wp.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/neil-patrick-harris-hamptons-house-39305e.jpg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/Jill-009c8a.png", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/ina-0a60e6.png", "https://outeast.com/wp-content/themes/outeast/assets/images/i-shorthand-white.svg", "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/outeast/1/OE-hamptons-celebrities-calvin-klein-ae2562.png"], "top_img": "https://wp-tid.zillowstatic.com/bedrock/app/uploads/sites/11/CelebHouses_Thumbnail-95eefd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heading Out", "Jason Schneider"], "canonical_link": "https://outeast.com/stories/hamptons-celebrities-homes/", "title": "Check Out the Hamptons Homes of Your Favorite Celebrities", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Hamptons is full of celebrities, and you won't believe some of their homes.
