She may be 92 years old, but she seems more lively and upbeat than ever \u2014 and we\u2019re sure she\u2019s loving the recent royal marriages as well as the arrival of new little members of the family. While she may still be participating in royal engagements, there\u2019s no doubt that many worry about the old age of her and her husband, Prince Philip. And many wonder what may happen if Prince Philip, who\u2019s currently 97, outlives his beloved wife.\n\n\u2018London Bridge Is Down\u2019 is code for when the queen dies\n\nShe\u2019s held the title of queen for 65 years, Marie Claire notes \u2014 but the country still has to be prepared when she eventually passes. \u201cLondon Bridge Is Down\u201d is code for the queen\u2019s death, and it will first be uttered by the queen\u2019s private secretary over a secure phone line to the prime minister. From there, 15 governments outside the U.K. where Queen Elizabeth is the head of state as well as 36 other Commonwealth nations will be alerted far before the media catches wind.\n\nWhile it\u2019s widely reported that the BBC will be the first to break the news when Philip dies, the Press Association news agency and other global news will be told about the queen\u2019s death at once. This plan, as well as the rest of the protocol, has been laid out since the \u201960s and is carefully revised each year. And reporters at the BBC have even said they\u2019re so prepared for this day that they\u2019ve been rehearsing what they\u2019ll say when the queen dies for over 30 years.\n\nPhilip will not receive a \u2018King Father\u2019 title\n\nIn a scenario where Queen Elizabeth II dies before Philip, there\u2019s been wide speculation about what this will mean for his title. In reality, Philip\u2019s title wouldn\u2019t change. Associate professor Rob Cover told Quora that while Queen Elizabeth II\u2019s mother was known as \u201cQueen Mother\u201d to the public, Philip would not get a \u201cKing Father\u201d title if his wife was to die. And, in reality, Queen Mother isn\u2019t even an official royal title.\n\nThe reason Queen Elizabeth was given the Queen Mother title in the first place was to avoid confusion after her husband died. When Queen Elizabeth II took the throne after her father\u2019s death, the original Queen Elizabeth was then known as Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother. Since Philip doesn\u2019t interfere at all with the line of succession, there\u2019s no need for him to change titles if he were to be widowed.\n\nIt\u2019s up to Prince Charles to decide what happens next\n\nAfter Queen Elizabeth II dies, the next royal to take the throne is her son, Prince Charles. The public may think that Philip could be next in line, but according to succession rules, that\u2019s simply not the case. As Royal Central notes, Charles will take the throne next \u2014 and from there, it\u2019s up to him to decide what happens next. Charles will get to decide whether his father will be next in line for the throne after him, or if William is up next. As Marlene Koeing, a royal historian, notes, \u201cWe won\u2019t know until Charles is king.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s also unlikely Prince Philip would move, too. Koeing said, \u201cI doubt he would be uprooted. He stays at Sandringham, liking Wolferton.\u201d\n\nBoth royals appear to be in good health as of now\n\nThey may be elderly, but there\u2019s no doubt that these two royals are still in good health. Daily Express reports the queen is in \u201cremarkable health\u201d and has not spoken of retirement any time soon. And Prevention notes her healthy eating habits certainly contribute to her longevity, too.\n\nPhilip retired from royal engagements back in 2017, but there\u2019s little concern of his health failing him thus far. The public has noticed he\u2019s not around as much anymore, though, and it\u2019s been reported that he\u2019s needed a few surgeries. Even so, it seems we don\u2019t have to worry about any sudden changes in the royal family just yet.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Queen-Elizabeth-II-attends-the-annual-Braemar-Highland-Gathering-in-2018-1024x682.jpg?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Queen-Elizabeth-II-attends-the-annual-Braemar-Highland-Gathering-in-2018.jpg?w=1024&h=682", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/GettyImages-466072342.jpg?w=1024&h=787", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/GettyImages-969181178.jpg?w=1024&h=671", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Queen-Elizabeth-II-attends-the-annual-Braemar-Highland-Gathering-in-2018-1024x682.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Weiler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/what-happens-if-prince-philip-outlives-queen-elizabeth-ii.html/", "title": "What Happens if Prince Philip Outlives Queen Elizabeth II?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Now that Queen Elizabeth II and Prince Philip are both in their 90s, many wonder what will happen if Philip outlives his wife.
