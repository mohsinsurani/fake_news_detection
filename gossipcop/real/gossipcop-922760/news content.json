I just miss [him].\u201d\n\n\u201cHe was my lover and his name was Teddy,\u201d she told Henry. \u201cWe were never married, nor did we live together, but he was sick for a lot longer than we knew.\u201d\n\nTearing up, Lakshmi, 47, remembered the moment she got the phone call that Forstmann had passed.\n\n\u201cI remember asking what time did he actually die, because the night before I had an alarm bell go off in my head,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI called over to his house to say, \u2018I can come over right away.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cWhen he comes through, there\u2019s this feeling of freedom from this, not being limited to that physical state anymore, and I think that that\u2019s really important for you to know,\u201d Henry told her. \u201cHe is okay. He\u2019s at peace. When he comes through, he has such an awareness of the love that\u2019s there for you.\u201d\n\nAccording to E! News, Lakshmi went on to ask if she had Forstmann\u2019s \u201cblessing\u201d as she moves forward in her current relationship with Adam Dell, the father of her daughter Krishna, who was at odds with Forstmann when he was alive.\n\n\u201cHe does not want you to be alone,\u201d said Henry. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t want you to have to parent alone. And he\u2019s acknowledging this feeling that he will always be connected to you, but you should absolutely feel like you have permission to love who you want to love.\u201d\n\nLakshmi, who opened up about Forstmann in her 2016 memoir, Love, Loss and What We Ate, previously told PEOPLE that the late billionaire CEO of IMG wasn\u2019t the kind of man she ever thought she\u2019d date.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

He did not take himself too seriously, which is refreshing in someone who is that accomplished. He was really humble. He had self confidence. He had swagger. He was a man with a huge ego but he wore his uniqueness lightly.\u201d\n\nHollywood Medium with Tyler Henry airs Wednesdays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
