Jenner kept warm by wearing Griffin\u2019s jacket throughout the rest of the night.\n\n\u201cKendall was there supporting Blake. She arrived at The Avalon a few minutes before the show started and greeted several of Blake\u2019s friends. She seemed to know them well and they all stood around chatting,\u201d the source told E! News.\n\nJenner and Griffin were first linked to each other in August. But until today, the two have not yet confirmed the real status of their relationship. Every now and then, the rumored couple has been spotted at various public outings.\n\nFor instance, Jenner attended one of Griffin\u2019s basketball games recently. The \u201cKeeping Up With the Kardashians\u201d star and the professional athlete has also enjoyed lunch and dinner dates together.\n\nA source told US Weekly last month that even though the two have not yet confirmed that they\u2019re dating, they already have been a couple since October. \u201cThey\u2019re legit. They\u2019re a full-on couple. Kendall has been going to a lot of his games and they have been enjoying time at home when Blake is in town. They\u2019re good,\u201d the source said.\n\nJenner and her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, also went on a double date with Griffin and Travis Scott on Oct. 15 at the Universal Studios\u2019 Halloween Horror Nights.\n\n\u201cKylie and Kendall were both really loving and cuddly with their boyfriends. Both couples were almost always holding hands or had their arms around each other,\u201d an insider said.\n\nEarlier last month, Jenner was once again spotted at one of Griffin\u2019s games in Los Angeles. The rumored couple was seen hanging out by the bleachers, and they also mingled with their friends separately.\n\n\u201cKendall is very happy with Blake. They started out more like friends, and then it was very casual. But it seems more serious lately. When they are not together, they keep in touch over the phone. Her family has accepted Blake. They are spending time getting to know him,\u201d another insider told People.\n\nPhoto: Tristan Fewings/Getty Images for Bottega Veneta", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/12/08/kendall-jenner.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/12/08/kendall-jenner.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/12/08/kendall-jenner.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220/http://www.ibtimes.com/kendall-jenner-wears-rumored-boyfriend-blake-griffins-jacket-stay-warm-2626325", "title": "Kendall Jenner Wears Rumored Boyfriend Blake Griffin\u2019s Jacket To Stay Warm", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "kendall jenner wears blake griffin jacket, kendall jenner blake griffin dating,who is kendall jenner boyfriend, kendall jenner instagram, blake griffin la clippers, kendall jenner blake griffin relationship, kendall jenner news, blake griffin news", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220/http://www.ibtimes.com/kendall-jenner-wears-rumored-boyfriend-blake-griffins-jacket-stay-warm-2626325", "title": "Kendall Jenner Wears Rumored Boyfriend Blake Griffin\u2019s Jacket To Stay Warm", "description": "Kendall Jenner kept warm during a recent outing by wearing her rumored boyfriend Blake Griffin\u2019s jacket.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/12/08/kendall-jenner.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "modified_time": "2017-12-09T00:42:45-05:00", "published_time": "2017-12-09T00:42:45-05:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kendall Jenner Wears Rumored Boyfriend Blake Griffin\u2019s Jacket To Stay Warm", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220im_/http://www.ibtimes.com/kendall-jenner-wears-rumored-boyfriend-blake-griffins-jacket-stay-warm-2626325", "description": "Kendall Jenner kept warm during a recent outing by wearing her rumored boyfriend Blake Griffin\u2019s jacket.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171209071220im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/12/08/kendall-jenner.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "Kendall Jenner kept warm during a recent outing by wearing her rumored boyfriend Blake Griffin\u2019s jacket."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512798165.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
