Even those who've already read extensively about the Manson murders and their aftermath may find new insight into the pint-sized West Virginia-born con man who convinced a bevy of middle-class young women (and a few men) to murder for him.\n\nAmong the revelations? Manson studied Scientology. Yep, L.A.'s favorite \u201creligion\u201d also influenced its most notorious mass murderer \u2014 in prison, \u201cCharlie adopted those aspects of [L. Ron] Hubbard's teachings that lent themselves to manipulating others,\u201d Guinn reports. \u201cHis September 1961 report [by prison officials] noted, 'He appears to have developed a certain amount of insight into his problems through the study of [Scientology]. Manson is making progress for the first time in his life.'\u201d\n\nBut Hubbard isn't responsible for Manson turning into Manson. Turn the page to find out 10 chilling new things we learned from Guinn's biography \u2014 including the unlikely book the author credits for transforming Manson into a guru who fooled dozens of kids into following him straight into \u201cHelter Skelter.\u201d\n\n10. Manson learned his most effective techniques by studying Dale Carnegie. Carnegie, a salesman, had published How to Win Friends and Influence People in 1936, sharing his techniques for convincing others to do what you want. Good information for a salesman, yes, but supremely helpful for a con man.\n\nAfter stealing a car in Ohio and driving it to L.A., where his mother was living, Manson was sent to prison in San Pedro \u2014 and there he enrolled in a Carnegie course. It changed his life.\n\n\u201cCharlie had always evinced limited reading skills, but in this Carnegie class he proved that he could not only read but fully comprehend printed material if he was sufficiently engaged, and if instructors were helpful enough,\u201d Guinn writes. \u201cVirtually every word in the Carnegie publications resonated with Charlie. For the first time in his life he was considered an outstanding pupil.\u201d How to Win Friends, Guinn reports, \u201cseemed to formally codify all the ways Charlie had manipulated people since childhood.\u201d Acquaintances would later recall Manson using just those techniques on the young women in his \u201cfamily.\u201d\n\n9. In Manson's previous life, he was a square. Manson is associated strongly with '60s counterculture \u2014 after all, he found his calling on Haight-Ashbury, painted himself as a guru to the young women he recruited, and kept them tripping on acid and sexually pliant (free love, don't you know?). But as a young man in the '50s, Manson loved Frank Sinatra and, yes, Perry Como. He married a nice girl named Rosalie at 19 and had a baby soon thereafter. And he might have made it work, had Rosalie not left him during his time in prison in San Pedro. He got out in 1967 and, with nowhere to go and only a vague dream of being a pop star, convinced his parole officer he should move to San Francisco. That's where he realized the time's changing morals (and hordes of lost kids) could work for him, and the rest is history.\n\n8. Manson was so controlling, he banned the women who followed him from wearing eyeglasses. In the Haight and by trolling around Los Angeles, Manson picked up a half-dozen women who, over time, became the core of the Manson \u201cfamily.\u201d Nice girls from middle-class homes, these women fell for Manson's manipulation \u2014 using Carnegie's techniques and his own sociopathy, he expertly exploited their daddy issues.\n\nBy the time he moved his small commune to Spahn Ranch, an old movie set used to shoot Westerns near Simi Valley, he'd banned books, wristwatches, calendars and clocks. \u201cEyeglasses weren't allowed either,\u201d Guinn writes. \u201cCharlie explained that whatever the state of their vision, that was their natural way to see the world, and only natural things were good. New members were relieved of their glasses immediately; some of them developed permanent squints.\u201d\n\nTurn the page for more chilling facts, including which Hollywood star's boyfriend cheated on her with the Manson girls.\n\n7. Candice Bergen's boyfriend cheated on her \u2014 repeatedly \u2014 with the Manson girls. Manson used the women who followed him to gain favor with men he needed something from \u2014 first he broke down their sexual inhibitions by sleeping with them; then he shared them with men of his choosing. Once he settled in L.A., it was only natural that there would be connections to Hollywood. One early recruit? Didi Lansbury, daughter of Angela.\n\nAnd among the men who regularly partook of the women in Manson's stable were both Dennis Wilson of The Beach Boys and Terry Melcher, who was the son of Doris Day, a record producer with great success in his own right, and, yes, ostensibly in a committed relationship with Bergen, herself a successful actress.\n\nLater, Melcher would lie to investigators about his interaction with the Manson girls. Asked whether he'd had sex with the girls, he'd shown them a picture of Bergen: \u201cWhen I've got beauties like these to get in bed with,\u201d he asked, \u201cwhy would I want to screw any of Manson's clap-ridden, unwashed dogs?\u201d Ah, but he did. And it was Melcher's interactions with Manson in part that led Manson's gang to Sharon Tate's home that deadly night in August 1969.\n\n6. Manson and his family escaped notice because their hangout at Spahn Ranch fell between the jurisdiction of various law enforcement agencies. Local authorities knew there were 100 or so hippies living at Spahn Ranch \u2014 and they knew drug use and car thievery were probably rampant. But they put aside their suspicions for an all-too-predictable reason: \u201cSpahn Ranch was along the Los Angeles\u2013Ventura county line and there was some question about jurisdiction,\u201d Guinn reports. \u201cNeither county police department really wanted to take responsibility for law enforcement in the area, so nobody kept an eye on what Charlie and the family got up to.\u201d\n\n5. The LAPD nearly let Manson and his followers get away with murder. Perhaps the most shocking thing in Manson is how dimwitted the LAPD was. After Manson's followers killed five people on Cielo Drive (the \u201cTate murders,\u201d after their most famous victim, actress Sharon Tate) and two people in Los Feliz (the LaBianca murders) just 24 hours later, it took the police almost three months to connect the two crimes, Guinn reports. That's despite major similarities in the two crimes, including words written in the victims' blood on the walls. And though a man living near Cielo Drive recovered the gun used as a murder weapon soon after the crime, it was only by hounding the cops that he managed to get them to connect it to the murders \u2014 four months later.\n\n4. Even after Manson was arrested, his followers were convinced The Beatles would be on his side. When Rolling Stone came to interview the \u201cfamily\u201d after Manson's arrest but before his trial, in February 1970, they demanded money to tell their story. They also wondered aloud why The Beatles hadn't rushed to his aid. \u201cTell them to call,\u201d they told the journalists. \u201cGive them our number.\u201d\n\nTurn the page for more, including the way the Manson girls nearly killed a witness against them.\n\n3. Manson's lawyer was so annoying, and so boring, that at one point in his trial, the jury asked for NoDoz. Manson hired Irving Kanarek mainly to annoy the crap out of the prosecutors and the judge. Guinn writes, \u201cSomehow Charlie had learned about Kanarek, who routinely confounded judges and prosecutors and put juries to sleep by extending trials with drawn-out questioning of witnesses and frequent objections that seemed like filibusters.\u201d The downside is that he annoyed the jury, too. At one point, even Manson himself shouted, \u201cYou're just making things worse!\u201d Too late. Manson was sentenced to death, although the sentence later was reduced to life in prison.\n\n2. The Manson girls went so far as to try to murder a witness \u2014 by dosing her hamburger with acid. Two of Manson's followers lured a key witness to Hawaii, where they bought her a hamburger. As she was swallowing the last bites, Guinn relates, one of the Manson girls said casually, \u201cJust imagine if there were 10 tabs of acid in that.\u201d Before losing consciousness, the witness begged a stranger to call the prosecutor. She was treated for a drug overdose and survived; the \u201cgirls\u201d who gave her the tainted hamburger were charged with attempted murder.\n\n1. As Manson rotted in prison, his hold over his \u201cgirls\u201d continued. Sentenced to life in prison, Manson saw his followers carry out an unsuccessful assassination attempt on President Gerald Ford. He was happy to suggest he was still controlling them. He founded a new group called the \u201cOrder of the Rainbow,\u201d and ordered them to avoid sexual intercourse, meat, cigarettes, makeup and even \u201cmovies with violence.\u201d His new goal? To save the environment.\n\nJeff Guinn reads from Manson at Vroman's on August 14 at 7 p.m. Follow the L.A. Weekly on Twitter @LAWeekly.
