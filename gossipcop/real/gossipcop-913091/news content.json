But Underwood isn't letting her injuries get the best of her and instead is getting back into fighting shape.\n\nThe mother and wife of former NHL player Mike Fisher posted two photos of herself in her home gym. One of them shows the singer working out alongside her son and in the other one we see her son and husband doing push-ups.\n\nUnderwood captioned the image, \"My boys make work outs fun (and a bit less productive, but that\u2019s ok)!\"\n\nUnderwood took to Instagram last month to share an X-ray that revealed a metal plate and screws in the singer's wrist, supporting the break and keeping it in place for it heal.\n\nThe singer captioned the image, \"Last check up on the old wrist this morning!! Thanks, Dr. Wurth and my PT angel, Renee, a.k.a. \"Bulldog\" for fixing me up!!!,\" she wrote. \"I'm good to go!\"\n\nIn a New's Year Day blog, Underwood shared more details with her fans about the accident.\n\n\"In addition to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I\u2019ll spare you the gruesome details, but when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [Underwood\u2019s husband] Mike that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in,\u201d Underwood wrote on Jan. 1.\n\nShe called the fall a \u201cfreak random accident\u201d and said she was \u201cgrateful that it wasn\u2019t much, much worse.\u201d Underwood added that she wanted to share the details about her fall to let her fans know why she \u201cmight look a bit different\u201d when she returns on camera.\n\nThe singer said, \"I'm hoping that, by then, the differences are minimal, but, again, I just don't know how it's all going to end up.\"\n\nUnderwood has yet to share any full images of her face herself since having stitches, but a month after her accident, \"Below Deck\" star, Adrienne Gang, spotted Underwood with her husband at a Tennessee resort and snapped a pic with the singer.\n\nThe picture was the former \"American Idol\" contestant's first photo since her accident. Apart from a number of throwback pictures on her Instagram, the only current photo Carrie has shared of her face was on Nov. 6 and only featured the singer's eyes.\n\nFox News' Sasha Savitsky contributed to this report.\n\n", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/meek-mill-kanye.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/348/196/GettyImages-1427614638.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/348/196/tom-cruise-top-gun-press-conference.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/kathie-lee-brady-bundchen-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-411.svg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/04/19/896/500/694940094001_5773237900001_5700531402001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-876-reuters.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/Getty_QueenElizabeth_PrinceAndrew.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/348/196/Kanye_West_Kim_Kardashian.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-876-reuters.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Morgan Evans"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carrie-underwood-gets-back-in-shape-post-bad-fall-with-the-help-of-her-son", "title": "Carrie Underwood gets back in shape post bad fall with the help of her son", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "After suffering hand a face injuries from from a 2017 accident, Carrie Underwood has headed back to the gym with a new work out companion - her two-year-old son, Isaiah.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Morgan Evans", "dc.title": "Carrie Underwood gets back in shape post bad fall with the help of her son", "dcterms.abstract": "After suffering hand a face injuries from from a 2017 accident, Carrie Underwood has headed back to the gym with a new work out companion - her two-year-old son, Isaiah.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "After suffering hand a face injuries from from a 2017 accident, Carrie Underwood has headed back to the gym with a new work out companion - her two-year-old son, Isaiah.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:2cdeeba0-e9b3-5c99-916b-ed16bdae8b95", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-02-12", "dcterms.created": "2018-02-12T07:17:49-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-02-12T16:24:50-05:00", "og": {"title": "Carrie Underwood gets back in shape post bad fall with the help of her son", "description": "After suffering hand a face injuries from from a 2017 accident, Carrie Underwood has headed back to the gym with a new work out companion - her two-year-old son, Isaiah.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/carrie-underwood-876-reuters.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carrie-underwood-gets-back-in-shape-post-bad-fall-with-the-help-of-her-son", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Carrie Underwood gets back in shape post bad fall with the help of her son", "description": "After suffering hand a face injuries from from a 2017 accident, Carrie Underwood has headed back to the gym with a new work out companion - her two-year-old son, Isaiah.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/carrie-underwood-876-reuters.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/carrie-underwood-gets-back-in-shape-post-bad-fall-with-the-help-of-her-son"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment", "classification-tags": "celebrity,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
