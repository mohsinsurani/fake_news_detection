Friday Night Lights alum Zach Gilford and Kingdom actress Kiele Sanchez have welcomed their first child together, Us Weekly confirms.\n\nZeppelin Adele Gilford was born via surrogate on Wednesday, November 29, in Los Angeles. The couple, who met in 2010 on the set of the ABC pilot The Matadors and tied the knot in December 2012, chose the name Adele for Gilford\u2019s grandmother.\n\nAs previously reported, Sanchez suffered a late-term miscarriage in October 2015.\n\n\u201cWe regretfully confirm that Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez recently lost their child to a late-term miscarriage,\u201d the couple\u2019s rep told Us in a statement at the time. \u201cNo additional details will be made available. We thank everyone in advance for their sensitivity and discretion during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nThe 40-year-old actress opened up about her loss and returning to work on the DirecTV/Audience series Kingdom in an emotional guest column for The Hollywood Reporter in July 2016.\n\n\u201cIt was a few weeks after losing my pregnancy. A few weeks after giving birth to him. My son, Winter,\u201d Sanchez wrote at the time. \u201cI was in New York and was supposed to start shooting the next season of Kingdom in a few weeks. I couldn\u2019t imagine it. The amount of pain I felt consumed me. Every day it bit at me. Chewed on me. Swallowed me. I felt heavy and hollow \u2026 We had filmed the last season with my character, Lisa, pregnant so she either has the baby or she doesn\u2019t. Both seemed merciless. I told him I\u2019m at my lowest. I can\u2019t imagine playing anything other than where I\u2019m at. If I can turn this into \u2026 something. He asked if I was sure and I said let\u2019s lean in.\u201d\n\nSanchez\u2019s Kingdom character, Lisa, ended up having a miscarriage like Sanchez.\n\n\u201cIt ended up being cathartic. A word I never really knew until now,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI have so much pride that we didn\u2019t shy away. That we created something that speaks to suffering that for some reason lives in shadows. I am grateful that I was put in a position that I did not have the option to hide. I\u2019m glad that we leaned in. Went into the humanity of heartbreak.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kiele-sanchez-zach-gilford.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1405px%2C794px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kiele-sanchez-zach-gilford.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1405px%2C738px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kiele-sanchez-zach-gilford.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1405px%2C738px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/zach-gilford-and-kiele-sanchez-welcome-first-child/", "title": "Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez Welcome First Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez have welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Zeppelin Adele Gilford \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez Welcome First Child", "description": "Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez have welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Zeppelin Adele Gilford \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/zach-gilford-and-kiele-sanchez-welcome-first-child/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:08:07+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kiele-sanchez-zach-gilford.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1405px%2C738px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kiele-sanchez-zach-gilford.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1405px%2C738px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-22T23:24:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:08:07+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez Welcome First Child", "description": "Zach Gilford and Kiele Sanchez have welcomed their first child together, a daughter named Zeppelin Adele Gilford \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/kiele-sanchez-zach-gilford.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1405px%2C738px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513985092.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
