When we stopped at Guitar Centre, that felt like we were done, but it was like \u2018this is halfway\u2019.\u201d\n\nDescribing the experience to NME as \u201ca little uncomfortable\u201d, the Foo Fighters belted out hits \u2018All My Life\u2019, \u2018Best Of You\u2019 and \u2018Learn to Fly\u2019. Afterwards, Smear said \u201csinging other people\u2019s songs would have been easier.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrohl added: \u201cI could do that all day. We did The Ramones, and Rick Astley, but they didn\u2019t use it. I don\u2019t know why.\u201d\n\nNow, in an interview with The Sun, Grohl revealed that Corden sent him a text soon after the show about his comments.\n\n\u201cI got a fucking text from him [the next day],\u201d the frontman said. \u201c[James] was like, \u2018What the fuck, dude?\u2019 I was like, \u2018Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god!'\u201d\n\nGrohl told The Sun that he tried to explain his thoughts to Corden more clearly.\n\n\u201cWhat we were trying to say was it was uncomfortable to sit in a car and try to sing our own songs. If we were singing Queen songs or Led Zeppelin songs or Beatles songs, it would have been fine\u2026but to sit there and sing your own songs\u2026we felt weird about it.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGrohl added that Corden was \u201ca sweet guy\u201d and that they didn\u2019t have a terrible time.\n\nThe Foo\u2019s are currently on tour and will play two dates in London this week on June 22-23 at London Stadium.", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FOO_FIGHTERS_CARPOOL_1000-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FOO_FIGHTERS_CARPOOL_1000.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FOO_FIGHTERS_CARPOOL_1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Aubrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/james-corden-responds-dave-grohls-comments-uncomfortable-carpool-karaoke-2342160", "title": "James Corden responds to Dave Grohl\u2019s comments about being \u201cuncomfortable\u201d on Carpool Karaoke", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "James Corden responds to Dave Grohl's comments about carpool karaoke", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "James Corden responds to Dave Grohl's comments about being \"uncomfortable\" on Carpool Karaoke", "description": "James Corden responds to Dave Grohl's comments about carpool karaoke", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/james-corden-responds-dave-grohls-comments-uncomfortable-carpool-karaoke-2342160", "site_name": "NME", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/FOO_FIGHTERS_CARPOOL_1000.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "published_time": "2018-06-21T20:46:19+00:00"}, "author": "Elizabeth Aubrey", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nme", "site": "@nme", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Elizabeth Aubrey", "label2": "Estimated reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Xe0Qd6bUFo?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1529613979.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
