But then, his awful bathroom scene comes to pass. In one of the Netflix drama\u2019s most shockingly brutal scenes yet, viewers are forced to watch as Montgomery \u201cMonty\u201d de la Cruz (Timothy Granaderos) bashes Tyler\u2019s face in multiple times, drowns him in a toilet bowl, and then viciously sodomizes the boy with the handle of a broomstick, leaving him half-nude and bleeding on the floor. It is a truly horrific moment, and one that convinces Tyler that his hopeful outlook was futile \u2014 that the athletes of Liberty High will never stop abusing their power to unspeakable ends. This idea is only reinforced when Tyler goes home to find himself still bleeding, presumably out of his anus.", "images": ["https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/eea/0,1350,4000,2100/x,80/1969084/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/eea/0,1350,4000,2100/x,80/1969084/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ineye Komonibo", "Katherine Singh", "Mekita Rivas", "Olivia Truffaut-Wong", "Melissah Yang", "Shamira Ibrahim", "Reasons Why Season Shocking Ending"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/05/199584/13-reasons-why-season-2-episode-13-recap-finale-ending", "title": "13 Reasons Why Season 2 Shocking Ending, Explained", "meta_data": {"title": "13 Reasons Why Season 2 Shocking Ending, Explained", "description": "\"13 Reasons Why\" has one of the most upsetting finales of 2018.
