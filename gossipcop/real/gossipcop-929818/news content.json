It looked like it was going to take months more.\u201d\n\nMeek was permitted specific visiting times and phone calls by officials at the jail in Chester, and the Supreme Court notified his legal team of his bail outside of these permitted hours on Tuesday, so supporters couldn\u2019t reach him with the good news.\n\nMeek said of the moment he learned of his freedom, \u201cI was in my cell and I was watching the news, and they said I\u2019m free. I immediately said a quick prayer, and got ready to go.\u201d\n\nHe added that he still had work to do to get his original conviction overturned, given that it was based on the evidence of an alleged corrupt cop, and to shine a light on others trapped in a failing criminal justice system.\n\nBut for tonight, he was ready to celebrate at the 76ers game. \u201cWe are on to see the Sixers game, and its going to be a big night for Philly. The team is going to advance, and I came home.\u201d\n\nHe said his greatest joy will be to be reunited with his 6-year-old son, Papi, who he has barely seen during his five months in jail, because he didn\u2019t want him to see his dad in jail. Papi had been seen at a previous rally holding up a sketch of his father that read \u201cFree Meek Mill\u201d and adorably told a reporter, \u201cI miss my dad very much.\u201d\n\nMeek explained, \u201cI am going to watch the game with my son and my family tonight. I can\u2019t wait to see my son, it\u2019s his birthday on May 13 and he had been asking how we were going to celebrate. When I was in jail I couldn\u2019t give him an answer, I didn\u2019t know what to say to him, but now I\u2019m going to be spending all this time with him.\u201d\n\nMeek added he also wanted to take the time to thank all the supporters, fans and friends who have campaigned for his release, and promised to fight to change the criminal justice system that keeps innocent people in jail, and to also help others in his situation that do not have the same resources to fight for their freedom.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/heat_76ers_basketball-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/heat_76ers_basketball.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/meekmill.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/950886058.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/aptopix_meek_mill_released.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/04/meekmill.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Smith", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/04/24/meek-mill-says-hes-in-a-daze-in-first-interview-since-being-freed-on-bail/", "title": "Meek Mill \u2018in a daze\u2019 since being freed on bail", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
