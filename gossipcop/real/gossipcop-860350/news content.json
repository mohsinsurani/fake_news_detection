They all want a romantic comedy, a happy ending.

Lopez called Rodriguez, 43, her \"twin soul\" at the MTV VMAs in August.

And it's good enough right now.\"\n\nShe's loving Rodriguez in a big way.\n\n\"I have nothing but the most amazing things to say about Alex. He\u2019s an incredible friend, partner and father. And he's a family man. He\u2019s just awesome,\" says Lopez. \"We have this great loving support system.
