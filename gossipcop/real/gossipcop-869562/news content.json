Kelley February 19, 2017 ( ) 1.13[6] At an elementary school in Monterey, California, a murder occurs at a school fundraiser, but neither the victim nor the murderer is revealed. Flashing back to the first day of school, the families of five first-graders are introduced. Madeline Martha Mackenzie is a strong-willed and wealthy alpha female in town who is struggling to cope with her ex-husband Nathan's marriage to a yoga instructor named Bonnie while also trying to build a relationship with her older daughter, Abigail. Madeline's friend, Celeste Wright, is a retired lawyer and the mother of twin sons, who are also beginning at the same school. Madeline and Celeste befriend Jane Chapman, a young single mother who moved to Monterey hoping to provide her son, Ziggy, with a better life. Amabella, the daughter of the equally wealthy and volatile Renata Klein, accuses Ziggy of attempting to choke her at school, which he denies.

Nathan tries to come to a peaceful resolution with Ed about their parenting of Abigail, but Ed senses Nathan is trying to intimidate him, and stands firm. Madeline's younger daughter, Chloe, and Bonnie's daughter, Skye, attempt to mend the wounds between Ziggy and Amabella, but it leads to Ziggy kissing Amabella and causing an incident. The parents of the four children are called into the principal's office, leading Jane to have a flashback of an unwanted sexual encounter. 3 3 \"Living the Dream\" Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e David E. Kelley March 5, 2017 ( ) 1.04[8] Perry chokes Celeste when he believes she deliberately left him out of a family gathering; Celeste threatens to leave him. Renata's party for Amabella is a success, but she is ultimately upset when Madeline invited Amabella's closest friends and Ziggy to Disney on Ice on the same day. At therapy, Perry claims his outbursts are out of fear that Celeste does not love him, which Celeste attempts to deny. When Abigail's academic performance begins to decline, her guidance counselor suggests it is being caused by stress at home, so she decides to live with Nathan, much to Madeline's dismay. Jane gets Ziggy involved with more extracurricular activities and helps him construct a family tree for school with Madeline's help. However, Jane opposes Ziggy\u2019s insistence on putting his father's name on the tree, and she ultimately confides to Madeline that Ziggy was the result of rape by a man named \"Saxon Banks,\" whom she has not seen since. 4 4 \"Push Comes to Shove\" Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e David E.

Joseph and Madeline kiss, and they are revealed to have had an affair a year ago. Madeline locates a man online whom she believes to be Jane's rapist; she informs Jane and Celeste, and they plan to travel to San Luis Obispo to confront him. Ms. Barnes, the kids' teacher, suspects Amabella is still being bullied. Despite Amabella's assertions that she and Ziggy are friends, Ms. Barnes convinces Jane to have Ziggy psychologically evaluated.

Kelley March 19, 2017 ( ) 1.17[10] Nathan spots Jane at the gun range and tells Madeline.

Celeste's therapist advises her to prepare to leave Perry by renting an apartment and disclosing the abuse to friends. Perry later tries to forcefully initiate sex with Celeste, who defensively fractures his penis with a tennis racket. Returning from the hospital, Perry tells Celeste that she is \"lucky\" that he did not kill her. The following day, Celeste begins looking for an apartment. At the opening night of Avenue Q, Tori confronts Madeline about having an affair with Joseph.

Kelley April 2, 2017 ( ) 1.86[12] Following another beating, Celeste decides to leave Perry the day after trivia night.

When preparing to leave for trivia night, Perry sees a text message on Celeste's phone from the landlady of her new apartment. He confronts her on the way to the party, but is interrupted by Renata.

The two of them were expected to develop the project as a film in which they would star and act as executive producers, sharing the latter duty with Bruna Papandrea and Per Saari; Moriarty was also expected to produce.[20] In November of that year, the actresses announced the format's shift into that of a limited-run television series written by David E. Kelley.[21] In May 2015, HBO gave the series a production order and Kelley was announced to join the team of executive producers.[22] That October, Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e was reportedly in talks with the project's team to handle directing of the first episode and potentially others.[23] His involvement with all seven episodes was confirmed almost two months later.[24] The series' release date of February 19, 2017, was unveiled in November 2016.[25]\n\nOriginally conceived and billed as a miniseries,[26] a potential new season of Big Little Lies was discussed by the series' audience and the media. In July 2017, two weeks after the project and its cast and crew received several nominations for the 69th ceremony of the Primetime Emmy Awards, Witherspoon stated: \"As of right now, I think it's pretty whole. I feel really good about where it is, and if this is all it ever was, it's a beautiful thing we all accomplished together\".[27][28] However, in the wake of the nominations, HBO revealed that a second season was possible, and that Moriarty had been asked to write a story for it.[29] During a April 2017 interview, Vall\u00e9e came out strongly against the idea of producing a second season: \"There's no reason to make a season two. That was meant to be a one-time deal, and it's finishing in a way where it's for the audience to imagine what can happen. If we do a season two, we'll break that beautiful thing and spoil it.\"[30] When he and the series won several accolades at the 69th ceremony of the Primetime Emmy Awards, the director changed his mind: \"It'd be great to reunite the team and to do it. Are we going to be able to do it, altogether? I wish.\"[31]\n\nIn December 2017, HBO officially renewed the series for a seven-episode second season to be written by Kelley, directed by Andrea Arnold,[32] based on a new novella by Moriarty,[26] and with Vall\u00e9e remaining an executive producer.[33] The announcement of the second season, and specifically its timing, enraged producers of rival shows that were competing for award nominations in the limited series categories, particularly since it was made after voting for the Critics' Choice Television Award and Golden Globe Award were over.[34] Due to this, the Producers Guild of America restarted voting for the 2018 ceremony of their award show, reclassifying the show from a limited series to a drama series.[35][36] The second season premiered on June 9, 2019.\n\nIn July 2019, it was reported by IndieWire that director Andrea Arnold lost creative control after filming had completed, and it was given to season 1 director Jean-Marc Vall\u00e9e in an attempt to unify the style between the seasons. Arnold was initially promised by HBO that the show would be done in her vision, including post-production, and was unaware that Vall\u00e9e would edit the footage she had shot. Once Vall\u00e9e completed his work on Sharp Objects, he took over the editing process along with his own editorial team in Montreal. HBO also ordered 17 more days of additional photography, to be filmed by Arnold, but overseen by Vall\u00e9e. Significant reworking of the episodes also took place, where episodes were shortened.[37] In response, HBO programming president Casey Bloys stated, \"There's a lot of misinformation around that subject\" and \"the director typically does not have final creative control\". Bloys clarified that Vall\u00e9e came back to \"hone the episodes\" after being asked by the entire producing team, including Reese Witherspoon and Nicole Kidman, and that they were clear with Arnold about how the process would work from the start.[38]\n\nCasting [ edit ]\n\nAlongside the initial announcement of the production's development, Kidman and Witherspoon were reported to also star in the adaptation.[21][22] In December 2015, Shailene Woodley, Adam Scott, Laura Dern, and Zo\u00eb Kravitz were announced to have been cast in lead roles, with Kathryn Newton in a recurring one.[39][40][41][42] The following month, Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd, James Tupper, and Jeffrey Nordling joined the starring cast, while Santiago Cabrera, P. J. Byrne, Kelen Coleman, Sarah Burns, Darby Camp, Cameron and Nicholas Crovetti, Ivy George, Chloe Coleman, Virginia Kull, Sarah Baker, Kathreen Khavari, Larry Bates, Hong Chau, Gia Carides, Merrin Dungey, Larry Sullivan, David Monahan, and Iain Armitage landed supporting roles.[43][44] The latter one was cast in the role of Woodley's character's son.[45]\n\nFollowing the confirmation of a sophomore season, Meryl Streep was announced in January 2018 to have joined the starring cast in the role of Skarsg\u00e5rd's character's mother.[46][47] In February, Woodley, Dern, Kravitz, Scott, Tupper, Nordling and Armitage were confirmed to be returning.[48][49][50] That March, Douglas Smith was cast in a recurring role.[51][52] In April, it was reported that Crystal Fox joined the main cast alongside returners Newton and Sokolovic, while Mo McRae and Martin Donovan joined the recurring cast alongside returners Weigert and Dungey.[53][54] However, only Newton received main billing; Fox and Sokolovic's appearances were credited as recurring. Byrne was announced alongside newcomer Poorna Jagannathan in May,[55][56] followed by Denis O'Hare in June.[57]\n\nFilming [ edit ]\n\nFor the first season, Vall\u00e9e shot the series with an Arri Alexa digital camera and preferred using natural lighting and handheld shooting style to allow actors to move freely around the set.[27] Several scenes were filmed on location in the Monterey Peninsula, Big Sur, Pacific Grove, and Carmel Highlands.[58]\n\nSoundtrack [ edit ]\n\nABKCO Records released soundtracks for the first and second seasons on March 31, 2017,[59][60] and July 19, 2019, respectively.[61][62]\n\nRelease [ edit ]\n\nBroadcast [ edit ]\n\nOn February 7, 2017, the series held its official premiere at the TCL Chinese Theatre in Los Angeles, California.[63][64] Internationally, the series premiered on February 20, 2017, in Australia on Showcase,[65] and on March 13, 2017, in the United Kingdom and Ireland on Sky Atlantic.[66]\n\nMarketing [ edit ]\n\nOn October 16, 2016, HBO released the first teaser trailer for the series.[67] On December 5, 2016, HBO released a full length trailer for the series.[68]\n\nHome media [ edit ]\n\nThe first season was released on Blu-ray and DVD on August 1, 2017.[69] The second season was released on January 7, 2020, on DVD and manufacture-on-demand Blu-ray by Warner Home Entertainment and Warner Archive Collection respectively.[70]\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nCritical response [ edit ]\n\nCritical response of Big Little Lies Season Rotten Tomatoes Metacritic 1 93% (125 reviews)[71] 75 (42 reviews)[72] 2 86% (105 reviews)[73] 82 (36 reviews)[74]\n\nOn the review aggregation website Rotten Tomatoes, the first season holds a 93% \"certified fresh\" rating with an average rating of 8 out of 10 based on 125 reviews.
