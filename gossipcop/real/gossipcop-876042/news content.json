Again!!\u201d wrote Gadot on Instagram. \u201cAnd as much as the first time shooting Wonder Woman was amazing, this time was even more unique and special.. We shot in 4 very different locations in 3 countries, and I\u2019m so soooo proud of the almost 1000 crew members who came to set every day, giving everything they have into our movie.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t ask for better partners on this..\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019m so lucky to have the one and only Patty Jenkins, as my director. She always has our backs, she gives us the wings to dare, and everyday she helped us find the most creative version of ourselves .. I am so grateful to call her my friend. And to our AMAZINGly talented cast who made every day enjoyable and fun, thank you!\u201d\n\n\u201cHonestly.. Words cannot describe this experience.. This journey was so demanding and challenging but we all came and did our very best every take, every day, putting our all out there and I\u2019m so proud\u2026 Thank you universe for this opportunity. I love this character. And thank you to all of you for being the best fans in the world. It was you that made me push myself every day. I\u2019m so happy and excited, can\u2019t wait to share it with you in 2020! Gal\u201d\n\nThe forthcoming film stars Kristen Wiig as the new villain Cheetah and Pedro Pascal.
