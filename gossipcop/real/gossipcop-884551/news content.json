Rivera originally filed for divorce last November.\n\nWhile it\u2019s unclear if the dismissal means the pair \u2014 who share son Josey, 2 \u2014 are back together, a source told E! News, \u201cThey want to make it work for the sake of their son.\u201d\n\nDorsey, 34, and Rivera first dated in 2010 before going their separate ways while she starred on Glee. They later wed in July 2014, just three months after her engagement to rapper Big Sean ended.\n\nIn their November statement about the divorce, the couple told PEOPLE, \u201cAfter much consideration, we have made the decision to end our marriage. Our priority is and always will be our beautiful son that we share together. We will continue to be great co-parenting partners for him. We ask for respect and privacy for our family during this difficult time.\u201d\n\nRivera asked for primary physical custody of Josey, with visitation rights for Dorsey.\n\nIn April, the Glee alum told Momtastic that she and Dorsey are \u201cvery good at co-parenting.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always going to have its challenges logistically, but Josey is our priority,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019re his parents.\u201d\n\nAdded Rivera, \u201cIf everybody looks at it that way, it alleviates some of the drama. Doing what\u2019s best for Josey is really what it all boils down to.\u201d\n\nRivera did not respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/Q5V5d3IWFAU2nWd5Ag_lY0rjZcg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/naya-rivera-1-73e151500c5e4953a396ed808631c1f0.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZhfpwC-O6u8JDS2H_aAH1wexU1Q=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(706x0:708x2)/naya-rivera-e925a2cdd6974f78a1f5d23a81814ccd.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/y8mpiVPSVwt2n4KOiD9B6JVLjRo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(216x0:218x2)/naya-rivera-435-35-3092a86f28344200b9e2c01e077bac4a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/VyPE_FAdaa40UFGtTwI_vKWWs8M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(797x0:799x2)/september-birthdays-3-2000-28bc8f0388544c46991f26e88da67d0f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QPkftVxEma6AmUzpAxLWGvqAdg8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(685x0:687x2)/naya-rivera2-1-2000-75195b28201d4fad97c6e7d20394d305.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ApJ0lHwsKfkepYhI48pf-wG5jXM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Darren-Criss-Naya-Rivera2-cd8c38d530c44b0c85fe9c872c090e79.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ipBDgkEZhFfBO6X4yn6xsOsRfXE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/naya-rivera-14-3ac83784092f4982a318dd3656af80a6.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jJTJVCMda00QYQ_G043sQXWZT2A=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/ryan-dorsey-1-1-6ec7f5ae317a4c88953feee6cdb6188f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XkX6jLI3FYDg7vifBMEtSD3ZUQ4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x238:1001x240)/naya-rivera-7-671a667d57d14c7fbbb9ec06f5428857.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XfmwT_uAwnaDgfZlx17-1jFyZVo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(852x0:854x2)/naya-rivera-1-bf33877fa4c241408e41f93f956450f4.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rK1hgyEOmM1kPVTZ9jw2vMD1KrU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(614x0:616x2)/naya-2000-b369dbe141254e4ab69e9e804432ce80.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/luCt6oXsWQOIRuuicUIJ95O-zK8=/1707x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/naya-rivera-1-bf33877fa4c241408e41f93f956450f4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/luCt6oXsWQOIRuuicUIJ95O-zK8=/1707x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/naya-rivera-1-bf33877fa4c241408e41f93f956450f4.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/naya-rivera-calls-off-divorce-ryan-dorsey/", "title": "Naya Rivera Calls Off Divorce from Ryan Dorsey: Reports", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The couple \u2014 who wed in 2014 \u2014 originally told PEOPLE they were divorcing in November 2016", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "PEOPLE", "sailthru.author": "Lindsay Kimble", "article": {"section": "People", "opinion": "false", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/peoplemag"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Peoplemag", "url": "https://people.com/tv/naya-rivera-calls-off-divorce-ryan-dorsey/", "title": "Naya Rivera Calls Off Divorce from Ryan Dorsey: Reports", "description": "The couple \u2014 who wed in 2014 \u2014 originally told PEOPLE they were divorcing in November 2016", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/luCt6oXsWQOIRuuicUIJ95O-zK8=/1707x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/naya-rivera-1-bf33877fa4c241408e41f93f956450f4.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "title": "Naya Rivera Calls Off Divorce from Ryan Dorsey: Reports", "description": "The couple \u2014 who wed in 2014 \u2014 originally told PEOPLE they were divorcing in November 2016", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/luCt6oXsWQOIRuuicUIJ95O-zK8=/1707x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/naya-rivera-1-bf33877fa4c241408e41f93f956450f4.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
