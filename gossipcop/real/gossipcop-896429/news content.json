The couple, who have been together since last year and announced their engagement on the morning of 27 November, looked very much in love as they sat down with the BBC's Mishal Husain for their television appearance, and spoke about Harry's romantic proposal and their whirlwind romance.\n\nTalking about the stunning engagement ring, Prince Harry turned conversation to his late mother in an incredibly emotional way. \"The ring is - is obviously yellow gold because that's her favourite - and the main stone itself I sourced from Botswana and the little diamonds either side are from my mother's jewellery collection to make sure that she's with us on this on this crazy journey together,\" Harry revealed.\n\nMORE: Why Meghan and Harry are so perfect for each other\n\nWhen asked what it meant to have Princess Diana's diamonds on her engagement ring, the American actress, 36, replied, \"I think everything about Harry's thoughtfulness is - and the inclusion of that and obviously not being able to meet his mom it's so important to me to - to know that she's a part of this with us. And I think in being able to meet his aunts and - and also like Julia and just different people who were so important to his mom, I'm able to, in some way, know a part of her through them and of course through him. And it's - it's incredibly special. And you know to be able to have this, which sort of links where you come from and Botswana which is important to us and it's - it's perfect.\"\n\nLoading the player...\n\nHarry was in no doubt as to what his beloved mother would have thought of his future wife. \"Oh, they'd be thick as thieves, without question, I think she would be over the moon, jumping up and down, you know so excited for me,\" he said, emotionally. \"But then, as I said, [they] would have probably been best friends - best friends with Meghan.\"\n\nHarry admitted his day had been slightly bittersweet. \"It is days like - days like today when - when I really miss having her around and miss being able to share the happy news. But you know with the ring and with everything else that's going on I'm sure she's \u2026\"\n\n\"She's with us,\" interjected Meghan.\n\nHarry added, \"I'm sure she's with us yeah, you know, jumping up and down somewhere else.\"\n\nPHOTOS: Meghan Markle and Princess Diana's similarities\n\nHis comments echoed those previously made by older brother Prince William, who proposed to wife Kate in 2010 using Diana's sapphire engagement ring. Speaking during their first TV interview together, William said of his mother: \u201cI thought it was quite nice because obviously she's not going to be around to share any of the fun and excitement of it all - this was my way of keeping her sort of close to it all.\u201d\n\nKate also spoke affectionately about the late Princess, saying: \u201cObviously I would have loved to have met her. She\u2019s obviously she's an inspirational woman to look up to.\u201d\n\nThe exciting news of Harry and Meghan's engagement was revealed in a statement issued by Kensington Palace on Monday.
