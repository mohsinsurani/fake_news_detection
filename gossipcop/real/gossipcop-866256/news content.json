{"url": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/style-rules-for-dressing-your-age", "text": "In my late twenties I made an idle life plan. I say plan, but it was more of an un-plan. Get the hell over fashion by 40, was its gist. Forty seemed monumentally ancient and \u2013 happily \u2013 a zillion years into the future. No way would I be hobbling to fashion shows aged 41 (I had a very bleak impression of the ageing process back then). Public displays of undignified excitement about the new must-have, aged 45? God forbid.\n\nWhat was I thinking? I\u2019m now at the stage where 40 looks immature, and, I can tell you, that tingle you feel when you get your hands on \u2013 or your feet in \u2013 a transformative piece of kit\u2026 it never leaves you. This can only be one of life\u2019s positives. Given that no one is exempt from having to get dressed most days, I \u2013 we \u2013 might as well do it to the best of our abilities, whatever our DOB.\n\nBeing well-dressed is a discipline. It\u2019s a talent. It\u2019s a lifelong learning curve\n\nBeing well-dressed is a discipline. It\u2019s a talent. It\u2019s a lifelong learning curve \u2013 and it can\u2019t be done without an injection of fashion. And yes, I do know that \u201ca uniform\u201d is the holy grail of modern style. It says you know who you are, what you want to project, and that you\u2019ve managed to reduce it all to a single navy/latex/whatever exclamation mark. But uniforms can adapt: see Kate Moss, Stella Tennant, Emmanuelle Alt, Miuccia Prada, Caroline de Maigret, and In\u00e8s de la Fressange, who all constantly recalibrate their stylistic affiliations while staying true to their essence. Static style, on the other hand, is the sartorial equivalent of having your face Botoxed and filled until it\u2019s an unmovable mask of fear.", "images": ["https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615a874380008571626/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/2:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/63088b12ed55665a8eeb8b79/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/63359a68653aac3e89335a91/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615c6ae3400088a4a3a/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/62d03efbd56e620109c3a529/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615eabedb00089dfa8b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d5456152c0c410008892d73/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615c6ae3400088a4a3c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/original", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/633e9039b6eaf74035834def/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/62cff9c9bb9aa3b9cc48a4be/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/62d91d6a90297ee640ca231e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-international/assets/logo.666f451251327ad507cba9476f77eab9ebec74c9.svg", "https://www.vogue.co.uk/verso/static/vogue-international/assets/logo-reverse.8cfc2e9ff33a3bdbe862fb3e5726a0f79a1f681d.svg", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/633efdd8b6eaf74035834e4b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original"], "top_img": "https://media.vogue.co.uk/photos/5d545615ea07410008b93986/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/original", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lisa Armstrong"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.co.uk/article/style-rules-for-dressing-your-age", "title": "On Fighting - And Winning - The Style Eclipse", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Fight the style eclipse.
