They met and hooked up within an hour of starting to film the season on June 4.\n\n\u201cWe got turnt up,\u201d he recalled of their encounter. Though the incident was caught on tape, ABC only aired their interactions leading up when Paradise premiered last week. \u201cWe\u2019re at the bar, we\u2019re hanging out. One thing leads to another and we\u2019re making out \u2026 The pool gets a little intense and I didn\u2019t think anything of it.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cWho would say \u2018no\u2019 to Corinne?\u201d\n\nWithin days, an allegation of sexual misconduct between the pair launched an on-set investigation that suspended filming for nearly two weeks. Ultimately, producers Warner Bros. Television found no misconduct and resumed filming on the Mexico set.\n\nJackson reiterated what he had previously told The Hollywood Reporter, that a third party filed the complaint and he remains confused about why the show shut down if the issue didn\u2019t stem from him or Olympios. The third-party complaint was filed by a producer, who Jackson claims he only knows as Olympios\u2018 best friend. (Olympios\u2018 rep said Jackson should refer his questions to proucers.) Jackson said that producer, along with a second producer who later filed a similar complaint, left set before he did.\n\nABC has not provided any details about the producers, or what motivated them to file their complaints.\n\n\u201cI never once thought that I would be here, today, speaking to you guys amid a crazy scandal,\u201d he said, admitting that the whole situation, coming on the heels of his disastrous Bachelorette stint, made him reevaluate himself and his decisions.\n\nHe then broke down in tears recounting what he and his family then went through, especially his mother.\n\n\u201cYou were being accused of sexual assault,\u201d said Harrison.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s every man\u2019s biggest fear,\u201d he replied.\n\nRecalling a false report that stated he took a \u201climp Corinne\u201d out of the pool and had \u201csex with her,\u201d Jackson said, \u201cI know I\u2019m not that monster they\u2019re trying to portray on TV.\u201d\n\nHe also noted the \u201caggressive\u201d and \u201cintense\u201d slut-shaming Olympios experienced on her end. The pair has yet to speak.\n\nThe sit-down broke the traditional format on the summer spinoff series and resembled the Bachelor and Bachelorette post-show special, After the Final Rose, with franchise alums and castmembers making appearances before a live audience. The studio edition aired during the second half of Tuesday\u2019s episode, following an hour of traditional Paradise drama.\n\nBefore Jackson made his entrance, Harrison spoke to castmembers Raven Gates, Jasmine Goode, Derek Peth, Diggy Moreland and Robby Hayes. All five contestants were part of the original cast who were there for the shutdown.\n\nOnce again, the castmembers relived what happened, how production shut down and the fallout, pointing fingers away from the show and towards the media and public jury.\n\n\u201cIt was disgusting how they were portraying DeMario as someone that committed this \u2018sexual assault crime,'\u201d Gates said of the media coverage. \u201cReading those articles, there was maybe 10 percent of information that we connected with and 90 percent that was just made up,\u201d added Peth.\n\nGoode said the cast witnessed what happened and from what they saw, no one was a victim, referencing Olympios\u2018 statement made during the investigation. \u201cI thought she was into him and I thought he was into her,\u201d she said.\n\nNext week ABC will air Harrison\u2019s one-on-one sit-down with Olympios, who has been less outspoken in sharing her experience.\n\nShortly after the controversy broke, the 25-year-old said, \u201cI am a victim and have spent the last week trying to make sense of what happened on June 4.\u201d ABC reality chief Robert Mills told THR that Olympios will clarify what she meant.\n\n\u201cShe says, \u2018I used the word victim, but let me explain what that meant,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think she felt badly about what DeMario went through as well, so you\u2019ll see both of them discussing that. They had these statements that completely got twisted or misconstrued where it was being asked what they meant. I think they wanted to say in a stronger, more expansive forum, \u2018This is what I meant by that. \u2026 This is my version of what happened that night.\u2019 And just get the story out there so we can put this thing to bed once and for all.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/147277_4915_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/147277_4915_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/147277_4915_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Strause"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/demario-jackson-bachelor-paradise-interview-im-not-monster-1031911/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 Star DeMario Jackson Returns in Tearful TV Interview", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The ABC reality star made his first appearance on the franchise since leaving 'Paradise' in scandal this summer.", "news_keywords": "Bachelor In Paradise", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Jackie Strause", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1031911, "title": "'Bachelor in Paradise' Star DeMario Jackson Returns in Tearful TV Interview", "published_at": "2017-08-22 19:31:34", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/147277_4915_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Bachelor In Paradise", "topics": "TV News", "body": "DeMario Jackson made his awaited TV return on\u00a0Tuesday's Bachelor in Paradise.\r\n\"I'm in a much better place in my life,\" Jackson told host Chris Harrison, comparing his current status to one month prior when he was embroiled in the ABC reality show's controversy. \"June 11 was very difficult for myself, my family, my friends, my mother.\"\r\nJackson, speaking to Harrison during a pre-taped studio special, said he immediately bonded with castmate Corinne\u00a0Olympios over their \"villain\" personas from past stints on the franchise when they landed on the set of Paradise earlier this summer.
