It\u2019s true. Billingsley is also Ming Ming in 2003\u2019s Elf alongside Will Ferrell -- a role he went uncredited for.\n\nAlthough Elf was released 15 years ago, the realization that Billingsley was in both Christmas movies is now sending social media into a tinsel-drive tizzy.\n\nIt's that time of the year again when people find out Ralph from A Christmas Story is also Ming Ming in Elf and it blows their mind. \u2014 Nic (@nictoonie) December 4, 2018\n\nI Was Today Years Old When I Realized Ralphie From 'A Christmas Story' Was In 'Elf' - BuzzFeed\n\n\n\nWait?! \ud83e\udd28... Ralphie is Ming Ming \ud83e\uddd0... and, Ming Ming is Ralphie?!?! \ud83e\udd14...

For so long I have thought MING MING looked so familiar... ( why I have never looked him up before is beyond me.. lol) anyway as I am sitting here watching the movie it dawns on me he looks like Ralph!
