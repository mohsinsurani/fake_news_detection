The very act of getting ready for an award show can be a masochist\u2019s checklist of one\u2019s value: Airbrush your arms so that they look more toned. Check. Get a peel or injection to make sure your face looks flawless. Check. Lose bloat by eating only before 6 p.m. and stop drinking all liquid 24 hours before the big day to send your metabolism into shock. Check. Prepping for award shows can be a weeklong marathon in dread, resulting in a one-time portrayal of improbable beauty.\n\nYou\u2019re also often assigned a look that doesn\u2019t reflect who you truly are but reflects what a runway wants you to be. Platform high heels and frilly dresses and a clutch purse made from the skin of dead baby lizards. I\u2019ve spent the better part of my two decades as an actress accumulating more designer high heels than most could ever dream of, only to hit my 30s and realize I hated wearing most of them and always had. Years ago when I was nominated for a Golden Globe for best actress in a television drama, I had a full anxiety attack after the dress fitting, even though I had found a beautiful dress that fit me nicely. I found myself in my car, the air-conditioning on full blast, sobbing into my steering wheel. The anxiety I was feeling wasn\u2019t about the dress itself. It was about the fulfillment of the obligations of the dress.\n\nNot all actresses loathe getting ready for award shows, though. For some, the act of dressing up is a joy that comes quite naturally. For example, one of my best friends is the actress Blake Lively, who has such extraordinary taste in fashion and clothing. I often find myself texting her to get advice on what to wear to an event where I know there will be cameras present. She is always helpful and thoughtful about what will look best on me, a favor I can\u2019t ever seem to do for myself no matter how hard I try. In recent years, I\u2019ve become far more comfortable in my skin and on red carpets, and I\u2019ve had the good fortune of working with stylists such as Karla Welch and Sarah Slutsky who don\u2019t dress a woman\u2019s body as if it\u2019s a tree hungry for ornaments, but rather an individual, unique body with its own sweet purpose and design.\n\nBut getting dressed does still involve obligations. We actresses are not just modeling clothing when we walk a red carpet on award show night. We are modeling a kind of behavior. We are speaking in a coded language to other women \u2014 even young girls \u2014 that says: The way I look and what I wear and how I wear it is the standard for women. What is being worn is not an exception. It is the rule. You must dress a certain way and look a certain way if you want to be valued as a woman, no matter what you do for a living or who you are. We never intend for this to be the message we are sending with what we wear, but often it is the perceived one, whether we like it or not.\n\nI have often wondered what would happen if actresses stood in solidarity with a singular, powerful choice for just one night. What would that even look like? To uniformly reject our lifelong objectification and say: Enough. We belong to no one. We are a canvas for no expression other than the words our voices have chosen to speak.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/merlin_131903573_3eda0a47-aef2-443c-b3e4-6d5b75fe2fea-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/07tamblynWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f8505ab69bb94d8f8921a2abadab092bd4d5d5f9a49ccba29b8f5ad6ef2b724f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/07/opinion/07tamblynWeb/07tamblynWeb-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=f8505ab69bb94d8f8921a2abadab092bd4d5d5f9a49ccba29b8f5ad6ef2b724f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Tamblyn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/07/opinion/sunday/amber-tamblyn-golden-globes-metoo.html", "title": "Amber Tamblyn: Redefining the Red Carpet - The New York Times", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "At the Golden Globes, my fellow actresses aren\u2019t just wearing black.
