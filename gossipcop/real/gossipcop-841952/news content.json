Sorry, try harder.\n\nBack in FREAKING FEBRUARY, when the Arthur comparisons began online, Chrissy used the Arthur meme to illustrate her husband's reaction to basically being sexy human Arthur.\n\nTwitter\n\nThis bit is heading into its second month; follows are no longer guaranteed. Besides, Chrissy and John have too much going on to worry about which bygone cartoon parody accounts they follow on Twitter.\n\nJust last week, rumors John was robbed circulated all around the damn town. The story blew up after TMZ floated a story of an airport delivery driver stealing John's belongings that was later refuted by the singer himself.\n\nHe tweeted,\n\nThis story is untrue. We use a trusted a car service and they did not rob me. Our Delta greeter made a mistake and left a bag on the cart... The bag was taken because it was left unattended. The airport police caught the person who took it (on video) and retrieved my bag.\n\nUsing a screen grab of Lil Rel Howard's hilarious TSA character from \"Get Out,\" John praised airport security for returning his things.\n\nTwitter\n\nKeep putting out those Twitter fires, John and Chrissy. It's bizarrely become your second calling.\n\nCitations: Chrissy Teigen and Arthur Throw Shade at John Legend's Easter Bunny Outfit (E!)", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/7/f647f3ef-a498-4bd0-8b18-df928069394a-getty-487882572.jpg?w=138&h=138&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5267&fp-y=0.1383", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08121631/chrissy-teigen-troll-john-legend-arthur.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08121631/chrissy-teigen-troll-john-legend-arthur.jpg?w=374&h=187&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15353773&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08094302/John-Legend-Twitter-15.jpg?w=414&h=333&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/9/30/23736b5e-a3db-4337-b6bf-dc6c4e251cf3-getty-1373905726.jpg?w=138&h=138&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5667&fp-y=0.392", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08121633/arthur-chrissy-tweet1.jpg?w=414&h=238&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08113221/jl-tweet-2.jpg?w=414&h=394&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/7/383ca242-cc04-4aa6-86b9-2b8b3513ba31-getty-1422401304.jpg?w=138&h=138&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5133&fp-y=0.456", "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08121632/arthur-chrissy-tweet2.jpg?w=414&h=240&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08121631/chrissy-teigen-troll-john-legend-arthur.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/chrissy-teigen-trolls-john-legend-arthur-easter-pics/1854205", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Trolls John Legend For Dressing Just Like Arthur In Easter Pics", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@elitedaily", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@taylor_ortega"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily"}, "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "url": "https://www.elitedaily.com/entertainment/celebrity/chrissy-teigen-trolls-john-legend-arthur-easter-pics/1854205", "type": "article", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Trolls John Legend For Dressing Just Like Arthur In Easter Pics", "description": "Chrissy Teigen isn't about to let John Legend catch a break just because he's the most loving, supportive, beautiful husband of all time.\nThe couple took daughter Luna to snap a few photos with the Easter Bunny earlier this week, and John's outfit\u2026", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/elite-daily/2017/05/08121631/chrissy-teigen-troll-john-legend-arthur.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "Chrissy Teigen isn't about to let John Legend catch a break just because he's the most loving, supportive, beautiful husband of all time.\nThe couple took daughter Luna to snap a few photos with the Easter Bunny earlier this week, and John's outfit\u2026"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.elitedaily.com", "summary": ""}
