He will also visit Australia, New Zealand, Fiji and Tonga later this year on his first royal tour with Meghan as a married couple. However, Harry also went on a secret trip earlier this year to Botswana, a country special to the pair. The royal decided to go without his new wife, however, as Meghan did not join him on the trip.\n\nThe Duke of Sussex is on a private working trip to Botswana Kensington Palace\n\nA Kensington Palace spokeswoman told ITV: \u201cThe Duke of Sussex is on a private working trip to Botswana, to join the annual general meeting for Rhino Conservation Botswana in his capacity as patron. \u201cHe attended the board meeting in Maun and an RCB community project in Xarakao village.\" The secret trip was not disclosed at the time, although he was thought to have visited in August. It was suggested by royal correspondent Omid Scobie that it was the second time the royal had travelled to the region this year. He may have decided against taking Meghan seeing as it was a business trip as Patron of the Rhino Conservation Botswana, who work to protect black and white rhinos.\n\nPrince Harry: The royal travelled abroad on a secret trip without Meghan Markle\n\nWhile Meghan did not join him on his trip, the pair spent a romantic holiday there before their engagement, when he whisked her to the country on their third date. He said in the BBC interview: \u201cI managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana. We camped out with each other under the stars. \u201cShe came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. \u201cSo then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.\u201d They also visited the country to celebrate Meghan\u2019s 36th birthday last year.\n\nPrince Harry: He headed on a secret trip to Botswana in August (pictured in 2017)\n\nPrince Harry: He has visited a number of times, pictured here in 2017", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/25/750x445/1017533.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/25/750x445/1017533.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kara Godfrey", "Kensington Palace"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1017533/prince-harry-travel-secret-trip-meghan-markle-botswana", "title": "Prince Harry's secret trip to Botswana without Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "PRINCE HARRY is to join his wife in Australia and New Zealand later this year, but he chose to go on a secret trip earlier this year without Meghan Markle.", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 823607694325129, "pages": 129617873765147}, "og": {"title": "Prince Harry's secret trip without Meghan Markle", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/travel/articles/1017533/prince-harry-travel-secret-trip-meghan-markle-botswana", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/25/750x445/1017533.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "lifestyle,automotive,culture,food and beverage,home and garden,theater,travel,autoplay_video,prince harry,prince harry meghan markle,harry and meghan,meghan markle harry,prince harry botswana,harry botswana,prince harry africa,prince harry rhinos,prince harry travel", "section": "Travel News", "description": "PRINCE HARRY is to join his wife in Australia and New Zealand later this year, but he chose to go on a secret trip earlier this year without Meghan Markle."}, "news_keywords": "lifestyle,automotive,culture,food and beverage,home and garden,theater,travel,autoplay_video,prince harry,prince harry meghan markle,harry and meghan,meghan markle harry,prince harry botswana,harry botswana,prince harry africa,prince harry rhinos,prince harry travel", "article": {"tag": "prince harry travel", "published_time": "2018-09-23T06:01:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-14T12:39:40+01:00", "expiration_time": "2018-10-14", "section": "Travel News", "image_count": 3, "video_count": 1, "word_count": 541, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0, "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "author": "Kara Godfrey", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/25/750x445/1017533.jpg", "title": "Prince Harry's secret trip without Meghan Markle", "description": "PRINCE HARRY is to join his wife in Australia and New Zealand later this year, but he chose to go on a secret trip earlier this year without Meghan Markle."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "Prince Harry\u2019s secret trip abroad to his favourite country -
