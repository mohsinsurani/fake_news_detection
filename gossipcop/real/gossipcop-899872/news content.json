Acknowledging the Moodys\u2019 long period of eligibility before finally being nominated, thanks in part to aggressive campaigning on behalf of the band\u2019s fans, Edge \u2014 the oldest living inductee of the evening at 77 \u2014 said, \u201cIt was so long that we were eligible and didn\u2019t make it that I got a real sour grapes [feeling] for everything about it. \u2026 When it actually became something for us all to appreciate and have, I did realize that it means the world to me.\u201d\n\nExplore Explore Bon Jovi See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news\n\nThe Moodys \u2014 along with fellow inductees Bon Jovi, The Cars and Dire Straits (and the late Nina Simone and Sister Rosetta Tharpe) \u2014 have long been on lists of acts snubbed for Rock Hall induction. Saturday\u2019s more than four-and-a-half-hour ceremony set things right with a prevailing atmosphere of sincere appreciation \u2014 including from fans who sat in pouring rain to watch red-carpet arrivals and in the Public Auditorium\u2019s upper level \u2014 with only a few barbs about the long waits for induction.\n\nThe ceremony, which was filmed by HBO for a May 5 premiere, differed from other years in that Rock Hall co-founder Jann Wenner did not address the gathering and there was no finale that brought inductees and presenters together.\n\nThe crowd at Cleveland, Ohio\u2019s Public Auditorium did not have to wait long for what was the clear main attraction of the night. Following The Killers\u2018 tribute to the late Tom Petty with \u201cAmerican Girl\u201d (and a bit of \u201cFree Falling\u201d), Bon Jovi\u2019s hour-plus presentation was presided over by Howard Stern, who gave the band an epic, envelope-pushing-but-loving tribute that took Rolling Stone magazine and Rock Hall co-founder Jann Wenner to task (\u201cJann required years of pondering to decide if this glorious band that sold over 130 million albums should be inducted. What a tough decision.\u201d) and essayed on everything from Jon Bon Jovi\u2019s use of hairspray to guitarist Richie Sambora\u2019s penis size, as well as the fact that Bon Jovi\u2019s sales eclipsed the death tolls from the bubonic plague, the American Civil War and atomic bomb drops.\n\nHe also led the crowd in singing a chorus of \u201cWanted Dead or Alive,\u201d chided Bon Jovi\u2019s desire to own a National Football League franchise (New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and the Dallas Cowboys\u2019 Jerry Jones were band guests on Saturday) and told the frontman that \u201cI\u2019m glad you don\u2019t have to sit at home anymore throwing darts at pictures of Jann Wenner.\u201d\n\nBon Jovi was equally expansive and earnest in his acceptance speech. Following remarks by each of the band members (\u201cIf I wrote a book, it would be [called] The Best Time I Ever Had,\u201d said Sambora, returning to the ranks after leaving for good in 2013), Bon Jovi delivered a nearly 20-minute aural career history, thanking bandmates, management, record company executives, friends and family. \u201cI\u2019ve been writing this speech many days, in many ways \u2014 some days, it\u2019s the thank you speech, some days the f\u2014 you speech,\u201d he noted, acknowledging the group\u2019s long and controversial exclusion from the Rock Hall. But he kept things mostly positive and sentimental. \u201cIt\u2019s about time \u2014 that has been the theme of my weekend,\u201d Bon Jovi said, looking at his bandmates. \u201cI thank my lucky stars for the time I got to spend with each of you. Tonight the band that agreed to do me a favor stands before you so I can make this reality a dream.\u201d\n\nWith Sambora and original bassist Alec John Such reuniting with the group, Bon Jovi finished with a crowd-pleasing set that included \u201cYou Give Love a Bad Name,\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s My Life,\u201d \u201cWhen We Were Us\u201d from last year\u2019s This House Is Not for Sale album and \u201cLivin\u2019 on a Prayer.\u201d\n\nWithout a designated presenter, Dire Straits bassist and co-founder John Illsley took it upon himself to do the honors and subsequently make an acceptance speech. He quickly addressed the elephant in the room \u2014 frontman Mark Knopfler\u2018s decision not to attend \u2014 cracking that \u201cI can assure you, it\u2019s just a personal thing,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s for personal reasons, let\u2019s just leave it at that. You\u2019ve got to realize this is really more about a group of people more than one person. It\u2019s a collective, a brotherhood, and that\u2019s something that needs acknowledging tonight \u2026 the many musicians who have worked with Dire Straits over the years and made the band\u2019s success possible and led us all the way to Cleveland tonight.\n\nSoft-spoken keyboardist Guy Fletcher noted, \u201cI never thought of Dire Straits as a particularly cool band. \u2026 We weren\u2019t really there to be cool.\u201d He also told the group\u2019s fans to \u201cconsider this award yours, but if you don\u2019t mind, I\u2019ll look after it.\u201d\n\nThe Cars, inducted after two previous times on the ballot and ushered in by Killers frontman Brandon Flowers (\u201cThe Cars were the first band I truly fell in love with, and you never forget your first\u201d), spent much of their time paying homage to late bassist/singer Benjamin Orr, a native of Cleveland, much to the delight of the partisan Public Hall crowd. \u201cWhen the band first started, Ben was supposed to be the lead singer and I was supposed to be the good-looking guy in the band \u2014 but after a couple of gigs, I kinda got demoted to the songwriter,\u201d Ric Ocasek, sporting a glittery silver tuxedo jacket, said. \u201cBut obviously it\u2019s hard not to notice that Benjamin Orr is not here. He would\u2019ve been elated to be here on this stage. It still feels strange to be up here without him.\u201d\n\nThe group\u2019s set, with Weezer\u2018s Scott Shriner on bass and bushy-bearded drummer David Robinson looking sagely behind his kit, included \u201cMy Best Friend\u2019s Girl,\u201d \u201cYou Might Think,\u201d \u201cMoving in Stereo\u201d \u2014 which Flowers called \u201cthe best song in any movie scene that pictured a girl getting out of a pool taking her top off\u201d (Fast Times at Ridgemont High) \u2014 and \u201cJust What I Needed.\u201d\n\nBoth Nina Simone\u2019s younger brother Dr. Samuel Waymon and inductor Mary J. Blige made unapologetically long speeches, with the former thanking Jon Bon Jovi for giving him license to \u201ctake as much time as necessary to say what I need to say\u201d about the iconoclastic, genre-blending singer who was the surprise inclusion in this year\u2019s class. While Blige noted that Simone \u201ccould sing anything,\u201d Waymon \u2014 who managed her for many years \u2014 said that \u201cit is the oddest thing for you to induct her because [Simone] is a non-conformist, a non-traditionalist.\u201d He warned artists that \u201cif you\u2019re sampling her, you better pay for it\u201d and added that \u201cshe\u2019s sitting next to you. She\u2019s soaring over us tonight.\u201d Andra Day and The Roots followed with renditions of \u201cI Wish I Knew How It Would Feel to Be Free\u201d and a spectacular \u201cI Put a Spell on You,\u201d while Lauryn Hill came on for a long, showstopping set of \u201cBlack Is the Color of My True Love\u2019s Hair, \u201d \u201cAin\u2019t Got No, I Got Life\u201d and \u201cFeeling Good,\u201d accompanied by video footage of Simone herself.\n\nAlabama Shakes\u2018 Brittany Murphy made brief remarks inducting Sister Rosetta Tharpe as this year\u2019s Early Influence, calling her \u201cthe godmother of rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u201d before delivering a sharp rendition of \u201cThat\u2019s All.\u201d\n\nIn addition to the traditional In Memoriam segment, the ceremony featured two specific tributes. The Killers opened the night playing the late Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d slipping a bit of \u201cFree Fallin\u2019\u201d into the final verse, while Heart\u2019s Ann Wilson and Alice in Chains guitarist Jerry Cantrell performed an emotive duo version of Soundgarden\u2019s \u201cBlack Hole Sun\u201d to honor Chris Cornell.\n\nThe Moody Blues closed the evening after a salute from inductor Ann Wilson, who reminded the room that in addition to the group\u2019s heady musicianship and ethereal, philosophical lyricism, \u201cThe Moody Blues are and always have been a kick-ass rock \u2018n\u2019 roll band.\u201d Denny Laine, who co-founded the Moodys as a blues group but left after one album, saluted those who came after him, saying, \u201cI\u2019m really pleased to say these guys\u2026went on to other things, and I\u2019m a big fan. There ya go. The Moody Blues, I love you.\u201d\n\nLittle mention was made of co-founder Ray Thomas, who died Jan. 4, but Justin Hayward and John Lodge both thanked American radio disc jockeys who championed the band, while Lodge acknowledged the fans who campaigned so hard for the group, saying, \u201cThis is your Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.\u201d Hayward explained that \u201cfor us and all the British musicians, this is the home of our heroes. To be celebrated even in the same street, in the same building, even in the same town as Buddy Holly and the Everly Brothers, with the woman who showed us how it all should be done, Nina Simone\u2026it\u2019s a privilege. It means a lot to me.\u201d\n\nThe Moodys then picked up their instruments for a set that included \u201cI\u2019m Just a Singer (In a Rock and Roll Band),\u201d a galvanizing \u201cNights in White Satin\u201d and \u201cRide My See Saw.\u201d\n\nSaturday\u2019s ceremony also introduced a new category: The Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Singles honored six songs that Little Steven Van Zandt said \u201cshaped rock \u2018n\u2019 roll\u201d by \u201cartists in the Rock Hall \u2026 at the moment.\u201d The first inductees in the category included \u201cRocket 88\u201d by Jackie Breston and his Delta Cats (1951), Link Wray and his Ray Men\u2019s \u201cRumble\u201d (1958), \u201cLouie Louie\u201d by The Kingsmen (1963), Procol Harum\u2019s \u201cA Whiter Shade of Pale\u201d (1967) and Steppenwolf\u2019s \u201cBorn to Be Wild\u201d (1968).\n\nRock Hall President and CEO Greg Harris opened the evening pronouncing that \u201cin a world that is filled with division, rock connects us.\u201d He also celebrated \u201ca time of unprecedented growth\u201d for the museum and announced a $10 million donation from the Key Bank Foundation \u2014 the largest-ever single philanthropic contribution \u2014 which will be detailed later this spring.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/bon-jovi-richie-sambora-rock-hall-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/bon-jovi-richie-sambora-rock-hall-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=942&h=623&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/bon-jovi-richie-sambora-rock-hall-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gary Graff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/rock/rock-and-roll-hall-of-fame-induction-ceremony-recap-bon-jovi-8333553/", "title": "Reunited Bon Jovi Take Center Stage at 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The crowd at Cleveland, Ohio's Public Auditorium did not have to wait long for what was the clear main attraction of Saturday night's (April 14) 33rd annual Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony: Bon Jovi's hour-plus presentation.", "news_keywords": "bbnews", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "billboard", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 8333553, "author": "Gary Graff", "pmc-category": "Music,Rock", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-04-14T22:45:37"}, "pmc-tag": "bbnews", "title": "Reunited Bon Jovi Take Center Stage at 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-always-paywall": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-exclusive": "no", "pmc-breaking-news": "no", "pmc-prime": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Gary Graff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Billboard", "application-name": "Billboard", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 8333553, "title": "Reunited Bon Jovi Take Center Stage at 2018 Rock and Roll Hall of Fame Induction Ceremony", "published_at": "2018-04-14 22:45:37", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/bon-jovi-richie-sambora-rock-hall-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "bbnews", "topics": "Rock", "body": "The Moody Blues\u2019 Graeme Edge expressed the thoughts of many of the members of the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame\u2019s class of 2018 during the 33rd annual induction ceremony on Saturday night (April 14) in Cleveland\u2019s Public Auditorium.
