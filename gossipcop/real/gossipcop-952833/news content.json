Thanks to its millions of devoted viewers and the irrepressible Tim Allen, we haven\u2019t seen the last of Last Man Standing.\u201d\n\n20th TV, attempted to find the series a new home after ABC\u2019s cancellation of the show last year. Viacom-owned niche country-music-themed cable network CMT airs reruns of the show in syndication.) Fox\u2019s move to revive Last Man Standing comes after Allen and the network\u2019s studio counterpart,TV, attempted to find the series a new home after ABC\u2019s cancellation of the show last year. Viacom-owned niche country-music-themed cable network CMT was in talks to bring the show back for a seventh season for either a short-order or multiple-season/20-episode revival. But those negotiations ultimately broke down , given the sizable price tag that came with the series. (airs reruns of the show in syndication.)\n\nSpeaking with The Hollywood Reporter after last year\u2019s upfronts, 20th TV\u2019s Howard Kurtzman singled out Last Man Standing as the most disappointing and surprising pass. \u201cIf there\u2019s a way to bring it back, we will explore those opportunities,\u201d he said.\n\nAt the time of Last Man\u2018s cancellation, ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey stressed that the show\u2019s ownership structure \u2014 the network had to pay a sizable licensing fee to 20th TV \u2014 was behind her decision to drop it. Also playing a role in its cancellation was the fact that Allen\u2019s contract was up after season six, and a new deal would have increased the cost of the aging series at a time when ABC was poised to shoulder a larger share of the price tag on the show. Dungey emphasized that the cancellation had nothing to do with Allen\u2019s political affiliation after the actor compared being a conservative in Hollywood to \u201d \u201830s Germany.\u201d The actor has since voiced his support for President Donald Trump (and attended his inauguration).\n\nThe renewal, at least for now, gives Fox ownership of the comedy, though that could change if regulators approve Disney\u2019s $52.4 billion deal to buy Fox assets \u2014 including 20th TV. That would mean Disney would find itself in the opposite situation of where it was last year: owning the show on an outside network, with Fox having to pay the Mouse House a licensing fee.\n\nWhen Last Man Standing was canceled last May, it ranked as ABC\u2019s second-most-watched comedy (behind only Modern Family). Since then, the TV landscape has changed following the blockbuster ratings success ABC found with its Roseanne revival. Roseanne\u2018s ratings have illustrated the larger value of programming shows for middle America. Starring Roseanne Barr, who has been vocal about her support for the current president, the Roseanne revival has made the debate over Trump part of its storyline, as it looks to explore issues facing working-class America and open a larger dialogue. Dungey, for her part, has been vocal about ABC\u2019s need to program to audiences that go beyond affluent white viewers via series including Roseanne. (Fox also recently picked up a pilot about a family set in middle America that is in contention for midseason.)\n\nAsked following the Roseanne revival\u2019s spectacular ratings if she had plans to revive Last Man Standing \u2014 which could have been paired with Roseanne for a multicamera comedy block with conservative stars \u2014 Dungey said the network \u201chad talked\u201d about it, but there were no immediate plans to bring it back.\n\nRoseanne was ABC\u2019s lone multicamera comedy during the 2017-18 season, as the network made a decision to take a step back from the format. Multicamera comedies are less expensive to produce \u2014 a boon in an era of dwindling viewership and ad dollars \u2014 and faster to produce. Roseanne and The Big Bang Theory are the two most watched comedies on broadcast TV this season \u2014 and both are multicams. Following a pilot season where the genre heated back up again, multicamera orders have already topped last year, when only four were picked up.\n\nFor his part, Allen \u2014 who played conservative Mike Baxter, the father of three girls, on the family comedy \u2014 has remained vocal about his disappointment over ABC\u2019s cancellation of his show. \u201cI always wanted Last Man Standing to be like [All in the Family\u2018s] Archie Bunker,\u201d Allen said in September. \u201cArchie Bunker pushed boundaries, but Carroll O\u2019Connor was not that guy at all. I am a version of that guy. But there is nothing more dangerous, especially in this climate, than a funny, likable conservative character. He is mitigated on the show by a family of women who had a difference of opinions, but [Mike Baxter] was a likable guy and a principled guy about work and ethics and all this stuff.\u201d\n\nThe actor, who previously spent eight seasons starring as Tim \u201cThe Tool Man\u201d Taylor on ABC\u2019s Home Improvement, also took the broadcaster to task, noting that the network \u201ccould not have handled [the cancellation] worse,\u201d He added, \u201cSecond biggest show, [ABC] hadn\u2019t won a Friday night in 15 years. They put us out to pasture on Friday and we won Friday. Big night for us. Big night for them. I would have put Roseanne after us. Use us just to launch shows, if nothing else.\u201d\n\nKeep track of all the renewals, cancellations and new show orders with THR\u2018s scorecards for ABC, CBS, Fox, NBC and The CW and of all the latest pilot pickups and passes with our handy guide.
