The show features a group of strangers who participate in a social experiment and are paired together by experts.[1] Legal restrictions in Australia mean that the couples do not partake in a legally-binding marriage as prohibited by the Marriage Act 1961. Rather, contestants engage in an unofficial commitment ceremony.[2] The series first premiered on the 18 May 2015 on the Nine Network.[3] The show has had nine seasons between 2015 and 2022,[4] plus a two-part reunion special which was broadcast before the 2021 season.[5]\n\nPremise [ edit ]\n\nCouples meet for the first time at the altar, before spending their wedding night in a hotel and then embarking on a honeymoon. Upon return, they live together for a period of time and each week decide whether they will continue their relationship at a commitment ceremony where they can choose to either stay or leave.

also criticised the show, such as second season participant Simone Lee Brennan described the program as \"never [being] portrayed to its full authenticity,\" suggesting the man she had been paired with, Xavier Forsberg, had been recruited by producers and was seeking a sports-presenting role rather than a relationship.[98]\n\nAt the show's commitment ceremonies, each person writes \"leave\" or \"stay\", and participants can only leave the \"marriage\" if both they and their \"spouse\" write \"leave\". This has been criticised as sending \"the worst possible message\" to people who may be in a toxic relationship.[99]\n\nSome of the contestants of the show have also spoken out against the program claiming it to be fake, including Dean Wells from Season 5[100] Other former contestants have been abused in the street, received death threats online, attempted suicide, or been taken to a psychiatric hospital.[101]\n\nInternational [ edit ]\n\nBroadcasters [ edit ]\n\nIn The Netherlands the show is called \"Married at First Sight\" and is broadcast at primetime on RTL 4.\n\nIn Belgium the show is broadcast as Blind getrouwd - Australi\u00eb and runs every weekday on the Flemish channel VTM2.\n\nIn Spain, the show is broadcast as Casados a ciegas and runs every weekday from 6:15 pm for three hours each day on TEN.[102]\n\nIn the United Kingdom, in 2020, E4 aired the fourth series (2017), following this the fifth series (2018) was aired and then in early 2021, the sixth series (2019) was broadcast on the channel.
