Nina Dobrev opened up about her decision to leave The Vampire Diaries after six seasons in a new interview.\n\n\u201cThat was the plan from the get-go,\u201d the CW star, 28, told Harper\u2019s Bazaar in an article published on Thursday, August 17, of her decision to leave the hit show after her contract ended in 2015. \u201cIf anything, the fact that [leaving] terrified me drove me even more. I needed to feel that fear of, \u2018Oh my God, what if I never get a job again?\u2019 That just made me want to work five times as hard to make sure that didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nDobrev portrayed several different characters on the vampire series \u2014 including the lead, Elena Gilbert \u2014 and since leaving, she\u2019s starred in xXx: Return of Xander Cage and the forthcoming films, Crash Pad and Departures. However, the Degrassi alum explained that her roles have been sparse because \u201cthe things I want to do aren\u2019t necessarily the things that are expected of me.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI don\u2019t want to play a teenager anymore. I want to play adult roles and be challenged and work with great filmmakers and tell incredible stories and that has meant being really picky.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Dobrev accounted her exit in an emotional Instagram post. In May 2015, she told Self magazine that while filming the show had \u201cbeen such a crazy, awesome adventure,\u201d she knew that leaving \u201cis a new exciting step in the right direction.\u201d\n\nDobrev would later reunite with her former cast in the season 8 finale, which aired in March. \u201cIt was easy to get back into character for the finale. I played Elena for six years, so I jumped right back into it,\u201d Dobrev told Entertainment Weekly at the time. \u201cThere\u2019s lot of Elena in me, so it was easy to join the family back up and pick up where we left off.\u201d In the series\u2019 final episode, Elena awakes from a magically-induced coma and reunites with her longtime love, Damon Salvatore, played by Ian Somerhalder. (Dobrev and Somerhalder, 38, dated from 2011 to 2013).\n\n\u201cThis goodbye feels different than it did when I left the first time because I was leaving and the show continued and now the show\u2019s ending for everyone. It feels more final. It\u2019s more almost like closure. Everyone\u2019s been very nostalgic; it\u2019s a bittersweet ending,\u201d she continued to EW. \u201cI\u2019m very happy that we were able to make it work out and that I came back because I really missed the whole family and wanted to be part of the final goodbye. It really has felt like the closure that I needed \u2014 that hopefully everybody needs \u2014 and I think it ends in such a beautiful way that everyone will be happy.\u201d\n\nDobrev landed the role in 2009 at the age of 20 and also starred alongside Paul Wesley (Stefan Salvatore), Candice Accola (Caroline Forbes), Kat Graham (Bonnie Bennett) and Zach Roerig (Matt Donovan). The series launched many of their careers.\n\n\u201cSo much has changed for all of us. When I look back at everybody and see how everyone\u2019s changed in such a positive way and grown into such beautiful adults, it\u2019s great and it\u2019s also kind of sad,\u201d the Flatliners actress reflected. \u201cI\u2019m going to miss everybody, but hopefully, one everybody moves back to L.A., we\u2019ll continue to hang out.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.\n\nHear the Us Weekly editors break down the most surprising celebrity births during the pandemic in under 2 minutes!\n\n", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nina-dobrev-harpers-3-5db519ac-b775-4368-86c8-93b404e88eb6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nina-dobrev-harpers-3-5db519ac-b775-4368-86c8-93b404e88eb6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/nina-dobrev-explains-why-she-exited-the-vampire-diaries-w498330/", "title": "Nina Dobrev Explains Why She Exited \u2018The Vampire Diaries\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Nina Dobrev opened up about her decision to leave \u2018The Vampire Diaries\u2019 after her six-year contract expired \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nina Dobrev: This Is Why I Left \u2018The Vampire Diaries'", "description": "Nina Dobrev opened up about her decision to leave \u2018The Vampire Diaries\u2019 after her six-year contract expired \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/nina-dobrev-explains-why-she-exited-the-vampire-diaries-w498330/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-03-31T18:58:31+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nina-dobrev-harpers-3-5db519ac-b775-4368-86c8-93b404e88eb6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nina-dobrev-harpers-3-5db519ac-b775-4368-86c8-93b404e88eb6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-08-17T18:22:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-03-31T18:58:31+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nina Dobrev: This Is Why I Left \u2018The Vampire Diaries'", "description": "Nina Dobrev opened up about her decision to leave \u2018The Vampire Diaries\u2019 after her six-year contract expired \u2014 find out more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/nina-dobrev-harpers-3-5db519ac-b775-4368-86c8-93b404e88eb6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1489px%2C782px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502994120.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
