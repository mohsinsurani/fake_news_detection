We\u2019re mature now. We\u2019re grown-ups, and we\u2019re going to take our time and we\u2019re going to do things at our own pace.\u201d\n\nThe 48-year-old continued, \u201cOur life right now is incredibly wonderful. Between our kids and our work, we\u2019re truly blessed. We don\u2019t need anything more right now.\u201d\n\nLopez has been married three times \u2014 to waiter Ojani Noa (1997 to 1998), dancer Cris Judd (2001 to 2002) and Marc Anthony (2004 to 2014), with whom she shares 10-year-old twins Emme and Max. In 2002, the singer was also engaged to Ben Affleck. Meanwhile, Rodriguez shares daughters Ella, 10, and Natasha, 13, with ex-wife Cynthia Scurtis.\n\nAs for \u201cEl Anillo\u201d? It was \u201cwritten about the two of us, but it\u2019s like, not about the two of us,\u201d Lopez explained.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m like, \u2018Hey \u2026. Where\u2019s my ring?'\u201d she said. \u201cNo, it\u2019s not like that.\u201d\n\nThe Shades of Blue star added, \u201cI feel like they wrote it because \u2026 they want that to happen.\u201d\n\nMark Sagliocco/Getty\n\nDuring a recent sit-down on Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Lopez revealed what it would take to break up with the former baseball star.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so competitive [in] every way. I don\u2019t know, it\u2019s just something inside me, I\u2019m competitive,\u201d she explained. \u201cWhen we work out I think, \u2018I can beat you.\u2019 I\u2019m not laughing.\u201d\n\nHowever, Lopez said that her 42-year-old beau \u201cdoesn\u2019t even entertain my delusions\u201d \u2014 and that\u2019s probably for the best.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no winning that because if he beats me, it\u2019s over!\u201d she joked.\n\nInstead of battling, the couple are extremely supportive of each other. Lopez shared that Rodriguez attends her shows in Las Vegas and she\u2019ll go to baseball games that he\u2019s commentating on, even wearing an earpiece so she can listen to him.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Did Jennifer Lopez Ask Alex Rodriguez for an Engagement Ring in New Single \u2018El Anillo\u2019?\n\nDespite her toned body and flawless skin, Lopez insists that she is indeed aging just \u201clike every mom out there\u201d \u2014 but told Good Morning America that she\u2019s sharing some of her beauty secrets in a \u201csecret package thing\u201d coming out in the next year.\n\n\u201cYou have to juggle the kids and the working and the taking care of yourself,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not an easy thing.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cWomen are multi-taskers and we can do anything if we put our minds to it. I truly believe that.\u201d", "images":
