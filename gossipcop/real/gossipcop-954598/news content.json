Yesterday, The Big Bang Theory actress responded to criticism on Instagram after a commenter decided she wasn\u2019t wearing a supportive enough bra.\n\nJust five days after her wedding to equestrian Karl Cook, the actress underwent a pre-planned shoulder surgery. But after two weeks of recovery, Cuoco revealed she couldn\u2019t sit still any longer and posted videos from a gym workout to Instagram. However it seems her doctor wasn\u2019t too pleased about her removing her brace during her workouts, prompting Cuoco to post another series of videos, this time with the brace.\n\n\"When your doc scolds you for not wearing your brace. Alrighty then guess we\u2019re doin it this way!\" she wrote.\n\nAnd while Cuoco is crushing it, a handful of commenters felt the need to tell her she needed a \u201cbetter\u201d bra. One person wrote, \u201cBut you could wear a bra!\u201d\n\nTo which Cuoco responded, \"don't be jealous [...] It's not flattering.\"\n\nYES.\n\nShe then added that while she shouldn\u2019t have to explain her bra choices to anyone, her injury is restricting the bras she can currently wear. She wrote, \u201cFYI because of my shoulder, I can only get certain bras over my head NOT THAT ITS ANYONES BUSINESS.\u201d\n\nWhile it\u2019s ridiculous that Cuoco should even have to defend herself for, um, having nipples, we\u2019re unfortunately not surprised. Body shaming is still an all-too-common occurrence for women in our culture \u2014 especially women who \u201cdare\u201d to live in the public eye.\n\nLuckily a number of other fans stepped in to defend the actress, writing that it\u2019s really nobody\u2019s business what Cuoco decides to wear or not wear to the gym. Others pointed out that the padding in sports bras doesn\u2019t always prevent nipples from showing \u2014 something every women who has ever worn a sports bra knows to be true.\n\nWe\u2019re glad to see Cuoco living her best life as she recovers from surgery \u2014 wearing whatever she wants.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/07/25/Kaley-Cuoco2-e1532535982609.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/07/25/Kaley-Cuoco2-e1532535982609.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/07/25/Kaley-Cuoco2-e1532535982609.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/kaley-cuoco-clapped-back-gym-critics-bra/", "title": "Kaley Cuoco Claps Back To Critics Of Her Gym Look", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kaley Cuoco responded to negative comments on Instagram after users noted they could see her nipples through her sports bra.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kaley Cuoco Claps Back To Critics Of Her Gym Look", "description": "Kaley Cuoco responded to negative comments on Instagram after users noted they could see her nipples through her sports bra.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/kaley-cuoco-clapped-back-gym-critics-bra/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/07/25/Kaley-Cuoco2-e1532535982609.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1000, "height": 700, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-25T13:34:21+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T02:10:21+00:00"}, "author": "meaghankirby", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "meaghankirby", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532525661.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
