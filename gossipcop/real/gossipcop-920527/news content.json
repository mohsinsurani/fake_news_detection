But right up there with the rest of \u2018em is the ongoing saga involving . . . Prince George\u2019s obsession with the police.\n\nYou\u2019ll remember that back in December, Prince William handed a handwritten list to a Finnish Santa Claus on behalf of his 4-year-old son, in which George listed just one item he wanted for Christmas: a police car. And then on Tuesday, William and Harry attended a reception at Kensington Palace honoring those who work in Scotland Yard, and William confirmed that\u2014rest assured\u2014months later, George is still just as infatuated.\n\nPolice commissioner Jayne Richardson told William that there are more officers needed in the district, joking, \u201cWe are recruiting, actually, so if George and Charlotte are keen?\u201d\n\nWilliam responded, \u201c[George] is obsessed, actually, by the police . . . cars, toys, everything.\u201d\n\nWhere is this George and the police story line going to take us? Will we ever get to see a Halloween portrait of George dressed as a small policeman? Will Markle, in an effort to ingratiate herself to her soon-to-be nephew, let him wear some sort of police badge for his duties in her wedding? What does Princess Charlotte make of all of this? Is she obsessed with police cars? We will all, as ever, have to stay tuned.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa826e5afb7596b1f19ffee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/prince-george-police-obsession.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/josh-duboff-square.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6196c41c1bbf90e6dd958483/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a330265577ffb294a2532bb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-rip-third-wheel-ss02.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a330265f23f9530d4dbae5c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-rip-third-wheel-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a94386c1d14714f6de4401c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/Prince-Harry.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61bb68208185dc60dfd416d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62b3340bfa5c67611b2c46ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa826e5afb7596b1f19ffee/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/prince-george-police-obsession.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a330265577ffb294a2532bc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-rip-third-wheel-ss01.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa826e5afb7596b1f19ffee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/prince-george-police-obsession.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Josh Duboff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/prince-george-police-obsession-william", "title": "Prince George\u2019s Obsession with the Police Is Only Getting Stronger", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "William explains the 4-year-old\u2019s fascination.", "id": "5aa824e1af40c861bd502fd4", "keywords": "prince george", "news_keywords": "prince george", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5aa824e1af40c861bd502fd4", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"William explains the 4-year-old\u2019s fascination.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa826e5afb7596b1f19ffee/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/prince-george-police-obsession.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa826e5afb7596b1f19ffee/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/prince-george-police-obsession.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "William explains the 4-year-old\u2019s fascination.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa826e5afb7596b1f19ffee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/prince-george-police-obsession.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Prince George\u2019s Obsession with the Police Is Only Getting Stronger", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/prince-george-police-obsession-william"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-13T19:33:36.589Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-13T19:33:36.589Z", "author": "Josh Duboff"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "William explains the 4-year-old\u2019s fascination.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5aa826e5afb7596b1f19ffee/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/prince-george-police-obsession.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Prince George\u2019s Obsession with the Police Is Only Getting Stronger"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520969616.589, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
