On Andy Cohen\u2019s 50th birthday, his best pal John Mayer made sure to post his best wishes before the party tonight!\n\nThe rocker posted a pic of the two in an elevator, captioning it: \u2018Happy 50th Birthday @bravoandy! It\u2019s been about 30 minutes since I started writing this caption. Congratulations, I have no words. You have done it. Can\u2019t find \u2018em right now. They are all scattered in a flurry of love and memories OH HERE THEY COME.\u2019\n\nMayer went on: \u2018In conclusion, I love you, and you are such a special person that I am sure you are known throughout the universe. See you tonight.\u2019 Aw\u2026such cute bromance!\n\nTomorrow, Andy is set to celebrate his big 50 on an episode of his talk show Watch What Happens Live and John is definitely going to be there as well.\n\nWe have to say that we are impressed the two stars manage to keep in touch while being so busy with their own careers.\n\nWhether they\u2019re heading to a foreign country or traveling to Montana, they make sure to contact one another and have a chat.\n\nWhen their packed schedules allow them, they prioritize meeting face to face as well!\n\nFans probably know that they often comment on the outfits of the other, make fun of the other\u2019s job and even steal each other\u2019s phones just for fun!\n\nOnce when Andy Cohen shared a screencap of Kim Zolciak and NeNe Leakes fighting during two separate RHOA shootings, John hilariously commented: \u2018You never introduce me to your work friends.\u2019\n\n\u2018You never ASK!\u2019 Cohen replied.\n\nConsidering how close they are there is no surprise that people have been speculating that they really like each other.\n\nAccording to them, however, that is not the case at all.\n\nWhile on Howard Stern\u2019s Sirius XM show, Cohen explained: \u2018I have love for him, but I am not in love with him. John Mayer is great looking. I don\u2019t like to make a move on a straight guy.\u2019\n\nHe went on to explain that Mayer would often act as his wingman at gay bars.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018He was an additive for me to go out with. He is big and tall and handsome.\u2019", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Wendy-Williams-Believes-That-Scott-Disick-Will-Talk-His-Way-Back-Into-Sofias-Pants-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/andy-cohen-john-mayer.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Hugh-Jackman-ScreenRant.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/bill-clinton-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Porsha-Williams-Needed-A-Bailegh-Day-Check-Her-Out-Rocking-Her-Sweet-Niece-Using-Her-Signature-Moves-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/brody-jenner-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/NickMarkus-1-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Julianna-Margulies-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Tamar-Purple-Hair-Logan-Birthday-300x244.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Nicki-Minaj-Is-Accused-Of-Cultural-Appropriation-\u2018Chun-Li\u2019-Snapchat-Filter-Adds-Chopsticks-700x466.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Toni-Braxton-Has-A-Tour-Announcement-Coming-Soon-Fans-Are-Gushing-Over-Her-Short-Hair-Watch-The-Vid-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/serena_williams-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Kandi-Burruss-Todd-Tucker-Dubai-300x204.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/the-suite-life-of-zack-and-cody-300x210.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/andy-cohen-john-mayer.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Markus", "Nicole M", "Doris Williams"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180604194537/http://celebrityinsider.org/john-mayer-wishes-his-bff-andy-cohen-a-happy-50th-birthday-in-the-sweetest-way-ever-153710/", "title": "John Mayer Wishes His BFF Andy Cohen A Happy 50th Birthday In The Sweetest Way Ever!", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Nick Markus", "news_keywords": "andy cohen, instagram, john mayer,", "keywords": "celebrity news, andy cohen, instagram, john mayer,", "description": "Their friendship may be unlikely, but that\u2019s what makes it the best!
