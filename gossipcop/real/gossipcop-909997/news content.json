Sometimes people get left out that shouldn\u2019t, but on the other hand, we did the best we can to make sure that it\u2019s a representative and balanced show.\u201d\n\nEarlier, Lorde reportedly declined an offer to perform as part of a of a group tribute to Tom Petty involving his song \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d though she did take the stage Friday night to cover Fleetwood Mac\u2019s \u201cSilver Springs\u201d at the pre-Grammys MusiCares Person of the Year.]\n\nBut while Lorde didn\u2019t take the stage to share her message during the Grammys broadcast, the singer-songwriter still managed to make her voice heard once inside Madison Square Garden (she noticeably skipped the red carpet), affixing a poem by conceptual artist Jenny Holzer to the back of her fluffy tulle Valentino gown.\n\n\u201cMy version of a white rose \u2014 THE APOCALYPSE WILL BLOSSOM \u2014 an excerpt from the greatest of all time, jenny holzer,\u201d wrote Lorde on Instagram, referencing the white roses worn by a handful of men and women on the carpet to show solidarity with the Time\u2019s Up movement. \u201cThe old & correct must be laid to waste,\u201d reads the excerpt. \u201cBefore the just can triumph.

Once inside the venue, she pulled a Rihanna, reaching for a flask that just happened to perfectly match the vibrant red hue of her gown. Because sometimes a little booze is needed to take the edge off the patriarchy.\n\nLorde\u2019s mother, the NZ poet Sonja Yelich, shared her thoughts on her daughter\u2019s apparent snub with a Twitter post, highlighting a New York Times article which addressed gender inequality among Grammy winners.\n\nthis says it all \u2013@nytimes January 26, 2018 pic.twitter.com/R3YdHwieXf \u2014 Sonja Yelich (@sonjayelich1) January 26, 2018\n\nOf her nomination, Lorde told Billboard this month, \u201cIt\u2019s crazy I\u2019m the only woman in my category, and I feel very proud of that.
