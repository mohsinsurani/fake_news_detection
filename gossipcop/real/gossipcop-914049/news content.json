A spokesperson for \u201cThe Wendy Williams Show\u201d told Page Six on Wednesday morning that she was \u201cexperiencing flu-like symptoms,\u201d and had decided to take the rest of the week off. Reruns are airing in place of live shows.\n\n\u201cI feel awful, I had to be talked out of going into work today, and taking off a few days to get myself together,\u201d said Williams, calling herself a \u201cthoroughbred\u201d and referring to her days on the radio when she refused to take a sick day.\n\n\u201cI took the proper vacation time, but take off sick? What? No, never.\u201d\n\nAn outpouring of support flooded in the comments of Williams\u2019 video, while some fans were concerned for her health.\n\nIn October 2017, she suddenly collapsed on live TV. After a brief commercial break, she returned and said it \u201cwas not a stunt. I\u2019m overheated in my costume and I did pass out. But you know what? I\u2019m a champ and I\u2019m back.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/gettyimages-840676146.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/gettyimages-840676146.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["February"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/02/14/wendy-williams-shares-health-update-after-canceling-shows/", "title": "Wendy Williams shares health update after canceling shows", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
