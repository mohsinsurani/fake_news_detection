She seemingly took a page out of Kate Middleton's fashion book and recycled a piece she's already worn! \ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\ud83d\ude31\n\nGetty Images\n\nThis content is imported from {embed-name}. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nEagle-eyed fans spotted the fact that the Victoria Beckham sweater she wore at her most recent event looked suspiciously similar to the one she had on in her very cute engagement photos with Harry.\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHonestly, it's kind of hard to tell something like that from this engagement picture, since you just see, like, one shoulder of the sweater. But if she did pull a K-Mid and recycle it, it's fun!\n\nWhy? Because most celebrities step out wearing different pieces every day \u2014 so much so that we all start to think, \"Do they just wear stuff once and throw it out?\" Kate \u2014 and now Meghan, if this is true \u2014 is more relatable when she wears an item again. Plus, it's nice to see how she styles an item multiple ways.\n\nAnyway, apart from the VB sweater, Meghan wore a , a (now sold-out) skirt from Greta Constantine, a Charlotte Elizabeth handbag (available for pre-order here), and a pair of rust-colored velvet . The whole ensemble looked very good! Here are more photos, just because:\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nGetty Images\n\nIf you like Meghan's style, try the similar pieces below!\n\nShop Meghan's Look Cream Sweater $163 Fluted Skirt $68 Wool Coat $356 Rust Heels $328\n\nGet non-boring fashion and beauty news directly in your feed.
