In a lengthy series of videos posted on Thursday night, Cameron opened up about the sometimes dark side of social media and how it makes her feel. As reported by E!, the 22-year-old Descendants 3 actress voiced her thoughts, made in a series of selfie videos on her Instagram Stories on how lousy social media makes her feel at times.\n\n\"I really hate how Instagram makes me feel, I think, and I hate how Twitter and any kind of social media makes me feel. \"Whether I'm looking at other people's lives or how I portray my life, I just hate the whole thing. I hate it. I think that they're something super wrong with staring at other people that much and I think there's something really wrong with staring at yourself that much. It's like walking around with a mirror up to yourself all day long. You don't even look at people's eyes. You look at how you come off to them, like you're watching yourself in a dream.\"\n\n\"Whether I'm looking at other people's lives or how I portray my life, I just hate the whole thing. I hate it.
