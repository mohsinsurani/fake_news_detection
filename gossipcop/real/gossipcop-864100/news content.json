But according to a new report, parents Kate Middleton and Prince William do everything they can to ensure that their children live as normal lives as possible.\n\nRelated Story Kate Middleton Surprises Kids for Charity\n\nUs Weekly reports that, according to a \"royal insider,\" \"William and Kate very much prioritize bringing up the children in as normal an environment as possible.\"\n\nApparently, this normality takes precedence throughout every day, and starts from first thing in the morning. Per Us Weekly, Prince George is driven to his school, Thomas\u2019s of Battersea in London, by either his mom or dad.\n\nMeanwhile, Princess Charlotte, whose nursery is within walking distance of the family home, is walked there by one of her parents. Instead of enlisting a member of staff with these duties, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge endeavor to put their children first.\n\nKarwai Tang // Getty Images\n\n\n\n\n\nAnd when it comes to their home in Kensington Palace's Apartment 1A, Princess Charlotte is apparently a great hostess. Per the source, \"She\u2019ll come up to guests and ask them if they want tea or coffee or offer them sweets\u2014so adorable!\"\n\n\n\nThis isn't the first time that Kate and William have seen trying to keep their children's lives normal. Earlier this month, Kate was spotted doing some back-to-school shopping with the kids, as they looked for new school shoes. The Duchess has often been seen grocery shopping for the family, too.\n\nAnd the Daily Mail's royal correspondent, Rebecca English, previously reported that the Duchess of Cambridge even took Prince George to school the day after she gave birth to her third child, Prince Louis, which is more than a little impressive.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665062756.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0.0252xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1643411268.png?crop=1.00xw:0.501xh;0,0.239xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/crown-prince-frederik-of-denmark-prince-vincent-of-denmark-news-photo-1664899080.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.170xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fekixdhxgaapvq7-1664823960.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0406xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kate-paddington-index-1508154649.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664895878.jpg?crop=0.527xw:1.00xh;0.237xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-william-1537104454.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4m769-1664893662.jpg?crop=0.644xw:0.957xh;0.0962xw,0.0430xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-william-1537104454.jpg?crop=0.500170010200612xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4x9br-1664984071.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.185xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664976504.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.691xh;0,0.0431xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-820407648-1537106717.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664889898.jpg?crop=0.684xw:1.00xh;0.146xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/21445446-1bde-4290-a24e-2bdd274be027_1521573573.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-william-1537104454.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23240468/kate-middleton-prince-william-children-normal-lives/", "title": "How Kate Middleton and Prince William Keep Their Kids' Lives Normal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Kate Middleton & Prince William Keep Prince George & Princess Charlotte's Lives Normal", "description": "As members of the British royal family\u200b, it's hard to imagine that Princess Charlotte, Prince George, and Prince Louis live ordinary lives.
