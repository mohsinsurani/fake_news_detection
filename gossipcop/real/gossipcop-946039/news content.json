That's the only way I think either one of us could probably describe it,\" he added.\n\nShelton and Stefani confirmed their relationship in November 2015 following their splits from their respective spouses, Miranda Lambert and Gavin Rossdale. The couple found support and comfort in each other after their divorces.\n\n\"When I was going through my divorce, I hit rock bottom just like anybody does when they go through something that devastating,\" Shelton said. \"It's a miracle that I met somebody that was going through the same exact thing that I was at the exact same moment in time.\"\n\n\"I think if Gwen and I were being honest right now, talking about this, I think in the back of our minds we both kind of thought, 'This is a rebound deal,' because we're both coming out of a pretty low spot in our lives and we're kind of clinging to each other to get through this,\" he added.\n\nStefani thanked Shelton for sharing his world with her after spending Tuesday at Lake Texoma with the country singer and her son Apollo. She sent love to Shelton the day previous on his 42nd birthday.\n\n\"Happy b day @blakeshelton #iloveuthemost #yourmyfavorite gx,\" the singer wrote.", "images":
