The tennis champ made an appearance at Glamour's Women of the Year Awards in Brooklyn, New York, wearing a mini dress from Versace's Spring 2018 collection.\n\nGetty Images\n\nShe looked absolutely amazing.\n\nGetty Images\n\n\"It's been a while since I've been on the red carpet,\" Williams revealed on her Instagram Story. She recalled that her last appearance was at the Met Gala, where she debuted her baby bump, while attending with her fianc\u00e9, Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. Her green halter gown that evening was also by Atelier Versace.\n\nLast night's look however, had a shorter hemline, sexier body-hugging silhouette. The dress, originally modeled by Gigi Hadid at Milan fashion week in September, is a part of Donatella Versace's tribute collection to her brother Gianni, in honor of the 20th anniversary of his death this year. The range incorporated some of his most famous design motifs, including golden baroque swirls (as seen on Williams' dress), animal prints and pop art.\n\nWilliams finished of her look with some light jewelry and simple black pumps, but the real accessory was her hair, which she kept in a taut, high ponytail decorated with gold rings.\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe new mom not only wore the same look as Gigi Hadid, she also presented her with an award. While introducing her at the ceremony, Williams even joked onstage, \"Gigi, you are one of the few people on this planet I would leave my baby for\u2014for one night\u2014but for you it shows how much you mean to me.\"\n\nThe two shared an embrace when Hadid retrieved her trophy.\n\nGetty Images\n\nAnd they posed on the red carpet together, too.\n\nGetty Images\n\nNow that Williams is back in the spotlight, we're so ready for more empowering moments from her like this one.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-serena-woty-index-1510669880.jpg?crop=0.501xw:1.00xh;0.278xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-style-1655915134.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1663025856.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.0497xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1395162317.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/vanessa-hudgens-attends-the-2022-mtv-movie-tv-awards-at-news-photo-1654468176.jpg?crop=0.721xw:1.00xh;0.140xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1663029463.jpg?crop=0.669xw:1.00xh;0.166xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-873801158-1510670582.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kim-kardashian-and-pete-davidson-attend-the-the-2022-met-news-photo-1651590820.jpg?crop=0.66667xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1658851682.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.638xh;0,0.0469xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-serena-woty-hair-1510671390.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-serena-woty-index-1510669880.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1655149353.jpg?crop=0.572xw:0.381xh;0.292xw,0.115xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-serena-williams-gettyimages-873800966-1510672370.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/5866a1c7e694aa177f630fc3/thumb_1483121100.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/anne-hathaway-attends-the-screening-of-armageddon-time-news-photo-1653860022.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-serena-williams-gettyimages-873836696-1510672400.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lizzo-attends-the-2022-mtv-vmas-at-prudential-center-on-news-photo-1661721379.jpg?crop=0.699xw:1.00xh;0.151xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-36165-4980557-1662831008.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-serena-woty-gigi-1510671649.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1662572769.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.332xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-serena-woty-index-1510669880.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/red-carpet-dresses/a13582432/serena-williams-red-carpet-post-baby/", "title": "Serena Williams Makes First Red Carpet Appearance Since Giving Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Serena Williams Makes First Red Carpet Appearance Since Giving Birth -
