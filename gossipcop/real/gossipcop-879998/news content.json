Just last week, on August 4, Chip took to Twitter to shut down rumors that he and Joanna are getting divorced, as reported by Country Living.\n\nIn response to a fan who tweeted, \"I'm so sick of these 'stories' claiming @joannagaines and @chippergaines breaking up,\" Chip replied with three strong words: \"Won't ever happen ... you can take that to the bank! #loveOfMyLife.\"\n\nIt wasn't the first time the \"Fixer Upper\" stars had to address tabloid gossip this year.\n\nBack in April, Joanna denied rumors that she was leaving HGTV to start a line of face creams. \"If you're reading big, exciting news about us, and we did not confirm it on our official sites, then proceed with caution,\" she warned in a blog post.\n\nJust a few months later, however, Joanna had to shut down yet another round of rumors that claimed she was leaving \"Fixer Upper\" to start her own skin care and makeup line. \"This is a SCAM,\" Joanna wrote in an Instagram post. She added: \"We have nothing to do with it and have been trying to stop it for some time.\"\n\nThere have been rumors floating around about me leaving the show to start a skincare/makeup line.
