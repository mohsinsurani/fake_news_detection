In the single \u201cSorry\u201d, which features a cameo from Serena Williams in the video, she sings: \u201cHe only want me when I\u2019m not there, He better call Becky with the good hair.\u201d With themes in the album revolving around relationships, infidelity and reconciliation, the rumour mill went into overdrive.\n\nThe Beyhive flooded New York designer Rachel Roy\u2019s Instagram with bee and lemon emojis on Sunday after some accused her of being \u201cBecky\u201d following an Instagram post referencing \u201cgood hair\u201d. A day later they turned their attention to Rita Ora who is signed to Jay Z\u2019s record label, yet currently involved in a legal battle with the label.\n\nEvery cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Show all 16 1 /16 Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Tina Knowles, Beyonc\u00e9's mother, and her husband Richard Lawson Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Model Winnie Harlow HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Sybrina Fulton, Trayvon Martin's mother HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Serena Williams HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Oscar-nominated actor Quvenzhan\u00e9 Wallis HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Naomi Diaz of music duo Ibeyi HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Ballerina Michaela DePrince HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Lisa-Kaind\u00e9 Diaz of music duo Ibeyi HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Lesley McSpadden, Mike Brown's mother HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Leah Chase, restaurant owner and Queen of Creole cuisine HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Jay Z HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Hattie White, Jay Z's grandmother HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Gwen Carr, Eric Garner's mother HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Chloe and Halle Bailey of singing duo Chloe x Halle HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Singer, actor, and activist Zendaya (right) HBO Every cameo in Beyonc\u00e9's Lemonade Actor and activist Amandla Stenberg HBO\n\nOn Tuesday, Ora\u2019s Instagram comments varied from the emojis to offensive, misogynistic insults.\n\nThe 25-year-old Londoner responded to the comments and \u201ctabloid gossip\u201d with posts on Instagram clarifying that the rumours have no basis and she has the \u201cutmost respect for Beyonce\u201d.\n\n\u2715 LEMONADE Trailer - HBO\n\nWho the next \u201cBecky\u201d will be is anyone\u2019s guess.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Blair"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rita-ora-beyonce-lemonade-rumours-jay-z-affair-who-is-becky-a7003171.html", "title": "Rita Ora responds to 'false' Jay Z affair rumours after Beyonc\u00e9 Lemonade lyric", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Some Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0\u00a0fans chose to target Ora after initially targeting Rachel Roy", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "People", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/people", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Rita Ora responds to rumours she's 'Becky with the good hair'", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/people/rita-ora-beyonce-lemonade-rumours-jay-z-affair-who-is-becky-a7003171.html", "type": "article", "description": "Some Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0\u00a0fans chose to target Ora after initially targeting Rachel Roy", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "People", "author_name": "Olivia Blair", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 341, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 3}, "date": "2016-04-27T16:11:09.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Rita Ora responds to rumours she's 'Becky with the good hair'", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Some Beyonc\u00e9\u00a0\u00a0fans chose to target Ora after initially targeting Rachel Roy", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2016/04/27/11/gettyimages-498509206.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Beyonce,Rita Ora,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1461773469.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
