Bloom celebrated his birthday with his father Colin at his side, who couldn\u2019t have looked more proud, cheering his son from the sidelines.\n\nHappy birthday Orlando!", "images": ["https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original-696x1039.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_9882880aa-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/shutterstock_editorial_13330473du-1-324x400.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/braddpitt-e1663225071870-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/JonathanBailey-scaled-e1663831379613-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_9470680q-scaled-e1663576722678-100x70.jpg"], "top_img": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zoe Grace"], "canonical_link": "https://omgcheckitout.com/orlando-bloom-celebrates-birthday-leonardo-dicaprio-race-cars-morocco/", "title": "Orlando Bloom Celebrates Birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio and Race Cars in Morocco", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Depositphotos_153815706_original.jpg", "width": 2411, "height": 3600, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "locale": "en_US", "title": "Orlando Bloom Celebrates Birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio and Race Cars in Morocco", "description": "Orlando Bloom celebrated his 41st birthday with Leonardo DiCaprio by attending the third race of the Formula E season in Marrakesh, Morocco on Friday.
