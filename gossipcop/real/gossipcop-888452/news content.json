{"url": "https://thesaltyju.com/tag/jessie-james-decker/", "text": "Week of 11/9/2020\n\n1. Who Bought Halftime This Year?\n\nThe Weeknd, that\u2019s who. I\u2019m certainly not the first to say this but allow me to be the loudest, WHAT?! We just had a record day for new cases of the \u2018vid (I feel like if we give it a street name it\u2019ll stop killing people) and we\u2019re making plans for a football game in February?! LOLOLOL. Get the hell out of here with that garbage! Unless he\u2019s performing remotely like all of these ratchet awards shows, I feel like it\u2019s a scooch premature to be locking in the Super Bowl this year. Let\u2019s take a beat and see how the end of 2020 shakes out first. Even the CMA\u2019s that went full force the other night had people dropping like flies because of positive tests. Just because Pfizer has a promising lead on the vaccine sitch doesn\u2019t mean we\u2019ll be partying like it\u2019s 1999 mask free for Super Bowl Sunday. (Related note: all of this can also apply to LiveNation who thinks they\u2019re going to reboot the concert industry through an app to verify if you\u2019ve been vaccinated.) Everyone needs to slow their roll. I get that the world is crumbling and people just want reasons to celebrate and act like shit\u2019s normal but this has a real dad just hit mom at the dinner table and everyone be quiet vibe to it. Address the elephant in the room, the elephant that I\u2019m referring to is of course the fact that just anyone can purchase their spot at the Super Bowl now and a stage that large should be exclusively reserved for iconic singers\u2013of which the Weeknd is not. Sorry, that\u2019s the way the cookie crumbles. JLo? Icon. Gaga? Icon. The Weeknd? He\u2019s been around for like 2 years and I still have to google how to spell his name. Relax. That being said, should the halftime show go off without a hitch, my sister and I are one hundo percent available as backup dancers. Just need a couple of Bud Lattes, a cheese-based dip and 2 hours of practice to shuffle through 14 seconds of dance moves like we\u2019re uncoordinated paralyzed zombies. Please contact our agent if you\u2019re interested. Who am I kidding, we\u2019d never give up a night of unlimited dips just to perform at the Super Bowl no matter HOW talented we are. Rescinding the offer in favor of the best apps night of the year.\n\n2. Another Legend Gone.\n\nLifelong Jeopardy host Alex Trebek lost his battle with cancer this past weekend. Whether you were an old who can\u2019t miss Jeopardy or not, everyone is mourning this iconic host. He was Canadian cool and Jeopardy will be lost without him. I\u2019m not personally an avid viewer of the Jeop/WOF early bird special but I was an avid viewer of \u201cThe Best of Will Ferrell on SNL\u201d and his skits as Trebek were easily my favorite. It\u2019s unfortunate that my first thought when I hear his name is \u201cSuck It, Trebek\u201d or \u201cRough, just the way your mother likes it, Trebek\u201d but that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re so calm & collected that they make a whole SNL running sketch with Sean Connery (also RIP, God everyone\u2019s dropping like flies) insulting you. Hope he\u2019s up there kickin it with Reg, doing TV legend shit. (Enjoy my favorite clip below even though the only surviving celeb that they\u2019re mocking is French Stewart\u2026yoikes.)\n\nAnd also an actual tribute to the real Alex Trebek and not the parody.\n\n3. New Tuneage.\n\nThomas Rhett previewed this song about a week ago and I was READY FOR IT. I figured he\u2019d incorporate his cute ass family into the music video as he\u2019s been known to do, plus they spent a significant amount of time in Montana looking like an LL Bean catalog during quarantine. Curveball: he decided to go for the angle that makes me feel old AF. Watching a bunch of high school football games and kids singing in the car driving home from school was enough to make me wither away in my wrinkles and grey hair (YES I HAVE GREY HAIR, NO I AM NOT OVER IT) while watching. Regardless of my age insecurities, this song is a bop and the video had some wholesome fall vibes to it. Maybe one day I\u2019ll get to see his concert I bought tickets for last June and not have to prove via an app that I\u2019m Covid-Free. Also good news:\n\nThese two cherubs will be hosting the holidays. Since there\u2019s a high possibility that Thanksgiving and Christmas are cancelled, we need them now more than ever. Now who is going to give me a cable login so I can watch?\n\n4. Flex on Flex.\n\nRolling Stone did a feature called \u201cMusicians on Musicians\u201d where Taylor Swift and Paul McCartney kicked it in London and talked about the process behind their latest albums, both done in quarantine. In summary, it was a buttload of words about why they\u2019re both bosses. Paul played all the instruments on his album, Taylor talked about how she\u2019s been beefing up on classic literature and showed up without hair and makeup for a photoshoot. It\u2019s essentially a contest to see who can be more intelligent and humble. They both win. I imagine they conducted this interview in a castle library straight out of Beauty and the Beast, smoking cigars. The whole article just smelled of rich leather and mahogany. Obviously I\u2019m jealous as hell. And as two top-tier songwriters who have earned their success, why wouldn\u2019t you humble-brag about it in Rolling Stone if given the opportunity? For those of you who like a long read and are genuinely interested in the art of music (Dad), find the article HERE. For anyone with the attention span of a gnat (the rest of my friends and family), you\u2019re not really missing that much. Taylor doesn\u2019t give many tidbits behind folklore other than that Peace is one of the few on the album that is about her personal life (focusing on her lack of privacy and how that messes with her relationship) and she really loves the word epiphany and has a list of big words that she just likes and will toss into songs. My favorite part of the article is the story Paul tells in the end:\n\nHere\u2019s hoping something will happen for me REAL QUICK.\n\n5. CHRISTMAS IS COMING THE GEESE ARE GETTING FAT.\n\nPeople are really desp for some Christmas cheer this year and I feel like the past few weeks have been chock full of holiday content, so I\u2019m going to do the lazy thing and jam it all together here for your selective consumption. If you feel like it\u2019s too soon, get over it. Hallmark has been airing Christmas movies since March. It\u2019s time to force joy into your lives when it\u2019s pitch black at 5 (Seriously, is there a soul on this earth that LIKES daylight savings? Can we just cancel it like everything else?) and freezing cold. The hot flash that was last week is over and it\u2019s time to come to terms with Mariah season fast-approaching. So here\u2019s some new tunes (I\u2019m purposefully leaving out the Jonas Brothers release because it was the biggest snoozer):\n\nSo realistically it\u2019s just the country scene that are ready for some Christmas cheer, which is ironic because the south will never see snow and their holidays probably look like my 80 degree bike ride through the tacky lights on the lake display that they started erecting in Syracuse in July.\n\nIf only snow always looked as majestic as the set where Dan + Shay crooned about Christmas and white fedoras like Jessie\u2019s counted as casual wear. Anyway, in addition to new beats, there will also be a Disney singalong. Unfortunately it\u2019s the same night as the country holiday special hosted by TR and Lauren so hopefully y\u2019all have some DVR space. Normally I\u2019d skip this Disney fest but they do have Bubbles and everyone with a brain knows you can\u2019t have Christmas without Michael Buble.\n\nWe're making this season bright! \ud83c\udf1f Singalong with me during the #DisneyHolidaySingalong Monday Nov 30 at 8|7c on ABC pic.twitter.com/FtEtQ00Crf \u2014 P!nk (@Pink) November 13, 2020\n\nAnd finally should you be in search of holiday movies that might include a little more action than your regular Hallmark & Lifetime (of which I will try my hardest to do my annual blog of holiday TV movies), might I suggest Holidate on Netflix. TECHNICALLY it\u2019s not a Christmas movie because it features ALL holidays, but we\u2019ll count it for now because I have given it my must-watch stamp of approval. It has humor, it has sex (GASP) and just the right amount of cheese. Also, feel free to turn focusing on the fact that Kristin Chenoweth\u2019s forehead does not move one single time into a drinking game. You\u2019re welcome. My Christmas present to all.", "images": ["https://thesaltyju.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/bush.png", "https://thesaltyju.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/kathieleehoda.jpg",
