The pair might not have gotten along like a sept on fire when they finally met in Episode 3, but still, there was chemistry in the Dragonstone throne room. But an incestuous love match between aunt Daenerys and her nephew, Jon, would hardly rate as \u201csurprising\u201d\u2014so what, exactly, do Game of Thrones book readers think they know?\n\nAs with most of the best Thrones theories, this one comes to us via the dreams and prophecies that take up large sections of the books, but which the HBO series has largely had to cut. One of the most intriguing recurring symbols that crops up again and again is the blue winter rose. In the books, Ned remembers \u201cthe moment when all the smiles died, when Prince Rhaegar Targaryen urged his horse past his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell, to lay the queen of beauty\u2019s laurel in Lyanna\u2019s lap. He could see it still: a crown of winter roses, blue as frost.\u201d Lyanna is, as was revealed last season, Jon\u2019s mother and Ned\u2019s sister. In the show, it\u2019s Littlefinger who tells this story to Sansa in Season 5. Yes, he includes the roses.\n\nThis bit about blue roses is taken by readers as both literal and figurative language from Martin, foreshadowing that Rhaegar would soon impregnate Lyanna with baby Jon Snow. Lyanna crops up in dreams and visions (even Theon\u2019s) as a figure crowned in blue winter roses. Ned dreams of her death bed and Jon\u2019s birth:\n\n\u201cPromise me,\u201d she had cried in a room that smelled of blood and roses. \u201cPromise me,\u201d Ned. The fever had taken her strength and her voice had been faint as a whisper, but when he gave her his word, the fear had gone out of his sister\u2019s eyes.\n\nWe\u2019re meant to understand that the room smells of roses because Lyanna is still holding on to the crown Rhaegar gave her. \u201cNed remembered the way she had smiled then, how tightly her fingers had clutched his as she gave up her hold on life, the rose petals spilling from her palm, dead and black.\u201d\n\nBut the bit of book vision that cements the blue rose as both a literal item Lyanna held, a symbol of fertility, and Jon Snow himself comes from Daenerys. In the books, she has a lengthy, symbolism-packed vision in The House of the Undying where she sees images of things Martin hadn\u2019t even written yet. Most significantly for our purposes here, Daenerys sees \u201ca blue flower growing from a chink in a wall of ice, filling the air with sweetness\u201d\u2014which most readers and theorists agree is meant to be a vision of Jon himself.\n\nThe show didn\u2019t go for any blue roses in the House of the Undying sequence from Season 2, though Daenerys did visit that wall of ice.", "images":
