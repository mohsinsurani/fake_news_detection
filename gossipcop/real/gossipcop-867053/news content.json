The actress was unable to attend the event due to scheduling conflicts, but the letter was read by Disney chairman Bob Iger.\n\n\"As far back as I can remember, my mom and I have been Disney fanatics,\" Iger said as he read Lourd's words aloud. \"I was so obsessed with Ariel that I wanted to change my name. We went to Disneyland so much that I now realize she might have even loved it more than I did.\"\n\n\"Becoming part of the Disney family was truly an amazing moment for her. She secretly always wanted to be a Disney princess, so getting to be a Disney princess and a Disney legend would have been her ultimate dream,\" the speech continued. \"I wish I could be there to accept this award on her behalf, but unfortunately, I am currently working on American Horror Story. I am beyond grateful to Mr. Iger and everyone at Disney for this incredible honor. Thank you again, and may the force be with you always.\"\n\n\n\nRELATED: Carrie Fisher's Daughter, Billie Lourd, Named Beneficiary of Estate As Final Assets Are Revealed\n\nMark Hamill, who was also a recipient of the award, also shared a sweet message about his Star Wars co-star.\n\n\"We loved each other and what a great thrill it was to come back in The Force Awakens, in that time in our lives,\" the actor told the crowd. \"There was a comfort level with each other.
