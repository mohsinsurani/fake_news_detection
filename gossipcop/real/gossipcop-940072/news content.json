As People noted, she is already mom to four sons from her previous marriages: Julian Winding, 34, Killian Gastineau, 28, Douglas Meyer, 25, and Raoul Meyer Jr., 23.\n\n\"The children have kept me going,\" Nielsen told Hello! magazine in 2008, revealing that the married pair hoped to one day have children of their own. \"After I do Playboy, we want to try IVF.
