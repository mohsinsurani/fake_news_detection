Each six-episode season (of which there are three so far) tells a story from the darkest pages of the internet. While the show may be based on a new creepypasta each year, it is so much more than just a retelling of a scary story: It's also a show about the darkness within all of us, and explores complex themes like forgiveness, grief, and mental health.The next season, Channel Zero: The Dream Door, is rumored to hit SyFy next year, so get your fill of the first three installments now. All episodes are available to watch on SyFy's website.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/f3f/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1984885/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg"], "top_img": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/f3f/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1984885/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Singh", "Mekita Rivas", "Ineye Komonibo", "Olivia Truffaut-Wong", "Melissah Yang", "Shamira Ibrahim", "Best Tv Shows To Binge Watch This Summer - Picks"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/202190/2018-summer-shows-to-binge-watch", "title": "Best TV Shows To Binge Watch This Summer", "meta_data": {"title": "Best TV Shows To Binge Watch This Summer - 2018 Picks", "description": "For when you need some indoor time.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/06/202190/2018-summer-shows-to-binge-watch", "title": "TV Shows You Need To Binge-Watch This Summer", "description": "For when you need some indoor time.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/f3f/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1984885/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/f3f/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1984885/image.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1050}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "TV Shows You Need To Binge-Watch This Summer", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29", "description": "For when you need some indoor time.", "image": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/f3f/0,675,2000,1050/x,80/1984885/image.jpg"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/f3f/112,0,1776,2400/x,80/1984885/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "news_keywords": "tv shows to binge, best netflix shows to watch, best amazon shows to watch, best new tv shows, tv shows to binge, bingable shows, shows coming out this summer, good place, bold type, the resident,", "p": {"domain_verify": "b10faeb45f92f5ebf0073a215d615ea9"}, "entry_template": "entry.slideshow", "author": "Kaitlin Reilly"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529449200.0, "source": "https://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
