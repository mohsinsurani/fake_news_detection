He appeared with a rusty red arm in The Force Awakens.\n\n\u2013 The tune you hear as the Millennium Falcon zooms through the Crait mines during the TIE fighter chase scene is definitely a callback to the \u201cTie Fighter Attack\u201d theme from A New Hope. In fact, the way the scene is choreographed, the Falcon zig zagging past obstacles like that, it\u2019s almost meant to look like the Falcon\u2019s run through the Death Star II in Return of the Jedi.\n\n\u2013 Maz Kanata makes a very brief appearance in The Last Jedi in a hologram. We get to see her in action for the first time in this short scene, shooting at her enemies with a blaster. It\u2019s peculiar that she chooses to use a blaster considering that she can use the Force (as revealed in The Force Awakens\u2019 deleted scenes). I hope we can see more of her in Episode IX.\n\n\u2013 Although I thought Temmin \u201cSnap\u201d Wexley died in a fiery X-wing crash during the opening battle, the diligent commenters have corrected me: that\u2019s a dude named Tubbs, played by Jamie Christopher. That\u2019s almost certainly a reference to Porkins from A New Hope.\n\n\u2013 Billie Lourd, Carrie Fisher\u2019s daughter, returns once again as Lieutenant Kaydel Ko Connix. She gets a bit more to do this time around, such as help Poe Dameron commit mutiny and take over the Raddus.\n\n\u2013 Nien Nunb, the Sullustan who piloted the Millennium Falcon with Lando Calrissian during the Battle of Endor, makes a brief appearance as part of Poe Dameron\u2019s X-wing squadron. He also appeared in The Force Awakens.\n\n\u2013 In one of the more overt cameos in the movie, Rogue One director Gareth Edwards appears during the Battle of Crait. He can be seen next to the Resistance fighter who tastes the salt on the ground.\n\nPlanets, Other Cameos, & Miscellaneous\n\n\u2013 This isn\u2019t the first Star Wars story to bear the name \u201cThe Last Jedi.\u201d In the Legends timeline, there\u2019s a novel called The Last Jedi by Michael Reaves and Maya Kaathryn. It\u2019s a continuation of the Coruscant Nights trilogy, which stars a Jedi Knight named Jax Pavan in the days after Order 66.\n\n\u2013 Even though you never actually hear the famous Star Wars line, \u201cI\u2019ve got a bad feeling about this,\u201d it is in the movie, according to director Rian Johnson. He revealed to Huffington Post that it\u2019s actually BB-8 who says it to Poe during their crazy attack on the Dreadnought.\n\n\u201cIt seemed like a fun character to deliver that line,\u201d Johnson told HuffPo. \u201cI think originally I had Poe respond, \u2018Oh, I got a good feeling about it. Keep your chin up.\u2019 And then I made it a little less explicit just to make it more fun.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The little ornament Luke finds on the Falcon and later gifts to Leia is Han\u2019s lucky dice. The smuggler believes they bring him good luck, so he hangs the ornament in the ship\u2019s cockpit. He even used the dice to beat Lando Calrissian in a game of \u201cCorellian Spike,\u201d an offshoot of the card game sabacc, and win the Millennium Falcon!\n\nIn reality, Han\u2019s dice only appear ONCE in the entire Original Trilogy. Inexplicably, they disappear after one shot in the movie. They finally return in The Force Awakensand are given a bit more attention in The Last Jedi.\n\n\u2013 From what I can tell, the charred Darth Vader helmet doesn\u2019t make an appearance in this movie. It seems kind of odd that we never see Kylo Ren talking to it considering it was such a big part of his faith in the dark side in The Force Awakens. Perhaps that\u2019s part of his whole \u201cKill the past\u201d slogan in The Last Jedi. As far as I can tell, the last we saw of the helmet, it was on the Finalizer and not Starkiller Base, so it wouldn\u2019t have blown up, right?\n\n\u2013 There is a lot to learn about Canto Bight in the recently released novel collection. It\u2019s a corrupt place where the rich control the police department. You can read way more fun facts about the planet here.\n\n\u2013 The Force-sensitive boy who works in the fathier stables in Canto Bight is named Temiri Blagg, played by Temirlan Blaev.\n\n\u2013 Temiri\u2019s friends are named Arashell Sar (Sarah Heller) and Oniho Zaya (Josiah Oniha).\n\n\u2013 Canto Bight is located on the desert planet called Cantonica. Yes, it\u2019s a desert planet! How does Canto Bight have that body of water surrounding it and that huge waterfall? That\u2019s an artificial body of water constructed to make Canto Bight look even more lavish.\n\n\u2013 Warwick Davis, who played Wicket the Ewok in Return of the Jedi, has a brief cameo as an alien in Canto Bight named Wodibin. Davis has cameod in quite a few other Star Wars projects, too.\n\n\u2013 The \u201cspace horses\u201d located on Canto Bight are called fathiers. They were actually first mentioned in the novel Aftermath: Empire\u2019s End by Chuck Wendig, misspelled as \u201cfaithiers.\u201d\n\n\u2013 The Master Codebreaker Maz Kanata recommends for Finn and Rose\u2019s secret mission to deactivate the First Order\u2019s hyperspace tracker is played by Justin Theroux in a cameo role. He seems to be really good as \u201cspace craps.\u201d Hit me up if you know what game the Master Codebreaker is actually playing on Canto Bight.\n\n\u2013 Frequent Rian Johnson collaborator Joseph Gordon-Levitt has a brief cameo. He voices a character named Slowen Lo. According to Steve Wheeler in the comments, \u201cThe character Slowen Lo voiced by Joseph Gordon-Levitt is a reference to the Beastie Boys song \u2018Slow and Low.\u2019 There was a character called Ello Asty in The Force Awakens in reference to the Beastie Boys album Hello Nasty and J.J. Abrams used \u2018Sabotage\u2019 in Star Trek (2009) and it was later repeated in Star Trek Beyond (2016).\u201d Thanks for the Beastie Boys knowledge, Steve!\n\n\u2013 The space yacht DJ and BB-8 steal in order to escape Canto Bight is called the Libertine.\n\n\u2013 When DJ is going through the different ships the Canto Bight arms dealer sold to the First Order, we see holograms of the TIE bomber and TIE Interceptor.\n\n\u2013 The extreme close-up of the iron landing on the First Order officer uniform is a reference to the short film Hardware Wars, which itself is a parody of A New Hope.\n\n\u2013 The \u201ccrystal foxes\u201d on Crait are actually called vulptices. (The singular is \u201cvulptex.\u201d)\n\n\u2013 Apparently, filmmakers Edgar Wright and Joe Cornish also have cameo roles in the movie, but I\u2019ve not spotted them. Let me know if you do!\n\n\u2013 There were rumors that Tom Hardy (Mad Max: Fury Road) would also have a cameo, but that\u2019s not been confirmed. He apparently played a stormtrooper.\n\n\u2013 Prince Harry and Prince William of the British royal family reportedly filmed cameos. No sight of them just yet, though.\n\n\u2013 British singer Ellie Goulding revealed on Twitter that she filmed a cameo in The Last Jedi. I\u2019ve not spotted her, though.\n\nJohn Saavedra is an associate editor at Den of Geek US. Find more of his work on his website.
