Additionally, a doctor was not called. Although she was not on hand, Angelina Jolie did attend the service in London. She wore Ralph & Russo couture as she was photographed waving to onlookers.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II, who turned 92 in April, has been keeping busy as of late. She celebrated her birthday with the royal family earlier this month and was joined by Duchess Meghan, 36, for their first solo event together in Cheshire, England, on June 14. On Tuesday, Prince Harry joined them as they attended the Young Leaders Reception.\n\nThe Queen and Meghan have struck up a quick bond \u2013 even before the former actress wed Harry, 33, on May 19. \u201c[Meghan] quickly demonstrated that she is intelligent, polite and keen to learn,\u201d a source revealed in the new issue of Us Weekly, adding that her \u201centhusiasm towards living a life of service and humanitarianism excites the queen and it\u2019s just the type of vim and vigor she likes to see in someone.\u201d\n\nThe insider noted: \u201cShe has a brilliant sense of humor. That\u2019s one of the first things that brought her and Meghan closer. It\u2019s that warm side of her that has made Meghan feel so at ease.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Queen-Elizabeth-II-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C25px%2C1800px%2C1017px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Queen-Elizabeth-II-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Queen-Elizabeth-II-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/queen-elizabeth-ii-feeling-under-the-weather-skips-church-service/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II Feeling \u2018Under the Weather,\u2019 Skips Church Service", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II canceled an event on Thursday, June 28, after feeling \u2018under the weather\u2019 \u2013 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II Feeling \u2018Under the Weather,\u2019 Skips Church Service", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II canceled an event on Thursday, June 28, after feeling \u2018under the weather\u2019 \u2013 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/queen-elizabeth-ii-feeling-under-the-weather-skips-church-service/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-28T13:29:26+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Queen-Elizabeth-II-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Queen-Elizabeth-II-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-28T13:29:26+00:00"}, "author": "Stephanie Webber", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II Feeling \u2018Under the Weather,\u2019 Skips Church Service", "description": "Queen Elizabeth II canceled an event on Thursday, June 28, after feeling \u2018under the weather\u2019 \u2013 find out more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Queen-Elizabeth-II-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C30px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530192566.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
