The star\u2019s next conquest? The app store, which will see the debut of her proprietary app later this year, just in time to coincide with the publicity cycle for the artist\u2019s new album, Reputation, slated for November.\n\nThe Swift Life comes from Glu Mobile, the same company responsible for games like Kim Kardashian: Hollywood and Nicki Minaj: The Empire. According to a first-look video the company released, Swift\u2019s app will be less game and more access. It seems to borrow from the other Kim Kardashian app, the one that isn\u2019t from Glu, the Kim Kardashian West Official App, which offers \u201cpremium\u201d content to paid subscribers. \u201cConnect with Taylor!\u201d the video promises. \u201cGet exclusive pics and video!\u201d In addition to access to Taylor, the app will provide opportunities for Swift fans to connect and network with each other, building on Swift\u2019s already-strong presence on platforms like Twitter, Tumblr, and Instagram.\n\nThe video also teases \u201cTaymojis,\u201d another feature strangely reminiscent of a certain reality TV star\u2019s \u201cKimojis.\u201d The two may be enemies engaged in a battle over \u201creceipts,\u201d but apparently that hasn\u2019t stopped Swift from taking ample inspiration from Kardashian\u2019s business playbook. In-app purchases weren\u2019t mentioned in the preview but seem like a good bet, given Swift\u2019s talent for monetizing her every move: That may be the real secret of the Swift life, which means the Swift Life will be right on brand.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-fw53_-Tq3MNK1.gif", "https://compote.slate.com/images/04997ca1-06d4-4946-8c17-8c0d9f0ec1b7.jpg?width=1560"], "top_img": "https://compote.slate.com/images/04997ca1-06d4-4946-8c17-8c0d9f0ec1b7.jpg?width=1560", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Heather Schwedel"], "canonical_link": "https://slate.com/technology/2017/10/taylor-swift-announces-an-app-the-swift-life.html", "title": "Taylor Swift Announces an Exclusive App, the Swift Life", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Announces an Exclusive App, the Swift Life", "url": "https://slate.com/technology/2017/10/taylor-swift-announces-an-app-the-swift-life.html", "description": "Look what the Kardashians made her do.", "image": {"identifier": "https://compote.slate.com/images/04997ca1-06d4-4946-8c17-8c0d9f0ec1b7.jpg?width=1560", "width": 1560}, "site_name": "Slate Magazine", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Taylor Swift Announces an Exclusive App, the Swift Life", "url": "https://slate.com/technology/2017/10/taylor-swift-announces-an-app-the-swift-life.html", "description": "Look what the Kardashians made her do.", "image": "https://compote.slate.com/images/04997ca1-06d4-4946-8c17-8c0d9f0ec1b7.jpg?width=1560", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@slate"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-11T17:02:04+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Slate"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Look what the Kardashians made her do.", "author": "Heather Schwedel", "fb": {"app_id": 142011022527753}, "theme-color": "#000000", "dfp-cache-buster": "20673f0c66f9b7dc445dfc2001f1b9549a2c9299"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/f24IrRsf-lQ?rel=0&enablejsapi=1"], "publish_date": 1507741324.0, "source": "https://slate.com", "summary": ""}
