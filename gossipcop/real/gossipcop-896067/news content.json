She added a pic of herself with Tristan and their daughter, captioning it, \u201cTrue and I were hungry.\u201d\n\nIn her last picture of the day, the reality star appeared to be wearing a Cleveland Cavaliers T-shirt in support of the team her beau plays for.\n\nThe festivities came as the cheating scandal surrounding Thompson \u2014 who was spotted being unfaithful to Kardashian just two days before she gave birth to their first child together \u2014 has been unraveling in recent episodes of the E! reality show.\n\nKardashian could be heard referring to Thompson as \u201ca complete piece of s\u2013t,\u201d as she got heated during one episode.\n\nSister Kim Kardashian opened up to Ellen DeGeneres on Wednesday, November 21, and revealed that it\u2019s been uncomfortable for the couple to relive the drama.\n\n\u201cIt is awkward, especially for maybe Tristan, who isn\u2019t used to this,\u201d the Selfish author, 38, said. \u201cUnfortunately, that was what [was] going on in our lives. So six months later when it replays \u2014 and [he and Khlo\u00e9 have] gotten through what they needed to get through \u2014 and it\u2019s rehashed in front of everyone and everyone\u2019s giving their opinions all over again and we\u2019re live-tweeting and everyone\u2019s chiming in. So that is hard for Khlo\u00e9 and I\u2019m sure for Tristan, but it\u2019s our reality.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/khloe-k-tristan-thanksgiving.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1333px%2C753px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/khloe-k-tristan-thanksgiving.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/khloe-k-tristan-thanksgiving.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-spend-thanksgiving-together/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian, Tristan Thompson Spend Thanksgiving Together", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson spent Thanksgiving together on Thursday, November 22, as the athlete's cheating scandal is unfolding on Keeping Up With the Kardashians \u2014 details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tristan Calls Khloe a 'Fine Ass Chef' on Thanksgiving After Cheating Scandal Airs on TV", "description": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson spent Thanksgiving together on Thursday, November 22, as the athlete's cheating scandal is unfolding on Keeping Up With the Kardashians \u2014 details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-spend-thanksgiving-together/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-23T15:08:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/khloe-k-tristan-thanksgiving.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/khloe-k-tristan-thanksgiving.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-11-23T15:03:58+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-23T15:08:16+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tristan Calls Khloe a 'Fine Ass Chef' on Thanksgiving After Cheating Scandal Airs on TV", "description": "Khloe Kardashian and Tristan Thompson spent Thanksgiving together on Thursday, November 22, as the athlete's cheating scandal is unfolding on Keeping Up With the Kardashians \u2014 details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/khloe-k-tristan-thanksgiving.jpg?crop=0px%2C115px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542985438.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
