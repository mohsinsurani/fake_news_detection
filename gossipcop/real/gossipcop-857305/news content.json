The Oscar winner completely nailed Jimmy Fallon\u2019s hilarious Random Genre Generator music game during an appearance on The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon on Thursday, May 25.\n\nAs explained by the talk-show host, the game pairs a hit song with a random musical genre that the player then has to attempt to perform.\n\nFallon went first and took on the challenge of performing The Weeknd\u2019s \u201cCan\u2019t Feel My Face\u201d as a \u201850s crooner.\n\nFoxx was up next and performed \u201cWho Let the Dogs Out?\u201d as a Broadway musical, but it was his rendition of Rihanna\u2019s \u201cBitch Better Have My Money\u201d as an opera song that should have him winning another award.\n\nThe actor is no stranger to singing. Foxx earned his first Oscar for portraying Ray Charles in the 2004 musical biographical movie Ray. Foxx also has five studio albums to date.\n\nWatch the hilarious \u2014 and truly amazing \u2014 moment above!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jamie-foxx-fallon-66a9e483-c364-4c50-b6d3-8723bbcefb37.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1721px%2C904px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jamie-foxx-fallon-66a9e483-c364-4c50-b6d3-8723bbcefb37.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1721px%2C904px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jamie-foxx-sings-bitch-better-have-my-money-as-an-opera-song-watch-w484573/", "title": "Jamie Foxx Sings \u2018Bitch Better Have My Money\u2019 As an Opera Song: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jamie Foxx completely killed Jimmy Fallon\u2019s Random Genre Generator game on Thursday, May 25 \u2014 watch", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "You Have to Watch Jamie Foxx Sing \u2018Bitch Better Have My Money\u2019 As Opera", "description": "Jamie Foxx completely killed Jimmy Fallon\u2019s Random Genre Generator game on Thursday, May 25 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jamie-foxx-sings-bitch-better-have-my-money-as-an-opera-song-watch-w484573/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:03:03+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jamie-foxx-fallon-66a9e483-c364-4c50-b6d3-8723bbcefb37.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1721px%2C904px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jamie-foxx-fallon-66a9e483-c364-4c50-b6d3-8723bbcefb37.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1721px%2C904px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-05-26T18:40:06+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:03:03+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "You Have to Watch Jamie Foxx Sing \u2018Bitch Better Have My Money\u2019 As Opera", "description": "Jamie Foxx completely killed Jimmy Fallon\u2019s Random Genre Generator game on Thursday, May 25 \u2014 watch", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jamie-foxx-fallon-66a9e483-c364-4c50-b6d3-8723bbcefb37.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1721px%2C904px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495824006.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
