The are zillions of products targeted at making your skin beautiful and flawless, just think about it: toners, cleansers, face masks, sunscreens, moisturizers, creams and more.\n\nAll these products promise to make your skin brighter and blemish-free as they feature all kinds of magical transforming properties at very expensive costs, of course.\n\nAfter a typical morning routine, women have at least four to five layers of products on their skin, and this is not a surprising thing these days.\n\nOnce you add up all the ingredients from these products\u2019 compositions, you would be very surprised by how many substances and chemicals you put on your face.\n\nAccording to Miss USA, Kara McCullough, it\u2019s time to dial it back and use simpler products.\n\nThe contest winner and scientist is very aware of all the things that she puts on her skin and face.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m usually a naturalista when it comes to skin care. I do believe in a getting a thorough cleansing every now and then, like a good facial,\u201d she admitted during an interview with E! News.\n\n\u201cI try to stay away from products that are heavy in chemicals like sulfur.\u201d\n\nEven if Miss USA 2017 is a symbol of American beauty, Kara\u2019s skin care routine is remarkably relatable and also backed by her education in science.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve learned that [anti-bacterial soap] is actually more effective for me than most facial cleansers. An anti-bacterial soap, like Dial, is really good for clearing acne,\u201d she said.\n\nShe also considers that \u201cA lot of people don\u2019t know that blemishes stem from bacteria. I use anti-bacteria ointments, as well.\u201d\n\nAfter the pageant winner normally washes her face during her morning hot shower, she said that she steps out of the shower and rinses her face with cold water because this has an effect of closing the pores.\n\nWe really believe that for only $5, it\u2019s worth putting the beauty tip to the test.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo, what do you think? Is she doing it right? Are you ready for your Miss USA-inspired beautiful skin?
