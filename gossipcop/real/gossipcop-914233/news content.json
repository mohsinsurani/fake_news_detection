{"url": "https://parade.com/653264/paulettecohn/the-arrangement-star-christine-evangelista-ponders-the-question-is-love-enough/", "text": "Josh Henderson as Kyle West and Christine Evangelista as Megan Morrison\n\nThe Arrangement returns for its second season in the aftermath of Megan's (Christine Evangelista) forced trip to the Facility, the result of which makes her even more determined now to burn down the Institute For The Higher Mind and destroy its leader Terence Anderson (Michael Vartan). But at the same time, she doesn't want to do anything that might be damaging to Kyle (Josh Henderson), because, despite everything, she still loves him.\n\n\"Megan doesn\u2019t want to leave Kyle because she loves him, but she also can\u2019t leave because Terence will blacklist her career at the very least, so she\u2019s pulled in all these directions,\" Evangelista tells Parade.com in this exclusive interview. \"She has to be the perfect girlfriend. She has to be the perfect actress. She has to be the perfect model for the Institute, which is something that she does not believe in at all, and she has to live with herself at the end of the day. Being all these different people at once really causes so much stress and that manifests itself in her body, which we see in the first couple episodes. She doesn\u2019t have any release because she doesn\u2019t have anyone to release to.\"\n\nThe 10 episode season, premiering Sunday on E!, will delve more into the darker side of fame, as it features Kyle and Megan's wedding plans, and the couple as they prepare for a movie project that could define both their careers.\n\nWhen we return, it seems as if Megan is suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome.\n\nTotally. Everything that happened with Megan has changed her. Coming out of what she experienced last season as we saw her in those later scenes, she has to put on this game face to placate the people around her. She experienced so much stress and trauma and is feeling symptoms of rage, even, and distrust now in her partner.\n\nYou mentioned she doesn\u2019t want to leave Kyle because she loves him, but can she forgive him? He put her through hell by having her go through the IHM program. Does she love him enough to get past that?\n\nThat\u2019s the thing. Is love enough? But I also think that you and I wouldn\u2019t sign a contract marriage. People have a tendency to justify things in a certain way and, I think, this is a question that she asks quite literally throughout the season. Like how can I love someone that did what he did? She\u2019s earnestly asking that question because she has to constantly re-evaluate.\n\nAt some point, she really does think that he\u2019s been brainwashed by Terence, so she wants to bring him out of the Institute, but then on another hand, she\u2019s like, \"Well, I don\u2019t know if I can trust you to begin with.\" It\u2019s a constant tug of war that she\u2019s playing throughout the season and we do question is love enough to hold these two characters together?\n\nNow, don\u2019t forget these are both very flawed individuals. They both have a very dark past, so that\u2019s a bonding factor between the two of them. That\u2019s something that really unifies them. At this point, Kyle\u2019s the only person aside from Terence that knows what happened to Megan. Stockholm syndrome. That\u2019s a real thing and something that, I think, Megan is battling throughout the season. You\u2019ll be very surprised to see how it ends. I think also very proud. I was very proud.\n\nThe creators have said this show isn\u2019t based on any one person\u2019s life, but the reality is that these types of contracts do exist in real life.\n\nTotally.\n\nWhat have you been told about them?\n\nThere\u2019s NDA. I\u2019ve heard a lot of people having non-disclosure contracts in work relationships. There's prenuptial agreements. People draw up contracts to protect themselves, to protect their assets, and to protect their privacy, so I think the idea of contracts is very real. It\u2019s just in many different forms, but I have not experienced a relationship with someone where they\u2019ve given me a contract, even if it was just something as simple as an NDA.\n\nBut of course, you hear about it. Being on the television show, people come up to you all the time and talk about it. People talk about people that they know that have experienced it in certain arrangements. People talk about contracts being real. It\u2019s very exciting to be on a television show that\u2019s touching upon these things first. There\u2019s never really been a show that talks about arranged marriages in Hollywood.\n\nAt the end of Season 1, Megan says, \"I\u2019m going to burn IHM down,\" so we come back with her wanting to do that. Do you think she can outwit Terence? He isn\u2019t a stupid man and she doesn't have a lot of resources like he does.\n\nIs it possible for one person to take down a patriarchy? Or is it possible to cause some uproar or movement? It\u2019s very clear she\u2019s not going to be able to do this on her own. The question is, who\u2019s going to help her? Who\u2019s going to give her information to expose the corruption within the Institute? That\u2019s something that we explore throughout the season. Also at some point, she realizes it\u2019s not something that she can take on.\n\nThings like this take years to do and time, obviously, is not on this young woman\u2019s side. It\u2019s a very complicated situation that she\u2019s in. How is she going to do it? And if she does it, she\u2019d be hurting Kyle in the process. It\u2019s not just taking down the Institute. There will inevitably be collateral damage and that\u2019s something that she is constantly taking into consideration.\n\nYou would think that by now Kyle would have had enough indoctrination and knowledge to be able to do it on his own. Does he really need Terence anymore?\n\nYou would think so, but people develop co-dependent relationships. We see it a lot. I think in real life we often find ourselves asking: Why is that person still with them? I think that various religions and other organizations seem so peculiar to us, so unbelievable to us, and we can\u2019t imagine why someone would stay there, but I think the power of co-dependency is real.\n\nAnd I think when you have as many demons as these characters have, you really believe that you can\u2019t do it on your own. I think Kyle's world is very, very big and that\u2019s overwhelming. It's why you often need a team of people around, people that you can trust, and these people find it hard to trust someone. That could also leave you in the wrong person\u2019s hands, but I think this is something that we ask all the time in life. Why are they still with them? We just don\u2019t see things objectively when we\u2019re in it.\n\nRight. And when you\u2019re in it, you\u2019re emotionally involved as well, so it\u2019s not just logic.\n\nThat\u2019s what I say about this second season also. In the first season, Megan leads with her heart. Her heart is what gets her in the situation with Kyle, but in Season 2, she\u2019s\u2019 objective enough to lead with her mind and that takes this whole season to a very different place than it started off.\n\nExcept there\u2019s this one moment that I thought she was leading with her heart. This is the season of their wedding, and when she put on the wedding dress, it seemed as if she might get swept up in the magic of a big wedding, or is that for show?\n\nThat\u2019s the question and that is something that I really toyed with. She does have an emotional reaction to trying on the wedding dress, but what does that mean? Is it because she\u2019s trying on a dress that she had no part in choosing? Is it because all of this is beyond her control, or is she sad for the love lost?\n\nThen she turns around and she sees her friend\u2026there\u2019s that moment of like, \"Okay, if this is how it\u2019s going to happen for me then maybe I should enjoy it.\" But, I think, deep down there\u2019s many layers to what she\u2019s feeling in the moment.\n\nI think there\u2019s something that happens with women in general when you put on a white dress. Something happened to me when I put on the white dress, I\u2019ll tell you that, but it\u2019s so much more than just that one moment. It\u2019s what you\u2019ve imagined your whole life. Putting on that dress, finding your partner, and having a magical moment and, despite the situation, she\u2019s having a magical moment.\n\nDid you yourself have any input into what your wedding dress would look like?\n\nA hundred percent. It was super weird. I don\u2019t think this has ever happened in the history of wedding dresses, but my costume designer and I went to a wedding store and we were going through racks looking for the dress. We\u2019re trying to pick a dress that Megan would like, but not necessarily one that Megan chose, because the Institute has influence on everything. They obviously picked the wedding dress.\n\nAnd the first dress I tried on is the dress we chose. I tried on one dress. I never put on another one and we purchased that dress and the two of us worked to deconstruct it to make something, which you\u2019ll see in the finale, and I\u2019ve never seen done before. That\u2019s obviously not influenced by Megan, but definitely more of the Institute\u2019s influence on her. It was very important for us to have this not be something that Megan is making on her own.\n\nIs this a cautionary tale about the price of fame? Does it make you rethink your career in terms of what you want for your life?\n\nThere\u2019s lots of things that happen and I often catch myself thinking, \"What would I do if I was faced with this? Like what would I do if I couldn\u2019t leave the house?\" Of course, there are sacrifices that you make within this thing called fame. Not necessarily being an actress, I think. Being an actress, I can still continue to work. I can make good projects. I don\u2019t necessarily have to sacrifice my life for it, but when you embark on a relationship like Kyle and Megan are in, there are things that you have to just let go of in your day-to-day life. Myself, I\u2019ve been working through my own merit and through this meritocracy I\u2019ve gotten The Arrangement.\n\nThat\u2019s not the path Megan chose. She took, I guess, we\u2019ll call it a shortcut and is marrying a man that changed her career access overnight. She has to prove herself through that and continue to be a good actress, a mysterious actress, but I think there are just choices off the bat that I haven\u2019t made and I wouldn\u2019t make.\n\nSeason 2 of The Arrangement premieres Sunday, March 11 at 9 p.m. ET/PT on E!", "images": ["https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODY0ODQwNDM4NTIzMTAx/stranger-things-quotes.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTcxNTYzNzI5MDM2NDY0/goodnight-mommy.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc4NjkxMTA3NzI3MjI4/maxresdefault-1.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/t_share/MTkwNTc4NDI2NDEwNTc0OTcz/the-arrangement.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNDcxODI2MjM0ODc3MjU0/hellraiser-pinhead-jamie-clayton-hulu.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc4NjkxMTA3NzI3MjI4/maxresdefault-1.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc1OTIzMjUzMTU5MDM3/halle.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/MTg5NTUwNzMyMjcyMjE1NjM2/parade-logo-hamburger.svg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc1OTIzMjUzMTU5MDM3/halle.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/MTg5NzMxMjY4MjY5NzEyNjEw/parade-logo-nav-140w.svg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODcwMTM1MDU5NDU3NzQ0/jumanji-the-next-level-uk-film-premiere---red-carpet-arrivals.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_60%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_600/MTg5NTQ5Njk0NzY5MTc4MjA5/parade-logo-footer-275x60.svg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODAwMTY0NjczNDk2Nzg0/luckiest-girl-alive-mila-kunis.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNzk3MDczMTAyMzQ5NTMz/gettyimages-1426022223.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTcxNTYzNzI5MDM2NDY0/goodnight-mommy.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODY5MjAzMzE5OTg5OTY4/mindy-kaling.jpg"], "top_img": "https://parade.com/.image/t_share/MTkwNTc4NDI2NDEwNTc0OTcz/the-arrangement.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paulette Cohn"], "canonical_link": "https://parade.com/653264/paulettecohn/the-arrangement-star-christine-evangelista-ponders-the-question-is-love-enough/", "title": "The Arrangement Star Christine Evangelista Ponders the Question: Is Love Enough?", "meta_data": {"author": "Paulette Cohn", "description": "The Arrangement returns for its second season in the aftermath of Megan's (Christine Evangelista) forced trip to the Facility, the result of which makes her", "keywords": "actor,Entertainment", "section": "Entertainment", "pagetype": "article", "companies": "The Arrangement", "tags": "actor", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "item-id": "ci02a512179003247d", "published": "2018-03-09T17:05:41Z", "dcterms.dateCopyrighted": 2022, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@paulette49", "url": "https://parade.com/653264/paulettecohn/the-arrangement-star-christine-evangelista-ponders-the-question-is-love-enough/", "image": "https://parade.com/.image/t_share/MTkwNTc4NDI2NDEwNTc0OTcz/the-arrangement.jpg", "description": "The Arrangement returns for its second season in the aftermath of Megan's (Christine Evangelista) forced trip to the Facility, the result of which makes her", "domain": "parade.com"}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://parade.com/653264/paulettecohn/the-arrangement-star-christine-evangelista-ponders-the-question-is-love-enough/", "title": "The Arrangement Star Christine Evangelista Ponders the Question: Is Love Enough?", "description": "The Arrangement returns for its second season in the aftermath of Megan's (Christine Evangelista) forced trip to the Facility, the result of which makes her", "image": "https://parade.com/.image/t_share/MTkwNTc4NDI2NDEwNTc0OTcz/the-arrangement.jpg", "site_name": "Parade: Entertainment, Recipes, Health, Life, Holidays"}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "false", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Parade: Entertainment, Recipes, Health, Life, Holidays", "parsely-title": "The Arrangement Star Christine Evangelista Ponders the Question: Is Love Enough?
