In an interview with W magazine, the 48-year-old actress revealed that her secret to smooth, glowing skin isn\u2019t a beauty product gifted from the gods, but a serum made primarily of pumpkin.\n\nSpeaking to W, Zeta-Jones called Rhonda Allison\u2019s Pumpkin E Serum one of her \u201cmakeup miracles.\u201d She also has the facts to back it up. The fall favorite boasts several health benefits, including powerful antioxidants, nutrients, and enzymes that increase cell turnover and smooth and brighten skin.\n\nAlong with moisturizing with pumpkin, Zeta-Jones also follows an alcohol-free diet to keep her skin clean and taut. \u201cWater, maintaining my PH balance, no alcohol and through diet keeping my body free of any inflammation inside and out, she said.\n\nAnd though she\u2019s big on beauty (her favorite products include MAC\u2019s Spice Lip Liner, Marc Jacobs\u2019s Slow Burn Lipstick, and Cl\u00e9 de Peau Intensive Eye Contour Cream), Zeta-Jones admits that \u201cnothing can be done properly in five minutes,\u201d which is probably why she likes to keep her skin extra healthy.\n\nUnlike pumpkin spice lattes, the best thing about Zeta-Jones\u2019s pumpkin serum is that you can whip it out year-round without fear of looking #basic.
