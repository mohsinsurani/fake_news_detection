She was named as Team USA\u2019s first alternate.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Even Olympians Have Bad Days! Figure Skater Ashley Wagner Shares What Keeps Her Going\n\nWagner previously opened up to PEOPLE about what it would have meant to get to compete in the Pyeongchang Olympics as a 26-year-old woman.\n\n\u201cTo be a 26-year-old woman on the ice is an achievement in this sport because you\u2019re working against a lot of different things,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I got to Pyeongchang, I will be the oldest U.S. female figure skating athlete since 1924 or something like that \u2014 so I think it really goes to show that my longevity is something that\u2019s very, very rare. And I\u2019m really proud of that, and it\u2019s because I\u2019m so freakin\u2019 stubborn.\u201d\n\nAnd while the road to Pyeongchang was not always easy for the three-time national champion, Wagner never lost sight of her goal.\n\n\u201cI think that if anyone tells you that they\u2019ve been that hungry every single day of their career, they\u2019re not being honest,\u201d Wagner added. \u201cYou have days where you don\u2019t want to train. I mean, I\u2019ve been skating for 22 years \u2014 this absolutely gets old. But it\u2019s one of those things where I set a goal when I was 6, 7 years old and I owe it to that little girl \u2026 to see this through.\u201d\n\nStreeter Lecka/Getty\n\nThe 2018 Games, beginning on Feb. 8, would have been Wagner\u2019s third Olympic experience. In addition to receiving a bronze medal at the team-skating event at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi, she was a first alternate at the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver.\n\nThe three women who were chosen to compete for the United States in Pyeongchang next month are Bradie Tennell, Karen Chen and Mirai Nagasu \u2014 the figure skater who Wagner beat out for a spot on the Olympic team in 2014.",
