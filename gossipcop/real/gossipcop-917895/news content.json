Luv u, thank u so much for having me #TellMeYouLoveMeTour (sic),\" Fergie tweeted on Saturday.\n\nKhaled surprised fans during his set by bringing out special guests including Sean \u2018Diddy\u2019 Combs, Tinashe, Jaden Smith and Chris Brown.\n\nFergie's ex-husband Josh Duhamel opened up about her National Anthem backlash during a recent appearance on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, insisting that it wouldn't be long before fans would see Fergie bounce back.\n\n\"It\u2019s hard to see somebody you care about get beat up like that,\" he explained. \"But that\u2019s the business. You\u2019re in this business, you put yourself out there. Sometimes you win and sometimes you don\u2019t.\n\n\"Trust me, she\u2019s fine. She is about as resilient as they come.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.music-news.com/images/news/cover/111511.jpg", "http://www.music-news.com/Content/Images/newsletter-signup.gif"], "top_img": "http://www.music-news.com/images/news/cover/111511.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/111511/Fergie-returns-to-the-stage-after-National-Anthem-fiasco", "title": "Fergie returns to the stage after National Anthem fiasco", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Fergie returns to the stage after National Anthem fiasco - The Number One music magazine feat. band & artist news, reviews, interviews, videos & gossip UK & worldwide.", "keywords": "Fergie returns to the stage after National Anthem fiasco - music, news, music news,music-news reviews, Alternative, indie, metal, dance, hardcore, rock, pop, artists, audio, video, classic, hip hop, rap, soul, r&b, lennon, ash, sex pistols, radiohead, blur, hendrix, oasis, muzik, underworld, Limp Bizkit, Backstreet Boys,  U2, Korn,  Eminem,  *NSYNC,  Madonna,  Radiohead,  Marilyn Manson,  Pearl Jam, Britney Spears ,  Nelly , Metallica , Christina Aguilera , Prince, Blink-182,  Blur, Oasis, Travis, REM, Smashing Pumpkins, Manics, Supergrass, Pulp, Beck, Nirvana, Stereophonics, Beatles, U2, Foo Fighters, Suede, Stone Roses, Moby, David Bowie, Prodigy, top, fifty, 100, albums, singles, live, films, books, quotes, competitions, webcasts, webchats, radio, E-cards, angst, gigs, tickets, buy tickets, concerts, Real Audio, Microsoft media player, magazine, free, e-mail, email, shop, my, Cds, Cd's, Cd, contests, hits", "google-site-verification": "bDOS26sz2s-cSAyT3mz9xz63qHr4jxrYbQcimMBBXAw", "verification": "59ce4d17a6a39ea29e3fa8dae1d51917", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Music-News.com", "application-name": "Music-News.com", "msapplication-TileColor": "#231f20", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Content/Images/Favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "/Content/Images/Favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"site_name": "Music-News.com", "image": "/images/news/cover/111511.jpg", "url": "https://www.music-news.com/news/UK/111511/Fergie-returns-to-the-stage-after-National-Anthem-fiasco", "title": "Fergie returns to the stage after National Anthem fiasco", "description": "The former Black Eyed Peas singer stirred up controversy after her soulful rendition of the Star-Spangled Banner at the NBA All-Star Game last month."}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.music-news.com", "summary": ""}
