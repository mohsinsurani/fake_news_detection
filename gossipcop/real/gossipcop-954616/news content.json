She is stable, conscious and breathing, the official said.\n\nWhen contacted by CNN on Wednesday, a source close to Lovato denied reports she had been treated for an overdose of heroin.\n\nLovato\u2019s hospitalization comes just weeks after the singer, who has struggled with substance abuse, revealed she had recently suffered a relapse.\n\nThe pop star made the revelation about the setback in a single, \u201cSober,\u201d released late last month.\n\nLovato, who turns 26 next month, said in March that she was celebrating six years of sobriety.\n\nThe singer has spoken candidly in interviews about her use of cocaine and addiction to alcohol, as well as mental health issues and an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cSober\u201d did not reveal the nature of Lovato\u2019s relapse.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again,\u201d Lovato sings in \u201cSober.\u201d \u201cI want to be a role model but I\u2019m only human.\u201d\n\nThe lyrics also include Lovato singing, \u201cI\u2019m sorry that I\u2019m here again. I promise I\u2019ll get help.\u201d\n\nLovato was supposed to appear on the Tuesday night episode of the Fox game show \u201cBeat Shazam,\u201d which is hosted by Jamie Foxx, but a network spokesperson said the show would air a different episode in its place \u201cin light of recent reports.\u201d\n\nLovato taped her guest appearance on the show in December 2017.\n\n\u201cOur thoughts go out to Demi and her family,\u201d Fox said in a statement provided to CNN.\n\nLovato was next scheduled to perform on Thursday in Atlantic City, New Jersey, but her appearance has been canceled, a spokesperson for Live Nation confirmed to CNN.\n\nLovato got her start in entertainment at age ten as a regular on the children\u2019s series \u201cBarney & Friends.\u201d\n\nThat led to guest roles on TV shows like \u201cPrison Break\u201d and \u201cJust Jordan,\u201d followed by Disney Channel\u2019s \u201cAs the Bell Rings.\u201d\n\nLovato\u2019s role as aspiring singer Mitchie Torres in the Disney TV movie \u201cCamp Rock\u201d introduced the world to her musical talent. Her debut album, the pop-rock \u201cDon\u2019t Forget,\u201d released in 2008.\n\nAs a regular on the Disney series \u201cSonny with a Chance,\u201d and Lovato became one of the network\u2019s brightest young stars.\n\nHer second album, \u201cHere We Go Again,\u201d released in 2009.\n\nAfter three seasons on \u201cSonny with a Chance,\u201d Lovato announced she was leaving the show to focus on recording and her third album, \u201cUnbroken.\u201d\n\nShe later had a recurring role on the Fox series \u201cGlee\u201d and served as a judge on the reality singing competition \u201cThe X-Factor\u201d for two seasons.\n\nLovato\u2019s self-titled album, \u201cDemi,\u201d released in 2013. Her albums \u201cConfident,\u201d which earned her a Grammy nomination, and \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d followed.\n\nHer hits like \u201cSkyscraper,\u201d \u201cThis Is Me\u201d (a duet with ex-boyfriend Joe Jonas) and \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d firmly established Lovato as a pop superstar.\n\nLovato\u2019s most recent North American tour leg, which ran from February to April, grossed more than $20 million, according to tracking by Pollstar.\n\nCiting production issues, Lovato postponed the South American portion of her tour in April.\n\nShe last performed July 22 at the California
