The alleged drunk driver rounded a bend when he crossed his pickup truck into oncoming traffic and struck Macklemore\u2019s Mercedes-Benz.\n\nThe alleged drunk driver, who was not wearing a seatbelt, smashed his head into the windshield, leaving him briefly unconscious. He was taken to a local hospital for treatment, and was subsequently charged with a DUI.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRelated Video\n\nOne of Macklemore\u2019s passengers was treated for a minor cut to the head, but all three people walked away from the accident.", "images": ["https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-01-at-12-47-02-pm.png?w=930&h=551&crop=1&resize=1031%2C580&quality=80&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dan-harmon-chevy-chase-community-movie-i-dont-even-know-if-its-legal.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1753966171496536&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hans-Zimmer-photo-by-Lee-Kirby.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-example-preferred_2x.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mike-Patton.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mike-Patton.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/derry-girls-netflix.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/right-said-fred-beyonce-im-too-sexy.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/themes/cosv2/images/c15.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/right-said-fred-beyonce-im-too-sexy.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/legends-white-61x91-1.png?quality=80&resize=330,330", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-01-at-12-47-02-pm.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dan-harmon-chevy-chase-community-movie-i-dont-even-know-if-its-legal.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21854097&c3=&c4=https://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver/&c5=News&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-01-at-12-47-02-pm.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Young"], "canonical_link": "https://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver/", "title": "Macklemore survives head-on collision with drunk driver", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2f2e2a", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 434175690014}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "msvalidate.01": "8CABEAF0C9CE91FCEDBFB11C38206EE5", "description": "The rapper and two of his passengers miraculously escaped almost entirely unharmed.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Macklemore survives head-on collision with drunk driver", "description": "The rapper and two of his passengers miraculously escaped almost entirely unharmed.", "url": "https://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver/", "site_name": "Consequence", "image": {"identifier": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-01-at-12-47-02-pm.png", "width": 930, "height": 551, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/consequence/", "published_time": "2017-08-01T17:50:10+00:00"}, "author": "Alex Young", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@alexyoung", "site": "@consequence"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.9.4", "parsely-title": "Macklemore survives head-on collision with drunk driver", "parsely-link": "http://consequence.net/2017/08/macklemore-survives-head-on-collision-with-drunk-driver/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/screen-shot-2017-08-01-at-12-47-02-pm.png?w=150", "parsely-pub-date": "<span class=\"localtime\" data-ltformat=\"Y-m-d\\TH:i:s\\Z\" data-lttime=\"2017-08-01T17:50:10+00:00\">2017-08-01T17:50:10Z</span>", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-tags": "car crash,drunk driver,hip-hop,rap", "parsely-author": "Alex Young", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cropped-correct-blue.jpg?quality=80&w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501609810.0, "source": "https://consequenceofsound.net", "summary": ""}
