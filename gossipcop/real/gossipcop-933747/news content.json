The report indicated that former NBC News executives were contacted, but did not say whether interviews with those executives had taken place.\n\nFollowing the release of Wednesday\u2019s report, the woman who accused Mr. Brokaw, Linda Vester, wrote an op-ed column in The Post that criticized NBC for relying on its own in-house counsel.\n\n\u201cI want NBC to stop fighting #MeToo within its own walls,\u201d Ms. Vester wrote. \u201cI ask NBCUniversal to retain an outside investigator to look into sexual harassment and any coverup of sexual harassment at NBC News.\u201d\n\nAn advocacy group that grew out of the #MeToo movement, Press Forward, also issued a statement describing the nature of NBC\u2019s review as \u201can inherent conflict of interest.\u201d The group, which is focused on improving workplace environments for women in the media industry, added, \u201cNo one is going to be fully candid when speaking to management for fear of losing their jobs.\u201d\n\nIf there was criticism to be found in the NBC report, it came in an assessment of NBC News\u2019s human resources operation. The investigators found it \u201ctroubling\u201d that no formal complaints had been filed about Mr. Lauer despite his engaging in sexual relationships with subordinates. The report found that network staff members were fearful of retaliation and did not feel confident that their complaints would be kept confidential, in part because human resources managers occupied glass-walled offices in full view of other NBC News employees.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/business/nbc-1/nbc-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=87b7a9b2d25e64ff6636b8a3cbc3667b6f49cfb2a2db5d8064b9d202e16eca7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/business/nbc-1/nbc-1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/05/09/business/nbc-1/nbc-1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=87b7a9b2d25e64ff6636b8a3cbc3667b6f49cfb2a2db5d8064b9d202e16eca7d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael M.
