That being said, the Fourth of July is right around the corner, which means big sales across all categories.\n\n\u201cThree-day weekends are always good for pricey items like mattresses and furniture,\u201d says Trae Bodge, a smart shopping expert. Not only can you expect to save on big-ticket items, but there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll run into some extra savings this year as well.\n\nAccording to Bodge, as a result of changing pandemic shopping habits and supply chain disruptions, some larger retailers are sitting on overstocks in certain categories, including furniture, TVs, and apparel. She predicts that some retailers will discount certain items in addition to sales they already had planned in an effort to clear out inventory. In addition to overstock sales, \u201csomething new this year could be sales that take aim at price hikes,\u201d says Bodge. \u201cBrands that can afford to decrease their prices instead of increase could use this tactic to set themselves apart and gain new price-conscious customers.\u201d\n\nNow\u2019s the time to take advantage of this year\u2019s deals. And if your holiday weekend is already full of barbecues and beach days, leaving you little time to shop, don\u2019t worry. These stores are open on the Fourth of July, which is on a Monday this year.\n\nFourth of July Patio Furniture and Grill Sales\n\nThe Home Depot\n\nFrom now through July 4, you can score major savings on patio furniture and grills at The Home Depot.
