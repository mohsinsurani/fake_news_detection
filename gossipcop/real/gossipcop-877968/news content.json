Just ask his older brother Alexander.\n\nThe younger Skarsg\u00e5rd made his big debut at at the Hollywood premiere of Andy Muschietti's It, in which he portrays the creepy sewer-dwelling Pennywise the Dancing Clown, and his older brothers Alexander, 41, and Gustaf, 36, were there to cheer him on. Just look how proud they are of their little bro.\n\nThey are presenting him to the Hollywood elite as if he's the heir to the Skarsg\u00e5rd throne. (Sorry, Valter. You're still my underrated fave.)\n\nBut Alexander, whom you probably know from True Blood or Tarzan or Big Little Lies, also took the opportunity to try and \"scare\" his baby brother on the red carpet. After all, as the oldest Skarsg\u00e5rd (there are six of them), it is his duty to terrorize his younger siblings, especially at fancy Hollywood functions.\n\nBill, on the other hand, looks completely unfazed by his brother's antics.\n\nIsn't that right, Bill?\n\nYep. He's totally used to this.\n\nThis is just an average Tuesday for Bill.\n\nTotally normal. (Let's take a second to recognize Gustaf for his unwavering support in the wake of his older brother's nonsense.)\n\nWhen you grow up in the Skarsg\u00e5rd household, you develop an immunity to jump scares and public humiliation. Then again, when you grow up in the Skarsg\u00e5rd household, you're also guaranteed to be at least 6'4\" and look like this:\n\nSeems like a fair trade-off.", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:79ad7f25-c2ed-4cf9-a1ba-6e57be5286f5?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:ddeff14e-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c45b759e-5caf-44a0-a5f1-07d21156312b?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:af26ecc9-8660-466d-954d-47a5d29bbd2d?quality=0.7"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:ddeff14e-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mtv.com/news/ys3908/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The 'It' Premiere", "meta_data": {"app_version": "d8d613330-2688-2022-10-07", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd supported his little brother Bill Skarsg\u00e5rd at the Hollywood premiere of 'It.'", "original-source": "https://www.mtv.com/news/ys3908/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere", "search": {"title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The 'It' Premiere", "description": "You can't scare Pennywise the Dancing Clown!!!", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:ddeff14e-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7", "imageHeight": 2452, "imageWidth": 3616, "url": "/news/ys3908/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-09-06T14:14:01.000Z"}, "og": {"site_name": "MTV", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:ddeff14e-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "description": "You can't scare Pennywise the Dancing Clown!!!", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The 'It' Premiere", "url": "https://www.mtv.com/news/ys3908/alexander-skarsgard-scare-brother-bill-it-premiere", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "You can't scare Pennywise the Dancing Clown!!!", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd Tried (And Failed) To Scare His Little Brother Bill At The 'It' Premiere", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:ddeff14e-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.com", "summary": ""}
