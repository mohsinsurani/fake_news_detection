Nicky Hilton is expecting her second child with her husband, James Rothschild, and she told Us Weekly exclusively that the couple won\u2019t be having a gender reveal party anytime soon.\n\nAt the Samsung Annual Charity Gala in New York City on Thursday, November 2, Hilton, 34, told Us that they\u2019re choosing not to find out the sex of the baby, but that she does have a preference. \u201cYou know what? I would be happy with either but I love having a sister. With a sister, you have a best friend for life,\u201d she told Us, referring to her relationship with her sister, Paris Hilton. \u201cBut a boy would be really cute, too. I\u2019m thrilled with whatever.\u201d\n\nHilton and the banking heir welcomed their daughter, Lily Grace Victoria, in July 2016. The fashion designer revealed that her 15-month-old has no clue that another baby is on the way, but she is preparing her by getting her the right toys. \u201cI bought her a doll and she loves her doll. It\u2019s her baby and it goes everywhere with her,\u201d she said about her daughter. \u201cShe feeds her baby a bottle. She tried to put her baby in the bath with her tonight.\u201d\n\nThe Hilton family is breaking their holiday tradition this year to be by the socialite\u2019s side during the pregnancy. \u201cThe whole family is going to come out to New York for the baby,\u201d she told Us. \u201cAnd the holidays. We\u2019ll do the holidays here. We\u2019re usually all in L.A. But I can\u2019t fly, so everyone\u2019s coming to me!\u201d\n\nSince the baby\u2019s gender is unknown, Hilton doesn\u2019t want any presents and plans to use everything from the first time around. As for the dad-to-be, Rothschild is ready for his second baby. \u201cHe\u2019s very, very hands-on and very helpful with the baby. He\u2019s a great dad,\u201d she told Us.\n\nHilton and Rothschild got engaged in August 2014 in Lake Como, Italy, during a getaway and they tied the knot at Kensington Palace in London in July 2015.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/830808720_nicky-hilton-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/830808720_nicky-hilton-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/830808720_nicky-hilton-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nicky-hilton-shares-how-shes-preparing-for-baby-no-2/", "title": "Nicky Hilton Shares How She's Preparing For Baby No. 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Nicky Hilton tells Us Weekly how she is preparing for her second child and whether she wants a boy or a girl \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nicky Hilton Shares How She's Preparing for Baby No. 2", "description": "Nicky Hilton tells Us Weekly how she is preparing for her second child and whether she wants a boy or a girl \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/nicky-hilton-shares-how-shes-preparing-for-baby-no-2/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-11-06T23:42:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/830808720_nicky-hilton-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/830808720_nicky-hilton-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-06T23:50:31+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-06T23:42:43+00:00"}, "author": "Karla Rodriguez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Nicky Hilton Shares How She's Preparing for Baby No. 2", "description": "Nicky Hilton tells Us Weekly how she is preparing for her second child and whether she wants a boy or a girl \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/830808720_nicky-hilton-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510012231.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
