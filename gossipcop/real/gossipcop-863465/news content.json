Watch a clip below.\n\nOver dinner Michael asks Ben why he doesn\u2019t get along with the other guys in the house. Ben says he\u2019s not focused on making friends but rather wants to get to know Desiree, which she seems to appreciate.\n\nLater, when Desiree asks the guys about family traditions, Ben says he wants to go to church every Sunday with his family. But Michael calls him out, saying he didn\u2019t attend an Easter service in Germany when all the other men did go.\n\n\u201cEvery other guy was there except for you,\u201d an irritated Michael says. \u201cI thought that was odd.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Ben decides to excuse himself.\n\n\u201cI feel so uncomfortable being in the middle of Ben and Michael,\u201d Desiree says. \u201cI may want to let both of them go.\u201d", "images":
