But the ending leaves the fate of many characters up in the air, and the characters spared face an uncertain road ahead.\n\nThat doesn't mean there's no hope left, however. With \"Captain Marvel\" and an \"Infinity War\" sequel coming next May, and \"Black Panther\" and \"Spider-Man: Homecoming\" sequels already planned, the MCU shows no signs of slowing down.\n\nMarvel's comic books provide a glimpse into the MCU's possibilities going forward, and Disney's acquisition of Fox assets could potentially mean the arrival of characters we have yet to see in the MCU.\n\nBusiness Insider evaluates the future of the MCU post-\"Infinity War\" below:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E",
