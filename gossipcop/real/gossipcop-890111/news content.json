(The theaters where both of the Broadway shows \u2014 which are actually both directed by Zaks \u2014 are located right next to each other.)\n\n\u201cOh Amy,\u201d he says while laughing. \u201cI\u2019ma love you. I\u2019ma love you.\u201d\n\nSchumer captioned the photo, \u201cI love our director Jerry Zaks very much.
