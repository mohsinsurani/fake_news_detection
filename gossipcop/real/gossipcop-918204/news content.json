So here\u2019s what we\u2019re going to do. Not saying you shouldn\u2019t give a long speech, but whoever gives the shortest speech tonight will go home with \u2014 Johnny, tell them what they\u2019ll win.\u201d\n\nCue the curtain opening to reveal the jet ski, presented by Helen Mirren.\n\n\u201cI will be timing you. I have a stopwatch,\u201d he added.\n\nThe running gag ran throughout the evening, and was referenced by several winners. \u201cObviously I\u2019m not going to win the ski,\u201d joked Gary Oldman during his speech for Darkest Hour.\n\nAt the end of the ceremony Kimmel revealed that Phantom Thread costume designer Mark Bridges won the prize, with his speech clocking in at around 30 seconds long.\n\nBridges, who looked somewhat embarrassed, posed with Mirren, the jet ski and the life jacket on stage as the show concluded.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1787080818148630&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.screendaily.com/magazine/dest/graphics/logo/print_logo.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=3254793074533493&ev=PageView\n&noscript=1", "https://d1nslcd7m2225b.cloudfront.net/Pictures/450xAny/P/web/j/b/m/2021screenpackshot_967117.jpg", "https://d1nslcd7m2225b.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/2/9/1278929_helen-mirren-mark-bridges-jet-ski-valerie-durrant-ampas.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAMAAAACCAQAAAA3fa6RAAAADklEQVR42mNkAANGCAUAACMAA2w/AMgAAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://d1nslcd7m2225b.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/2/9/1278929_helen-mirren-mark-bridges-jet-ski-valerie-durrant-ampas.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Orlando Parfitt"], "canonical_link": "https://www.screendaily.com/news/oscars-2018-mark-bridges-wins-jet-ski-for-shortest-acceptance-speech/5127191.article", "title": "Oscars 2018: Mark Bridges wins jet ski for shortest acceptance speech", "meta_data": {"description": "Phantom Thread costume designer takes home unusual award.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "momentnowdate": "2022-10-08 14:18:23.365", "momentlocale": "en-gb", "momentlocaleformat": "D MMMM YYYY", "momentrelative": "false", "momentrelativeformat": "YYYY,MM,DD", "momentrelativemorethan": 10, "pubdate": "Mon, 05 Mar 2018 09:04 GMT", "blockthis": "blockGA", "showwallpaper": "true", "navcode": 24, "primarynavigation": "News", "og": {"title": "Oscars 2018: Mark Bridges wins jet ski for shortest acceptance speech", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.screendaily.com/news/oscars-2018-mark-bridges-wins-jet-ski-for-shortest-acceptance-speech/5127191.article", "site_name": "Screen", "description": "Phantom Thread costume designer takes home unusual award.", "image": {"identifier": "https://d1nslcd7m2225b.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1024x536/9/2/9/1278929_helen-mirren-mark-bridges-jet-ski-valerie-durrant-ampas.jpg", "alt": "helen mirren mark bridges jet ski valerie durrant ampas"}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Oscars 2018: Mark Bridges wins jet ski for shortest acceptance speech", "description": "Phantom Thread costume designer takes home unusual award.", "image": {"src": "https://d1nslcd7m2225b.cloudfront.net/Pictures/1120xAny/9/2/9/1278929_helen-mirren-mark-bridges-jet-ski-valerie-durrant-ampas.jpg", "alt": "helen mirren mark bridges jet ski valerie durrant ampas"}}, "msapplication-TileImage": "/magazine/dest/graphics/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.screendaily.com", "summary": ""}
