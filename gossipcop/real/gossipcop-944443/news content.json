Since then, Shelton has moved on with No Doubt rocker Gwen Stefani, while Lambert has been cozying up to R&B singer Anderson East. But according to Monroe, all is good in her friends circle.\n\n\n\nWATCH: Gwen Stefani and Blake Shelton Get Romantic at Pre-GRAMMYs Gala\n\nET chatted with the 29-year-old on the red carpet at the 58th Annual GRAMMY Awards in Los Angeles on Monday, where she couldn't stop gushing over Shelton's new girlfriend.\n\n\"I don't know if Blake's going to be here tonight,\" she revealed, adding, \"but if I see Gwen I'm gonna high-five her, because she's awesome.\"\n\n\"I met her when I sang with Blake at The Voice a long time ago, and I'll never forget, she said my voice was 'dope!'\" Monroe recalled. \"And I was like, 'Yeah! That's awesome.'\"\n\nMonroe also told ET she's rooting for Shelton and Stefani to have a lifetime of love.\n\n\"I think that any time you feel that in your heart, then you're a good match, you know,\" she explained. \"You can find someone just like you and it not work. Find someone opposite and it does, and I like that about love.\"\n\nWe couldn't agree more!\n\nSpeaking of love, Joey Feek -- who has been living out her final days in hospice care after ending treatment for colorectal cancer in late October -- and her adoring husband, Rory Feek, were nominated for a GRAMMY for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for \"If I Needed You.\" Monroe and Shelton were also up for the award.\n\nEven though the country-bluegrass duo, who go by Joey + Rory, didn't take home the gramophone (it went to Little Big Town), like Shelton, Monroe was hoping they would.\n\n\"I wholeheartedly agree [with Blake],\" she said. \"Not only is it beautiful to watch how their story has unfolded and see where they're at right now, I would want nothing more than for them to win that. My fingers are crossed for them as well.\"\n\n\n\nWATCH: Blake Shelton Wants Joey and Rory Feek to Win at the GRAMMYS\n\nBlake Shelton Hopes Joey + Rory Win The GRAMMY Over Him This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566846.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-08/GettyImages-1240426139.jpg?h=05c564aa&itok=Dkqb34Us", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/GettyImages-1243560296.jpg?h=27af8da9&itok=n9B1yPno", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567234.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-569095.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1280x720/public/images/2016-02/ashley_monroe_vidpic_021516_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=gQn_pkDI", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-568191.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567067.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567192.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-570584.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2016-02/1280_selena_gomez_510440954.jpg?itok=JEJPUEfC", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566831.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567063.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566844.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-02/ashley_monroe_vidpic_021516_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=IemzAfEp", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567230.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567075.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567077.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566814.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567052.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-570610.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-568004.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566845.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-02/ashley_monroe_vidpic_021516_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=IemzAfEp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Desiree Murphy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/news/182349_ashley_monroe_gives_stamp_of_approval_to_blake_shelton_and_gwen_stefani", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Miranda Lambert's Best Friend Ashley Monroe Gives Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Seal of Approval", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "ET caught up with the country singer at the GRAMMYs, where she couldn't stop gushing over her girl crush, Gwen!", "keywords": "News, Awards, Gwen Stefani, Blake Shelton, Miranda Lambert, Grammys", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/182349_ashley_monroe_gives_stamp_of_approval_to_blake_shelton_and_gwen_stefani", "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Miranda Lambert's Best Friend Ashley Monroe Gives Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Seal of Approval", "description": "ET caught up with the country singer at the GRAMMYs, where she couldn't stop gushing over her girl crush, Gwen!", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-02/ashley_monroe_vidpic_021516_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=IemzAfEp", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "ET caught up with the country singer at the GRAMMYs, where she couldn't stop gushing over her girl crush, Gwen!", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "EXCLUSIVE: Miranda Lambert's Best Friend Ashley Monroe Gives Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani Seal of Approval", "creator": "Desiree Murphy", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/news/182349_ashley_monroe_gives_stamp_of_approval_to_blake_shelton_and_gwen_stefani", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2016-02/ashley_monroe_vidpic_021516_1280Copy2.jpg?itok=IemzAfEp"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
