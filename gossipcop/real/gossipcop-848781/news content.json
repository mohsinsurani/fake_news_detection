It also drew a 1.3 rating in women 25-54. The numbers were good enough to make the show the number one syndicated talk show on Monday in both measurements, topping \u201cDr. Phil\u201d and \u201cEllen.\u201d\n\nRipa and Seacrest announced the surprise choice at the start of Monday\u2019s edition of the show, which Ripa has hosted since early 2001. Seacrest\u2019s move into the seat next to Ripa comes nearly a year after Ripa\u2019s former co-host, Michael Strahan, left the Disney-distributed show for an anchor slot on ABC\u2019s \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d\n\n\u201cRyan is a quintessential broadcaster and at the top of his game,\u201d said Ripa in a statement. \u201cI am thrilled to start my mornings with him every day, and we are so fortunate at \u2018Live\u2019 to have him join the family. Ryan is a close friend and his star shines as brightly off camera as it does on. His tremendous success is only matched by his impeccable reputation. Plainly said, everyone loves him, and so will our daily viewers.\u201d\n\n\u201cLive with Kelly and Ryan\u201d is distributed in national syndication by Disney-ABC Home Entertainment and TV Distribution. The show is produced by WABC-TV in New York and executive produced by Michael Gelman, Ripa, and Seacrest.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/live-with-kelly-ryan.jpg?w=1000", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/live-with-kelly-ryan.jpg?crop=1px%2C0px%2C972px%2C541px&resize=681%2C383"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/live-with-kelly-ryan.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/ryan-seacrests-live-with-kelly-ripa-ratings-1202406403/", "title": "Ryan Seacrest\u2019s \u2018Live With Kelly\u2019 Debut Lifts Series in Monday Ratings", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Ryan Seacrest's debut on \"Live with Kelly,\" now \"Live with Kelly and Ryan,\" lifted the series in the Monday syndication ratings", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202406403, "author": "Joe Otterson", "pmc-category": "News,Ratings", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-05-02T08:16:30"}, "pmc-tag": "Kelly Ripa,Live with Kelly and Ryan,Ryan Seacrest", "title": "Ryan Seacrest\u2019s \u2018Live With Kelly\u2019 Debut Lifts Series in Monday Ratings", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Joe Otterson", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "application-name": "Variety", "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://variety.com/2017/tv/news/ryan-seacrests-live-with-kelly-ripa-ratings-1202406403/?ia_markup=1"}, "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202406403, "title": "Ryan Seacrest's 'Live With Kelly' Debut Lifts Series in Monday Ratings", "published_at": "2017-05-02 08:16:30", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/live-with-kelly-ryan.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 32, "tags": "Ryan Seacrest", "topics": "Ratings", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "Kelly Ripa's announcement that Ryan Seacrest will be the new co-host of \"Live with Kelly\" on Monday lifted the syndicated daytime talk show to strong ratings.\r\n\r\nAccording to Nielsen data, \"Live with Kelly and Ryan,\" as it will now be known, delivered a 3.1 household rating, the show's best delivery in that measurement since its post-Oscar show in February.
