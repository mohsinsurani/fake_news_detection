It\u2019s often associated with moody and mysterious characters. The name peaked in popularity in the early 1990s, with data on Think Baby Names showing an increase in popularity for the name around 1992, before dropping off closer to the millennium. No doubt baby Stormi will revisit the public conscious now that it\u2019s got the Jenner stamp of approval. There are a number of famous celebrities called Stormi, including Stormi Bree Henley, an American model and partner of Lucky Blue Smith, but most are spelt Stormy (with the y). A number of references to storms can be seen throughout music history, including Stormy Monday by TB Walker and Stormy, by Classics IV. Although none mention any Kardashian/Jenner babies, we\u2019ve got no doubt Travis Scott will be dropping a song (or two) about stormy weather very soon. Baby Stormi\u2019s full name isn\u2019t yet confirmed, but as Travis Scott\u2019s real name is actually Jacques Webster, fans are deciding she will be named Stormi Webster. Others are saying Stormi is just it\u2014no last name\u2014and others are saying Jenner will hyphenate for what might be the most famous double-barreled name of the 2020s.\n\nA fan of the name of not, there\u2019s no doubt Kylie Jenner gets us all talking.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180331070701im_/https://cdn.newsapi.com.au/image/v1/a37c9984411aa3560cd1ccf95cd08124",
