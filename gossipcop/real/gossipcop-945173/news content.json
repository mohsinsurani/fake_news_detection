(Photo by Kevin Winter/Getty Images for MTV)\n\nThe 2018 MTV Movie & TV Awards aired on Monday night, and Tiffany Haddish hosted the most entertaining installment ever.\n\nRight from the start, it was clear this show would be a lot blacker than usual, and not only because Haddish was at the helm.\n\nHere are 7 of the best and blackest moment of the night:\n\nBlack Panther Opening.\n\nMTV recreated the incredible challenge for the throne scene in Black Panther and added a few twists. Chadwick Boseman was equally sexy and hilarious as he faced off against Haddish. Lil Rel Howery, Queen Latifah, Angela Bassett, and Jada Pinkett Smith made cameos and had us laughing from jump with jokes like, \u201cYour legs smell good. Like coconut butter and $700 million.\u201d\n\nTiffany Haddish as Cardi B.\n\nHaddish opened the show with her own version of Cardi\u2019s B hit, \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d and it was awesome. Even though the performance left her a bit out of breath, her verses were fantastic. She donned the same style dress Cardi wore for her baby bump reveal on SNL and pretended to get pregnant by looking into Michael B. Jordan\u2018s eyes.\n\nKim Kardashian West continues cultural appropriation tour.\n\nFile this one under one of the \u201cmost shocking\u201d moments because I paused my screen and rewound three times to make sure that my eyes weren\u2019t deceiving me. When Tiffany caddish started teasing the Kardashian family during her opening monologue, the camera panned to some beautiful braids that were unfortunately affixed to Kim\u2019s head. Did she really? Yup.\n\nBlack Panther won big.\n\nThe Ryan Coogler-directed Marvel hit was the big winner of the night, nabbing four awards including \u201cBest Movie.\u201d It\u2019s star, Chadwick Boseman won for \u201cBest Performance in a Movie\u201d and \u201cBest Hero\u201d and Michael B. Jordan took home the trophy for \u201cBest Villain.\u201d\n\nBoseman dedicated his award to the Waffle House Hero.\n\nWhen Chadwick Boseman won the award fro \u201cBest Hero\u201d he took time to honor a real-life hero, James Shaw Jr. He gave the man who disarmed a shooter at a Waffle House the recognition he deserves saying, \u201d \u201cIt\u2019s greater to acknowledge the heroes we have in real life \u2026 He fought off a gunman in Antioch, Tennessee at a Waffle House. He saved lives.\u201d\n\nChloe x Halle killed it.\n\nThe singing sister duo and Grownish stars took the stage for a rendition of \u201cThe Kids Are Alright\u201d and it was one of our favorite moments of the night.The siblings perfected every note and provided a break from all the laughs.\n\nBae disses Roseanne.\n\nJust when we though we had run out of reasons to swoon over Michael B. Jordan, the actor took a much-deserved dig at Roseanne Barr while accepting his award for Best Villain. \u201cI am shocked that I won \u2026 I thought Roseanne had this in the bag,\u201d he quipped with a sexy smith on his face.", "images": ["https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-978171632-600x400.jpg", "https://thegrio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/07/IMG_0400-96x96.jpg",
