The documentary was directed by Chris Moukarbel and shot over an extended period of time throughout the making of Gaga\u2019s fifth studio album, Joanne.\n\nExplore Explore Lady Gaga See latest videos, charts and news See latest videos, charts and news\n\nHere are 11 things we learned from watching Five Foot Two.\n\nWhy she and ex-fiance Taylor Kinney broke up\n\nWithin the first three minutes of the documentary, Gaga mentions ex-fiance Taylor Kinney.\n\n\u201cYeah,\u201d she says while cooking at her Malibu home, \u201cme and Taylor [Kinney] are fighting. So, that sucks.\u201d Gaga goes on to say that her \u201cthreshold for bullshit with men is \u2014 I don\u2019t have one anymore\u201d because she\u2019s 30, she feels better and her insecurities are gone.\n\nWe don\u2019t hear anything about Kinney until just over an hour into the documentary during a sit down interview with Beats 1 radio host Zane Lowe, where Lowe asks Gaga what has happened in the last five years. She responds by saying she has felt anxiety, body pain, paranoia and fear and has abused alcohol and drugs.\n\n\u201cThe public announcement that your marriage is breaking up and you\u2019ve got to go make a record,\u201d Lowe says.\n\n\u201cWell, engagement,\u201d Gaga corrects him. \u201cLet\u2019s not say marriage. But yeah. Very painful. It\u2019s hard enough when love isn\u2019t working out the way you want it to, and you\u2019ve got to walk down the street and have somebody go, \u2018Are you OK?\u2019\n\n\u201cI had to go into the deepest pain in my life,\u201d she says. \u201cI had to go into the part of myself that you don\u2019t want to face.\u201d\n\nThis acts as a segue to a totally black screen, where we hear Gaga crying as she says, \u201cI just want to make music and make people happy, and, like, I\u2019m on tour and I have a family and I just can never get it all right at the same time. I always have a shoot \u2026 My love life\u2019s imploded.\u201d\n\nShe adds: \u201cIt\u2019s a sad day when I\u2019m doing the Super Bowl, and I\u2019m so excited to do it, but I can\u2019t help but realize that when I sold 10 million records, I lost Matt. I sell 30 million, I lose Luc. You know? I get the move, I lose Taylor. It\u2019s like a turnover. This is the third time I\u2019ve had my heart broken like this. I\u2019m alone, Brandon, every night. And all these people will leave. Right? They will leave. And then I\u2019ll be alone. And then I go from everyone touching me all day and talking at me all day to total silence.\u201d\n\nThe aftermath of her broken hip and dealing with fibromyalgia\n\nThe documentary begins at Gaga\u2019s Malibu home. We quickly find her on a massage table getting worked on. She tells the camera that if she gets depressed, her body goes into a full-body spasm. All of which, she says, stems from when she broke her hip three years ago. This is even more relevant now that she has postponed the European leg of her Joanne World Tour due to her ongoing pain.\n\nHer struggles with chronic body pain, which we now know is fibromyalgia, appear several times throughout the one hour and 40 minutes. Some scenes are more dramatic than others, including just before she is set to perform for Tony Bennett\u2018s birthday \u2014 she\u2019s bawling on the couch in pain. \u201cI just think about other people that have maybe something like this that are struggling to figure out what it is, and they don\u2019t have the money to have somebody help them,\u201d she says through tears. \u201cLike, I don\u2019t know what I\u2019d fuckin\u2019 do if I didn\u2019t have everybody here to help me. What the hell would I do? \u2026 Do I look pathetic? I\u2019m so embarrassed.\u201d\n\nWhile shooting the \u201cPerfect Illusion\u201d music video, she has to pause and ice her hip and ankle. While rehearsing for the Super Bowl 51 halftime show, she has to pause and screams into a pillow as someone works on her hip.\n\nWhile sitting in a doctor\u2019s office later on, she admits, \u201cI have chased this pain for five years.\u201d\n\nThe making of Joanne\n\nThroughout the documentary, we revisit Gaga in the studio with producers Mark Ronson and Bloodpop and other members of her team during the making of Joanne.\n\n\u201cYou have to go to that broken place of your heart to write songs,\u201d Gaga tells the camera while taking a break from recording \u201cMillion Reasons\u201d and smoking a cigarello. \u201cThey say sometimes it\u2019s like open heart surgery, making music. Every time. It\u2019s invasive.\u201d\n\nIt is made very clear that Gaga fully trusts Ronson and perhaps wouldn\u2019t have been able to make such a vulnerable record with anyone else. At one point, she says, \u201cSo many men in my life \u2014 in business and also that I\u2019ve dated over the years \u2014 I just started to feel like what I was on my own wasn\u2019t good enough. And I don\u2019t feel that way working with Mark.\u201d\n\nOf the process, Gaga describes, \u201cWhen you reference or nod to something in music, it\u2019s just like putting something precious in plastic in a suitcase that you are going to take into the future.\u201d\n\nHer true feelings toward Madonna\n\nGaga addresses the fact that Madonna has never directly told her the problems she has with her. Instead, Gaga says, she found it all out through television. She compares finding out how Madonna feels about her through the media to a guy passing her a note through his friend.\n\n\u201cThe thing with me and Madonna, for example, is that I admired her always. I still admire her, no matter what she might think of me. The only thing that really bothers me about her is that I\u2019m Italian and from New York. So if I have a problem with somebody, I\u2019m going to fucking tell you to your face.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut no matter how much respect I have for her as a performer, I could never wrap my head around the fact that she wouldn\u2019t look me in the eye and tell me I was reductive or whatever.\u201d\n\nThe inner-workings of her performing at the Super Bowl\n\nThe documentary ends right as Gaga is about to take the stage at Super Bowl 51 in Houston. Just before going on, she tells her team that she has worked her whole life for this and repeatedly reminds herself to enjoy it.\n\nEarlier in the documentary, we\u2019re shown a meeting at her home with members of her team and the Super Bowl committee. \u201cYou guys are just making my day talking about this,\u201d she tells them. \u201cI could just cry. Thank you for this opportunity. This is just a dream come true. I want to do the opposite of what everyone thinks that I\u2019m gonna do. Everybody thinks that I\u2019m going to come out there on a fucking throne in a meat dress with 90 shirtless men and unicorns.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is the one,\u201d she tells her stylist on the day of the Super Bowl. \u201cIt\u2019s almost, like, a little bit sad. It doesn\u2019t get bigger than this, so what do I do after this?\u201d\n\nRelated Lady Gaga Postpones European Leg of World Tour\n\nHer thoughts on women \u2014 especially powerful women\n\nAfter a studio session, she says, \u201cWhen producers, unlike Mark [Ronson], start to act like they\u2019re the \u2014 like, you know, \u2018You\u2019d be nothing without me!\u2019 For women, especially, those men have so much power that they can have women in a way that no other men can. Whenever they want, whatever they want. \u2026 And then I walk in the room, and it\u2019s like eight times out of 10, I\u2019m put in that category. And they expect from me what those girls have to offer when that\u2019s just not at all what I have to offer in any way.\u201d\n\nThis transitions into Gaga admitting that the way she pushed back against those men who expected her to be a sex object was to \u201calways fuckin\u2019 put some absurd spin on it that made me feel like I was still in control. So, you know what, if I\u2019m going to be sexy at the VMAs and sing about the paparazzi, I\u2019m going to do it while I\u2019m bleeding to death.\u201d\n\nLater on, Gaga says, \u201cI want to become a woman in this business and grow up. When you become famous at 21 or 22, it\u2019s like you stop growing up. I want to become a woman because the truth is that I can always bring my past with me, but I can never go back. You\u2019ve got to leave yourself behind.\u201d\n\nShe really loves her family\n\nThis much is evident in the title of her fifth studio album alone: Joanne, after her aunt who died at age 19 from lupus. Joanne is Gaga\u2019s father\u2019s sister, and Gaga \u2014 whose real name is Stefani Joanne Angelina Germanotta \u2014 is named after her.\n\nEarly on is footage of Gaga and her family at church for the christening of a baby. As Gaga\u2019s mother, Cynthia, is leaving the church, an elderly woman stops her to say, \u201cBoth your daughters are beautiful girls.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re good people,\u201d Cynthia responds.\n\nLater on, Gaga is previewing Joanne in a room with New York Times reporter Darryl Pinckney, whom she tells, in part, \u201cMy family is the most important thing in my life. Joanne was an artist. What happened was that my grandmother couldn\u2019t take her hands from her.\u201d\n\nFollowing her time with Pinckney, Gaga goes to visit her grandmother to go through some of Joanne\u2019s old things and play her title track \u201cJoanne\u201d for the first time. It\u2019s a very emotional scene, as previously reported by Billboard. So much so, that as Gaga is playing the song for her grandmother, her father, Joe, has to leave the room.\n\n\u201cDid I get it right?\u201d Gaga asks through tears.\n\n\u201cYou did,\u201d her grandmother tells her.\n\nWhy she used to wear those costumes, maybe\n\n\u201cI never felt comfortable enough to sing and just be this way, now,\u201d Gaga says. \u201cTo just sing, wear my hair back. I never felt pretty enough or smart enough or a good enough musician. That\u2019s the good part. The good part is that I just didn\u2019t feel good enough, and I do now. I know I deserve \u2014 of all the things I deserve, that is where I know I\u2019m worth something so I have to stay there.\u201d\n\nThroughout the documentary, there are various references to leaving her eccentric persona in the past and finally stepping out into the world as just herself. There are conversations had throughout the documentary about what she wants her wardrobe and aesthetic to be for Joanne and mentions that maybe she\u2019d like to go with a black T-shirt, black jeans and black boots. We now know that she went with the iconic pink hat.\n\n\u201cI can see now,\u201d she says. \u201cI don\u2019t need to have a million wigs on and all that shit to make a statement.\u201d\n\nHer first ever car accident was rear-ending Mark Ronson\u2019s Mercedes\n\nAs Gaga arrives at a session to record \u201cHey Girl\u201d with Florence Welch of Florence + the Machine, we hear a bang before she confesses, \u201cI hit Mark\u2019s car.\u201d She goes inside and tells him, where he quips back playfully, \u201cI wish if you have a problem with me, just tell it to my face not to my bumper.\u201d\n\nGaga seems to be truly mortified and admits that this is her first ever car accident.\n\nShe was at the doctor when Joanne leaked\n\nJoanne leaked online when a record store at Belgium decided to sell the album early.\n\nGaga was at the doctor as this happened. She\u2019s describing to a doctor her atrocious pain and inflammation all over her body, how her hip hurts every day. The doctor suggests that they try and relieve her face pain, re-educate her muscles and do a blood spinning.\n\n\u201cWhile this is all occurring, my album is hemorrhaging all over the internet,\u201d Gaga says.\n\nShe checked on Joanne at Walmart\n\nGaga casually strolls into a Walmart with her manager, Bobby Campbell, to check the visibility of Joanne on the shelves. Initially, she asks a cashier, \u201cDo you have the new Lady Gaga album?\u201d And he genuinely has no idea what she\u2019s talking about or who he\u2019s talking to.\n\nIt\u2019s not until the store\u2019s manager is called \u2014 \u201cI thought I was in trouble!\u201d says Gaga \u2014 that everybody realizes that it\u2019s Lady Gaga asking for the new Lady Gaga album. Of course, mobs of people then begin asking her for photos.", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/lady-gaga-five-foot-two-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/lady-gaga-five-foot-two-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Armstrong"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/pop/lady-gaga-five-foot-two-netflix-documentary-things-learned-7965926/", "title": "11 Things We Learned in Lady Gaga\u2019s \u2018Five Foot Two\u2019 Netflix Documentary", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Lady Gaga will show all of herself to anyone who chooses to watch her new Netflix documentary 'Five Foot Two,' which is available beginning Friday, Sept. 22.", "news_keywords": "movies", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "billboard", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 7965926, "author": "Megan Armstrong", "pmc-category": "Music,Pop", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-09-21T21:08:38"}, "pmc-tag": "movies", "title": "11 Things We Learned in Lady Gaga\u2019s \u2018Five Foot Two\u2019 Netflix Documentary", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-always-paywall": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-exclusive": "no", "pmc-breaking-news": "no", "pmc-prime": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Megan Armstrong", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Billboard", "application-name": "Billboard", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 7965926, "title": "11 Things We Learned in Lady Gaga's 'Five Foot Two' Netflix Documentary", "published_at": "2017-09-21 21:08:38", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/lady-gaga-five-foot-two-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "movies", "topics": "Pop", "body": "Lady Gaga will show all of herself\u00a0to anyone who chooses to watch her new Netflix documentary\u00a0Five Foot Two, which is available beginning Friday (Sept. 22).
