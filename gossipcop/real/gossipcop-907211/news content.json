According to the LA Times, she\u2019s also part of two much smaller groups: women who have directed a film of that scale, as well as directors of color.\n\nThe milestone is a notable one: it demonstrates the faith a studio has in its director, and puts DuVernay\u2019s name before a wide audience. The film will be written by Frozen co-director Jennifer Lee and will star Oprah Winfrey. Winfrey is an executive producer for DuVernay's OWN show Queen Sugar.\n\nDuVernay pointed out that she wasn\u2019t the first woman of color to be capable of directing such a feature.\n\nNot the first capable of doing so. Not by a long shot. Thanks to @DisneyStudios for breaking this glass with me. https://t.co/iXJ9pgV7eP \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@AVAETC) August 3, 2016\n\nShe noted that the milestone comes with a downside: audiences have certainly missed out on the visions of numerous other directors who could have come before her:\n\nA shame. Hollywood and audiences have missed some wonderful voices. High hopes for change. https://t.co/5TrQRV0pO9 \u2014 Ava DuVernay (@AVAETC) August 3, 2016\n\nDuVernay\u2019s position as director of a major blockbuster is a positive point in an industry lacking in diversity. The 2016 Academy Awards were heavily criticized for a predominantly white slate of nominees. This is a problem that extends not only to the stories hitting theaters, but for the crews and professionals that work to create films. This is a solvable problem: scrolling through DuVernay\u2019s Twitter feed shows off her efforts to create a more inclusive workplace. She broke through this particular glass ceiling, and will hopefully provide an example for others to follow.\n\nA Wrinkle in Time is based on the 1964 book by Madeleine L\u2019Engle, which follows the adventures of Meg Murphy, who sets of to try and find her missing father. The novel recently got a boost in attention when it was highlighted by Chelsea Clinton during the Democratic National Convention in July.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/network/placeholder_image/2/The_Verge.644.jpg", "https://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/network/placeholder_image/2/The_Verge.644.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Liptak"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12375718/ava-duvernay-will-be-the-first-woman-of-color-to-direct-a-100-million-dollar-blockbuster", "title": "Ava DuVernay is the first woman of color to direct a $100 million blockbuster", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@verge"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "og": {"site_name": "The Verge", "title": "Ava DuVernay is the first woman of color to direct a $100 million blockbuster", "description": "She is now part of a select group of directors", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12375718/ava-duvernay-will-be-the-first-woman-of-color-to-direct-a-100-million-dollar-blockbuster", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/network/placeholder_image/2/The_Verge.644.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large", "description": "She is now part of a select group of directors", "article": {"published_time": "2016-08-04T16:51:04.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-08-04T16:51:04.000Z"}, "author": "Andrew Liptak", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Ava DuVernay is the first woman of color to direct a $100 million blockbuster", "parsely-link": "https://www.theverge.com/2016/8/4/12375718/ava-duvernay-will-be-the-first-woman-of-color-to-direct-a-100-million-dollar-blockbuster", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/network/placeholder_image/2/The_Verge.644.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-08-04T16:51:04.000Z", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-tags": "verge,front-page,entertainment", "parsely-author": "Andrew Liptak", "next-head-count": 30}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1470265200.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
