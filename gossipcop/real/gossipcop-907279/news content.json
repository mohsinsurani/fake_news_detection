The actress posted a touching Instagram picture honoring her beloved pet.\n\nThe photo showed Hayek holding Lupe in her lap with the caption, \u201cWith my heart filled with love and pain I had to say goodbye to my Lupe. I am so grateful for the 18 years she enriched my life with her great spirit. I have no words or tears to describe how much she meant to me,\u201d she wrote.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BeD-9yWHH4e/?taken-by=salmahayek\n\nUnfortunately, this isn\u2019t the first time Hayek has lost a pet. In 2016, Hayek lost her 9-year-old dog, Mozart, after a terrible act of gun violence. According to the Instagram post after that tragic loss, she took a week away from social media to grieve the passing of her pet.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BCQ4sG2MFi_/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=embed_legacy\n\nOf course, it\u2019s never easy to cope with the loss of a pet because they are a beloved member of your family and often a closer friend than many people, but fans are writing to Hayek and sending condolences in order to help ease her pain.\n\n\u201cWe love you and are so grateful for all you do for the animals. May your baby RIP,\u201d one fan wrote on Twitter.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/RwhirshHirsh/status/954047481159004161\n\n\u201cEvery dog owner knows what this feels like, and it\u2019s bad. Sympathy to Salma Hayek,\u201d another fan wrote.\n\nhttps://twitter.com/JoeCappucino/status/953898467293671426\n\nNot only does Hayek have the support of her fans, she also has many other animals to keep her company. She told Ellen DeGeneres that she has more animals than she can even remember to name.\n\n\u201cI have five horses, four alpacas, one cat, eight dogs, one hamster, five parrots, two fish\u2014I\u2019m sure I\u2019m forgetting something!\u201d Hayek said on \u201cThe Ellen DeGeneres Show\u201d in October 2013.\u201cYou know this is like giving thanks at the Oscars, you know you\u2019re forgetting someone.\u201d\n\nHayek isn\u2019t the only celebrity who\u2019s recently opened up about losing a pet. Jessica Alba, Jordin Sparks and others have also shared similar sad news with their fans online. To Hayek and anyone else mourning a pet\u2014I\u2019m truly sorry for your loss.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_59499035-120x120.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201032'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_15907096-120x120.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ic_scripps.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20110'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AdobeStock_197077261-120x120.jpeg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cropped-cropped-simplemost_logo550new.png", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/498514258_salma-hayek.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/498514258_salma-hayek.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Augusta Statz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.simplemost.com/salma-hayek-mourns-dogs-death-instagram/", "title": "Salma Hayek Mourns Death Of Her Dog Lupe", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Salma Hayek Says Her Heart Is Broken After The Death Of Her Beloved Dog", "description": "Losing a pet is never an easy thing to go through, and actress Salma Hayek is opening up about the heartbreak she's experiencing after having to put down her dog of 18 years, Lupe.
