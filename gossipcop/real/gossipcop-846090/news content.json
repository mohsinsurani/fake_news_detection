{"url": "http://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-white-button-down-shirts-for-women.html", "text": "Sizes: As always with any kind of apparel, we\u2019re focused on featuring button-downs offered in a wider selection of sizes rather than the frustratingly limited (but all-too-common) small-to-large range.\n\nFabric: Traditionally, cotton is the material of choice for button-downs \u2014 see the classic oxford shirt \u2014 so that\u2019s what most of the ones on this list are made of. It\u2019s cheaper (compared to something like silk) and wears well, especially on the wrinkle-fighting front (unlike linen).\n\nDesign: The rule that a button-down must have buttons on each end of the collar (hence the name) isn\u2019t enforced as much in modern womenswear. In fact, button-down and button-up are used interchangeably to refer to any shirt with a row of buttons and a collar. Other than that, anything\u2019s really fair game, whether that\u2019s pockets, ruffle pleats, curved hems, or puffed sleeves. All of these details are included below for easy reference. A note: Our panel favored oversize styles overall (think Carrie Bradshaw\u2019s post-pond look versus Carolina Herrera\u2019s runway-ready tops), but we\u2019ve noted when a button-down is more tailored.\n\nPrice: The cost-per-wear philosophy is helpful here \u2014 it makes sense to invest in a button-down since it\u2019s pretty much dress code\u2013proof. But our focus was on finding shirts that were worth it, and whenever one was pricier, we tried to include a more affordable alternative. The ones that made it onto this list are categorized as either under $100 ($), under $200 ($$), and over $200 ($$$).", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/341/915/e01d3622ba964d4485521907bd9f554348-wilfredoversized.rdeep-vertical.w245.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/abe/434/6a6c30c2fe5780e23fa9fa140d2a357443-04-shirt-lede.rsquare.w700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/abe/434/6a6c30c2fe5780e23fa9fa140d2a357443-04-shirt-lede.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/2af/764/593cdca44874bea5063cc699f166bfed19-everlaneoxford.rsquare.w600.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9fb/37c/14eb787bcdaaf4314415b2833f77598947-linen-guayabera.rsquare.w600.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/76e/984/518ba5bdde943a80e7c437dbcc93fbe365-ANINE-BING-MIKA-SHIRT-WHITE-A-09-2006-10.rsquare.w600.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/757/2b8/76b202423e99f5951caabfc7a640371a07-baserange.rdeep-vertical.w245.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/90e/e74/46f62b8eaee8a8a1673bc0aeb0f18d4fdc-dadshirtcottonon.rsquare.w600.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9f1/77a/cee15f5e18c30f64452f12114210e2f01e-equipment-silk.rsquare.w600.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/9fc/9ee/a71d86f2330e010f5e1c9f471ab109e363-jcrewshirt.rsquare.w600.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/158/4ac/bf264c70e2a29ca711791f21184ff376ea-ayr-shirt.rsquare.w600.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/b10/ce1/469445b67c6c6e05634b6ec4a0795d9ecc-mangooversize.rdeep-vertical.w245.png", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/ab4/183/d2faa3128f5fc6fe02b8f239ab043ab2d9-steeleboyfriendshirtdress.rsquare.w600.png"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/abe/434/6a6c30c2fe5780e23fa9fa140d2a357443-04-shirt-lede.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ambar Pardilla"], "canonical_link": "https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-white-button-down-shirt-women.html", "title": "The 8 Very Best White Button-down Shirts for Women", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "the strategist, women\u2019s clothing, button-downs, shirts and blouses, ask a cool person, best in class, featuretype:q&a, featuretype:list or roundup", "og": {"title": "The 8 Very Best White Button-down Shirts for Women", "url": "https://nymag.com/strategist/article/best-white-button-down-shirt-women.html", "description": "Several even resemble Ina Garten\u2019s Hamptons uniform.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/abe/434/6a6c30c2fe5780e23fa9fa140d2a357443-04-shirt-lede.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Strategist", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The 8 Very Best White Button-down Shirts for Women", "description": "Several even resemble Ina Garten\u2019s Hamptons uniform.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/abe/434/6a6c30c2fe5780e23fa9fa140d2a357443-04-shirt-lede.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@strategist"}, "article": {"published_time": "2022-04-11T14:55:00.000-04:00", "tag": "the strategist, women's clothing, button-downs, shirts and blouses, ask a cool person, best in class", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nymagstrategist"}, "description": "A panel of obsessives recommend their favorite white button-down shirts for women, including linen, oxford, oversize, beach, and silk options from brands including Everlane, Mango, Baserange, Ayr, and more.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "the strategist, women's clothing, button-downs, shirts and blouses, ask a cool person, best in class", "author": "Ambar Pardilla", "fb": {"app_id": 1782502952000064}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Strategist", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Strategist", "application-name": "The Strategist", "msapplication-TileColor": "#111", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/strategist/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1649703300.0, "source": "http://nymag.com", "summary": ""}
