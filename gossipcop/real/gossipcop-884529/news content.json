Did they eat breakfast together? Or drop each other off at casting calls? We\u2019ve got a lot of questions.\n\nThe news was shared on LIVE With Kelly and Ryan, along with a photo of the roommates at a party. Since they look like fresh-faced teens (we can\u2019t ignore the frosted tips), we have to believe Ackles when he said it \u201cwas a long time ago.\u201d\n\nKelly Ripa was as curious about the girl in the back as we were \u2014 not just because it looks like she\u2019s giving the pair side-eye, but because she looks so familiar. As it turns out, that\u2019s actually Tatyana Ali.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EijNzQJlcuE?feature=oembed\n\nOne of Seacrest\u2019s best memories of the party in question included a place called George E. Wong, which had the very best pellet ice for parties. Ackles had a vague recollection of the ice, but Seacrest seemed to have a greater-than-average memory of how the night unfolded.\n\nAccording to Seacrest, Ackles was just one of his five roommates. And while it may seem like they had celebrity parties, they weren\u2019t yet \u201ccelebrities\u201d at that point.\n\nIt\u2019s so incredible how much their careers have blossomed since. We\u2019d love to hear more stories about that memorable time when the two get a chance!", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/04/jensen-ackles-ryan-seacrest.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/04/jensen-ackles-ryan-seacrest.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='581'%20height='557'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/04/live-kelly-ryan.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/04/jensen-ackles-ryan-seacrest.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/jensen-ackles-and-ryan-seacrest-revealed-they-used-to-be-roommates/", "title": "Jensen Ackles and Ryan Seacrest used to be roommates, and here's an epic throwback pic to prove it - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ryan Seacrest and Jensen Ackles used to live together with a few other roommates, and we bet they've got a ton of amazing stories.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jensen Ackles and Ryan Seacrest used to be roommates, and here's an epic throwback pic to prove it - HelloGiggles", "description": "Ryan Seacrest and Jensen Ackles used to live together with a few other roommates, and we bet they've got a ton of amazing stories.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/jensen-ackles-and-ryan-seacrest-revealed-they-used-to-be-roommates/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/04/jensen-ackles-ryan-seacrest.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 985, "height": 479, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-04T11:25:28+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T22:31:43+00:00"}, "author": "karen belz", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "karen belz", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507116328.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
