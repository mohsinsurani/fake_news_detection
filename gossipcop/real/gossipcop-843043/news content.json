Sheree greets Frankie (Tomlin) with a hug, to which Grace\u2019s protective best pal deadpans, \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing I\u2019m not allergic to rhinestones.\u201d But she is quickly left stunned by their friendship and asking, \u201cWhat the hell is going on here?\u201d The arrival of Sheree is set to irk Frankie and threaten to drive a wedge between her and Grace as the season progresses.\n\nKudrow\u2019s arrival as a recurring star also marks a Friends reunion with creator Marta Kauffman. The pair have not worked together since the NBC comedy wrapped in 2004.\n\nThe trailer also hints at further upheaval to come, as Grace\u2019s and Frankie\u2019s ex-husbands turned lovers, Sol (Sam Waterston) and Robert (Martin Sheen), are having marital problems. Their therapist suggests they try an open marriage.\n\nMeanwhile, partners in crime Grace and Frankie remain partners in business as well, as Grace is shown continuing to sell their now-recognizable purple vibrators, which are targeted to women who, like 70somethings Grace and Frankie, desire to explore their sexuality at any age. The pair continue their usual shenanigans, but also appear to be in denial about their health, spurring their kids to stage what appears to be an intervention.\n\nThe Emmy-nominated comedy also stars Brooklyn Decker, June Diane Raphael, Ethan Embry, Baron Vaughn. Ernie Hudson returns as Frankie\u2019s boyfriend and Peter Gallagher is also back as a potential love interest for Grace.\n\nThe fourth season of Grace and Frankie launches Jan. 19 on Netflix.
