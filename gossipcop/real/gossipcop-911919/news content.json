I think it was the universe\u2019s way of testing me, of saying, 'We\u2019re going to see if you really do love yourself.'\"\n\n\"That was challenging for me, because I didn\u2019t realize how much I relied on the outside validation,\" she adds. \"I thought that I didn\u2019t, but once you get kicked down the mountain a little bit, you realize that the weather really is better at the top. It\u2019s been really necessary for me to go through that.\"\n\nEmma Summerton/ Glamour\n\nUltimately, Perry says the challenges have her thinking about the next chapter of her life -- family.\n\n\"I\u2019m preparing to do a big soul overhaul very soon that I\u2019m nervous about,\" she shares. \"I want to emotionally elevate myself. I don\u2019t want to hold on to childhood trauma anymore. I want to grow into becoming an adult. I\u2019m preparing myself for having a family of my own in the near future. And that\u2019s the thing: I want to do a little bit more soul surgery before I have a family of my own so that I don\u2019t transfer any of those lingering feelings.\"\n\nEmma Summerton/ Glamour\n\n\"I\u2019m about to go heavy into that emotional process, and I\u2019m nervous, but I don\u2019t think I have a choice anymore,\" she decides. \"This last year has been about killing my ego, which has been really necessary for my career. But for my personal life, it doesn\u2019t work that way. If I want to have that true balance, I have to step into being Katheryn Hudson.\"\n\nPerry's Glamour interview is out now.\n\nEmma Summerton/ Glamour\n\nRecently, the singer came out to honor Minnie Mouse, as the beloved Disney character was honored with a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame!\n\nWatch below for the cute moment.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nSuper Bowl Halftime Shows: Looking Back at Beyonce, Katy Perry and More\n\nKaty Perry Rocks Wild, Animal-Print Ensemble for a Night Out in Los Angeles: Pics!\n\nKaty Perry Dazzles While Presenting Minnie Mouse With Her Hollywood Walk of Fame Star: Pics!\n\nKaty Perry Presents Minnie Mouse With Her Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame -- Watch!
