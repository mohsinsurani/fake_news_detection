Khloe also revealed on Jimmy Kimmel's chat show last night that both 26 year-old Thomas and the KUWTK crew knew before the Jenner Kardashian family, 'I've known the crew since 2007. We've had pretty much the same. They've been involved in pretty much the best and worst of us and they keep quiet.'\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube.

I think it's so sweet, but I don't want to do some of that stuff,' she said.\n\nKourtney is know for her natural-lead mothering, which includes avoiding TV's and processed foods, for her three children with Scott Disick. Khloe went onto explain, 'If someone buys blocks, I'm allowed to have blocks! Let me experience things. It's either her way or no way. It's not what you say, it's how you say it.'\n\n'We've been fighting a lot lately and we never fight,' Khloe said, 'She got p***ed because I wanted to put a TV in the nursery. ...I'm the worst person for ever wanting a TV.'\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

She told the comedian why she announced her pregnancy on Instagram and also what her name ideas are for her newborn. She explained, 'I think, if it's a boy I'll go with\u2026 Tristan Jr. , and then for a girl I don't even know where to begin \u2026I think I want a K or a T.'\n\nThat's right, a continuation of the K dynasty. We wouldn't expect anything less.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/3200x1600/landscape-1515151302-khloe-preg.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/4000x1998/1515141698-gettyimages-471548094index-1515105133.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/2560x1284/1515141702-rozman-20180103-15075-0270r-1515073463.jpg?resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/3200x1600/landscape-1515151302-khloe-preg.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daisy Murray", "Digital Writer", "Daisy Murray Is The Digital Writer At Elle Uk", "Writing Articles On Vintage Shopping To Melania Trump", "Everything In Between."], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40771/khloe-kardashian-has-announced-her-potential-baby-names/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Has Announced Her Potential Baby Names", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Has Announced Her Very Kardashian Baby Names", "description": "A 'K' is in the running, naturally.", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40771/khloe-kardashian-has-announced-her-potential-baby-names/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/3200x1600/landscape-1515151302-khloe-preg.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-01T20:14:49Z", "published_time": "2018-01-05T13:11:00Z", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/3200x1600/landscape-1515151302-khloe-preg.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Has Announced Her Potential Baby Names", "description": "Six months pregnant and a 'K' name is already in the running.", "keywords": "pregnancy, khloe kardashian baby names", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/1600x1600/square-1515151302-khloe-preg.jpg?resize=320:*", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,Tristan Thomas,khloe kardashian,Kourtney Kardashian", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-05T13:11:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/3200x1600/landscape-1515151302-khloe-preg.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/18/01/1600x1600/square-1515151302-khloe-preg.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Khloe Kardashian Has Announced Her Very Kardashian Baby Names", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515157860.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
