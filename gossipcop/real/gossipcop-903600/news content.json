In the midst of the tidal wave of Kardashian pregnancies that came earlier this year, Khlo\u00e9 kept hers a secret for as long as possible in order to make sure that her younger sister, Kylie Jenner, (opens in new tab) could have her special moment as a new mom. Wow, when would your big sister ever?\n\n2018 got off to a strong start for the Kardashian dynasty, with Kim Kardashian West welcoming her third child, Chicago (opens in new tab), back in January. Just one month later, Kylie gave birth to daughter Stormi (opens in new tab), having kept her pregnancy (mostly) a secret and deciding not to announce that she was expecting her first child with boyfriend, Travis Scott. Completing the trifecta with a very un-Kardashian-like move, it wasn\u2019t until she was over half way through her own pregnancy that Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian unveiled her baby bump (opens in new tab) to the world.\n\nRevealing the real reason that she waited so long to announce that she and boyfriend Tristan Thompson were to have their first child together, Khlo\u00e9 explained on Keeping Up With The Kardashians that she was only thinking of sister and BFF, Kylie. \"I am really anxious to announce my pregnancy, but Kylie\u2018s three months ahead of me and I want to give her her own time to shine and let her do her thing,\" Khlo\u00e9 said.\n\nA post shared by Khloe\u0301 Kardashian (@khloekardashian) (opens in new tab) A photo posted by on\n\n\"But Kylie keeps going back and forth on whether she will announce. Waiting is so frustrating because my body is changing and people are super invasive and just not being respectful,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 admitted, before an explanation came towards the end of the episode.\n\nKylie later told Khlo\u00e9: \"I don\u2019t think I\u2019m ever going to announce that I'm pregnant. I just don\u2019t want to be in the spotlight, I just want to be low-key. You should go ahead, you don\u2019t have to wait for me, you should announce\u2014it\u2019s exciting for you, too.\u201d\n\n\n\nA post shared by Khloe\u0301 Kardashian (@khloekardashian) (opens in new tab) A photo posted by on\n\nIt\u2019s almost sweet enough to make you forget about the times that the Kardashian-Jenners have almost torn each other apart in brutal, vicious, unforgiveable family arguments (opens in new tab), isn't it?
