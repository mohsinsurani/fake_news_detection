Times reported the house sold outside the Multiple Listing Service for $14 million.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West's Bel Air home is back on the market, just seven months after they sold it for $17.8 million\n\nThe couple let go of their former estate in November, handing over the keys to Silicon Valley entrepreneur and philanthropist Marina Acton, who seemed smitten with the property after receiving a personal tour from Kardashian.\n\nHer real estate dreams weren't meant to last, however, as she's now relisted the property for $18 million with Million Dollar Listing's Josh and Matt Altman, the brothers confirm to PEOPLE.\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West \u2019s former Bel Air home, sold for $18 million.

Inset: Getty\n\nActon told TMZ that she's selling because she's expecting a baby girl and plans to move to a new home with a guest house, where her parents can live. She's reportedly also relocating to the Miami area, where she'll look for an even larger house with about 10,000 additional square feet. (Kardashian and West's former home is 9,000 square feet.)\n\nThe Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman\n\nThe Altman Brothers were the listing agents on the property for the previous sale as well, which the couple sold for more than one-and-a-half times the price they originally paid for it \u2014 making it the most expensive home ever sold in Bel-Air Crest, according to the MLS.\n\nKardashian, 37, and West, 41, originally picked up the place in January 2013 for $11 million and did extensive renovations on it throughout the years.\n\nCourtesy Douglas Elliman\n\n\"When they first bought this home, it had a very Mediterranean feel,\" Josh exclusively told PEOPLE at the time of the sale. \"Now, it's been transformed into a very modern, minimalist style, but so beautiful.\"\n\nThe six-bedroom, eight-bathroom home features large automatic windows, a pool, and breathtaking views of L.A.\n\nThe Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman\n\nCourtesy Douglas The Altman Brothers at Douglas Elliman\n\nKardashian, West and their three children \u2014 North, 5, Saint, 2, and Chicago, 5 months \u2014 now reside in Hidden Hills, California, where they picked up a new mansion for a reported $20 million in 2014. Kardashian told PEOPLE at the time that she and her husband had \"just found a new, amazing place\" nearer to her mom, Kris Jenner.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner Have a Girls Night Out at MTV Movie & TV Awards as Kylie Bails\n\n\"When we bought our Bel Air house, we didn't have a baby, we weren't even pregnant,\" Kardashian explained of the decision to find a new, larger home. The couple reportedly never lived in the completely overhauled home.\n\n\"After you have a baby, you realize that you need so many other things and a different kind of space,\" she said. \"So being in the city is a different life. We wanted to be away and have more privacy.\"\n\nX17online; Inset: Getty\n\nThey moved into the Hidden Hills house in December 2017, despite ongoing renovations, in order to get settled before baby Chicago's arrival, a source confirmed to PEOPLE.\n\nThe new estate boasts 3.5 acres, two swimming pools, two spas and its own vineyard. They made significant changes to this property as well, and Jenner recently stated that the house is now worth $60 million.", "images":
