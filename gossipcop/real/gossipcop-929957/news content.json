That\u2019s why I\u2019ve kind of moved on,\u201d he added.\n\nShelton spoke to Entertainment Tonight about his tweet as well and said it wasn\u2019t fully intended for his fans to understand.\n\nJohn Shearer/Getty\n\n\u201cIf it was meant for people to know exactly what it meant, it wouldn\u2019t have been so cryptic,\u201d he told the outlet during a Facebook Live interview with his fellow Voice coach Kelly Clarkson.\n\n\u201cBut I can tell you it\u2019s been, actually, very entertaining to watch the world run with it and assume what they think it\u2019s about,\u201d he continued.\n\nShelton said most guesses as to what his tweet was about were not entirely correct, adding, \u201cI\u2019ll say this, people are way off the mark. But I don\u2019t have time to worry about it.\u201d\n\nLast week, he tweeted, \u201cBeen taking the high road for a long time.. I almost gave up. But I can finally see something on the horizon up there!! Wait!! Could it be?! Yep!! It\u2019s karma!!\u201d\n\nMiranda Lambert and Evan Felker. Jason Merritt/Getty; Frazer Harrison/Getty\n\nWhile the \u201cI Lived It\u201d singer demurred on who or what he was exactly tweeting about, multiple sources previously confirmed to PEOPLE it was indeed about the 30-time ACM award winner.\n\nOne Shelton insider says he feels \u201cvindicated\u201d after news broke that Lambert was dating the Turnpike Troubadours frontman, who filed for divorce from his estranged wife Staci Nelson two weeks after meeting Lambert for the first time in person.\n\nAccording to another source close to the estranged spouses, Lambert and Felker, both 34, connected via text message before his band opened for the country superstar during her Livin\u2019 Like Hippies Tour for three dates in early February. Lambert\u2019s split from former boyfriend Anderson East was made public in early April.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Miranda Lambert\u2019s New Boyfriend\u2019s Wife Addresses Her Tough Week After Relationship News Breaks\n\n\u201cThey had never met and she had started texting him about looking forward to playing together and getting to know each other and maybe they could write because she really liked his writing sort of thing,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt started very much about work. He was completely thrilled. By the time he was leaving for tour, it had become a lot flirtier.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

When Felker was supposed to return home to Nelson in Oklahoma, he allegedly skipped his flight, telling Nelson via email, \u201cI\u2019m not coming home this week,\u201d according to the source.\n\nIn the midst of the drama last week, Nelson alluded to the cheating allegations in a \u201cpublic service announcement\u201d posted to her Instagram Story on Thursday. \u201cPSA: If Staci Felker can make it through this week, so can you,\u201d Nelson, who continues to use Evan\u2019s last name on social media, captioned a teary-eyed picture of herself.", "images":
