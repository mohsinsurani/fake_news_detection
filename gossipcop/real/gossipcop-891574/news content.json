Sophia and her family will travel to Boston Children\u2019s Medical Center to have the risky, open heart surgery.\n\nBut before that, she had a special wish.\n\n\"That\u2019s all she wanted in the world, was to marry the love of her life,\" Chiappalone said.\n\nThat man is Hunter, her best friend from preschool. When Hunter\u2019s mom Tracy found out, she knew she had to do something.\n\n\"I contacted my best friend who\u2019s a photographer about maybe doing a mock bridal shoot and she was game,\" Tracy Laferriere said.\n\nSassy Mouth Photography did the shoot. Bliss Bridal shop in Cheshire donated Sophia\u2019s gowns. With their help, the moms pulled off a beautiful wedding photo shoot.\n\n\"That was a happiness that I have not seen from Sophia in so long,\" Chiappalone said.\n\nSophia\u2019s heart may not be healthy, but it\u2019s clear, her heart is full of love.\n\n\"I hope that Sophia is going to live a long life and marry Hunter when she\u2019s 25,\" Chiappalone said. \"But my hope for the future is that Sophia stays happy and healthy as long as her body can handle.\"", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1497632700532728&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/ots-double-arrow.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/NBC_OTS_CONSUMER_CT.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/OLY-CT.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://s.clickability.com/s?19=990&14=0&6=453144533&7=522472&25=0&18=0.3641643956291364", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1201*675/5_Year_Old_Gets_Dream_Wedding_Ahead_of_Heart_Surgery.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/designimages/ots_light_wx_97.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcnewyork.com/images/connecticut-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcmiami.com/designimages/nbc-ajax-loader.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcmiami.com/images/tve-play-icon.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1201*675/5_Year_Old_Gets_Dream_Wedding_Ahead_of_Heart_Surgery.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803/https://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/5-Year-Old-Gets-Dream-Wedding-Ahead-of-Heart-Surgery-453144533.html", "title": "5-Year-Old Gets Wedding Wish Ahead of Heart Surgery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140, user-scalable=yes", "robots": "noodp,noydir", "fb": {"app_id": 81242742459, "pages": 53587699329}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "NBC Connecticut", "description": "Five-year-old Sophia Chiappalone looks like any other little girl, but she has a serious health problem.", "title": "5-Year-Old Gets Wedding Wish Ahead of Heart Surgery", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/5-Year-Old-Gets-Dream-Wedding-Ahead-of-Heart-Surgery-453144533.html", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1201*675/5_Year_Old_Gets_Dream_Wedding_Ahead_of_Heart_Surgery.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCConnecticut", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/Rayner.Kate"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcconnecticut", "creator": "@nbcconnecticut", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/http://www.nbcconnecticut.com/news/local/5-Year-Old-Gets-Dream-Wedding-Ahead-of-Heart-Surgery-453144533.html", "title": "5-Year-Old Gets Wedding Wish Ahead of Heart Surgery", "description": "Five-year-old Sophia Chiappalone looks like any other little girl, but she has a serious health problem.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171104032803im_/https://media.nbcconnecticut.com/images/1201*675/5_Year_Old_Gets_Dream_Wedding_Ahead_of_Heart_Surgery.jpg?ak=bc"}, "tp": {"preferredRuntimes": "Universal,HTML5", "preferredFormats": "m3u,mpeg4,webm,ogg,flv,F4M"}, "keywords": "local news, connecticut news, ct   news, breaking news, new haven news, hartford news, westport news", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.description": "Five-year-old Sophia Chiappalone looks like any other little girl, but she has a serious health problem.", "description": "Five-year-old Sophia Chiappalone looks like any other little girl, but she has a serious health problem.", "sailthru.tags": "local news, connecticut news, ct   news, breaking news, new haven news, hartford news, westport news", "sailthru.title": "5-Year-Old Gets Wedding Wish Ahead of Heart Surgery", "title": "5-Year-Old Gets Wedding Wish Ahead of Heart Surgery", "taboola_lead": "video"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
