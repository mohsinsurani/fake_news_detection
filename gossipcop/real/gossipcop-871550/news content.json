She paired the look with a white polo shirt and mirrored sunglasses.\n\nJenner publicly supported Trump, 71, throughout the 2016 presidential election season, much to the dismay of her fellow transgender advocates on her short-lived E! series, I Am Cait. She later told CNN that she did not regret casting her vote for Trump, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t support him in everything that he does, but we needed to shake the system up.\u201d\n\nThe Olympic gold medalist (formerly known as Bruce) reversed course in July after the real estate mogul announced on Twitter that transgender individuals will no longer be able to serve in the U.S. military \u201cin any capacity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere are 15,000 patriotic transgender Americans in the US military fighting for all of us,\u201d Jenner tweeted on July 26. \u201cWhat happened to your promise to fight for them?\u201d\n\nThe Secrets of My Life author later released a full statement on her website. \u201cI believe every American should be outraged by the disrespect shown to those people wearing our country\u2019s uniform,\u201d she wrote. \u201cFurthermore, this half-baked idea puts all of our service members in harm\u2019s way. Does President Trump intend to just pull 15,000 people out of every critical position to which they are currently assigned? That would disrupt core military missions around the world and needlessly endanger our troops.\u201d\n\nJenner concluded her blog post: \u201cAmerica\u2019s 15,000 trans service members and 134,000 veterans are much braver than you, Mr. Trump; my allegiance is with them and our country, not you.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/caitlyn-jenner-great-again-hat-2391ac20-3d9b-4b82-821f-97c2689343f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/caitlyn-jenner-great-again-hat-2391ac20-3d9b-4b82-821f-97c2689343f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caitlyn-jenner-wears-make-america-great-again-hat-after-slamming-trump-w496034/", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Wears 'Make America Great Again' Hat After Slamming Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner wore a 'Make America Great Again' hat while driving around Malibu on Thursday, August 3, after slamming President Donald Trump's transgender military ban \u2014 photo", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Wears 'Make America Great Again' Hat After Slamming Trump", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner wore a 'Make America Great Again' hat while driving around Malibu on Thursday, August 3, after slamming President Donald Trump's transgender military ban \u2014 photo", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/caitlyn-jenner-wears-make-america-great-again-hat-after-slamming-trump-w496034/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:44:46+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/caitlyn-jenner-great-again-hat-2391ac20-3d9b-4b82-821f-97c2689343f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/caitlyn-jenner-great-again-hat-2391ac20-3d9b-4b82-821f-97c2689343f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-08-04T19:17:04+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:44:46+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Caitlyn Jenner Wears 'Make America Great Again' Hat After Slamming Trump", "description": "Caitlyn Jenner wore a 'Make America Great Again' hat while driving around Malibu on Thursday, August 3, after slamming President Donald Trump's transgender military ban \u2014 photo", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/caitlyn-jenner-great-again-hat-2391ac20-3d9b-4b82-821f-97c2689343f1.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501874224.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
