Pippa, on the other hand, recently wore this to a wedding in Cork.\n\nExpand Close Pippa Middleton and her husband James Matthews in Glengarriff last summer / Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsapp Pippa Middleton and her husband James Matthews in Glengarriff last summer\n\nThe more private Middleton sister was also thrust into the spotlight when her sister's relationship with Prince William went public in 2005 and in 2008, she began being pictured alongside her sister, as well as on her own. Her undeniable beauty and penchant for socialising meant she was a more accessible Kate and gave us countless iconic looks which sum up the noughties for all of us.\n\n2006\n\nWe were first introduced to her walking arm in arm with Kate at Cheltenham in 2006, wearing a suede boot with a kitten heel we could all approve of.\n\nExpand Close (L-R) Pippa Middleton and Prince William's girlfriend Kate Middleton, wearing a Russian-style fur hat, attend the final day of Cheltenham Races on March 17, 2006 in Cheltenham, England.

At a book launch for The Young Stalin: The Adventurous Early Life Of The Dictator 1878-1917, an event we would never see either at these days, her yellow silk Orla Kiely print dress is only overshadowed by her modest patent heel (with round toe) and black bolero.\n\nExpand Close Pippa and Kate Middleton (R) attend the book launch party of The Young Stalin: The Adventurous Early Life Of The Dictator 1878-1917 by Simon Sebag Montefiore, at Asprey May 14, 2007 in London, England.
