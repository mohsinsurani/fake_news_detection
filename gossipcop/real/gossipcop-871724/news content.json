During a press tour, Channing Dungey, the entertainment company\u2019s president, addressed the media about the shut down of production that happened following the Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson incident.\n\nWhen talking about the series, Channing explained, \u201cWe were never looking for a way to sensationalize it (the incident). The Bachelor Nation was very engaged, so there\u2019s nothing that happens in that universe that they\u2019re not up to speed with.\u201d\n\nAs fans of The Bachelor series know, Warner Brothers conducted an investigation and ultimately concluded that no misconduct at occurred.\n\nAnd while the press asked a lot of questions, Dungey managed to deflect the interrogation.\n\nA person in the audience pressed Dungey about the incident, and he said, \u201cthe whole thing certainly brought up some safety issues that we want to make sure we\u2019re on top of.\u201d\n\nThe entire ordeal was somewhat of a wake-up call for the directors of the series.\n\nAccording to Channing, they want to make sure their contestants are safe and sound at all times, and the role of alcohol is being questioned.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe said, \u201cWe are looking at all of those things. We want to be sure that we are safeguarding all of our contestants and making certain that we\u2019re handling it in the right way to move forward.\u201d Will the new changes affect how fun the show is to watch? It\u2019s hard to tell, but the only thing we can do now is continue to watch it and hope everything is just as entertaining!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Corinne-Olympios-Bachelor-In-Paradise-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Bachelor-In-Paradise-Season-4-Spoilers-Which-Couples-Get-Get-Engaged-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/princess-diana-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tameka-Tiny-Harris-T.I.-300x250.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/jamie-bell-kate-mara-300x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Carly-Waddell-And-Evan-Bass-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lebron-James-Trainwreck-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Greys-Anatomy-Is-Adding-New-Characters-For-Season-14-What-We-Know-So-Far-300x210.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tiny-Harris-Miss-Piggy-Comment-300x252.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tiny-Harris-Outfit-Video-300x242.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Bachelor-In-Paradise-e1502053360238.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Bachelor-In-Paradise-e1502053360238.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170812212236/http://celebrityinsider.org/boss-of-abc-addresses-the-changes-in-safety-regulations-regarding-their-hit-show-bachelor-in-paradise-57477/", "title": "Boss Of ABC Addresses The Changes In Safety Regulations Regarding Their Hit Show Bachelor In Paradise", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "abc, bachelor in paradise, corinne olympios, demario jackson,", "keywords": "celebrity news, abc, bachelor in paradise, corinne olympios, demario jackson,", "description": "The Bachelor In Paradise scandal is a still a hot button issue for the bigwigs at ABC.
