The current status is this: After dating on and off for the better part of a decade, House Bieber and House Gomez are at odds, with her family\u2019s apparent disapproval often making headlines. Now, Bieber\u2019s mom, Pattie Mallette, is getting in on the action and coming to her son\u2019s defense.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of the amazing young man you are, and the young man you are becoming,\u201d she wrote in an Instagram post. \u201cNone of us are perfect and never will be, (so we will always need patience and grace for each other), but your genuine growing relationship with Jesus is evident in the choices you are making daily and the good \u2018fruit\u2019 you bear.\u201d Mallette, who has said she \u201cloves\u201d Gomez and has a \u201cspecial bond\u201d with the actress, continued to gush about her son. She said, \u201cI admire your character and integrity. You are maturing beautifully and wise beyond your years. You are so funny that I find myself laughing out loud when I\u2019m alone, remembering of something you said or did. And your heart is gold. I love you to the moon and back.\u201d\n\nRecently Mandy Teefey, Gomez\u2019s mother, was reportedly hospitalized after a particularly stressful talk with her daughter about her beloved Biebs. Later, Teefey spoke to Gossip Cop about her relationship with her daughter and was very forthcoming with her opinions. Teefey admits she is \u201cnot happy\u201d about the latest reunion between the pair, but also says \u201cSelena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy.\u201d\n\nOf course, neither Bieber or Gomez themselves have commented on the matter.\n\nRelated: Selena Gomez Opens Up About Justin Bieber With a Very Zen Answer", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/01/19/5a61fb0176bff12812018dbd_justin-biebers-mom-defends-her-son.jpg?w=414&h=284&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/28/7a3f0c1f-f605-48ba-a124-fdf346739758-gettyimages-1389379651.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5507&fp-y=0.2764", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/01/19/5a61fb0176bff12812018dbd_justin-biebers-mom-defends-her-son.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/8/29/9f122c0b-8ad0-4d04-b2cf-3379547870db-tswifty.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.532&fp-y=0.228"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/01/19/5a61fb0176bff12812018dbd_justin-biebers-mom-defends-her-son.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/justin-bieber-mom-defends-son-instagram", "title": "Justin Bieber\u2019s Mom Defends Her Son After Some Not So Kind Words From Selena Gomez\u2019s Family", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/justin-bieber-mom-defends-son-instagram", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Bieber's Mom Comes to His Defense Following Attacks From Selena Gomez's Family", "description": "\"I admire your character and integrity.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/01/19/5a61fb0176bff12812018dbd_justin-biebers-mom-defends-her-son.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "\"I admire your character and integrity.\""}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
