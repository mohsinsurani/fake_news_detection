The pregnant E! star found out the sex of her and Tristan Thompson's first child together on Sunday's season finale of \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\"\n\nWhile on a trip to San Francisco with sisters Kim Kardashian West and Kourtney Kardashian, Kylie Jenner calls Khloe to deliver the results from Khloe's doctor.\n\n\"You're having a girl!\" an excited Kylie tells Khloe over the phone.\n\n\"You're lying!\" Khloe immediately says in disbelief.\n\n\"I'm not lying,\" Kylie squeals. \"I'm so excited for you Khloe!\"\n\n\"I don't feel like I'm having a girl,\" a disappointed Khloe responds.\n\n[NATL] Top Entertainment Photos: Best of the American Music Awards, and More\n\nKhloe Kardashian's Pregnancy Pics\n\n\"It's OK, I cried when I found out North was going to be a girl too,\" Kim says.\n\n\"I don't feel like I'm having a girl at all. I'm like in a state of shock,\" Khloe admits.\n\nKhloe later explains her reaction to the baby news, \"When you have your mind made up as to what you're having, like everyone told me you're going to feel what you're having and you'll just kind of know. And then when you find out it's the complete opposite it's just a shock. I just was convinced that I was having a boy, so to be having a girl it's just like, \u2018OK that wasn't what I thought was going on.'\"\n\nKhloe then calls mom Kris Jenner to share the announcement, adding, \"I'm really hoping Kylie's gonna say she's lying and like I'm really having a boy.\"\n\n\"Khloe, the only thing I wanted in life, the only thing, was a boy. Three times, and I got the three of you,\" Kris tells her daughter, adding, \"a man is much more attached to a girl.\"", "images": ["https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/New_York_On_Dark@3x-5.png?fit=528%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=176&h=40", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/Osmo.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/Migrant-Planes-Orange-COunty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2021/07/GettyImages-141810855-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NYC_aerial-1-1.png?fit=2060%2C847&quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=44&crop=1", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/AP22281414206795.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/AP22281349654135.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/subway-victim.png?resize=100%2C56&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/stream_1920x1080_2082043459780.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NY_On_Light@3x-3.png?fit=552%2C120&quality=85&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brett Malec"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/915758/khloe-kardashian-finds-out-the-sex-of-her-baby-on-the-kuwtk-season-finale-i-m-shocked", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Finds Out the Sex of Her Baby on the \u2018KUWTK' Season Finale: \u2018You're Lying!'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.8.5", "og": {"site_name": "NBC New York", "type": "article", "description": "Khloe Kardashian finds out the sex of her baby on the \u2018KUWTK\u2019 season finale.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Finds Out the Sex of Her Baby on the \u2018KUWTK' Season Finale: \u2018You're Lying!'", "url": "https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/khloe_kardashian_finds_out_sex_baby_kuwtk_season_finale/2067831/", "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all"}, "google-site-verification": "J_TExBQP8zWCS59RsGcM6VSRGvK0WA0HSmT5E7ZDWSs", "fb": {"app_id": 57055548682}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcnewyork", "creator": "@nbcnewyork", "description": "Khloe Kardashian finds out the sex of her baby on the \u2018KUWTK\u2019 season finale.", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Finds Out the Sex of Her Baby on the \u2018KUWTK' Season Finale: \u2018You're Lying!'", "url": "https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/national-international/khloe_kardashian_finds_out_sex_baby_kuwtk_season_finale/2067831/", "image": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCNewYork"}, "description": "Khloe Kardashian finds out the sex of her baby on the \u2018KUWTK\u2019 season finale.", "keywords": "sex, E!, shock, results, trip, phone, shock, disbelief, C, state, mind, reaction, baby news, San Francisco, sex, North, announcement, thing, thing, life, times, season finale, three, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, San Francisco, Tristan Thompson", "sailthru.title": "Khloe Kardashian Finds Out the Sex of Her Baby on the \u2018KUWTK' Season Finale: \u2018You're Lying!'", "sailthru.description": "Khloe Kardashian finds out the sex of her baby on the \u2018KUWTK\u2019 season finale.", "sailthru.tags": "sex, E!, shock, results, trip, phone, shock, disbelief, C, state, mind, reaction, baby news, San Francisco, sex, North, announcement, thing, thing, life, times, season finale, three, Keeping Up With the Kardashians, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kris Jenner, Kylie Jenner, San Francisco, Tristan Thompson", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-25T22:36:13+00:00", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/cropped-NBC_New-York-1.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=85&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519598173.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnewyork.com", "summary": ""}
