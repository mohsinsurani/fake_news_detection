The duo, however, were handed the wrong envelope: Instead of receiving one with the best picture winner, they received a redundant envelope naming Emma Stone as best actress for La La Land. (Two complete sets of winners' envelopes were present, with one held on each side of the stage.)\n\nBeatty was visibly perplexed by the card and showed it to Dunaway, who thought he was hamming it up.\n\n\"He took the card out, and he didn't say anything,\" Dunaway told Holt. \"He paused, he looked over me, offstage, he looked around, and I finally said, \u2018You're impossible.' I thought he was joking. I mean, I thought he was stalling. Warren's like that. He kind of holds the power and makes you wait \u2026 but it's part of his charm.\"\n\nNot noticing Stone's name on the card, Dunaway announced La La Land as best picture, and it took two minutes \u2014 and two and a half acceptance speeches \u2014 for the error to be corrected. Both the film academy and accounting firm PricewaterhouseCoopers, which tabulates the votes and manages the envelopes, apologized for the snafu. <iframe src=\"http://www.nbcnews.com/widget/video-embed/928555587925\" width=\"560\" height=\"315\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen=\"\" class=\"\" scrolling=\"no\" resize=\"0\" replace_attributes=\"1\" name=\"\"></iframe>\u007fn7\u00dfOx\u00dfM8\u00df\u008dum\u00e7\u00df{nw{\u00dd\u0178i\u00f7^m\u00edo\u2021[", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F02%2Fgettyimages-645725604-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F02%2Fgettyimages-645725604-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2021%2F09%2F30%2Foliver-gettell-headshot-2000-e1632962385151.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F02%2Fgettyimages-645725604-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Oliver Gettell", "April", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "title": "Faye Dunaway felt 'very guilty' after Oscars mixup", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Faye Dunaway addresses the Oscars mishap that led to 'La La Land' being mistakenly announced as best picture.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Faye Dunaway Felt 'Very Guilty' After Oscars Mixup", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "description": "Faye Dunaway addresses the Oscars mishap that led to 'La La Land' being mistakenly announced as best picture.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F02%2Fgettyimages-645725604-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F02%2Fgettyimages-645725604-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/", "title": "Faye Dunaway Felt 'Very Guilty' After Oscars Mixup", "description": "Faye Dunaway addresses the Oscars mishap that led to 'La La Land' being mistakenly announced as best picture.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F02%2Fgettyimages-645725604-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/04/24/faye-dunaway-very-guilty-oscars-mixup/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492988400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
