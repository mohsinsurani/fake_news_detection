Among his well-wishers was daughter-in-law Catherine Zeta-Jones, who took to Instagram to share a sweet photo of them together.\n\n\"101 today!!!! My darling Pappy on my knee,\" Zeta-Jones, 48, captioned the photo. \"Happy Birthday to my wonderful, inspirational and loving father in law, Kirk. Love you with all my heart.\"\n\nZeta-Jones added the hashtag #hero, leaving no doubts as to what her father-in-law means to her.\n\nKirk Douglas and Catherine Zeta-Jones at the AFI Lifetime Achievement Award: A Tribute to Michael Douglas event in 2009.
