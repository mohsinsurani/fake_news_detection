David Livingston/Getty\n\nThe MTV personality had an on-again, off-again relationship with Saran for more than two years before calling it quits in 2017.\n\nDuring one of her and Saran\u2019s breaks, Abraham enlisted Million Dollar Matchmaker\u2018s Patti Stanger to help her find the one, but came up empty handed.\n\n\u201cIt didn\u2019t go so well. Those guys were chiming in and being friendly, but I don\u2019t know. Hopefully there\u2019s another amazing dating show coming up for me. I\u2019m just really keeping it open and not limiting myself,\u201d she previously told PEOPLE.\n\nAs for what Abraham is looking for in a guy, she explained that she wasn\u2019t willing to put her career on pause.\n\n\u201cIf I find somebody who is just understanding of adversity and I find a man who is equally adverse, then that is the best thing for me to be partnered with. They can\u2019t be jealous and they can\u2019t stop my career,\u201d she explained. \u201cWith Simon, when I met him, I stopped doing my tours and stopped traveling. He has his own reasons for fights and arguments that I couldn\u2019t deal with, so I stopped some things.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Teen Mom\u2019s Farrah Abraham Steps Out After Arrest for Battery at the MTV Movie & TV Awards\n\nAbraham sued MTV\u2019s parent company Viacom for $5 million in February, claiming she was fired from Teen Mom OG because of her decision to work in the adult entertainment industry, according to court documents obtained by The Blast.\n\nThe reality star previously released sex tapes with Vivid Entertainment in 2013 and 2014 with porn star James Deen, and since then, she has done adult webcam shows and appearances at strip clubs, as well as sex toy endorsements.\n\n\u201cWe respect Farrah\u2019s decision to pursue other endeavors and we wish her the best,\u201d a Viacom spokesperson told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cRegarding her suit, the claims are without merit.\u201d\n\nAbraham reached a settlement with Viacom in March.\n\nEx on the Beach premieres Dec. 20 at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.", "images":
