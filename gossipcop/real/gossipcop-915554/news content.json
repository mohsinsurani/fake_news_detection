Abrams told Stephen Colbert on \u201cThe Late Show\u201d Thursday night that the script for \u201cStar Wars: Episode IX\u201d is finished.\n\n\u201cWe have a script, which is a big deal for me,\u201d said Abrams, who added that shooting begins in July.\n\nAbrams, who will direct the film, co-wrote the script with Chris Terrio, who has credits with the Ben Affleck films \u201cArgo\u201d and \u201cBatman vs. Superman: Dawn of Justice.\u201d\n\nAccording to the tech news website Ars Technica, fans should still temper their expectations about this particular script draft, as scheduling changes and production issues can derail a first script.\n\n\u201cJurassic World\u201d director Colin Trevorrow was originally slated to direct the space epic, but he was fired by Lucasfilm. Abrams took the helm shortly after.\n\nAbrams previously directed \u201cStar Wars: The Force Awakens\u201d and served as a producer for last year's \u201cStar Wars: The Last Jedi.\u201d\n\nThe contents of the new script aren't public knowledge. However, writer Brandon Katz of The Observer issued \u201ca public plea\u201d to Abrams about the film\u2019s story. He asked Abrams to go all-in on light saber battles, avoid a marketing-based ending and not split up the characters.\n\n\u201cAnd above all, please, please don\u2019t try to set up future saga films or spinoffs in Episode IX,\u201d Katz wrote. \u201cAs has been well covered, Disney and Lucasfilm have some enormously ambitious plans for the Star Wars universe moving forward. The worst thing they could do is to use \u2018Episode IX\u2019 as a springboard for those ideas in an attempt to keep fans on the hook for five more years. We saw how backdoor pilots to upcoming projects torpedoed \u2018Batman v Superman.\u2019 Hopefully the studio will allow Abrams\u2019 concluding entry to stand on its own.\u201d\n\nThe film is set to be released on Dec. 20, 2019.\n\nIn the meantime, Star Wars fans can check out \u201cSolo: A Star Wars Story,\u201d which will be a prequel film centered around Han Solo's early years. That films opens on May 25.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1860428570942209&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/author/authorpage/23084/23084.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/headline/emailspotlight/765696954/765696954.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/promo/sectionspotlight/193772/193772.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://beacon.deseretconnect.com/beacon.gif?cid=589640&pid=329", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/35a8c04218?resize=width_1200&order=resize,crop&type=jpg&c=3&a=9ac95963", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/35a8c04218.jpg?crop=top:0|left:0|width:1200|height:630&quality=100&resize=height:630&order=resize,crop&c=14&a=ad923d22", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://i.ytimg.com/vi/xyXscDJSHD0/default.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/35a8c04218?resize=width_100&type=jpg&c=6&a=9c8d13b4", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/promo/sectionspotlight/193634/193634.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/promo/sectionspotlight/193850/193850.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/promo/sectionspotlight/193777/193777.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KUMT4fYgcdEeg.gif?labels=ddmnetwork.news.deseretnews.entertainment", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://cdn.deseretnews.com/images/promo/sectionspotlight/193733/193733.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430im_/https://media.deseretdigital.com/file/35a8c04218.jpg?crop=top:0|left:0|width:1200|height:630&quality=100&resize=height:630&order=resize,crop&c=14&a=ad923d22", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Herb Scribner", "Herb Scribner Is A Writer For Deseretnews.Com.", "Hscribner Deseretnews.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180226185430/https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900011271/jj-abrams-says-he-has-a-script-for-episode-ix-heres-why-thats-a-good-thing.html", "title": "J.J.
