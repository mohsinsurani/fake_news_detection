The final episodes will debut in 2019.\n\n\u201cAfter seven seasons, it\u2019s time to be released from prison. I will miss all the badass ladies of Litchfield and the incredible crew we\u2019ve worked with. My heart is orange but fade to black,\u201d Kohan said Wednesday.\n\nOITNB was renewed for a seventh season when the Lionsgate-produced series received a three-season pickup ahead of season four back in 2016. The news that season seven will be the dramedy\u2019s last comes as little surprise given the bulk pickup \u2014 a first at the time for Netflix. Last year, amid mixed reviews of season five\u2019s three-day riot storyline, Kohan did not rule out as much when speaking to The New York Times. \u201cI haven\u2019t made a final decision yet, but I\u2019m leaning toward ending it after seven,\u201d she said, \u201calthough the nature of the show is one that can go on and on because you can bring in new people.\u201d Kohan also said she thought she had a series ending in mind, though she wouldn\u2019t share it.\n\nAfter spending six years in the minimum and maximum security prisons of Litchfield Penitentiary, OITNB delivered a game-changing finale at the end of season six. The series set the stage for its final run when its central character, inmate Piper Chapman (Taylor Schilling), was released early. That allowed season seven to follow her life outside the show\u2019s central core of inmates for the first time since season one.\n\nBoth Schilling and co-star Laura Prepon (Alex) told The Hollywood Reporter that they were both already preparing for the end of the show. \u201cAs an actor getting ready to say goodbye to a role that I\u2019ve lived with for six years, it\u2019s very poignant,\u201d Schilling said before heading back into production on season seven. \u201cIt\u2019s a very kind of surreal time. It\u2019s as surreal as it was when the thing came out of the gate and was so powerful those first few seasons. It\u2019s equally as surreal now to be ending it all.\u201d\n\nAdded Prepon, \u201cThe endgame is there. As of now, season seven is our last season. So, the endgame is clear. \u2026 I don\u2019t know if I can say that I\u2019m prepared for the end, but I\u2019ve been doing this for a long time and I know that there\u2019s always going to be more after that. It will just be different. Orange is its own special thing, just like That \u201970s Show was, and I\u2019m so happy that I get to be a part of it.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring production of season one, everyone involved with Orange Is the New Black felt like we knew a special secret we couldn\u2019t wait to share with the world,\u201d Netflix vp originals Cindy Holland said. \u201cSince then, we have laughed, cried, raged and roared with the women of Litchfield, and every moment spent with them felt like borrowed time \u2014 too good to last forever. We will be sad to say goodbye but we will definitely be going out on a high. We are grateful to Jenji Kohan and her groundbreaking vision; to her supremely talented team of writers and producers; and to a once-in-a-lifetime cast and crew for creating a truly special work of art that has inspired conversations and connected audiences around the world.\u201d\n\nThe announcement on Wednesday came with a video message from the cast.\n\nWarning: This may make you cry.

Under the pact, she already executive produces awards darling GLOW. Kohan produced OITNB for Lionsgate TV, where she was under a longtime overall deal (and for whom she created the Showtime hit Weeds) before moving to Netflix. She next produces Lifetime\u2019s American Princess.\n\n\u201cOrange Is the New Black has profoundly impacted popular culture worldwide, and has played a prominent role in building Lionsgate into a platform-defining brand,\u201d said Lionsgate Television Group chairman Kevin Beggs. \u201cThanks to the brilliance of Jenji Kohan, the mastery of the creative and production team, the transcendent cast, and our tremendous partnership with Netflix, the series has surpassed our expectations year after year.

The political drama launched Netflix into the scripted originals business, with OITNB following shortly afterward.\n\nOITNB, which is inspired by Piper Kerman\u2019s memoir of the same name, bowed to critical acclaim in 2013. The 16-time Emmy nominated dramedy received 12 nods for its first season, including a historic nomination for Laverne Cox, who become the first transgender person nominated for an Emmy. That year, the show won the Emmy for best comedy. The series has since nabbed three additional wins. After an Emmy rule change in 2015 classifying the series as a drama, OITNB became the first series to receive Emmy nominations in both the comedy and drama categories. Though the streamer does not release numbers, OITNB has became one of Netflix\u2019s most-watched original series.\n\nLesley Goldberg contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/taylor.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/taylor.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/taylor.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Strause"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/oitnb-end-season-7-netflix-1153175/", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 to End With Season 7 on Netflix", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'Orange Is the New Black' is officially saying goodbye to Litchfield.
