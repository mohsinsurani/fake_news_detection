{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/modern-family-renewed-for-2-more-seasons-at-abc/", "text": "ABC has renewed \u201cModern Family\u201d for two more seasons of 22 episodes each, TheWrap has learned.\n\nThe hit family comedy has officially been renewed through Season 10, which will air in the 2018-19 season. The order will bring the series to a staggering total of 232 episodes.\n\nThe news comes after months of negotiations between the network, producers 20th Century Fox Television and the cast, whose previous deals expired at the end of Season 8, though a renewal was likely always in the cards given the show\u2019s success in the ratings.\n\nAlso Read: 'Scandal' to End After Season 7\n\n\u201cModern Family has been the centerpiece of our comedy brand for eight seasons and we are thrilled to have it on our schedule for two more years. Steve and Chris have created such endearing characters, and the cast is second-to-none,\u201d said ABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey in a statement.\n\n\u201cWe are beyond thrilled that we get to spend more time with these characters, these amazing actors, our ridiculously-talented writers and our incredible crew \u2013 all of whom are like family to us. And the good kind of family, not the kind that argues with you all the time,\u201d added co-creator and executive producer Steve Levitan.\n\nAlso Read: ABC Closes Deal to Revive 'American Idol'\n\n\u201cModern Family\u201d joins the Shondaland dramas \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d \u201cScandal\u201d and \u201cHow to Get Away With Murder\u201d and the long-running comedy \u201cThe Middle\u201d as the five ABC shows already renewed. The Kerry Washington-led \u201cScandal\u201d is reportedly set to end after the conclusion of its seventh season next year.\n\nThe news comes as the broadcast networks begin to finalize their fall programming slates ahead of the upfront presentations next week. ABC also recently announced that it will revive the Fox reality singing competition series \u201cAmerican Idol\u201d next season.", "images":
