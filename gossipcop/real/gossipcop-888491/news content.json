As a source tells the publication, Meghan apparently \"spends most of her weekends in the Cotswolds with Harry. When she does venture out to Pilates or to get her hair done, she normally goes incognito under a baseball cap.\" Just like in the movies, by wearing a cap and sunglasses, Meghan seems to manage going undetected in ordinary life.\n\nOf course, Prince Harry and Meghan signed a two-year lease on a home in the Cotswolds following their May 2018 wedding, per Country Living. Based on the Great Tew Estate, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are able to escape London at the weekend. Notably, as Country Living reports, Soho Farmhouse, where Meghan had her spa-themed bachelorette party, is based nearby, making the Cotswolds a real home away from home for the former actress.\n\nAccording to the Soho House website, the members' only club attracts mainly those working in \"film, fashion, advertising, music, art and media sectors,\" with Meghan's close friend, Markus Anderson, being a consultant for the brand.\n\nMeghan and Harry are adjusting to their new life as the Duke and Duchess of Sussex, and it sounds as though they've found the perfect country hideaway to escape the limelight.\n\nRelated Story American Moments in Royal Wedding Ceremony", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665062756.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0.0252xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/serena-meghan-1511831009.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/crown-prince-frederik-of-denmark-prince-vincent-of-denmark-news-photo-1664899080.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.170xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fekixdhxgaapvq7-1664823960.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0406xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-american-ceremony-moments-1526750221.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.111xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-copy-1537108895.jpg?crop=0.4999185800358248xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-copy-1537108895.jpg?crop=0.9998371600716496xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664895878.jpg?crop=0.527xw:1.00xh;0.237xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4m769-1664893662.jpg?crop=0.644xw:0.957xh;0.0962xw,0.0430xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4x9br-1664984071.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.185xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664976504.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.691xh;0,0.0431xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664889898.jpg?crop=0.684xw:1.00xh;0.146xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-copy-1537108895.jpg?crop=0.9998371600716496xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23240463/meghan-markle-weekends-at-cotswolds-home-prince-harry/", "title": "Where Meghan Markle Spends Her Weekends with Prince Harry", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Meghan Markle Spends Her Weekends on Great Tew Estate in the Cotswolds near Soho Farmhouse", "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan\u200b Markle signed a two-year lease on a home in the Cotswolds\u200b following their May 2018 wedding. \u200bBased on the Great Tew Estate\u200b, the Duke and Duchess of Sussex are able to escape London at the weekend.
