It was just the two of them, and this event came to shut down rumors according to which they are planning to get divorced.\n\nWent to see Dave Chappelle this night and laughed all night long. Sometimes u just need a good laugh session with your friends! A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 31, 2017 at 10:47am PDT\n\nKim wore a skintight bodycon dress and kept the accessories to a minimum with a pair of gold chain necklaces.\n\nThe reality star paired the simple look with a sexy pair of lace-up stilettos by Merah Vodianova.\n\nKanye braced a workman\u2019s look, and he wore a grey work jacket by Caterpillar, black pants which he paired with black boots.\n\nKim and Kanye left their kids at home for their night out.\n\nBack in September, Kim confirmed that the family of four are happily expecting a third child via surrogate shortly.\n\nEarlier in that same evening, Kim stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live in Hollywood where guest host Jennifer Lawrence interviewed her.\n\nJennifer has always been a vocal fan of Keeping Up With the Kardashians.\n\nDuring the interview, they shared a lot of laughs recalling all kinds of past events.\n\nThey discussed light-hearted topics including farting, stalking exes and late-night drunk dinners and the weirdest thing Kanye does.\n\nMood A post shared by Kim Kardashian West (@kimkardashian) on Oct 4, 2017 at 9:39am PDT\n\n\u2018He falls asleep anywhere,\u2019 Kim explained to the actress. \u2018We\u2019ll be at a meeting, or he\u2019ll introduce me to people I\u2019ve never met before, we\u2019ll be at a restaurant, and he\u2019ll be snoring at the table.\u2019\n\nKim and Kanye were also seen at her sister Kendall Jenner\u2019s 22nd birthday party at the taco bar Petite Taqueria in LA on Thursday night.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBirthday guests also included Blake Griffin, BFF Hailey Baldwin, Kendall\u2019s parents, Kris Jenner, Caitlyn Jenner, sister Kourtney Kardashian and her boyfriend, Younes Bendjima.", "images":
