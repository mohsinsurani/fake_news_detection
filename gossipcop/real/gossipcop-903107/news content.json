The historic move marks the first time in the program's 65-year history that two women front the program.\n\nWhile the happy news has elicited public reactions from Kotb, Guthrie, and Kotb's co-host for Today's 10 a.m. hour Kathie Lee Gifford, Lauer has yet to officially comment.\n\nNBC/Getty Images\n\nHowever, between show segments on Tuesday, Kotb told E! News that Lauer was among the slew of people congratulating her on the new position.\n\n\"He was sweet this morning. Certain texts popped up, and there was one from Matt: 'Congratulations!'\" said Kotb. \"And he said some nice words.\"\n\nThe new host said that the text was not unwelcome.\n\n\"It meant the world to me to hear from him,\" Kotb said. \"It was really nice.\"\n\nLauer was fired by NBC in November amid allegations of sexual misconduct. Since his termination, more reports have come up about additional alleged misconduct, some reportedly involving Today staffers and interns. Lauer has kept a low profile since the news broke, but released a statement in November.\n\nRELATED: A Look at Matt Lauer's History, Following His Firing from the Today Show\n\n\u201cThere are no words to express my sorrow and regret for the pain I have caused others by words and actions,\u201d Lauer said. \u201cTo the people I have hurt, I am truly sorry. As I am writing this, I realize the depth of the damage and disappointment I have left behind at home and at NBC.\n\n\u201cSome of what is being said about me is untrue or mischaracterized, but there is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed. I regret that my shame is now shared by the people I cherish dearly.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/010218-matt-lauer-lead.jpg?itok=BC_5ETzA", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2018/01/010218-matt-lauer-lead.jpg?itok=-LFWNY8e", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2018/01/010218-matt-lauer-lead.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/010218-matt-lauer-lead.jpg?itok=BC_5ETzA", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexandra Whittaker"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707/http://www.instyle.com/news/matt-lauer-reaction-hoda-kotb-today-show", "title": "Matt Lauer Reacts to Hoda Kotb Replacing Him on the Today Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "News,Celebrity,TV Shows,Today Show,Matt Lauer,Hoda Kotb", "news_keywords": "matt lauer and hoda kotb, matt lauer reacts, matt lauer replaced, hoda kotb today show, today show replacement", "description": "Matt Lauer has reacted to the news that Hoda Kotb is replacing him as co-anchor of the Today show alongside Savannah Guthrie.", "og": {"title": "Matt Lauer Reacts to Hoda Kotb Replacing Him on the Today Show", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707/http://www.instyle.com/news/matt-lauer-reaction-hoda-kotb-today-show", "description": "Lauer was fired last year amid allegations of sexual misconduct.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/010218-matt-lauer-lead.jpg?itok=BC_5ETzA"}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://www.instyle.com/news/matt-lauer-reaction-hoda-kotb-today-show", "description": "Matt Lauer has reacted to the news that Hoda Kotb is replacing him as co-anchor of the Today show alongside Savannah Guthrie.", "media": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/010218-matt-lauer-lead.jpg?itok=BC_5ETzA"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://www.instyle.com/news/matt-lauer-reaction-hoda-kotb-today-show", "title": "Matt Lauer Reacts to Hoda Kotb Replacing Him on the Today Show", "description": "Lauer was fired last year amid allegations of sexual misconduct.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180103010707im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/010218-matt-lauer-lead.jpg?itok=BC_5ETzA"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
