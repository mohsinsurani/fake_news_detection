Kerr admitted to Elle Canada that she battled depression and had to find her way out of it by learning that every thought you have affects your reality.\n\nORLANDO Bloom has posted a sweet tribute to Miranda Kerr in honour of Mother\u2019s Day, proving there\u2019s clearly no bad blood between the exes.\n\nThe former couple, who share six-year-old son Flynn, were married in 2010 but divorced just three years later. Kerr is now engaged to Snapchat co-founder Evan Spiegel, while Bloom recently split from girlfriend Katy Perry.\n\nWhile the romance may be over, the Pirates of the Caribbean star still had plenty of nice things to say about his supermodel ex-wife when he and Flynn came across one of her billboards in China.\n\nAlongside an Instagram photo of his son hugging the poster, he wrote: \u201cWe came across this billboard in China while he was visiting me on set. He loves his mum and what\u2019s not to love \u2014 she\u2019s a wonderful mother, a great friend and co parent. So blessed and grateful.\u201d\n\nwe came across this billboard in china while he was visiting me on set he loves his mum and what's not to love- she's a wonderful mother a great friend and co parent so blessed and grateful @mirandakerr #happymothersday A post shared by Orlando Bloom (@orlandobloom) on May 14, 2017 at 10:15am PDT\n\nIt\u2019s not the first time he\u2019s publicly praised Kerr\u2019s parenting skills.\n\nJust three weeks ago, the actor posted a photo of his son\u2019s birthday present for her, along with the caption: \u201cHAPPY BIRTHDAY! To an amazing mother, co-parent and friend.\u201d\n\n\ud83c\udf81#HAPPY BIRTHDAY\ud83c\udf82to an amazing mother\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffbco-parent \ud83d\udc4a\ud83c\udffband friend\ud83c\udf88 A post

breakup with Bloom in 2013.\n\n\u201cWhen Orlando and I separated I actually fell into a really bad depression,\u201d she told Elle Canada .\n\n\u201cI never understood that depth of that feeling or the reality of that because I was naturally a very happy person.\u201d\n\nShe revealed she overcame her troubles using positive thinking and mindfulness, realising that \u201cevery thought you have affects your reality and only you have control of your mind.\u201d", "images":
