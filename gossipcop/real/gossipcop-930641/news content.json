This month, Kanye West \u2013 undeniably one of the most famous, successful, critic-proof hip-hop artists in history \u2013 went on what can best be described as a \u201cnegative press tour.\u201d His baffling series of public provocations were, at best, a Gabbo-style alienation of his massive fan base. They were, at worst, a dangerous amplification and normalization of men\u2019s rights activism and MAGA racism/sexism/xenophobia. His TMZ outburst reduced two centuries of American slavery to \u201cfake news.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s not really worth engaging in the endless fan fiction of debating whether this is performance art, a mental health breakdown, or just the gears of fame and social media grinding up another one of their loudest lights. But one thing is clear: Twitter has been an absolute Chernobyl toilet for a week. (Much thanks to Childish Gambino for wrangling everyone\u2019s attention, at least for a little while.)\n\nThe media \u2013 perhaps correctly \u2013 has been dismissing Kanye West outright despite his reign as the most critically acclaimed artist of the 21st Century (he\u2019s topped the Village Voice critics poll four times \u2013 a feat only Bob Dylan can match). Throughout this pea-soup-thick social media fog of outrage, Twitter dunks, memes, smhs, boycotts, thinkpieces, outreach, opportunism, concern and recalibrations, you would be forgiven if you didn\u2019t notice that Kanye West also released two new songs. \u201cYe Vs. the People,\u201d assisted by an astonishingly patient T.I., is basically a meta hall of mirrors about the entire fiasco up to that point; feel free to wade into West\u2019s defense of indefensible politics at your own peril.\n\nHowever, the nonsensical \u201cLift Yourself\u201d has been the surprising talking point. Uproxx called it a \u201cflatulent troll job\u201d while a Pitchfork headline said he \u201ctrolls everyone.\u201d A Stereogum writer said he felt \u201c[p]unk\u2019d,\u201d and another said it was \u201cclearly a goof.\u201d Consequence of Sound called it \u201ca musical poop joke,\u201d and Vulture gushed \u201cKanye West inhabits a theatre of the absurd where scatological squibs count as songs.\u201d It\u2019s obvious that Kanye\u2019s new politics may not be everyone\u2019s cup of tea, and Kendrick Lamar\u2019s Pulitzer Championship Belt will not be threatened by lyrics like \u201cpoopy-dee scoop.\u201d However, dismissing \u201cLift Yourself\u201d as the musical version of trollface.jpg is shortsighted and ahistorical.\n\nBy any reasonable metric, the lyrics to \u201cLift Yourself\u201d are complete and total jabberwocky: \u201cPoopy-dee scoop/Scoop-diddy-whoop/Whoop-dee-scoop-dee-poop/Poop-dee-scoopty.\u201d But immediately washing your hands of them ignores a long, proud, defiantly pop tradition of gibberish in popular music.\n\nWhere would music be without nonsense? Louis Armstrong\u2019s epoch-making bedrock of the Hot Five Recordings are replete with scat singing in songs like 1926\u2019s \u201cHeebie Jeebies\u201d and \u201cSkid-Dat-Dee\u201d and 1927\u2019s \u201cHotter Than That.\u201d Even the most elementary rap scholar can trace modern rhythmic swag back to the Thirties work of Cab Calloway, who would pepper his songs with bursts of zah zuh zaz and hi de hi de hi de hos. The swing and jump blues that paved the way for R&B and rock and roll was replete with koanic classics like \u201cHey! Ba-Ba-Re-Bop\u201d and \u201cDrinkin\u2019 Wine, Spo-Dee-O-Dee.\u201d\n\nRock\u2019s foundational years were full of trailblazers and pop weirdos alike dropping hits like \u201cSh-Boom,\u201d \u201cBe-Bop-a-Lula,\u201d \u201cSplish, Splash,\u201d \u201cOoby Dooby,\u201d \u201cDo Wah Diddy,\u201d \u201cDa Doo Ron Ron\u201d and \u201cOb-La-Di, Ob-La-Da.\u201d At this point, what revisionist cynic would argue against the untranscribable onomatopoeia of the Chips\u2019 1956 mumble doo-wop \u201cRubber Biscuit\u201d or the Trashmen\u2019s 1963 proto-punk surf-snarl classic \u201cSurfin\u2019 Bird,\u201d songs that transcend novelty status to merge with the ineffable. The 2003 comp Great Googa Mooga reveals an entire alternate universe of doo-wop and R&B sides with names like \u201cOokey Ook,\u201d \u201cOochie Patchie\u201d and \u201cYacka Hoom Boom.\u201d If you feel like making a real connection to West\u2019s scatological scatting, you could do worse than the giddy 1960 groover \u201cLoo-Key Doo-Key\u201d by Floridan R&B shouter \u201cKing\u201d Coleman. A wop bop a-lu-bop, a poopity scoop.\n\nEven rap itself is built on funky scoopity \u2013 in its very first year on record, 1979, early hip-hop label Sound of New York, U.S.A. released a holiday-themed 12-inch by a rapper named Scoopy. The very first lines of \u201cRapper\u2019s Delight,\u201d the 1979 song that introduced the art form to a national audience, started with fun disco nonsense: \u201cI said a hip, hop, the hippie, the hippie/To the hip hip hop and you don\u2019t stop.\u201d The 1982 electronic quantum leap of Afrika Bambaata\u2019s \u201cPlanet Rock\u201d was anchored by rapper Pow Wow offering \u201czih zih zih zih zih zih/zih zih zih/zih-zih-zih-zih-zih- zih zih.\u201d\n\n\u201cPow Wow had one section and he couldn\u2019t remember his words,\u201d Tommy Boy president Tom Silverman said later. \u201cIt\u2019s on the record and it\u2019s one of the parts everyone sings along with.\u201d\n\nWho wants a pop landscape without Steam\u2019s \u201cNa Na Hey Kiss Him Goodbye\u201d or Hanson\u2019s \u201cMMMBop.\u201d Lady Gaga \u2013 who took her name, it should be said, after the highly nonsensical Queen song \u201cRadio Gaga\u201d \u2013 built one of the most successful pop empires on inspired nonsense like \u201cJust Dance\u201d (Da-da-doo-doot-n\u201d), \u201cPoker Face\u201d (\u201cMum mum mum mah\u201d) and Bad Romance (\u201cRah rah ah-ah-ah\u201d).\n\n\u201cGod, I got flak for that one,\u201d Sting told Q about the Police\u2019s 1980 hit \u201c\u201dDe Do Do Do, De Da Da Da.\u201d \u201cI always thought it was an articulate song about being inarticulate. \u2026 I was intrigued with why songs like that worked. Why \u2018Da Doo Ron Ron,\u2019 why \u2018Doo Wah Diddy Diddy,\u2019 why \u2018Be-Bop-a-Lula,\u2019 why \u2018Tutti Frutti\u2019 worked. I came up with the idea that they worked because they were totally innocent. They weren\u2019t trying to tell you anything or distort your vision \u2013 it was just a sound. So in the song I try to intellectualize and analyze why that works so effectively, which is self-defeating in a way, but it was still a massive hit. Some people might think that the man who wrote \u2018De Do Do Do, De Da Da Da\u2019 is a stupid twat but \u2026 I\u2019m living here.\u201d\n\nSting\u2019s theory of dedoology can be fast-forwarded to the present day, where SoundCloud rapper Lil Pump racks up massive streaming numbers repeating the aesthetically solid phrase \u201cGucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang, Gucci gang.\u201d While certainly not nonsense (it\u2019s the name of his Florida-based crew), Pump does repeat it until the meaning falls apart and becomes just an irresistible sound or feel, a meme that rolls off the tongue. To wit, a popular YouTuber once said \u201cGucci gang\u201d one million times to raise money for charity. Pump\u2019s latest Top 40 hit turns the phrase \u201clet\u2019s get it\u201d into the very repeatable \u201cEskeetit.\u201d Again, not exactly nonsense, but the sheer pleasure to repeat it makes it feel more like Sting\u2019s \u201cjust a sound.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s \u201cLift Yourself\u201d may be the first rap song from a major celebrity to truly embrace the aesthetics of SoundCloud rap, the controversial yet incredibly popular music produced by Pump, XXXTentacion, 6ix9ine, Lil Skies and more. SoundCloud rap is marked by its punkish, lo-fi, sketchpad feel, short song durations; and depressive, emo-fueled lyrics. While \u201cLift Yourself\u201d is uplifting instead of moody, and it uses classic Eighties sample-chop techniques, it does mirror the movement in its lean 2-minute-28-second run time, its focus on sensation instead of bars, its minimalist production, its feeling of first-draft-best-draft, the raw way it cuts off at the end. While rooted in decades of radio gaga, West is the only multi-platinum rapper grappling with the future\u2019s unleaded eskeetit.\n\nWest spitting a verse of nonsense even feels like a next-level boast, turning the threats of previous rappers into his own new reality. On his Number One single from 2007, New York rapper Mims bragged, \u201cThis is why I\u2019m hot: I don\u2019t gotta rap/I can sell a mill, saying nothing on the track.\u201d Of course, Mims did rap throughout the song. He offered this explanation to Stereogum a decade later: \u201c[It\u2019s] honestly a double entendre because it says that I\u2019m so confident that I don\u2019t even need to say anything in order for people to receive me well, and the other half of it was about the state of hip-hop, where, you know, someone could literally have no lyrical content whatsoever and become an overnight celebrity or make millions of dollars doing it.\u201d\n\nIs West\u2019s nonsense also some sort of criticism about the state of hip-hop? Or did he just turn Mims\u2019 hot line into a hot song? It\u2019s the full realization of a threat made by Digital Underground\u2019s \u201cHumpty Dance\u201d: \u201cI\u2019ll say a word that don\u2019t mean nothin\u2019, like looptid.\u201d Or Company Flow\u2019s El-P in 1997\u2019s \u201cThe Fire in Which You Burn\u201d: \u201cEven when I say nothing it\u2019s a beautiful use of negative space.\u201d Or Eminem on 2004\u2019s \u201cRain Man\u201d: \u201cAnd I don\u2019t even gotta make no goddamned sense/I just did a whole song and I didn\u2019t say shit.\u201d Or Houston rapper Marcus Manchild on 2013\u2019s \u201cNo Mercy\u201d: \u201cOkay, I need no introduction/I could hop on this and say nothin\u2019\u201d\n\nOr maybe rapping nonsense is just fun and cool \u2013 a feeling certainly not without precedent in hip-hop.\n\n\u201cI invented rapping without actually using the words,\u201d Black Thought of the Roots told Rolling Stone. \u201c[W]ith songs like \u2018Don\u2019t Say Nuthin\u2019,\u2019 freestyles like \u2018New Year\u2019s At Jay Dee\u2019s,\u2019 I essentially invented mumble rap, where you go for many bars without saying any words. And when I did it, it came from a place of being inspired by scatting.\u201d\n\nI like to think West is inhabiting a space between Mims\u2019 chest-puffing critique and Black Thought\u2019s jazz-fried artfulness. The whole \u201cKanye West Going Door-to-Door Sparking Thinkpieces\u201d model right now seems like an attempt for the rapper/reality TV star to wrangle the eyes and ears of social media. The current economy makes little distinction between a passionate fan, a curious listener or a news peg. Clicks equal revenue. And it feels like Kanye West is saying he can get clicks for nothing as just as easily as he got accolades for a classic like \u201cCan\u2019t Tell Me Nothing.\u201d Our curiosity is his victory. And it helps that he delivers that message with a flow that seems deeply attuned to today\u2019s cutting edge of off-kilter, slightly off-beat flows and raw delivery.\n\nThe entire concept of \u201cLift Yourself\u201d \u2013 a hugely famous figure talking loud and saying nothing \u2013 brings to mind one of the best scenes from 2001 cult flick Pootie Tang. Pootie, a national sensation who speaks entirely in nonsense words, enters the recording studio and slowly lowers the faders, stripping a track away until there\u2019s nothing left. He dramatically opens his mouth for a John Cage-ian silence and it becomes a national hit.\n\n\u201cPootie don\u2019t need no words, don\u2019t even need no music!\u201d shouts J.B. Smoove. \u201cWoo!\u201d\n\nEveryone put their own meaning to Pootie\u2019s nothingness, which is a good metaphor for \u201cLift Yourself\u201d too.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/9048529bz-af92a049-573a-4dae-a956-1316ae2e899c.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/9048529bz-af92a049-573a-4dae-a956-1316ae2e899c.jpg?w=1581&h=1054&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/9048529bz-af92a049-573a-4dae-a956-1316ae2e899c.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher R.

Uproxx called it a \"flatulent troll job\" while a Pitchfork headline said he \"trolls everyone.\" A Stereogum writer said he felt \"[p]unk'd,\" and another said it was \"clearly a goof.\" Consequence of Sound called it \"a musical poop joke,\" and Vulture gushed \"Kanye West inhabits a theatre of the absurd where scatological squibs count as songs.\" It's obvious that Kanye's new politics may not be everyone's cup of tea, and Kendrick Lamar's Pulitzer Championship Belt will not be threatened by lyrics like \"poopy-dee scoop.\" However, dismissing \"Lift Yourself\" as the musical version of trollface.jpg is shortsighted and ahistorical.By any reasonable metric, the lyrics to \"Lift Yourself\" are complete and total jabberwocky: \"Poopy-dee scoop/Scoop-diddy-whoop/Whoop-dee-scoop-dee-poop/Poop-dee-scoopty.\" But immediately washing your hands of them ignores a long, proud, defiantly pop tradition of gibberish in popular music.Where would music be without nonsense? Louis Armstrong's epoch-making bedrock of the Hot Five Recordings are replete with scat singing in songs like 1926's \"Heebie Jeebies\" and \"Skid-Dat-Dee\" and 1927's \"Hotter Than That.\" Even the most elementary rap scholar can trace modern rhythmic swag back to the Thirties work of Cab Calloway, who would pepper his songs with bursts of zah zuh zaz and hi de hi de hi de hos.

The 2003 comp Great Googa Mooga reveals an entire alternate universe of doo-wop and R&B sides with names like \"Ookey Ook,\" \"Oochie Patchie\" and \"Yacka Hoom Boom.\" If you feel like making a real connection to West's scatological scatting, you could do worse than the giddy 1960 groover \"Loo-Key Doo-Key\" by Floridan R&B shouter \"King\" Coleman.

To wit, a popular YouTuber once said \"Gucci gang\" one million times to raise money for charity.

Pootie, a national sensation who speaks entirely in nonsense words, enters the recording studio and slowly lowers the faders, stripping a track away until there's nothing left. He dramatically opens his mouth for a John Cage-ian silence and it becomes a national hit.\"Pootie don't need no words, don't even need no music!\" shouts J.B. Smoove. \"Woo!\"Everyone put their own meaning to Pootie's nothingness, which is a good metaphor for \"Lift Yourself\" too.", "fb": {"pages": 10664530778}, "onesignal": "wordpress-plugin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Kanye West's New Song 'Lift Yourself' Isn't as Bad as You Think", "url": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/kanye-wests-lift-yourself-isnt-as-bad-as-you-think-628284/", "description": "Hate the rapper\u2019s politics all you want, but writing off his \u201cpoopy-dee scoop\u201d moment is shortsighted", "site_name": "Rolling Stone", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/9048529bz-af92a049-573a-4dae-a956-1316ae2e899c.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "width": 1024, "height": 681, "alt": "Kanye West's 'Lift Yourself' Isn't as Bad as You Think"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-08T19:05:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-25T15:28:43+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@RollingStone", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kanye West\u2019s \u2018Lift Yourself\u2019 Isn\u2019t as Bad as You Think", "description": "Hate Kanye West's politics all you want, but writing off his \"poopy-dee scoop\" moment is shortsighted.", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/9048529bz-af92a049-573a-4dae-a956-1316ae2e899c.jpg?w=1024"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/cropped-Rolling-Stone-Favicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/4NUTTC1QqVU"], "publish_date": 1525806300.0, "source": "https://www.rollingstone.com", "summary": ""}
