They're not alone, either, as Desperate Housewives star Eva Longoria recently expressed her interest her own interest in returning to Gaby's lifestyle.\n\nI wish! I love that show. I miss it every single day. I miss being Gaby. I miss being on that set. I miss everything about it. But our creator [Marc Cherry] has said many times he wouldn't bring it back. Plus, we're all so busy. Felicity [Huffman] is always off doing some Emmy award--winning show. I'm busy with my projects. I don't know if it will ever happen, but I'm all for the idea!\n\nThere was nothing desperate about that response, with Eva Longoria expressing a lot of genuine enthusiasm for the idea of bringing Desperate Housewives back to TV. It sounds like it would take zero effort to get her signature on the dotted line, should a contract's dotted line ever appear in front of her. (Hint, hint, ABC and Marc Cherry and everyone else.) While lots of TV stars would counter revival questions with guarded and generic answers, Longoria gave fans exactly the answer that would be most desired. Well, I guess if her answer included a reveal that the show actually IS coming back, that would be the most desired response...\n\nEva Longoria was speaking with NewBeauty when she said those encouraging words, though she did counteract them by reminding everyone that Marc Cherry has consistently affirmed his stance that he doesn't want to do more Desperate Housewives beyond the eight seasons that aired. But we all know that nothing is set in stone when it comes to TV, so maybe once we get a little further away from the series' 2012 finale, Cherry might arrive at a revival idea that he can't put out of his head. And thankfully, the Desperate Housewives finale didn't kill everyone off in a jaw-dropping fashion, so there wouldn't be any need to retcon story points.\n\nAnyone looking to see Eva Longoria performances in 2018 will need to first head to theaters for the Overboard remake. We'll hopefully get to see her returning to TV at some point, too. 2017 brought us her stint on Empire and the British miniseries Decline and Fall, as well as an unfortunately non-ordered Fox pilot that co-starred Ken Marino and Andy Richter.\n\nWhile we're not sure if we'll get to see Desperate Housewives back on TV in the future outside of repeats, there are lots of shows that are coming in the next few months, and you can find them all on our 2018 midseason premiere schedule.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yq2mETBdBXosgazHq78hjW-320-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yq2mETBdBXosgazHq78hjW-1200-80.jpg", "https://www.cinemablend.com/media/img/missing-image.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/yq2mETBdBXosgazHq78hjW-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Venable", "Assistant Managing Editor", "Window.Slicecomponents", "Window.Reliabledomcontentloaded.Then", "Var Componentcontainer", "Document.Queryselector", "Slice-Container-Authorbio", "If Componentcontainer", "Var Data", "Layout"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cinemablend.com/television/1750909/eva-longoria-wants-a-desperate-housewives-revival", "title": "Eva Longoria Wants A Desperate Housewives Revival", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2017-12-25T16:53:47+00:00", "description": "Hoping for a Desperate Housewives revival?
