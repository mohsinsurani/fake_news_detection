The incident occurred as Lochte was receiving one of the judge\u2019s critique of his dance routine.\n\n\u201cTwo individuals stormed the dance floor tonight and were immediately subdued and escorted out of the building,\u201d a spokesperson for the company that produces \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d BBC Worldwide Productions, told CNN.\n\nABC News reported that two men got on the ballroom dance floor and at least four other people yelled anti-Lochte chants. CNN has confirmed that the two men were Barzeen Soroudi and Sam Sotoodeh. \u201cThey were arrested on trespassing, this was a private person\u2019s arrest as the security at the venue made the arrest,\u201d a spokesperson for the LAPD told CNN. \u201cWe just accepted [them] and booked them.\u201d\n\nLochte joined Season 23 of \u201cDancing With The Stars\u201d after a spate of negative publicity he received for admitting he \u201cover-exaggerated\u201d claims that he and fellow swimmers were robbed at gunpoint in Rio de Janeiro.\n\nAlthough the show was live, the actual incident was not shown on camera by ABC.\n\nAt least one audience member was able to record the moment security guards tackled Soroudi and Sotoodeh and posted video to social media.\n\nAnother angle of Lochte protesters on #DWTS #DancingWiththeStars\n\n\n\nWhy does this remind me of a Trump rally \ud83e\udd14 https://t.co/YKCwT5dirE \u2014 @DCHomos (@DCHomos) September 13, 2016\n\nThroughout the brief incident, the camera stayed focused on judge Carrie Ann Inaba, who yelled \u201cExcuse me!\u201d multiple times as clamor rose in the audience and onstage.\n\n\u201cOff! Off!\u201d she yelled, gesturing for the intruders to get off stage.\n\nThe network went to a commercial break, but the camera briefly showed Lochte and his dancing partner, Cheryl Burke, as both appeared flustered and surprised.\n\n\u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d host Tom Bergeron addressed the interruption after the commercial break.\n\n\u201cWe had to go to break because we had a little incident,\u201d he said, although he didn\u2019t clarify any further. Bergeron thanked the security team on the show.\n\nHe also asked Lochte how he was doing after the interruption.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a little hurt\u201d\n\n\u201cSo many feelings are going through my head right now,\u201d said the Olympic swimmer. \u201cI\u2019m a little hurt.\u201d\n\nAfter the show, Lochte told CNN that he was saddened by what happened.\n\n\u201cYou know, at that moment, I was really heartbroken,\u201d he said. \u201cMy heart just sunk. It felt like somebody just ripped it apart.\u201d\n\nBut Lochte added he \u201chad to brush it off.\u201d\n\n\u201cCompletely shocked\u201d but \u201cbeyond\u201d proud of him\n\n\u201cI had to realize that I came out here in front of millions. I did something that I did not know how to do \u2013 I don\u2019t know how to dance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I gave it my all and I\u2019m glad I did it and I\u2019m glad I\u2019m here.\u201d\n\nHis dancing partner, Burke, said she was \u201ccompletely shocked\u201d but \u201cbeyond\u201d proud of him.\n\nCNN crews captured two suspected protesters outside of the event being led away in handcuffs. They both wore T-shirts that contained a red circle with a slash going through the word Lochte. One man called Lochte \u201ca liar.\u201d\n\nA spokesperson for the company that produces \u201cDancing with the Stars,\u201d told CNN that \u201cthe matter is now being handled by the authorities.\u201d\n\nOfficial statement from BBC Worldwide Productions spokesperson re: Lochte protestors on #DWTS pic.twitter.com/7ret4u4ds5 \u2014 Sandra Gonzalez (@TheSandraG) September 13, 2016\n\n\u201cSaddening and disheartening\u201d\n\nLochte\u2019s fellow cast members rallied around the Olympic champ after Monday\u2019s incident.\n\nProfessional dancer Witney Carson, who this year is paired with Robert Van Winkle, known best as Vanilla Ice, said she\u2019d never seen anything like the incident during her time on the show.\n\n\u201cI think it was just saddening and disheartening more than anything because this is such a positive show and we\u2019re all about putting people in a positive light,\u201d she said. \u201cFor somebody to want to ruin that for Ryan is just really, really hard.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a hero and a great guy on top of that\u201d\n\nVan Winkle also offered Lochte his support.\n\n\u201cHe won the gold medal for this country, folks. Get over the bull story, whatever. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said. \u201cHe\u2019s a hero and he\u2019s a great guy on top of that.\u201d\n\nFormer NFL wide receiver Calvin Johnson, Jr. told CNN the \u201cunfortunate\u201d event no doubt put \u201ca damper\u201d on Lochte\u2019s debut, but said he gave his fellow dancer a pep talk backstage.\n\n\u201cYou know, you have to keep pushing, have another great week next week,\u201d he said. \u201cIt sucks to have somebody like that in the crowd do those kinds of things. Nobody\u2019s perfect. Everybody makes mistakes.\u201d\n\n\u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d airs Mondays on ABC.\n\nAdditional reporting by Chloe Melas.", "images":
