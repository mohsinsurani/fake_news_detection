When the Menendez brothers were tried on national TV for brutally killing their parents in Beverly Hills, their story became a national obsession. Now, the first edition of this anthology series delves into the players, the crime and the media circus, detailing the day-to-day battles of the trial and unveiling the shocking truth of what really went down when the cameras stopped rolling.\u201d\n\nHere is the trailer:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWa1SN0MNwY\n\nLyle and Erik Menendez were the sons of entertainment executive Jose Menendez and former schoolteacher Mary Louis \u201cKitty\u201d Menendez. On August 20, 1989, 21-year-old Lyle and 18-year-old Erik shot and killed their parents in their Beverly Hills home at 722 North Elm Drive and then went dinner and the movies with friends as an alibi. When they got home, they called 9-1-1. The brothers were considered suspects but the police had no evidence to connect them to the killings. Erik confessed to his psychologist.\n\nThe brothers were tried separately. The first two trials resulted in hung juries. They were convicted of murder at the third trial and were sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole in 1996. The trial aired on CourtTV in 1993, two years before the O.J. Simpson trial.\n\nLaw & Order: True Crime season 1 cast Gus Halper (Power, Public Morals) as Erik Menendez, who along with his brother Lyle Menendez, went to jail for life, without the possibility of parole for murdering their parents in a courtroom sensation that shocked the nation.\n\nDick Wolf and NBC\u2019s upcoming scripted anthology drama Law & Order: True Crime season 1 will be written by Rene Balcer (Law & Order), who will executive produce the series with Wolf, Peter Jankowski and Arthur W. Forney.\n\nFalco, who also appeared on shows Horace and Pete, 30 Rock, Oz and Homicide: Life on the Street, was cast in February.", "images": ["https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/tony_sokol_bio.jpg?resize=200%2C200&filter=grayscale", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/edie_falco.jpg?fit=1725%2C792", "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/edie_falco.jpg?resize=768%2C432"], "top_img": "https://www.denofgeek.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/edie_falco.jpg?fit=1725%2C792", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Sokol", "Ron Hogan", "Joseph Baxter", "Alec Bojalad", "John Saavedra", "Kayti Burt", "Rosie Fletcher", "Lee Parham"], "canonical_link": "https://www.denofgeek.com/tv/law-order-true-crime-the-menendez-murders-trailer-drops/", "title": "Law & Order True Crime: The Menendez Murders Trailer Drops", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#d23226", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "p": {"domain_verify": "1893a020468964417f83c6a42b6791cf"}, "description": "Killers or victims?
