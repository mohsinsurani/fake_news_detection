NBC has long said the decision was based on ratings, and the network declined to comment on Wednesday. But fans and journalists like then-New York Times media critic Brian Stelter, who detailed the tension between Lauer and Curry in his 2013 book \u201cTop of the Morning,\u201d believe Lauer had something to do with her departure.\n\nIn an interview on CBS This Morning on Wednesday, co-anchor Gayle King said to Curry, \u201cIt was viewed that a very powerful man, meaning Matt Lauer, derailed your career.\u201d Curry \u2014 after joking, \u201cDon\u2019t worry, I\u2019m not going to start crying\u201d \u2014 responded, \u201cYou should ask someone else, I\u2019m not the one to ask about that \u2026 I don\u2019t know what was all behind it. I do know that it hurt like hell.\u201d\n\nAsked if she thought Lauer \u2013 who was fired in November over claims of sexual misconduct \u2013 abused his power, Curry said, \u201cI\u2019m trying to do no harm in these conversations. I can tell you that I am not surprised by the allegations.\u201d\n\nWhen King asked Curry whether she \u201cheard things\u201d or \u201cknew things\u201d while she was at NBC, Curry responded: \u201cI\u2019m trying not to hurt people and I know what it\u2019s like to be publicly humiliated. I never did anything wrong to be publicly humiliated, and I don\u2019t want to cause that kind of pain to somebody else.\n\n\u201cBut I can say that I, because you\u2019re asking me a very direct question, I would be surprised if many women did not understand that there was a climate of verbal harassment that existed.\u201d\n\nAfter Lauer\u2019s firing, some of Curry\u2019s fans took to social media to speculate how she felt about the news. The meme \u201cSomewhere Ann Curry\u201d imagined the former co-anchor greeting the news in various ways, for instance, \u201cSomewhere Ann Curry is breaking out that champagne.\u201d\n\nCurry told People this week that she didn\u2019t revel in Lauer\u2019s firing at all. Instead, she said: \u201cI wish I could say that I was celebrating. But actually I immediately checked myself. Because I knew women had suffered.\u201d\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-824491936.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C130px%2C4765px%2C3179px&resize=160%2C106&strip", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/washington-politics-unity.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Begley"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5105990/ann-currys-complex-relationship-with-matt-lauer-and-the-today-show/", "title": "Ann Curry's History With Matt Lauer and the Today Show", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ann Curry gained national attention for her emotional goodbye when she was fired from the Today show.", "og": {"title": "Ann Curry's Complex Relationship With Matt Lauer and 'Today'", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5105990/ann-currys-complex-relationship-with-matt-lauer-and-the-today-show/", "description": "Her emotional goodbye in 2012 is a landmark moment in morning television", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5105990/ann-currys-complex-relationship-with-matt-lauer-and-the-today-show/", "description": "Ann Curry gained national attention for her emotional goodbye when she was fired from the Today show.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5105990/ann-currys-complex-relationship-with-matt-lauer-and-the-today-show/", "title": "Ann Curry's Complex Relationship With Matt Lauer and 'Today'", "description": "Her emotional goodbye in 2012 is a landmark moment in morning television", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ann-curry-matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUtEn5tGsSI"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
