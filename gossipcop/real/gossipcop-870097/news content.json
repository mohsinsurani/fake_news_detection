I think we\u2019ve done it well, but it doesn\u2019t stop me from freaking out.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

I don\u2019t want the nanny to be doing everything,\u201d adds the mother of one.\n\nBobby Bank/Getty Images\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Are Maks and Peta Ready For Baby #2?! Val Says \u201cThey\u2019re Pretty Serious About It\u201d\n\n\n\nMurgatroyd says the family finds time to spend together often during the day, playing and reading books before heading to work. And sometimes, Shai \u2014 who has taken to pointing out Mommy, Daddy and Uncle Val on the tour\u2019s posters \u2014 even gets a chance to watch the show and have a moment on the stage with his parents.\n\n\u201cHe comes backstage and watches half the show sometimes,\u201d Murgatroyd says. \u201cIt\u2019s so cute. He loves it and is clapping with the music.\u201d\n\nBoth parents say they\u2019re incredibly thankful they\u2019re able to make it work so that Shai is able to come with them on tour. As Murgatroyd explains, \u201cI would never be able to go on tour without him.\u201d", "images":
