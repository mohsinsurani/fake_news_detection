While in La La Land, the talk show host caught up with Jason Kennedy at E! News \u2014 and he offered some pretty juicy scoop.\n\nWhen the E! host asked Andy to share a time that a WWHL interview didn't go as planned, Andy responded with candor. \"Amber Rose ... didn't want to answer any of my shady questions,\" he said. \"She turned to me, she goes, \u2018Am I a horrible guest?' I go, 'You are in the running for one of the worst guests we've ever had.'\" Check out part of that interview in the clip, above.\n\nAndy also opened up about questions that he was nervous to ask on his show. \"I got nervous asking Oprah if she'd been with a woman,\" he said. \"I got nervous asking Shaq how big his dick was.\" Fair enough!\n\nKennedy had one more big question for the WWHL host: Will Kim Zolciak-Biermann return to The Real Housewives of Atlanta? \"I think she's done,\" Andy confessed. \"She walked out of [The Season 10] reunion and I was like, 'OK, I've seen the last of that wig at these reunions.'\"\n\nWatch Andy spill more tea in the clip below.\n\nEvery night Sunday through Thursday at 11/10c, Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen brings you lively conversations about everything in the world of entertainment, politics, and pop culture.
