And after you think Sonja, you probably picture her, glass of wine in hand, the life of the party.\n\nThat was exactly the setting in which I met her at the opening of the new TMPL gym location. Morgan, dressed in head-to-toe sequins, was the center of attention, people hanging on her every word. Luckily, I was able to steal her away for a few minutes to talk her holiday favorites, the new season of RHONY, and which co-star would get coal from her this year.\n\nFinish this sentence for us: For Sonja, it\u2019s not the holidays without\u2026\n\nWithout real cranberry sauce. Right? And also Sonja Morgan designs!\n\nAre you excited for your fashion line in 2019?\n\nOh, great stuff for the fashion line\u2014I\u2019m teaming up with Susanne Bartsch because I love her and her dedication to supporting AIDS research, which I also have been an advocate for. And for the show, season ten is amazing. [At this point, Morgan steps away from the interview for a few seconds to tell a drag queen walking by that she looks great, and that she is a Sagittarius, which felt like the most Sonja Morgan moment ever.]\n\n\n\nAre you still vegan?\n\nLast year, season nine, I was trying to be vegan and people said no you\u2019re vegetarian darling 'cause you wear leather and I was crushed. I was eating oysters and I thought those were vegan cause they were raw\u2014no, no, no. I learned a lot\u2014so I'm vegetarian but once in a while I\u2019ll have a hamburger or hot dog. Everything in moderation!\n\nYou\u2019ve been very philanthropic throughout past seasons. What inspired you to be involved with the toy drive this year?\n\nIt\u2019s such a great cause! I brought three bags of toys: eight barbies, three footballs, three magic eight balls.\n\nSince we\u2019re at the David Barton and Susanne Bartsch\u2019s Toy Drive, was there a toy you got as a kid that was your favorite?\n\nYou could never have enough stuffed animals!\n\nIf you had to give one of your co-stars coal for Christmas, which one would it be?\n\nOh I\u2019d love to do that to Ramona because I love her and she\u2019d get such a kick out of it.\n\nWhat is the best thing you learned about yourself from filming?\n\nWell every year I learn to not take myself seriously and that you have to laugh at yourself.\n\nRelated Story A Real Housewives of NYC Social Clout Ranking\n\nRelated Story The Forgotten Real Housewives of New York", "images":
