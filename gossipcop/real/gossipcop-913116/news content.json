I feel like I\u2019ve been here before. Gosh, I really think I know this (place)\u2019.\n\n\u2018I actually took a good look at the house and realised it was the Salvatore House from (The Vampire Diaries) pilot. Isn\u2019t that hilarious? Because we shot the pilot in Vancouver.\n\n\u2018And the backyard of it, which is so gorgeous, is where we built our cemetery. That was a nice flashback!,\u2019 Julie spilled.\n\nThis is all too much for any supernatural, drama loving, Ian Somerhalder-obsessed heart to handle.\n\nMORE : Ian Somerhalder admits \u2018freaking out\u2019 Nikki Reed as he destroyed her contraception\n\nMORE : Headed for splitsville?
