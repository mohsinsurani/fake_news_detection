You got to a point where you told me straight up, you were like, \u2018Mom, I have to leave here to live my life.\u2019 I remember thinking to myself, as devastated as I was, I was like, \u2018He\u2019s right. The time is now. He\u2019s 15. It\u2019s time for him to leave the house.\u2019\u201d\n\nJaden, now 19, was present for the parenting conversation with his mom, sister Willow Smith and grandmother Adrienne Banfield-Jones. Jada added that she felt comfortable with Jaden leaving the nest because of his maturity level and because he was already managing his own life.\n\nBut for Jaden, raised by famous parents Jada and Will Smith, he said he most needed to get out of the Hollywood bubble.\n\n\u201cIt just makes you appreciate being at home, being with your parents, spending quality time with your family,\u201d he said about moving out. \u201cYou get out into the world and you just understand things.\u201d\n\nJada and Will\u2019s parenting style has always been a hot topic. The freedom they give their children often seems to spark a debate. In 2016, Will confessed that their hands-off parenting approach may have been a \u201cmistake.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think we may have gone too far,\u201d he shared on BBC Radion 1Xtra. But Will had nothing but compliments to share about his son, who also shocked fans when he joined the Louis Vuitton womenswear campaign wearing a skirt. \u201cJaden is 100 percent fearless, he will do anything,\u201d Will said. \u201cSo as a parent, it\u2019s scary, it\u2019s really terrifying \u2014 but he is completely willing to live and die by his own artistic decisions and he just doesn\u2019t concern himself with what people think.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/jaden-smith-jada-pinkett-smith1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/jaden-smith-jada-pinkett-smith1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/jaden-smith-jada-pinkett-smith1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/06/04/jada-pinkett-smith-explains-why-son-jaden-moved-out-at-15/", "title": "Jada Pinkett Smith explains why son Jaden moved out at 15", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
