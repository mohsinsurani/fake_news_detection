Louis is also part of Prince William\u2019s full name of William Arthur Philip Louis and Prince George\u2019s full name of George Alexander Louis. The name holds great meaning to William\u2019s own father, Prince Charles, whose beloved great-uncle and mentor, Earl Louis Mountbatten, was assassinated by the IRA in 1979.\n\nThe royal baby\u2019s middle names of Charles and Arthur also hold special meaning. Charles, of course, is in honor of the baby boy\u2019s grandfather, Prince Charles. And the name Arthur is a family tradition. Both dad William and grandfather Charles have it as a middle name. Arthur was also the name of Queen Victoria\u2019s third son (and seventh child) and was said to be her favorite child.\n\nThe name Arthur, which means \u201cbear\u201d in Celtic, is also rooted in mythology. King Arthur is a legendary figure who was head of the kingdom Camelot and the Knights of the Round Table in medieval times.\n\nWhile Will and Kate waited four days before revealing their new baby\u2019s name, that didn\u2019t keep British oddsmakers from making predictions (Albert and Arthur were early favorites). William also teased his son\u2019s name as he left the hospital. \u201cYou\u2019ll find out soon enough,\u201d he said with a smile.\n\nAnd eagle-eyed fans even spotted a suspicious web page on the royal family\u2019s official website with a URL containing the name Prince Albert \u2014 one of the top predictions.\n\nThe name Louis comes as a surprise as it was trailing behind in 10th place among oddsmakers. \u201cPrince Louis has caught both bookies and punters by surprise,\u201d Alex Apati of Ladbrokes said. \u201cWith it being one of Prince George\u2019s middle names fans didn\u2019t see it as an obvious front runner for Kate and Will\u2019s second son.\u201d\n\nPapixs/Abaca/Sipa/AP\n\nBig brother Prince George was also given a name with special meaning by the royal parents after his birth. His full name, George Alexander Louis, was chosen with love and a nod to history.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Prince William and Kate Middleton Begin Life as a Family of 5: \u2018It Completes Them\u2019\n\nThe name George carries a lot of sentimental meaning to William\u2019s grandmother, Queen Elizabeth, as it was the name picked by her beloved father when he became King George VI in 1936. Alexander is believed to have been picked by the couple to honor the Queen, whose middle name is Alexandra. And Louis, of course, is special to the royal family \u2014 now the two royal brothers share the name.\n\nTim Rooke/REX/Shutterstock\n\nWatch the full episode of Raising a Royal streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nWhen it came to choosing a name for their second-born child, Princess Charlotte, the royal parents paid tribute to William\u2019s late mother, Princess Diana, and the almost 3-year-old princess\u2019s full name is Charlotte Elizabeth Diana.\n\nWill and Kate represented the baby\u2019s grandfather, Prince Charles, by going for the female version of his name. And they included Princess Diana, which was a popular choice with friends and admirers of her legacy. They also added the ultimate nod to great-granny and reigning monarch Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images/PA Wire\n\nThe baby prince was born on Monday at 11:01 a.m. at 8lbs, 7oz. Just seven hours after giving birth to her third child, Kate Middleton appeared (in heels!) on the steps of the Lindo Wing at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital on Monday evening with Prince William by her side to introduce their new baby boy to the world.\n\nKate\u2019s younger sister, Pippa, was one of the royal baby\u2019s first visitors. Pippa, who is reportedly expecting her first child with husband James Matthews, arrived at Kensington Palace just one day after the prince was born.\n\nCarole Middleton arrived at Kensington Palace on Wednesday to meet her newest grandson and to check in on daughter, Kate Middleton.\n\nDavid Fisher/REX/Shutterstock\n\nAfter the royal baby\u2019s birth, Prince Charles released a humorous statement on behalf of himself and wife Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall.\n\n\u201cWe are both so pleased at the news,\u201d Charles said in a statement. \u201cIt is a great joy to have another grandchild, the only trouble is I don\u2019t know how I am going to keep up with them.\u201d\n\nQueen Elizabeth celebrated the latest addition to her family with a quick horseback ride through the grounds of Windsor Castle, where she is staying with husband Prince Philip, who is still recovering from hip surgery.", "images":
