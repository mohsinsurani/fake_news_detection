Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted holding hands as they arrived to the Lumiere de Vie Hommes Launch yacht party in NYC on Saturday, October 13, before spending the evening apart.\n\n\u201cJamie was holding Katie\u2019s hand when they got out of their car and then they walked onto the boat together,\u201d an onlooker told Us Weekly about their arrival at Chelsea Piers prior to the event.\n\nThe insider noted that \u201cJamie held her hand as she stepped up onto the ramp and they looked very much like a couple,\u201d before the pair \u201cwalked quickly through the party and were taken to private quarters in the back, where Katie stayed the rest of the night.\u201d\n\nHowever, just because the 39-year-old Dawson\u2019s Creek alum stayed put, it didn\u2019t stop Foxx, 50, from embracing the celebration.\n\n\u201cJamie went to the DJ booth and started spinning for the party,\u201d the source told Us of the Collateral actor. \u201cHe was playing lots of \u201990ss hip-hop and hyping the party up, he really made everyone turn up and was a great DJ.\u201d\n\nThe source added that Foxx even took four shots of Patron in 20 minutes before he quipped, \u201cs\u2013t I\u2019m drunk now!\u201d to the crowd.\n\nFoxx and Holmes\u2019 outing comes just two months after the pair finally confirmed their nearly five-year relationship during a PDA-packed beach outing after shying away from getting cozy together in public for years.\n\n\u201cThey were totally engaged with each other,\u201d a beachgoer explained to Us in August. \u201cThey were never on their phones. She had this incredible smile on her face. She looked smitten.\u201d\n\nThe couple was spotted the following month working out together while Holmes visited her beau in Atlanta where he was filming the upcoming movie Just Mercy with Michael B. Jordan.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Katie-Holmes-Jamie-Foxx-Lumiere-De-Vie-Hommes-Launch-Event-Aboard-Superyacht-Utopia-IV.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Katie-Holmes-Jamie-Foxx-Lumiere-De-Vie-Hommes-Launch-Event-Aboard-Superyacht-Utopia-IV.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Katie-Holmes-Jamie-Foxx-Lumiere-De-Vie-Hommes-Launch-Event-Aboard-Superyacht-Utopia-IV.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-held-hands-looked-very-much-like-a-couple-at-nyc-event/", "title": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx Held Hands, 'Looked Very Much Like a Couple' at NYC Event", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted at a New York City event on Saturday, October 13, where they held hands and 'looked very much like a couple' \u2014 details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx Held Hands, 'Looked Very Much Like a Couple' at NYC Event", "description": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted at a New York City event on Saturday, October 13, where they held hands and 'looked very much like a couple' \u2014 details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-held-hands-looked-very-much-like-a-couple-at-nyc-event/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:00:20+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Katie-Holmes-Jamie-Foxx-Lumiere-De-Vie-Hommes-Launch-Event-Aboard-Superyacht-Utopia-IV.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Katie-Holmes-Jamie-Foxx-Lumiere-De-Vie-Hommes-Launch-Event-Aboard-Superyacht-Utopia-IV.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-10-14T17:18:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:00:20+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx Held Hands, 'Looked Very Much Like a Couple' at NYC Event", "description": "Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx were spotted at a New York City event on Saturday, October 13, where they held hands and 'looked very much like a couple' \u2014 details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/Katie-Holmes-Jamie-Foxx-Lumiere-De-Vie-Hommes-Launch-Event-Aboard-Superyacht-Utopia-IV.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539537528.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
