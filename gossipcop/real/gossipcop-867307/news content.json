He was found in possession of less than one ounce of marijuana and drug-related objects, according to a report obtained by PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cBasically, I\u2019ve been listening to America and Stevie Wonder and the O Brother, Where Art Thou? soundtrack,\u201d Carter says about how he\u2019s carrying on after the incident.\n\nAllen Berezovsky/Getty Image\n\nCarter\u2019s girlfriend, Madison Parker, was in the car with him and was also arrested. Just before the arrest, the pair was in North Carolina for a club appearance on Friday. Carter claims he decided to purchase an inexpensive car to avoid wasting money on rentals because he suffers from severe anxiety over flying stemming from watching the 9/11 terrorist attacks.\n\n\u201cI opened for Michael Jackson Sept. 9 and 10 in 2001. We all left the morning of Sept. 11 and watched the Trade Centers get hit across the Hudson River, and I saw it with my own eyes and I saw people jumping out of the buildings and burned,\u201d says Carter.\n\nCarter says the car he bought was \u201ca lemon, so the alternator was shot, and then it kept dying.\u201d After discovering the windows were stuck in the down position and the car\u2019s locking system gave out, Carter \u201cput my girlfriend in the back of the car and I guarded the car all night for eight hours,\u201d he claims.\n\nAfter tweeting about missing his Saturday show with Flo Rida in Kansas City, Missouri, due to \u201ctransportation issues,\u201d Carter says he changed routes to head to Alabama, and that\u2019s when he was stopped at an AutoZone in Georgia to fix his alignment after getting a new tire. He was then approached by police after a motorcyclist had reported him for reckless driving.\n\n\u201c[They] forcefully grabbed me out,\u201d claims Carter. \u201c[I] stepped outside. I say, \u2018I invoke the right to speak to my attorney,\u2019 and they disregarded that, they revoked that immediately. They said, \u2018Is there anything illegal in the car?\u2019 I said, \u2018I have marijuana in the car.'\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Aaron Carter Hits Back at Brother Nick After DUI Arrest and Alleges He Was Targeted Because He\u2019s Famous\n\nGeorgia authorities previously refuted Carter\u2019s claims of police aggression to PEOPLE. \u201cThe incident report reads that [Carter] was cooperate with the deputies and there was no incident between him and the deputies during arrest,\u201d said Capt. Floyd Canup of the Habersham County Sheriff\u2019s Office.\n\nHowever, Canup said that Carter\u2019s girlfriend \u2013 who was in the car at the time \u2013 failed to follow deputies\u2019 commands and was arrested for obstruction of law enforcement officers, as well as possession of drug-related objects and possession of marijuana.\n\nCarter\u2019s rep, Jonathan Ward, previously told PEOPLE exclusively that the star has \u201cnothing against the police\u201d and understands they were doing their job. \u201cMadison has never been arrested \u2026 she was scared, as anyone would be. She apologizes, in particular to Aaron\u2019s fans,\u201d Ward added.\n\nCarter claims he did not have any alcohol or drugs in his system at the time of his arrest, though he admitted to smoking marijuana \u201cnine hours before that\u201d for his anxiety, chronic pain and to increase his appetite.\n\nET\n\n\u201cI do not drink alcohol at all,\u201d says Carter, who claims he suffers from a medical condition called hiatal hernia that prevents him from consuming any type of alcohol. However, he added he will occasionally enjoy beer.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll occasionally have a sip of a beer or something like that, but I can\u2019t even drink IPAs,\u201d he says. \u201cI can\u2019t drink anything like that. I have to drink the lightest beer possible that\u2019s not hoppy. I don\u2019t drink any hard liquor.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Aaron Carter Opens Up About Eating Disorder & Slams Hard Drug Rumors\n\nDuring the interview, Carter also admitted to previously being on pain medication \u2014 which he has since stopped taking \u2014 due to a jaw injury and claims he is not taking any other drugs.\n\n\u201cNo. Nothing. Zero. I am willing to do a polygraph test,\u201d he says. \u201cI take Xanax, Propranolol for high blood pressure medication and I took oxycodones for my mouth.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s hoping to get a message across to his fans claiming he needs to seek professional help for drug addiction.\n\n\u201cIt hurts real bad because people don\u2019t know me, and I have no control over it, and this is the way I am,\u201d he says. \u201cI have a medical condition. When I was 19 years old, I got an endoscopy done in Tennessee and I was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia. The doctor told me I have to keep stress out of my life, or else it\u2019s gonna take a toll on me and I can develop cancer.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t need help,\u201d he adds. \u201cWhat I need is for people to understand that I\u2019m human and that I make mistakes just like every other human in this world, but I would never risk my life or my girlfriend\u2019s life.\u201d\n\nWhile Carter forcefully denies he\u2019s ever smoked crack cocaine, meth or taken heroin, he says his biggest mistake is trying ecstasy \u201ca couple of times\u201d when he was 16 years old.\n\n\u201cI do not drink,\u201d he says, again. \u201cHire a polygraph person, a professional. Strap me up.\u201d", "images":
