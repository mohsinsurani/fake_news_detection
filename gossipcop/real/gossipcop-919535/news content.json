We feel so badly for the seven-year-old.\n\nRelated: Stephen Belafonte Claims Ex Mel B Is An Addict\n\nAs you may recall, back in December, Frankel sued Hoppy for custody of their shared child. On Thursday, the Bravolebrity faced off against Jason in court, as the two appeared before a Manhattan judge. According to an E! News source, Judge Michael Katz ultimately ruled that Frankel and Hoppy need to get forensic evaluations done with their daughter.\n\nThe insider shared:\n\n\u201cBack in 2013 when the divorce and custody initially happened, this same doctor did a forensic custody evaluation at the time. The judge today ordered that same doctor do another forensic custody evaluation to update his first report from 2013. He will meet with Bryn and Jason, and then Bryn with Bethenny \u251c\u00f3\u0393\u00e9\u00bc\u0393\u00c7\u00a3 separately but in person \u251c\u00f3\u0393\u00e9\u00bc\u0393\u00c7\u00a3 and observe each of them with the child.\u201d\n\nWhile we bet Bethenny is annoyed by this legal hoop, it\u2019s certainly a fair way to assess Bryn\u2019s respective relationships with her mom and dad. The tipster continued:\n\n\u201cThey are due back in court on May 10th and the evaluations are to be completed by then, that\u2019s why the judge gave them so much time between now and then.\u201d\n\nWe can\u2019t blame the Bravo personality for being skittish around her baby daddy. Last October, Hoppy struck a plea deal after stalking and harassing his former flame. The businessman was ordered to comply with an order of protection for six months and obey all laws, and if he did, his case could be dismissed.\n\nThe protective order is slated to expire on April 20. Man, oh man.\n\nHopefully, this family feud hasn\u2019t caused any mental distress for Jason and Bethenny\u2019s innocent daughter. *Sigh*\n\n[Image via Michael Carpenter/WENN.]", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2099999%2099999%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20150%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20300%2049%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20316%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bethenny-frankel-jason-hoppy-court-ordered-evaluations-with-daughter.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/bethenny-frankel-jason-hoppy-court-ordered-evaluations-with-daughter.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://perezhilton.com/bethenny-frankel-jason-hoppy-court-ordered-forensic-custody-evaluations-with-daughter-bryn/", "title": "Bethenny Frankel & Ex Jason Hoppy Ordered By Judge To Complete Forensic Custody Evaluations With Daughter Bryn", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "fb": {"pages": 1028334267217239}, "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bethenny Frankel & Ex Jason Hoppy Ordered By Judge To Complete Forensic Custody Evaluations With Daughter Bryn - Perez Hilton", "description": "Bethenny Frankel\u2018s custody war with ex Jason Hoppy is far from over.
