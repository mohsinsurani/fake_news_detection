Prime Minister Theresa May and Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn were among the politicians in attendance.\n\nSpeaking before the memorial, the Bishop of Kensington, who has worked with the west London community since the fire, said: \"I am sure that the presence of the royal family will be a reassurance and support to those at the heart of this service.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe memorial was designed to remember those who died and to give thanks for everyone who assisted on the ground at the time of the tragedy and since it. St Paul's Cathedral said it had worked with residents to hold a service that \"will enable the nation to stand together with those directly affected by the Grenfell Tower fire and together express hopes for the future.\"\n\nA Green For Grenfell banner adorned with a heart was carried into the cathedral and a pre-recorded sound montage from people from the Grenfell community was played during the service, The Evening Standard reports. It was due to conclude with bereaved family members and survivors leaving together holding white roses.\n\nGetty Images\n\nEarlier this week, Kate Middleton was on Santa duty when she gave out presents to families during her visit to The Rugby Portobello Trust's community centre in North Kensington. The Trust, which offers support services for youth and parents, played an important part in helping the community recover from the devastating blaze.", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/sites/elle/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/1024x512/landscape-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/1024x734/gallery-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg?resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/1024x512/landscape-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Frost"], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/uk/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40509/prince-william-kate-middleton-prince-harry-grenfell-tower-fire-memorial-service/", "title": "Prince William, Kate Middleton And Prince Harry Remember Victims Of The Grenfell Tower Fire At Memorial Service", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "ELLE", "title": "William, Kate And Harry Remember Grenfell Tower Fire Victims At Memorial Service", "description": "The royals joined survivors and families of the bereaved at St Paul's Cathedral.", "url": "http://www.elleuk.com/life-and-culture/culture/news/a40509/prince-william-kate-middleton-prince-harry-grenfell-tower-fire-memorial-service/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/1024x512/landscape-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg?resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 201742389861242}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ELLEuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-21T21:18:17Z", "published_time": "2017-12-14T12:00:00Z", "section": "Culture", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@ELLEUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/1024x512/landscape-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg?resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "W6SOBCzCmb2sA5l3z9YK1yO7I7bPYArVQCP09_e2zck", "title": "Prince William, Kate Middleton And Prince Harry Remember Victims Of The Grenfell Tower Fire At Memorial Service", "description": "Members of the royal family have joined survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire and families of the bereaved at a memorial service held exactly six months after the tragedy on 14 June.", "keywords": "Prince William, Kate Middleton, Prince Harry, Grenfell Tower fire, memorial service, St Paul's Cathedral", "auto-publish": "never", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/640x640/square-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg?resize=320:*", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Life + Culture,life-and-culture,culture,prince harry,Prince William,kate middleton", "sailthru.date": "2017-12-14T12:00:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/1024x512/landscape-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/elleuk.cdnds.net/17/50/640x640/square-1513249529-kate-william-harry-memorial-service.jpg", "sailthru.socialtitle": "William, Kate And Harry Remember Grenfell Tower Fire Victims At Memorial Service", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513252800.0, "source": "https://www.elle.com", "summary": ""}
