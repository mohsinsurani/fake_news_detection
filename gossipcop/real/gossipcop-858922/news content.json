Her mother said he always encouraged her to sing the \u201cWizard of Oz\u201d ballad in public.\n\nThe \"One Love\" concert was dedicated to the 22 victims who were killed by a suicide bomber after Grande\u2019s May 22 \u201cDangerous Woman\u201d tour performance wrapped up. Money raised went to British Red Cross\u2019s Manchester Emergency fund, which has raisedover \u00a39.6 million ($16.8 million) for the victims and their families. An online shop has also been set up for people to buy merchandise benefitting the cause.\n\nSecurity for the show was heightened after another terror attack took place in London less than 24 hours earlier, according to CNN.\n\nThe \"One Love\" concert was dedicated to the 22 victims who were killed by a suicide bomber after Grande\u2019s May 22 \u201cDangerous Woman\u201d tour performance wrapped up.\n\nGrande and her manager, Scooter Braun, pulled the whole show together on short notice, while also making time to visit the victims and their families in hospital. She talked about meeting the mother of 15-year-old Olivia Campbell, who lost her life during the Manchester attack, during the show.\n\n\"As soon as I met her I started crying and I gave her a big hug and she said I should stop crying because Olivia would have wanted me to stop crying,\u201d Grande said. She added Campbell\u2019s mother told her that her daughter would\u2019ve \u201cwanted to hear the hits,\u201d so Grande listened, and rejigged her setlist to include some more upbeat songs like \u201cSide to Side.\u201d\n\nEarlier in the three-hour long show, Grande addressed her fans directly. \u201cI love you so, so much. Thank you so much for coming together and being so loving and strong and unified. I love you guys so much, and I think the kind of unity you're displaying is the medicine the world needs right now,\u201d she said.\n\nThe star-studded event at the Emirates Old Trafford Stadium also included performances and tributes from Justin Bieber, Katy Perry, Coldplay, Miley Cyrus, Oasis\u2019s Liam Gallagher, Pharrell Williams, the Black Eyed Peas, Take That, and many others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nPerformers and attendees alike proved the concert\u2019s mantra \u2014 love conquers hate and fear.\n\nAlso on HuffPost", "images":
