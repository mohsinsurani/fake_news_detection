Fisher admitted that she usually tries to correct people, but that she sometimes goes along with the assumption.\n\nFor instance, she almost got caught in a lie at the Vanity Fair Oscars afterparty. \u201cThe crowd parted and there was Lady Gaga and she\u2019s heading right toward me and she says, \u2018Thank you. Your performance in American Hustle, Amy\u2026.\u2019\u201d The actress is a big fan of the singer and didn\u2019t want to tell her the truth, so she went along with her presumed identity as Amy Adams. \u201cSo I just gracefully thanked her and bowed my head.\u201d As she continued to fall deeper into the lie, her true identity was almost exposed. \u201cI look over her shoulder and there\u2019s Amy Adams walking into the party.\u201d She quickly created a diversion by pointing to Adams and saying, \u201cThere\u2019s Isla Fisher. She\u2019s not even nominated for anything. What\u2019s she doing here?\u201d\n\nThe actress also recalled a time when a mother and her children spotted Fisher at IKEA and requested that she sing \u201cThat\u2019s How You Know,\u201d a song Adams performs in Enchanted. \u201cI\u2019m tone-deaf,\u201d Fisher prefaced before singing a few lines from the song to Kimmel. After hearing Fisher\u2019s rendition, the woman \u201cbacked away realizing that I was clearly not Amy Adams.\u201d\n\nIn order to avoid any more confusion, Fisher brought a PSA to explain the differences between the two actresses. \u201cI feel as though I should, this evening, set the record straight,\u201d she said while introducing the clip.\n\nThe PSA opens with Fisher standing in front of a white backdrop with a piano playing in the background. \u201cHello. I\u2019m Isla Fisher and I\u2019d like to clear something up,\u201d she began. \u201cI am not Amy Adams. Amy Adams and I are completely different people.\u201d\n\nFisher first explained that she and Amy Adams have different hair colors. \u201cAmy Adams has auburn red [hair]. My hair is light auburn red,\u201d she said. She then pointed out that they have had different roles. \u201cAmy Adams played Susan in Nocturnal Animals. I played Laura in Nocturnal Animals.\u201d\n\nThe actress also explained that they have different accomplishments. \u201cAmy Adams has five Oscar nominations,\u201d she said. \u201cI am a member of SAG.\u201d\n\nAnd Fisher joked that she and Adams might also be confused for another redheaded actress. \u201cAmy Adams played Maya in Zero Dark Thirty. Oh wait, no. That was Jessica Chastain,\u201d she said. \u201cOK, maybe it\u2019s a little hard to tell us apart,\u201d Fisher admitted. \u201cBut the point is when you come up to any of us and say \u2018I love you in Arrival,\u2019 it hurts because we weren\u2019t in Arrival.\u201d\n\nFisher concluded the PSA by stating, \u201cWe have totally different names, hence we are totally different people.\u201d She also wanted to remind everyone that she\u2019s \u201cnot Wendy from the hamburger commercials.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/isla_fisher_is_not_amy_adams-_screen_shot_0.jpg?w=928", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/isla_fisher_is_not_amy_adams-_screen_shot_0.jpg?w=928", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/isla-fisher-releases-mock-psa-remind-she-is-not-amy-adams-1046456/", "title": "Isla Fisher Releases Mock PSA to Remind Everyone That She Is Not Amy Adams", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The actress talked about the confusion on 'Jimmy Kimmel Live!'", "news_keywords": "Amy Adams, Isla Fisher, Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late-Night TV", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1046456, "title": "Isla Fisher Releases Mock PSA to Remind Everyone That She Is Not Amy Adams", "published_at": "2017-10-06 09:28:21", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/isla_fisher_is_not_amy_adams-_screen_shot_0.jpg?w=928", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Late-Night TV", "topics": "TV News", "body": "When visiting Jimmy Kimmel Live!\u00a0on Thursday, Isla Fisher talked about how fans constantly confuse her with actress Amy Adams.
