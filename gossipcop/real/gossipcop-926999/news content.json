She\u2019s so happy, and I\u2019m thrilled for her.\u201d\n\nWatch the full special Born Kardashian streaming now on PeopleTV.com, or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nThe exciting chapter comes in the midst of scandal: Tristan Thompson, Kardashian\u2019s boyfriend and the baby\u2019s father, has been accused of cheating on her with multiple women.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known that girl my entire life and she\u2019s a strong, resilient woman,\u201d said Hilton. \u201cI think that all she\u2019s focusing on right now is this baby.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Then & Now: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian & Tristan Thompson\u2019s Relationship Whirlwind \u2014How Did We Get Here?\n\nPlus, Hilton believes Kardashian has \u201csuch an incredible family\u201d by her side.\n\n\u201cHer mother [Kris Jenner] and all her sisters and everyone, they\u2019re so supportive and such a big family,\u201d Hilton said. \u201cShe\u2019s so lucky to have such an incredible support system because family is everything.\u201d\n\nStefanie Keenan/Getty\n\nHilton thinks it\u2019s particularly exciting that Kardashian had a baby girl \u2014 and she hopes to also have a girl when she starts a family with her fianc\u00e9 Chris Zylka in the future.\n\n\u201cI hope when I have my first baby it\u2019ll be a girl because the bond you have with your mother is amazing,\u201d she said.\n\nBut first will come the wedding, which Hilton says she\u2019ll start planning after her brother Barron Hilton\u2019s upcoming nuptials to socialite Tessa Gr\u00e4fin von Walderdorff in St. Barts.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

It\u2019s going to be a very weird mixture to have everyone, so I don\u2019t know. Maybe I do like the family wedding and then the fun, friend wedding \u2014 the after, after party wedding.\u201d\n\nFor Friday\u2019s Moroccan-themed event sponsored by Belvedere Vodka, Hilton chose to wear Zoe\u2019s Suzette dress because it had \u201cbridal vibes.\u201d A fan and friend of the designer, Hilton said she\u2019s \u201cproud\u201d Zoe and the empire she\u2019s built.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s a powerhouse,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve known her since I was a teenager and just to see her grow into such an incredible businesswoman is so inspiring, and I love it.\u201d\n\nThough fans have been rallying for a reboot of The Simple Life after seeing photos of Hilton and her former BFF Nicole Richie\u2019s reunion at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards in early April, Hilton said it would be tough to pull off.\n\n\u201cThey actually approached me [about it] last year,\u201d Hilton told PEOPLE. \u201cI was like, \u2018I\u2019m so different now and I don\u2019t know if I could go back to that character. I don\u2019t want to leave my fianc\u00e9. Nicole also has her two kids and she\u2019s so busy with her TV show [Great News], and I\u2019m so busy.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt would be so much fun if we both weren\u2019t basically married with me having a kid soon as well. We\u2019re both so busy, but it would be hilarious. Nobody is as funny as Nicole.\u201d", "images":
