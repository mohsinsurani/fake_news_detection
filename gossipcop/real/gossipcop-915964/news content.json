Wife Kimberly is pregnant, he announced on Instagram Friday, sharing a photo of their four children placing their hands on their mama\u2019s bare belly.\n\n\u201cThrilled beyond belief to announce that we are once again adding to our family \ud83d\ude0d,\u201d Van Der Beek captioned the adorable shot.\n\n\u201cAnd I say \u2018beyond belief\u2019 because some people are probably wondering if we\u2019re out of our minds,\u201d he added. \u201cWhich we might very well be \u2026 but I couldn\u2019t be more excited. Or grateful. Or in awe of @vanderkimberly \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\n\n\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u2764\u201d\n\nThe new baby will join big brother and sisters Emilia, 23 months, Annabel Leah, 4, Joshua, 6 next month, and Olivia, 7.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

The \u201csmall, spiritual ceremony\u201d took place in Tel Aviv, Israel, where the couple met in 2010.\n\nThe Don\u2019t Trust the B\u2014- in Apartment 23 alum opened up to PEOPLE this past August about his life as a father of four \u2014 including his household\u2019s favorite holiday.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve got kids who love Halloween so much they celebrate it throughout the year,\u201d he said. \u201cMy son, a month ago was like, \u2018Daddy, fog machine, please?\u2019 So we got out the fog machine, we got out the Halloween decorations, they wanted it spooky so we had spider webs up, they just love Halloween.\u201d\n\nMatt Winkelmeyer/Getty\n\nJames Van Der Beek and family\n\nFor more coverage, follow our babies magazine on Flipboard.\n\nVan Der Beek further explained that becoming a father changed his perspective on the work he chooses to do.\n\n\u201cThe second I had kids, they immediately became my priority and everything I did existed to support the life that was all about them in a good way,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s been fun about the work that I\u2019ve been doing is that it\u2019s so playful and kids bring out that playful side of you, so I think that\u2019s gone hand in hand.\u201d", "images":
