Officers arrived shortly thereafter and made contact with the person complained of, Farrah Abraham,\u201d a spokesperson for the Beverly Hills Police Department tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cA male adult hotel security officer reported that he asked Abraham to leave the hotel after she refused to disengage from a verbal altercation with hotel guests,\u201d says the spokesperson. \u201cThe security officer reported that Abraham struck him in the face with her forearm, grabbed his ear and pushed him in the face as he attempted to prevent her from re-entering the hotel. Officers noted that Abraham exhibited signs of intoxication during the investigation.\u201d\n\nAccording to the spokesperson, the victim \u201csustained minor injury and was not transported to a hospital.\u201d\n\nAbraham was arrested for misdemeanor battery and trespassing pursuant to a private person\u2019s arrest. She was booked at the Beverly Hills Jail and is being held on $500 bail.\n\n\u201cWe can confirm there was an incident involving a patron in the Polo Lounge this morning,\u201d a spokesperson for the hotel tells PEOPLE. \u201cAs this is an ongoing investigation with the Beverly Hills Police Department, we are unable to provide any further comment at this time.\u201d\n\nAbraham\u2019s rep tells PEOPLE, \u201cThis situation has been blown out of proportion.\u201d\n\n\u201cFarrah has not been charged and was released this afternoon,\u201d the rep continues. \u201cA misunderstanding occurred and there was no battery or trespassing. Farrah is the hardest working individual I know and sets very high standards of herself. She has been working on a number of deadlines for new projects and business ventures; she is immaculate in her work ethics and pushes herself harder than her team recommend sometimes. Farrah is a powerhouse and was having a business meeting in the hotel where the alleged incident happened. She is a very sweet and ambitious young woman who has been portrayed in a biased light on a reality TV show for many years.\u201d\n\nTMZ was the first to report the news of Abraham\u2019s arrest.\n\nAbraham, 27, documented her day at the luxury hotel Tuesday on social media. She was joined by her 9-year-old daughter Sophia and shared snaps of the two lounging by the pool.\n\nFarrah Abraham/Instagram\n\nFarrah Abraham/Instagram\n\nThe reality star also snapped a photo with
