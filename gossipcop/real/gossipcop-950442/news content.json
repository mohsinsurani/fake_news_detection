The design is named The Jane.\n\nThe Look What You Made Me Do hitmaker showed off a very toned figure with a tiny waistline and shapely legs as she flashed a pair of designer sunglasses that framed her face perfectly.\n\nLast week the pop princess slipped into a patriotic red, white and blue striped bikini as she and her love enjoyed a day of snorkeling in the sunshine.\n\nIsland life: The power couple has been at the beach destination for several days already and they seem to have deep tans as a result\n\nThe pair spent Independence Day with one another, dipping in and out of the crystal clear waters.\n\nThe stunning singer went make-up free for her swim in the ocean, tying back her blonde hair in a ponytail.\n\nJoe showcased his own toned torso in a pair of navy white striped swim shorts, with both carrying a snorkel and flippers.\n\nCute look: Swift had on a cute blue-and-white striped bikini by company Sold & Striped that had ties on the briefs. The design is named The Jane. The Look What You Made Me Do hitmaker showed off a very toned figure with a tiny waistline and toned legs as she flashed a pair of designer sunglasses that framed her face perfectly\n\nThey frolicked around in the sea for a while, taking turns floating on their backs and swimming side by side as Taylor enjoyed a break from her highly successful Reputation tour.\n\nThe duo could be seen cosying up in the water, the Blank Space hitmaker hugging the handsome actor from behind and planting sweet kisses on his shoulder.\n\nStrapping on some snorkels, goggles and flippers, they messed around in the water, making sure not to leave one another's side.\n\nShy for a reason: Swift has not been as open about her relationship with the actor as in the past there was too much focus on her love life: she has dated John Mayer and Harry Styles, among others\n\nThe luxury resort will have cost them a pretty penny to stay there.\n\nBut it won't exactly break the bank. Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk star, Joe, is thought to be worth around $250k, while his girlfriend is worth well over 100 times that, at a staggering $280million.\n\nDespite their fame, the duo have kept their relationship fairly private since rumours first emerged they were dating.\n\nJoe, who is best known for his role in the 2016 war drama has been attending some of Taylor's concerts as part of her Reputation tour.\n\nWanna hit the water? Behind the lovebirds was a catamaran boat that looked ready for takeoff\n\nBack to the hotel? After a while they seemed to want to head up the beach, but they may have just been in need of some shade\n\nLet's hit it: Joe took the lead and walked his lady love up the white sands of the Turks And Caicos beach\n\nIn March, the couple were pictured on a hike, yet before then they hadn't been seen since the Jingle Ball in New York in December where they were pictured holding hands.\n\nDuring the past year and half they've been dating the songstress has reportedly been spending a lot of time in London where Joe lives.\n\nAccording to The Sun, the singer had been renting a house in North London for their rendezvous and they are rumored to use disguises while going out and about in the city.\n\n'They're clearly serious,' an insider told E!. 'Taylor's met all of Joe's family. They've done many a Sunday roast together \u2014 in fact it happens without fail if she's here over a weekend\u2014and they seem very comfortable around her,\n\nCheers my love: Not wanting to kill the buzz, the famous pair took their drinks into the ocean\n\nMillions of reasons to celebrate: Her new tour has been making a fortune. She is reportedly worth almost $300m\n\n'His brothers all seem to be fans of them together as they've hung out with Taylor and Joe on several occasions.'\n\nTaylor previously dated British actor Tom Hiddleston for three months, with the couple not shying away from showing off their romance with lots of public outings \u2014 including her famous celeb packed July 4 shindig at her Rhode Island mansion.\n\nRyan Reynolds and Blake Lively, Gigi Hadid, Karlie Kloss, Ruby Rose and Uzo Aduba were all on hand to witness Hiddleswift in full PDA mode two years ago.\n\nTom's reputation as a uber-cool and suave actor went a little by the wayside when he wore a white tank-top with 'I [heart] TS' emblazoned on the front.\n\nThat short-lived relationship followed Taylor's split from Scottish DJ Calvin Harris in June 2016 after 15 months together.", "images": ["https://i.dailymail.co.uk/i/furniture/fff/hub_link.png",
