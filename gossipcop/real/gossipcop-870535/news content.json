It was about what she feared she might find.\n\nHudson chose the style for an upcoming film directed by singer Sia, and as she explained to Jimmy Kimmel Thursday night, her \"character is just a shaved-head kind of girl.\"\n\n\"It's funny, too, because when (the cut) first started, I didn't think about it because it was (for) the role,\" she explained. \"It was like, 'Oh, let's do this!'\"\n\nActress Kate Hudson attends the 21st Annual Urbanworld Film Festival at AMC Empire 25 theater on September 23, 2017 in New York City. J. Countess / WireImage\n\nSia and the actress' 6-year-old son, Bingham, did the honors, and as they got underway, Hudson suddenly focused on a newfound fear.\n\n\"Oh! What is the shape of my head going to look like?\" she recalled thinking. \"I really started to panic.\"\n\nBut Sia assured her she'd likely have a symmetrical and smooth dome under all that hair.\n\n\"(She) was like, 'I know it's going to be round. I know it!'\" Hudson laughed. \"And all of the sudden it was like a birthing, like, 'It's a boy!' But 'It's round!'\"\n\nWho knows what she was expecting \u2014 lumps, bumps, dents \u2014 but the fact that her head is perfectly lovely, just like the rest of her, came as no surprise to Kimmel.\n\n\"Well, who would have imagined your head would also be perfect?\" he deadpanned.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201703/x_tdy_shaved-heads-charlize-Theron-Natalie-Portman-Demi-Moore-today-170313-tease.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_39/1284495/kate-hudson-buzz-cut-today-tease-1-170925.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_39/1284497/kate-hudson-buzz-cut-today-inline-5-170925.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_39/1284495/kate-hudson-buzz-cut-today-tease-1-170925.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ree Hines"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/style/kate-hudson-reveals-what-really-made-her-panic-when-she-t117464", "title": "Kate Hudson reveals what really made her 'panic' when she shaved her head", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/style/kate-hudson-reveals-what-really-made-her-panic-when-she-t117464", "title": "Kate Hudson reveals the scariest part of shaving her head", "description": "It wasn't about what she lost.
