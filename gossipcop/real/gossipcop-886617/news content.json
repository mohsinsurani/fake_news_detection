Since the allegations against Weinstein came to light, McGowan has called out many other Hollywood insiders, including Ben Affleck. On Instagram she posted a screenshot from Twitter, saying a tweet prompted the social network to temporarily freeze her account.\n\nTWITTER HAS SUSPENDED ME. THERE ARE POWERFUL FORCES AT WORK. BE MY VOICE. #ROSEARMY #whywomendontreport A post shared by Rose McGowan (@rosemcgowan) on Oct 11, 2017 at 9:19pm PDT\n\nOthers on Twitter quickly rushed to her defense, noting how, more often than not, accounts that threaten even physical violence are allowed to stay. Many noted how far-right and white supremacists still remain on the platform while voices like McGowan\u2019s find themselves silenced.\n\nIn the meantime, my friend @rosemcgowan had her account suspended for calling out Harvey Weinstein for being a sexual predator. https://t.co/zjIty7ynnv \u2014 Shaun King (@ShaunKing) October 12, 2017\n\nAfter hours of silence, Twitter has finally issued a response. According to a tweet, Twitter suspended the account because she posted a \u201cprivate phone number.\u201d The company added that it is now in touch with McGowan.\n\nHere are the tweets:", "images": ["data:image/png;base64,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", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6916907&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.fastcompany.com/magazine/latest-cover.jpg", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/insta-icon-circle-in.svg", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/linkedin-icon-circle-li.svg", "https://grunerandjahr.112.2o7.net/b/ss/gjincfastcoprod/1/H.24.4--NS/0/5658306", "https://secure-us.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=us-805310h&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/tw-icon-circle-tw.svg", "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/10/p-mcgowan.jpg", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?event=init&tid=2613508785281&pd[em]=<hashed_email_address>&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1389601884702365&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://images.fastcompany.com/image/upload/v1576118408/fb-icon-circle-fb.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.fastcompany.net/image/upload/w_1280,f_auto,q_auto,fl_lossy/wp-cms/uploads/2017/10/p-mcgowan.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["About The Author", "Cale Is A Brooklyn-Based Reporter.
