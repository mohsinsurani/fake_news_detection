Oddly, the man stated that the woman's penchant for dropping turds in public is a right protected under the United States Constitution, although the nation's founding document guarantees no such bathroom privileges in explicit terms.\n\nLocal outlet KRDO interviewed Colorado Springs criminal defense attorney, Jeremy Lowe, about constitutionally protected public pooping. \u201cDefecating in someone\u2019s yard is definitely not protected under the First Amendment and it is actually a crime,\u201d the lawyer stated.\n\nEarlier this month, the Mad Pooper conjured a viral sh*t-storm after using the Budde family's front yard as a public toilet during her neighborhood jogs. The intrigue surrounding the Mad Pooper, who seemed remorseless as she left a trail of smelly terror in her wake, spawned something of a media frenzy. As a prize for her vile escapades, Charmin offered her a lifetime supply of free toilet paper -- which only seemed to further incentivize the act of pooping in public:", "images": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/i_HrXKiOSCo/hqdefault.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2706033/1200x600/scale"], "top_img": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2706033/1200x600/scale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Blum", "Published On At Am"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mad-pooper-colorado-jogger-apologizes-for-pooping-on-familys-lawn", "title": "The Mad Pooper Is Sorry For Repeatedly Pooping on Colorado Family's Lawn", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "thrillist editorial, nation, news, sam blum, standard, entertainment, food, recipe, video, movie and tv genres, streaming services, youtube, crime, family, [none]", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "description": "The Colorado Springs woman known as the \"Mad Pooper\" has apologized through an anonymous spokesperson.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Thrillist"}, "parsely-title": "The Mad Pooper Is Sorry For Repeatedly Pooping on Colorado Family's Lawn", "parsely-link": "https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mad-pooper-colorado-jogger-apologizes-for-pooping-on-familys-lawn", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2706033/1200x600/scale;", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-30T15:38:44.000Z", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-author": "Sam Blum", "parsely-tags": ",entertainment,news", "fb": {"pages": 101800100890, "app_id": 111767172173562}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.thrillist.com/fbihtml/news/nation/mad-pooper-colorado-jogger-apologizes-for-pooping-on-familys-lawn"}, "og": {"site_name": "Thrillist", "url": "https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mad-pooper-colorado-jogger-apologizes-for-pooping-on-familys-lawn", "type": "article", "title": "The Mad Pooper Is Sorry For Repeatedly Pooping on Colorado Family's Lawn", "description": "This just keeps getting weirder.", "image": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2706033/1200x600/scale;"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thrillist", "image": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2706033/1200x600/scale;", "description": "This just keeps getting weirder.", "title": "The Mad Pooper Is Sorry For Repeatedly Pooping on Colorado Family's Lawn"}, "placeholder": {"1": "ph", "2": "ph", "3": "ph", "4": "ph", "5": "ph", "6": "ph", "7": "ph", "8": "ph", "9": "ph"}, "next-head-count": 57}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thrillist.com", "summary": ""}
