That is when all the photographers got a little chaotic. (But it\u2019s Blake Lively so who can really blame them?)\n\nWho has time for screaming and demands in 2018? Not Blake!\n\nBlake Lively Models on the Met Gala Red Carpet Blake Lively telling photographers to \u201ccalm down\u201d at the Met Gala is a BIG mood. Posted by E! News on Monday, May 7, 2018\n\nWhen the paparazzi erupted, she took a brief moment from hitting each pose to say something we have all wanted to say at one point or another thus far in 2018.\n\n\u201cCALM DOWN!\u201d\n\nThe best part? They did. She spoke. They listened. Blake Lively has just done something no other celebrity has done. Calmed down crazy photographers without A) Throwing something at them, B) causing bodily harm or C) breaking their camera.\n\nAfter playfully, but totally seriously, telling everyone to take a chill pill she went back to effortlessly posing for pictures.\n\nLively\u2019s era fueled gown is an Atelier Versace. She told Vogue, \u201cThis year\u2019s may be my favorite dress ever.\u201d It executed this year\u2019s Met Gala them of \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination.\u201d The red dress took more than 600 hours to create with intricate beading throughout. Lively styles herself and knew she needed something great to go with her dress to pull it all together. So she enlisted the help of her friend and jewelry designer, Lorraine Schwartz. \u201cShe\u2019s looking at the beading of my dress and designing a piece based on that,\u201d Lively told E!News.\n\nHer heels came from Christian Louboutin. \u201cI just sent Lorraine Schwartz and Christian Louboutin my dress, and said, \u2018Ok let\u2019s do something special,'\u201d said the Gossip Girl actress. Lively continued to say that it\u2019s so special that, \u201cThey\u2019re making something custom for it. So it\u2019s kind of nice, because I have a bunch of artists around me who I have direct relationships with.\u201d\n\nWhen you are slaying a Versace gown, Louboutin shoes and custom jewelery and tell people to \u201ccalm down,\u201d they probably will.\n\nWhat has been your mood this 2018?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://cdn1.itmwpb.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/50n.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://cdn1.itmwpb.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/10d.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://cdn1.itmwpb.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/04d.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://d2isblg909whrf.cloudfront.net/themes/wbti/twitter.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2017/10/25124611/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/SmartSpeakerBTISuperior.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/APPLE-LOGO.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/admin-ajax.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://d2isblg909whrf.cloudfront.net/themes/wbti/facebook.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2018/05/08061447/rs_1024x759-180507182258-1024-met-gala-2018-blake-lively-1024x759.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2022/03/04102926/96.9appbanner-300x100.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://cdn1.itmwpb.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/03d.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://cdn1.itmwpb.com/wp-content/plugins/wcp-openweather/theme/default/assets/images/weather/01d.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2014/12/09161951/Cloings.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://d2isblg909whrf.cloudfront.net/themes/wbti/listen-live.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2018/05/08061447/rs_1024x759-180507182258-1024-met-gala-2018-blake-lively-1024x759.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304/https://www.wbti.com/2018/05/08/blake-lively-telling-met-gala-paparazzi-to-calm-down-is-the-mood-for-2018/", "title": "Blake Lively Telling Met Gala Paparazzi to \u201cCalm Down\u201d is the Mood for 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Blake Lively showed her mommy-side at this year", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"site_name": "WBTI", "locale": "en_us", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304im_/https://dehayf5mhw1h7.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/347/2018/05/08061447/rs_1024x759-180507182258-1024-met-gala-2018-blake-lively-1024x759.jpg", "title": "Blake Lively Telling Met Gala Paparazzi to \u201cCalm Down\u201d is the Mood for 2018", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822025304/https://www.wbti.com/2018/05/08/blake-lively-telling-met-gala-paparazzi-to-calm-down-is-the-mood-for-2018/", "description": "Blake Lively showed her mommy-side at this year\u2019s Met Gala.
