The country is divided. Sometimes that can make it tough to find common ground, but this year \u2026 this year, I think we should all take a deep breath, find the ability to forgive, and remind ourselves there is no difference so great that we can\u2019t overcome it,\u201d the Gilmore Girls alum, 39, concludes, before scooping chili out of a Crock-Pot into a bowl as the hashtag #CrockPotIsInnocent appears on the screen.\n\nThe promo is in response to the January 23 episode of This Is Us, which ended with Jack walking around the kitchen, tidying up. Before heading to bed, he turns off the family\u2019s Crock-Pot \u2014 but due to its old age and faulty switch, the slow cooker switched back on and started a fire that many believe took the beloved character\u2019s life. Following the episode, upset fans tweeted about Crock-Pots, with many saying they refuse to use the household appliance.\n\nThe outrage prompted series creator Dan Fogelman to tweet, \u201cTaking a moment to remind everyone that it was a 20 year old fictional crockpot with an already funky switch? Let\u2019s not just lump all those lovely hardworking crockpots together.\u201d\n\nCrock-Pot released its own statement a few days later, assuring viewers that the product is safe to use: \u201cCrock-Pot understands the concerns brought up by the recent episode of This Is Us, and we too are heartbroken by the latest development in Jack\u2019s story line. However, it is important that our consumers understand and have confidence that all Crock-Pot slow cookers exceed all internal testing protocols and all applicable industry safety standards and regulations as verified by independent third-party testing labs. For nearly 50 years, with over 100 million Crock-Pots sold, we have never received any consumer complaints similar to the fictional events portrayed in last night\u2019s episode. In fact, the safety and design of our product renders this type of event nearly impossible.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur hope is that the team at NBC\u2019s This Is Us will help us spread factual information regarding our product\u2019s safety. While we know their primary mission is to entertain \u2013 something they have continued to excel in \u2013 we also feel they have a responsibility to inform,\u201d the statement concluded. \u201cJust like many fans, we will be watching next week\u2019s episode to see how Jack\u2019s story progresses and, regardless of the outcome, we want consumers first and foremost to know they are safe when using their Crock-Pot.\u201d\n\nAs loyal fans of the hit NBC series know, this Sunday\u2019s episode of This Is Us is going to be a big one: viewers will finally find out what caused Jack\u2019s death. In an exclusive interview with Us Weekly, the Rocky Balboa star promised he is here for Us, saying he is open to giving heartbroken fans \u201chugs\u201d following the devastating reveal.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/this-is-us-super-bowl-crock-pot-commercial.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/this-is-us-super-bowl-crock-pot-commercial.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz-Stanton", "Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/milo-ventimiglia-asks-this-is-us-fans-forgive-crock-pot-super-bowl-ad/", "title": "Milo Ventimiglia Asks \u2018This Is Us\u2019 Fans to \u2018Forgive\u2019 in Crock-Pot Ad", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Super Bowl", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Milo Ventimiglia encourages \u2018This Is Us\u2019\u00a0fans to \u2018forgive\u2019 in a hilarious Crock-Pot Super Bowl ad \u2014 watch it now!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch\u00a0Milo Ventimiglia Ask\u00a0\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Fans to \u2018Forgive\u2019 in Funny Crock-Pot Ad", "description": "Milo Ventimiglia encourages \u2018This Is Us\u2019\u00a0fans to \u2018forgive\u2019 in a hilarious Crock-Pot Super Bowl ad \u2014 watch it now!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/milo-ventimiglia-asks-this-is-us-fans-forgive-crock-pot-super-bowl-ad/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-02-02T20:52:39+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/this-is-us-super-bowl-crock-pot-commercial.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/this-is-us-super-bowl-crock-pot-commercial.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-02-03T21:25:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-02-02T20:52:39+00:00"}, "author": "Leanne Aciz-Stanton", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch\u00a0Milo Ventimiglia Ask\u00a0\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Fans to \u2018Forgive\u2019 in Funny Crock-Pot Ad", "description": "Milo Ventimiglia encourages \u2018This Is Us\u2019\u00a0fans to \u2018forgive\u2019 in a hilarious Crock-Pot Super Bowl ad \u2014 watch it now!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/this-is-us-super-bowl-crock-pot-commercial.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517693133.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
