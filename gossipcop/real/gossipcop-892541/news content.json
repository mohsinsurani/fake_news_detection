The celeb mom told E! News that she\u2019s going to let Luna decide if and when to pierce her ears.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t have her ears pierced, and I\u2019m going to let her decide when she wants to do that,\u201d she said at a launch party for a new Forevermark jewelry line.\n\nTeigen\u2019s decision seems to have something to do with the fact that she wasn\u2019t allowed to decide about getting her own ears pierced as a child.\n\n\u201cI remember when I was little what I went through. My mom did it for me,\u201d she told E!.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BRKNFpmDuiU/?hl=en&taken-by=chrissyteigen\n\nThere is disagreement around when is the best time to get a little girl\u2019s ears pierced, and even doctors don\u2019t really have a straight answer.\n\n\u201cIf the piercing is performed carefully and cared for conscientiously, there is little risk, no matter what the age of the child,\u201d according to HealthyChildren.org. \u201cHowever, as a general guideline, postpone the piercing until your child is mature enough to take care of the pierced site herself.\u201d\n\nFor Dr. David Levine, it\u2019s all about waiting to see what an individual child wants.\n\n\u201cMy biggest advice to the parents, unless this is a cultural issue where everybody in the culture gets their kids\u2019 ears pierced in early childhood, I\u2019d like the kid to actually want it,\u201d he told CNN.\n\nHe also thinks it\u2019s important to discuss tattoos and piercings with your child, whether or not your child actually wants to get pierced or tattooed.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very similar when we talk to parents about the time to do the sex talk is at age 11, before they actually need it \u2026 even if it\u2019s not right at that moment, it will open up the conversation and keep the communication open on these issues as kids negotiate adolescence,\u201d Dr. Levine said.\n\nSo, Chrissy Teigen seems to have a great approach to this ear piercing thing \u2014 wait until Luna says she wants it.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BWRD9STjwsg/?hl=en&taken-by=johnlegend\n\nLuna is the first child for Teigen and her husband John Legend, but the couple have been open about their plans to have baby number two.\n\nGetty Images | Stephen Brashear\n\nTeigen was open about her struggles with infertility and the process of getting pregnant and getting to choose the sex of their first child. Sounds like a boy is what the family\u2019s preparing for next!\n\nYou can always count on Teigen to keep it real\u2014from losing baby weight to piercings, to dealing with infertility, this woman\u2019s open about it all, and we love her for it!", "images": ["https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AdobeStock_5472437.jpeg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201001'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_59499035-120x120.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/AdobeStock_101189022.jpeg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_15907096-120x120.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ic_scripps.png", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/luna.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201004'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20110'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201049'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/693157944_chrissy-teigen-john-legend.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AdobeStock_197077261-120x120.jpeg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cropped-cropped-simplemost_logo550new.png"], "top_img": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/luna.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Augusta Statz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.simplemost.com/chrissy-teigen-luna-daughter-ear-piercing/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Shares Her Thoughts On Piercing Her Daughter\u2019s Ears", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Shares Her Thoughts On Piercing Her Daughter's Ears", "description": "Supermodel Chrissy Teigen is not shy when it comes to voicing her opinion, and she has some thoughts as to when is the appropriate time to get her daughter's ears pierced.
