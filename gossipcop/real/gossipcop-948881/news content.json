No one can take that away from you \u2764,\u201d she wrote in the caption of the short video.\n\nBut, in the now-deleted video, as Gonzalez showed off her body in the mirror by moving the camera around to highlight her physique she showed off more than just her body.\n\nAs she did, in the far corner of the reflection a man, who appeared to be Duhamel, could be seen briefly. The man then pulled down his pants and struggled briefly to get them off one of his legs. Hopping out of his pants, he turned towards the camera and it did not seem like he had underwear on. Fortunately for him, a decorative pot saved him from revealing more than he already had.\n\nAs fans started to take notice, Gonzalez deleted the video and re-posted a cropped version.\n\nIt doesn\u2019t seem likely the accident will put a damper on the pair\u2019s vacation.\n\nThe couple was spotted soaking up the sun and packing on the PDA on Sunday, sharing a kiss by the water at Muyil Lagoon.\n\nThe two were previously spotted sharing a casual meal together in Sherman Oaks, California last month, where an onlooker told PEOPLE, \u201cthey were kissing and affectionate.\u201d\n\nThe pair made their public debut earlier that month.\n\nA source close to the actress previously told PEOPLE that Duhamel and Gonzalez, who has previously been linked to Liam Hemsworth, have \u201cbeen quietly dating for months,\u201d but initially chose to keep their relationship out of the spotlight.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really attracted to her and things are going pretty well,\u201d the insider revealed.\n\n\u201cTheir relationship started out slowly, but lately, they are spending more time together,\u201d a second source added. \u201cThey seem very happy.\u201d\n\nDuhamel and his ex Fergie \u2014 with whom he shares 4-year-old son Axl Jack \u2014 confirmed to PEOPLE exclusively that they were splitting up after 8 years of marriage in September 2017.\n\nThis article originally appeared on PEOPLE.", "images": ["https://secure-gl.imrworldwide.com/cgi-bin/m?ci=au-pacmags&cg=0&cc=1&ts=noscript", "http://www.who.com.au/media/18526/josh-duhamel-and-eiza-gonzalez.jpg", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/d93bdc6170d5028f62e678d549d59c1a/5BE4F399/t51.2885-15/sh0.08/e35/s640x640/33399780_2103922773210397_1963843873058848768_n.jpg?efg=eyJ1cmxnZW4iOiJ1cmxnZW5fZnJvbV9pZyJ9", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=2581274802111615&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.who.com.au/media/72280/who27-edm.jpg?height=158", "https://scontent-iad3-1.cdninstagram.com/vp/c241169ce8b3dbcff310213050fcecfc/5B3D9827/t51.2885-15/e15/36149049_282109219001065_3515552455444135936_n.jpg?_nc_eui2=AeEXhaDp4ghi9KGaIVBZ-pBlrvZEEe72AZyy4yCp16Lo5QojoNyNVF5Y4u_gV3x1UOu-E42sHN7sainXpNzgynbI", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/Who/images/enhanced-header-logo.svg", "https://www.who.com.au/Branding/Who/images/brand-logo-footer-new.svg"], "top_img": "http://www.who.com.au/media/18526/josh-duhamel-and-eiza-gonzalez.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alexia Fernandez", "Writer For Our Sister Site", "People Online."], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/movies/eiza-gonzalez-accidentally-showed-boyfriend-josh-duhamel-getting-undressed", "title": "Did Eiza Gonzalez accidentally show boyfriend Josh Duhamel getting undressed on Instagram?", "meta_data": {"language": "en-us", "description": "Eiza Gonzalez may have shared more of boyfriend Josh Duhamel than she intended.", "news_keywords": "Josh Duha, Eiza Gonzalez, Josh Duhamel Eiza Gonzalez, Josh Duhamel Naked, celebrity gossip photos, celebrity leaked photos, celebrity news and photos, celebrity photos", "robots": "index, follow", "og": {"site_name": "Who", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.who.com.au/eiza-gonzalez-accidentally-shows-boyfriend-josh-duhamel-getting-naked-on-instagram", "title": "Did Eiza Gonzalez accidentally show boyfriend Josh Duhamel getting undressed on Instagram?", "description": "Eiza Gonzalez may have shared more of boyfriend Josh Duhamel than she intended.", "image": {"identifier": "http://www.who.com.au/media/18526/josh-duhamel-and-eiza-gonzalez.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 800}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@WHOmagazine", "title": "Did Eiza Gonzalez accidentally show boyfriend Josh Duhamel getting undressed on Instagram?", "description": "Eiza Gonzalez may have shared more of boyfriend Josh Duhamel than she intended.", "image": "http://www.who.com.au/media/18526/josh-duhamel-and-eiza-gonzalez.jpg", "url": "https://www.who.com.au/eiza-gonzalez-accidentally-shows-boyfriend-josh-duhamel-getting-naked-on-instagram"}, "msvalidate.01": "3BD3CB44DC500E9821E82E085D0F0D13", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "fb": {"pages": 28734051211}, "sailthru.title": "Did Eiza Gonzalez accidentally show boyfriend Josh Duhamel getting undressed on Instagram?", "sailthru.date": "2018-07-4 00:00:00", "sailthru.author": "Alexia Fernandez", "sailthru.description": "We sure HOPE so!", "sailthru.tags": "Josh Duha,Eiza Gonzalez,Josh Duhamel Eiza Gonzalez,Josh Duhamel Naked,celebrity gossip photos,celebrity leaked photos,celebrity news and photos,celebrity photos", "sailthru.section": "Entertainment", "sailthru.doctype": "ArticlePage", "sailthru.image": "http://www.who.com.au/media/18526/josh-duhamel-and-eiza-gonzalez.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530662974.764, "source": "https://www.who.com.au", "summary": ""}
