Buckle up before scrolling through\u2014they'll likely be discussed for a long time to come.\n\nWhether it was Stephen Colbert kicking off the night with jokes about President Donald Trump , or the women from 9 to 5 talking about refusing to be controlled by sexist bigots, the stars of the 69th Emmy Awards held nothing back.\n\nThis year's Emmys in a word? Political. With Stephen Colbert hosting, and Saturday Night Live and The Handmaid's Tale up for multiple nominations, it was bound to be from the get go, but even so, we were treated to a night where celebrities got particularly candid about politics.\n\n01 of 07 Stephen Colbert's Opening Monologue Getty When Colbert took the stage for his opening monologue at the Emmys, people expected he would get political, and boy were they right. The host made sure to point out that President Trump had \"never won an Emmy\" for his work on The Apprentice, which caused Trump to call the award show \"rigged.\" \u201cEven during the campaign, Trump would not let it go. But he didn\u2019t because unlike the presidency, Emmys go to the winners of the popular vote,\" he said. \"He was nominated multiple times for Celebrity Apprentice, but he never won. If he had won an Emmy, I bet he never would have run for president. Trump is like Walter White. He\u2019s just like Walter and much whiter.\u201d Also worth noting? Former White House press secretary Sean Spicer himself made a cameo, much to the shock and awe of the audience. It really can't get more political than that.\n\n02 of 07 Alec Baldwin Won an Emmy for His Portrayal of Donald Trump Getty In one of the most overt political moments of the night, Baldwin accepted the trophy for Outstanding Supporting Actor in a Comedy Series, and he had a few choice words for Trump, whom he portrayed on Saturday Night Live. \u201cI suppose I should say, at long last, Mr. President, here is your Emmy,\u201d Baldwin began his speech. \u201cI always remember once someone told me that when you die, you don\u2019t remember a bill that Congress passed or a decision the Supreme Court made or an address made by the president\u2014you remember a song, you remember a line from a movie, you remember a play, you remember a book, a painting, a poem,\u201d Baldwin said. \u201cWhat we do is important, and for all of you out there in motion pictures and television, don\u2019t stop doing what you\u2019re doing. The audience is counting on you.\u201d\n\n03 of 07 Jane Fonda, Dolly Parton, and Lily Tomlin Took a Stand Getty The three leading actresses from 9 to 5 took the Emmys stage to a roaring standing ovation that only continued once they started sharing their thoughts on the state of the world. Fonda said that in 1980, women refused \"to be controlled by a racist, egotistical bigot.\" Tomlin jumped in, saying, \"In 2017 we still refuse to be controlled by a sexist, egotistical, lying hypocritical bigot.\"\n\n04 of 07 Kate McKinnon Thanked Hillary Clinton in Her Speech Getty When McKinnon took the stage to accept the award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series for her work on Saturday Night Live, she quickly gave thanks to none other than Hillary Clinton for her \"grace and grit.\" McKinnon impersonated Clinton on the sketch comedy show.\n\n05 of 07 Lorne Michaels's Subtle Reference to the Political Climate Getty Saturday Night Live took home many awards on Sunday night, many of which spurred from the show's sketches about politics. So naturally, when Michaels himself took the stage, he referenced that. \"I remember the first time we won this award, it was after our first season in 1976. And I remember thinking as I was standing there, alone, that this was it. This was the high point. There would never be another season as crazy, as unpredictable, as frightening, as exhausting, or as exhilarating,\" he said. \"Turns out, I was wrong.\"\n\n06 of 07 Donald Glover Thanked Donald Trump Lester Cohen/Getty Glover won two awards during the Emmys ceremony for his work on Atlanta (while also became the first black person to win an Emmy for directing a comedy, NBD), and while he was giving one of his acceptance speeches, he gave the president a shade-filled shout out. \"I want to thank Trump for making black people No. 1 on the most oppressed list,\" said Glover while accepting his second award for lead actor in a comedy series. \"He\u2019s probably the reason I\u2019m up here.\"", "images":
