In a clip posted to Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Instagram, the duo did a little jump for the camera to show their excitement for the movie.\n\nBlue wore a beige dress with a tie detail around her neck, covering up with a black jacket with multiple patches. Beyonc\u00e9, 36, also posted several snaps of her ensemble, a white dress with a blue flower pattern and ruffled skirt. The dress had a plunging neckline and showed plenty of leg. Beyonc\u00e9 finished off her outfit with neutral heels and a pair of small frame sunglasses, which are quickly becoming part of her signature look. (Get all the outfit details here!)\n\nIt was appropriate that the Grammy winner attended the screening, given that Oprah Winfrey compared her whimsical character in the film, Mrs. Which, to \u201cBeyonc\u00e9\u2019s aunt.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?
