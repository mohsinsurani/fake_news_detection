Miranda later said he spent a year writing the Hamilton song \"My Shot\", revising it countless times for every verse to reflect Alexander Hamilton's intellect.[51][13] By 2012, Miranda was performing an extended set of pieces based on the life of Hamilton, which he then referred to as the Hamilton Mixtape. The New York Times called it \"an obvious game changer\".[52]\n\nHamilton: An American Musical premiered off-Broadway at The Public Theater in January 2015, directed by Thomas Kail. Miranda wrote the book and score and starred as the title character.[53][54] The show received highly positive reviews,[55] and its engagement was sold out.[56] Chernow and Miranda received the 2015 History Makers Award from the New York Historical Society for their work in creating the musical.[57] The show began previews on Broadway in July 2015 at the Richard Rodgers Theatre and officially opened on August 6, 2015,[58] earning positive reviews.[59] On the first night of Hamilton previews, over 700 people lined up for lottery tickets.[60] The Hamilton ticket lottery evolved into Ham4Ham, a series of outdoor mini-performances for lottery participants that was hosted daily by Miranda and cast members for over a year, until August 31, 2016.[61] Miranda earned a 3% royalty on each performance of Hamilton, earning him $12.7 million by July 2017.[62][63] Hamilton won the Tony Award for Best Musical; Miranda won the Tony Awards for Best Original Score and Best Book of a Musical and received a nomination for Best Actor in a Musical. Miranda won the Pulitzer Prize for Drama for the musical, and the Hamilton cast album won the Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album. In May 2016, for his work in the role of Alexander Hamilton, Miranda received the Drama League Distinguished Performance Award.[64]\n\nOn March 15, 2016, members of the cast of Hamilton performed at the White House and hosted workshops; Miranda performed freestyle rap from prompts held up by President Obama.[65] In April 2016, Miranda and Jeremy McCarter published Hamilton: The Revolution, a book describing Hamilton's journey from conception to Broadway success and discussing the cultural revolution that permeates the show.[66]\n\nMiranda gave his last performance in Hamilton on July 9, 2016,[67] but vowed to return to the show.[68] Miranda reprised the role of Alexander Hamilton for a three-week run in Puerto Rico January 11\u201327, 2019, for which the engagement was sold out in three hours in November 2018.[69] In a review, Chris Jones praised \"deeper on-stage emotions\" in Miranda's reprisal, as well as improved vocal and dance technique than on Broadway.[70]\n\nA documentary about the creation of the show, Hamilton's America, featuring Miranda, premiered at the New York Film Festival on October 1, 2016, and first aired on PBS' Great Performances series on October 21, 2016.[71][72] A taping of the OBT version of Hamilton was released on Disney+ on July 3, 2020.\n\nOn January 24, 2016, Miranda performed the offstage cameo role of Loud Hailer in the Broadway production of Les Mis\u00e9rables,[73] fulfilling his childhood dream of being in the show, as it was the first production he ever saw on Broadway.[74]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nEarly acting roles [ edit ]\n\nMiranda appeared in a small role in the Walt Disney Pictures live-action film The Odd Life of Timothy Green (2012).[75][76]\n\n2015\u2013present: Disney projects [ edit ]\n\nMiranda interviewed with Disney in the winter of 2013, and submitted a six-song demo package to Walt Disney Animation Studios.[77] This began a series of collaborations with the company:\n\nIn the Heights (2021) [ edit ]\n\nOn November 7, 2008, Universal Pictures announced that they planned to adapt In the Heights as a feature film for release in 2011.[101] However, the project was canceled in March 2011,[102] reportedly due to the fact Universal was looking for a \"bankable Latino star\" like Shakira or Jennifer Lopez instead of unknown actors.[103] In January 2012, Miranda stated that the film adaptation was back under discussion;[104] in May 2016, it was announced that Miranda would co-produce the film with Harvey Weinstein and backing from The Weinstein Company.[105] On June 10, 2016, Jon M. Chu came on board to direct the film adaptation of the musical.[106] In the aftermath of numerous sexual misconduct allegations made against Weinstein, his producer credit on the film was removed, with the rights to the film eventually auctioned off to Warner Bros. for $50 million.[107] While Miranda originated the role of Usnavi, he felt he was too old to star as Usnavi in the film adaptation. Ultimately, Miranda played the smaller role of Piraguero, the \"Piragua Guy,\" in the film. He was quoted as saying the Broadway production was \"...a miraculous experience. I went from substitute teacher to Broadway composer. I will never make a leap that big again in my life. I was very content to let Anthony Ramos and this incredible cast have their own experience.\"[108] Miranda also served as producer and acted alongside Anthony Ramos,[109] Corey Hawkins,[110] Leslie Grace,[111] and Jimmy Smits.[112] The film was set for release on June 26, 2020,[113] but was pulled from the schedule due to the COVID-19 pandemic's impact on the film industry.[114] It was released in theaters and temporarily on HBO Max on June 10, 2021.[115]\n\nVivo (2021) [ edit ]\n\nMiranda stars as the titular character and provided eleven songs for Vivo, a Sony Pictures Animation film directed by Kirk DeMicco which was released on Netflix in August 2021.[116][117][118]\n\nImagine Entertainment announced in July 2018 that Miranda would make his debut as a film director with an adaptation of Jonathan Larson's semi-autobiographical musical Tick, Tick... Boom!, to be scripted by Dear Evan Hansen librettist Steven Levenson.[119][120] Miranda produced the film alongside Ron Howard and Brian Grazer:[120] it was released on Netflix in 2021.[121][122]\n\nUpcoming projects [ edit ]\n\nMiranda agreed in 2016 to serve as executive producer and composer of Lionsgate's film adaptation of The Kingkiller Chronicle by Patrick Rothfuss, as well as a tie-in television series.[123][124] In 2022 it was revealed that he was no longer attached to the project.\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\n2007\u20132013: Early roles [ edit ]\n\nMiranda also worked in film and television.

Nadal is in the center.\n\nMiranda married Vanessa Nadal, a high school friend, in 2010.[139] At the wedding reception, Miranda, along with the wedding party, performed the Fiddler on the Roof song \"To Life\".[140] Nadal was a lawyer at the law firm Jones Day.[141] Miranda and Nadal's first son, Sebastian, was born in November 2014.[142] Their second son, Francisco, was born in February 2018.[143] His son Sebastian was named after the Jamaican crab from The Little Mermaid, one of his favorite films, the reason for which he took the job of composing the music for live-action version.[144] Sebastian was the first name listed in the Production babies credits of Moana, for which Miranda wrote the songs.[145]\n\nMiranda discovered that he is related to artists Residente and iLe of Calle 13 during a 2009 concert by the group in San Juan, Puerto Rico, where Miranda was invited to perform. Backstage, the mother of Residente and ILE revealed their connection to Gilberto Concepci\u00f3n de Gracia, founder of the Puerto Rican Independence Party.[146][147][148] Miranda and Residente have since confirmed the relationship.[149][150][151][152] In 2017, Miranda performed on the opening track of Residente's self-titled debut album.[153]\n\nMiranda is cousins with professional baseball player Jos\u00e9 Miranda.[154]\n\nActivism [ edit ]\n\nAfter a meeting with President Barack Obama in March 2016,[155] Miranda joined U.S. Senators Kirsten Gillibrand, Chuck Schumer, Elizabeth Warren, and other Democratic lawmakers to call for congressional action to back a Senate bill in Washington that would allow Puerto Rico to declare bankruptcy and significantly ease its $70 billion government-debt burden.[156] Miranda was particularly active in the wake of Hurricane Maria's devastation in Puerto Rico,[10][11] and by December 2017, proceeds from his song \"Almost Like Praying\" helped the Hispanic Federation raise $22 million for rescue efforts and disaster relief.[157][158]\n\nMiranda uses proceeds from Hamilton to support Graham Windham, a nonprofit adoption agency founded by Eliza Schuyler Hamilton.[159] Miranda performs at their fundraising gala benefits in New York City and helps to fundraise for children in foster care.[160]\n\nHe performed \"Found/Tonight\" with Ben Platt at the March for Our Lives anti-gun violence rally in Washington, D.C., on March 24, 2018.[161][162]\n\nIn order to raise money for Puerto Rico's reconstruction after being struck by hurricanes Irma and Mar\u00eda, including at least $15 million to be channeled through the Flamboy\u00e1n Foundation, Lin-Manuel decided to take, and once again play the protagonist role in Hamilton to his father's native Puerto Rico. The Miranda family donated approximately $1 million to bring the University of Puerto Rico theater up to par in order to use it as the venue for the musical's performance in January 2018. After tickets sold out in two hours for the three-week run, producers decided to move out of the university venue due to warnings of potential disruptions by a university workers' labor organization, and move the already-installed set to the Luis A. Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center in Santurce, where the performances ran from January 11 to January 27. The production donated additional hundreds of thousands of dollars in improvements to the Ferr\u00e9 Performing Arts Center.[163]\n\nIn 2016, Miranda advocated for the passing of the Puerto Rico Oversight, Management, and Economic Stability Act (PROMESA), a law setting out to restructure the debt of Puerto Rico following Hurricane Maria.[164] The law led to budget cuts resulting in the closure of over 200 public schools, cuts to government labor benefits, and budget cuts at the University of Puerto Rico (UPR). It was met with protests, with UPR shutting down due to student strikes over the measures in 2017. Miranda became a target of criticism, especially when he performed Hamilton in Puerto Rico, given his lobbying on the bill as well as the musical's subject matter of the United States which many Puerto Ricans see as an oppressor of the island.[165] During the post show, Miranda met with protestors explaining that he had seen PROMESA as the only bipartisan option for the debt crisis previously, he does not support the austerity measures introduced and that he believes full debt-relief should now be pursued.[166] Subsequently, he has argued for full debt-relief for the island[167] and noted that the 2016 act has not led to the promised relief.[168]\n\nAwards and honors [ edit ]\n\nAmong his numerous accolades, Miranda has won a Pulitzer Prize, three Tony Awards, three Grammys, two Emmys, and two Olivier Awards and has been nominated for two Academy Awards. In 2015, he was the recipient of a Genius Grant from the MacArthur Fellows Program. In 2016, Time magazine included Miranda in its annual Time 100 as one of the \"Most Influential People in the World\" and he received a star on the Puerto Rico Walk of Fame.[170][171] Miranda received a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame on November 30, 2018.[172] In December 2018, he received the Kennedy Center Honors for creating Hamilton.[173]\n\nIn 2015, Miranda was the recipient of Smithsonian Magazine's American Ingenuity Award in the History category.[174] In 2019, Smithsonian National Portrait Gallery awarded Miranda the Portrait of a Nation prize.[175]\n\nHonorary degrees\n\nMiranda received an honorary degree in 2009 from Yeshiva University in Washington Heights, Manhattan, becoming the youngest person to receive an honorary degree from that university.[176] Ed Koch, former mayor of New York City, presented Miranda with the degree.[177]\n\nHe received the honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters in 2015 from his alma mater, Wesleyan University,[178] and gave their commencement address.[179] In May 2016, he received an honorary Doctorate of the Arts from the University of Pennsylvania and gave the commencement speech.[180] In July 2016, The University of Puerto Rico approved to grant him the degree of doctor honoris causa.[181] In July 2022, he received an honorary doctorate from the Royal Academy of Music in London, England[182]\n\nWork [ edit ]\n\nTheater [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nWeb series [ edit ]\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2020 Some Good News Self Episode 2[192] 2020 LUNCH DOODLES with Mo Willems!
