In a profile published on U.K.'s Times Sunday, Goodman said his character will be \"mopey and sad because his wife's dead.\"\n\nABC announced the network would move forward with an unlikely spinoff, \"The Conners,\" after Barr's namesake show was abruptly cancelled following her racist tweet to former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett in May.\n\nMore from USA Today:\n\nABC Entertainment President Channing Dungey called the tweet \"abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values.\"\n\nBarr said her controversial tweet was misinterpreted and that she is not a racist, and Goodman agreed. \"I know, for a fact that she's not a racist,\" he told the Times Sunday.\n\nGoodman admitted he was \"brokenhearted\" and \"surprised\" at the show's cancellation, before dialing it back: \"That's probably all I should say about it.\"\n\n\"Roseanne\" returned to ABC in March, two decades after it ended its first run from 1988 to 1997. The original cast, including Barr, Goodman, Laurie Metcalf and Sara Gilbert, returned.", "images": ["https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105238008-3ED2-REQ-NewRoseanne-052918.jpg?v=1529478332&w=750&h=422&vtcrop=y", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=1000004&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105287771-GettyImages-904280178.jpg?v=1532563620&w=1920&h=1080", "https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/27ec0e938f3f5890f298.svg", "https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/4db8932b7ac3e84e3f64.svg", "https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/79ea413ac8a9ee99cad0.svg", "https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/0dbbcac4aae29ae1ab0b.svg", "https://static-redesign.cnbcfm.com/dist/09c161b9810767a7849e.svg"], "top_img": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105287771-GettyImages-904280178.jpg?v=1532563620&w=1920&h=1080", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cydney Henderson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/08/27/john-goodman-says-roseanne-killed-off-conners/1116945002/", "title": "John Goodman reveals Roseanne will be killed off in 'The Conners' spinoff", "meta_data": {"format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "AssetType": "cnbcnewsstory", "pageNodeId": 105419671, "description": "In a profile published on U.K.'s Times Sunday, John Goodman said his character will be \"mopey and sad because his wife's dead.\"", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "John Goodman reveals Roseanne will be killed off in 'The Conners' spinoff", "description": "In a profile published on U.K.'s Times Sunday, John Goodman said his character will be \"mopey and sad because his wife's dead.\"", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/28/john-goodman-reveals-roseanne-will-be-killed-off-in-the-conners-spinoff.html", "site_name": "CNBC", "image": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105287771-GettyImages-904280178.jpg?v=1532563620&w=1920&h=1080"}, "twitter": {"image": {"src": "https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105287771-GettyImages-904280178.jpg?v=1532563620&w=1920&h=1080"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNBC", "url": "https://www.cnbc.com/2018/08/28/john-goodman-reveals-roseanne-will-be-killed-off-in-the-conners-spinoff.html", "title": "John Goodman reveals Roseanne will be killed off in 'The Conners' spinoff", "description": "In a profile published on U.K.'s Times Sunday, John Goodman said his character will be \"mopey and sad because his wife's dead.\"", "creator": "@CNBC"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cnbc", "published_time": "2018-08-28T10:17:14+0000", "modified_time": "2018-08-28T12:46:17+0000", "section": "Entertainment", "author": "Cydney Henderson", "opinion": "false", "tag": "Entertainment"}, "news_keywords": "Business,Media,Entertainment,business news", "keywords": "Business,Media,Entertainment,business news", "tp": {"PreferredRuntimes": "universal", "PreferredFormats": "M3U,MPEG4", "initialize": "false"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=398018310", "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "CNBC Business News and Finance", "app_store_id": 398018310}}, "parsely-metadata": "{\"nodeid\":105419671,\"originalImage\":\"https://image.cnbcfm.com/api/v1/image/105287771-GettyImages-904280178.jpg?v=1532563620\"}", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "author": "Cydney Henderson"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535410800.0, "source": "https://www.cnbc.com", "summary": ""}
