Three-quarter-length minks, leather and pigskin palms, fedoras and double-breasted tweed. Suited and booted was how it was done on the daily. Seats on a plane were spacious, the food was real, the lines manageable. Eye contact was mandatory, and a handshake was as stiff as the drinks that were served.\n\nAnd then\u2014oil, terror, dollars and cents\u2014times changed. Nothing personifies the anxiety-inducing madness of modern air travel like an international terminal. This is why we need Xanax and Ambien over pretzels and peanuts.\n\nThe American airport is a case study of the herd mentality, where waiting and woe have replaced whimsical and wishful. Nothing works, no one cares, and nothing seems to improve security or efficiency despite pre-checks and precautions. Footwear to laptops and lithium\u2014we\u2019re all resigned to our fate when flying, just hoping not to get too fucked over from point A to B. Nostalgia be damned, some things were better before the age of apps, and traveling was one of them. Flying was special.\n\nAnd now, for the most elite of the jet set, it is again. In May, the first private terminal in the U.S. opened at Los Angeles International Airport. Private is the operative word; the $22 million facility is located on the far side of the airport, away from public terminals and paparazzi. There are 13 suites with bathrooms, drinks, food, televisions, and a staff of eight servants\u2014er, attendants.\n\nCourtesy of Gavin de Becker & Associates.\n\nPassengers complete security screening and clear customs in the terminal before being driven, head-of-state style, across the runway to the plane in a BMW 7 Series sedan (supposedly just 70 steps from terminal to plane. The average Joe hoofs more than 2,000).\n\nModeled on Heathrow\u2019s Windsor Suite, which runs about $3,500 for membership, V.I.P. terminals are catching on, with one in Dubai that opened last December, and options in Amsterdam, Munich, and now Los Angeles, where the chosen few no longer deal with luggage, lines, or paparazzi. Could anything be more celebrity-friendly in a city known for stars?\n\nV.I.P. is a descriptor so casually thrown around these days that any place with burgundy velvet and a bald bouncer can call itself \u201cexclusive.\u201d But the LAX private terminal is crammed with tangible reminders of how different the other half lives. Organic seaweed snacks, 85 percent cacao, Laurent-Perrier Champagne, scented candles, daybeds. Passengers can take advantage of seemingly every toiletterie and travel hack under the sun, from universal chargers and noise-canceling headphones to Emergen-C and roll-on deodorant. Instead of rushing to the gate and jockeying for a seat, the biggest problem in this terminal is figuring out whether there is any Dijon mustard (there is), and how to switch from CNN to MSNBC on the suite\u2019s TV.\n\nTop right, Gavin de Becker & Associates. Bottom and left, courtesy of Adam Popescu\n\nDuring a visit to the terminal in June I met the suite\u2019s designer, Gavin de Becker\u2014sort of. I was led to an empty room, and a James Bond-esque live tablet. De Becker, 63, with jet-black hair, sharp eyes even across a screen, and wearing what looked like a very comfortable kimono, was calling across the Pacific from Tokyo.\n\n\u201cWhat others have missed,\u201d he began, \u201cis that this is for business travelers. This isn\u2019t luxury. This is logistics. You can park your car and leave it, book spa services, doctors, order food in advance, everything you could get in the terminal, without having to carry bags, walking to a gate change or avoiding lines.\u201d\n\nDe Becker has made a career in the world of security, shepherding high-value clients, people worried about watching their backs. He\u2019s written a best-seller, The Gift of Fear, gushed on Oprah\u2019s couch multiple times, and spent decades protecting A-listers (one story goes that a character from the original Twin Peaks was based on him). He\u2019s very savvy and well-connected\u2014he gave eulogies for both Carrie Fisher and Garry Shandling\u2014having earned the trust of the kind of L.A. denizens who might pay a premium for this kind of concierge service.\n\nIf the mood in LAX is base panic, in de Becker\u2019s suite it\u2019s sublime peace. To that end, there\u2019s a small art gallery filled with photos from Gary Yost, a series of olive-green Anna\u2019s hummingbirds feeding their young. There\u2019s a park onsite with tents and a faux fireplace, and a kid\u2019s area to play on real grass\u2014nowhere else in the world does such a thing exist with planes flying overhead, all on the runway. Each suite has a toy menu. Lucky kids. And I didn\u2019t see any during my stay. That\u2019s the beauty of it\u2014I didn\u2019t see anyone. You\u2019re not supposed to.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6327fcb89abfd8a85cba4428/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591ca19ca077562db2c08d21/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Amber-Valetta-Airport-Cannes.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599345914012d829276c4bca/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/celebrity-lax-terminal-01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59934592a582881e676240fa/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/celebrity-lax-terminal-opener.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591ca0e5e4c6f71c391b1740/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Hailey-Baldwin-Airport-Cannes.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59934591f2f7975a13fe5cb6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/celebrity-lax-terminal-02.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6329cf346009e759e6639211/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59934591f2f7975a13fe5cb5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/celebrity-lax-terminal-03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/632891edc1df471d836f1d99/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633ee2fb2dd34e3e1035bb7c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/591b709003574b1b9f36249d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Cannes-Airport-Arrivals-Style-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5993459299b2703a17f49d2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celebrity-lax-terminal-opener.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5993459299b2703a17f49d2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celebrity-lax-terminal-opener.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Adam Popescu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/inside-the-private-celebrity-friendly-terminal-at-lax", "title": "Inside the Private, Celebrity-Friendly Terminal at LAX", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The organic seaweed snacks are plentiful, the paparazzi are absent, and the TSA employees even smile.", "id": "599343cea582881e676240f8", "keywords": "de becker,terminal,organic seaweed snack,paparazzi,lax,airport security,airport wait times,luxury", "news_keywords": "de becker,terminal,organic seaweed snack,paparazzi,lax,airport security,airport wait times,luxury", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "599343cea582881e676240f8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The organic seaweed snacks are plentiful, the paparazzi are absent, and the TSA employees even smile.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5993459299b2703a17f49d2a/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-celebrity-lax-terminal-opener.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5993459299b2703a17f49d2a/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-celebrity-lax-terminal-opener.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The organic seaweed snacks are plentiful, the paparazzi are absent, and the TSA employees even smile.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5993459299b2703a17f49d2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celebrity-lax-terminal-opener.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Exclusive: Inside the Private, Celebrity-Friendly Terminal at LAX", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/08/inside-the-private-celebrity-friendly-terminal-at-lax"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-16T11:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-16T11:00:00.000Z", "author": "Adam Popescu"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The organic seaweed snacks are plentiful, the paparazzi are absent, and the TSA employees even smile.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5993459299b2703a17f49d2a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-celebrity-lax-terminal-opener.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Exclusive: Inside the Private, Celebrity-Friendly Terminal at LAX"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502881200.0, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
