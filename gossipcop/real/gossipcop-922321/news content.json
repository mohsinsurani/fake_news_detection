I think we have 16 regular cast members, and I think it\u2019s always sad when we lose people for whatever reason.\"\n\n\"Whether they want to go or don\u2019t want to go, it doesn\u2019t make it any easier,\" she added.\n\n\"Grey's Anatomy\" star Ellen Pompeo opened up about rumors that her salary caused other actresses to be fired from the series. Michael Rozman/Warner Bros.\n\nPompeo, an outspoken advocate for equal pay for women in Hollywood, revealed she was upset by the rumors because they create a catfight-like story where there isn't one.\n\n\"I think that it\u2019s important for us to not pit women against each other and to really dispel the notion that women are always victims,\" said the star. \"You don\u2019t have to pit us against each other. We\u2019re not enemies. We do lift each other up and support each other, and we\u2019re not victims. We\u2019re very strong and we\u2019re capable of many, many things.\"\n\nWatch the discussion in the video above.", "images":
