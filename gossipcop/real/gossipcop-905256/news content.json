In that time, the 37-year-old has had to rewire the way she speaks, eats, sits and, well, exists.\n\nRoyal etiquette might seem frivolous to some, but to experts such as Myka Meier - the founder of Beaumont Etiquette, who spent two years working underneath Charles, The Prince of Wales - it\u2019s an important nod to respected traditions that have stood for centuries.\n\nMs Meier told news.com.au the mixture of history and veneration embedded in royal etiquette makes it absolutely critical the Duchess of Sussex adopts the many rules that now govern her life as a working royal.\n\nAnd so, we asked the expert: How exactly is Meghan Markle performing so far?\n\nBRITISH VERBIAGE\n\nWhile many have noticed the California-born former actress adopt a British twang, Ms Meier discredits rumours the Palace has given Meghan a voice coach as part of her regular princess lessons.\n\nInstead, she says, Meghan would have been encouraged to swap out Americanisms, such as \u2018elevator\u2019, for their British alternatives, such as \u2018lift\u2019. This shift in her vocabulary has naturally seen a slight change in her accent.\n\n\u201cShe has probably received guidance to use sophisticated verbiage as part of the cultural training she would be undertaking,\u201d Ms Meier told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cThe Duchess of Sussex has been extra cautious about using British verbiage. She\u2019s not using slang words, and she\u2019s enunciating and articulating everything really quite well, which is great to see.\u201d\n\nA short clip featuring Meghan speaking in what appeared to be a posh British accent in June went viral on social media as people were baffled by her new voice.\n\nMeghan said my name, that\u2019s me done\ud83d\ude2d pic.twitter.com/167F2ubjUh \u2014 Aya El Zeiny (@elzeiny99) June 14, 2018\n\nTHE \u2018DUCHESS SLANT\u2019\n\nMs Meier was amused to see feverish commentary around Meghan\u2019s duchess slant back in June. When the Duchess had a momentary lapse of concentration during a party at Buckingham Palace and crossed her legs, some went so far as to say her slip-up was \u201cdisrespectful to the Queen\u201d.\n\nIt was a curious moment for Ms Meier, who invented \u2018the duchess slant\u2019 in 2013, and saw Meghan\u2019s mistake as a blip, not a blunder.\n\n\u201cI created the term, and the truth is there are different versions of it. I can tell you it\u2019s just a simple way of sitting that protects vulnerabilities and looks great in photos,\u201d Ms Meier said.\n\nWhile the preferred seated position is for a woman to have her knees together, with one foot under the other, Ms Meier said the commentary on Meghan\u2019s faux pas was excessive and unnecessary.\n\n\u201cPeople are very quick to show everything she\u2019s doing wrong, but there\u2019s a lot of pressure,\u201d Ms Meier added.\n\nBRITISH STYLE\n\nMeghan has a team of aides helping her adhere to clothing protocol - which is so strict and detailed it confuses even some of the most committed royalists - which means her attire has been almost faultless.\n\nWhile Meier conceded there have been one or two slight mistakes - a flash of her black lacy bra at the wedding of Prince Harry\u2019s best friend Charlie van Straubenzee last month wasn\u2019t ideal \u2013 breaking protocol really relies on intent, which has been absent in every case of discretion.\n\n\u201cI firmly believe this was not intentional, it was only moments later that her garment was buttoned up again,\u201d Ms Meier told news.com.au.\n\n\u201cAnything that\u2019s accidental or unintentional would never be considered a break in protocol.\u201d\n\nThe only steadfast rule the Queen has for clothing is that royal women always pair dresses and skirts with nude pantyhose - something Meghan ignored right up until the moment she was officially a working royal.\n\n\u201cDuring the day pantyhose or tights are seen as the most conservative, the most formal, and the most professional in the role of a working royal,\u201d Ms Meier said.\n\nMEETING AND GREETING\n\nPerhaps Meghan\u2019s strongest area is how she engages with fans, Ms Meier said, adding that she is a natural with the public.\n\n\u201cThe Duchess of Cambridge had 10 years to perfect everything, Meghan Markle had under a year to become a Duchess, and so far she\u2019s doing wonderfully,\u201d Ms Meier said.\n\nWhen it comes to formally acknowledging senior royals in the Palace - the focal point of many princess classes \u2014 Meghan is also said to be doing rather well.\n\n\u201cOf all of the things (she needs to adhere to), the most difficult would probably be the English etiquette protocol that is expected inside the Palace walls. The meetings, greeting people in the right way, it\u2019s not easy,\u201d Ms Meier said.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s doing a fine job.\u201d\n\nHER FINAL MARK\n\nAll that considered, what grade does Ms Meier give Meghan for her first four months as a duchess?\n\n\u201cI would definitely give her an A for etiquette,\u201d Ms Meier told news.com.au. \u201cShe has really embraced her role. I think she\u2019s doing fantastically.\u201d\n\nFor more from Myka Meier, follow her on Instagram", "images":
