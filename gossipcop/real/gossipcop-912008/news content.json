Then there was the \u201cbeach body.\u201d And now there is the \u201crevenge body.\u201d Based on data from Google Trends, the concept has now reached its apotheosis, in no small part due to Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s new show, Revenge Body, which premiered on E! Thursday night.\n\nWhat does \u201crevenge body\u201d mean? No, it\u2019s not getting revenge on your body or anyone else\u2019s. It also doesn\u2019t involve the bodies of people who appeared in Golden Globe\u2013nominated television show Revenge. Instead, a revenge body is something you strive to obtain after someone has wronged you. It\u2019s turning your body into a super-sexy shiv and knifing an ex-boyfriend or mean girl from high school in back.\n\nKardashian herself explains on the first episode of the show, \u201ca great body is the best revenge.\u201d\n\nNeither Kardashian nor E! gets credit for the term. It comes from tabloids, like most concepts of this nature do, and anyone with a body who had endured a recent breakup after 2010 or so, now had a \u201crevenge body\u201d\u2014so Jennifer Aniston mostly. Kim Kardashian West and Britney Spears have had \u201crevenge bodies,\u201d too. Once the fitness magazines took hold of the term, there was no stopping it. Fitness named Katie Holmes \u201cBest Revenge Body\u201d in 2012 after her divorce from Tom Cruise. Holmes herself does not appear to have ever uttered the phrase. In 2014, Cosmopolitan launched a subscription-based fitness channel called CosmoBody, and it offered a video called \u201cRevenge Body.\u201d\n\nBy 2015 the phrase had appeared on Urban Dictionary, and now Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian has expanded the definition to include anyone you\u2019d like to get revenge on, not just a lover scorned. A mother, for example. A mean high-school bully. Any stylist that wouldn\u2019t work with you or any designer who wouldn\u2019t send you dresses to wear on the red carpet.\n\nLike getting bangs or revamping your wardrobe, getting a \u201crevenge body\u201d is a pretty transparent reaction to a painful life event, a way to do something and feel in control. Still, the tabloid usage makes those who have changed their appearance, usually post-breakup, seem to be both conniving and also not in it for genuine self-improvement.\n\nIn 2017, the term sounds outdated, a concept that takes away celebrities\u2019 agency about something as fundamental as their bodies. Maybe a star\u2019s makeover came after months of crying and the inability to eat; tabloids will never know. If you\u2019ve made any visible change in your appearance in the 24/7 celebrity industrial complex, then a revenge body you must have.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58795bd4a57f7203699c938f/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7ae5f9f2d6c81700a52e/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/A_Headshots_KenzieBryant_Revise.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58795baf001d758258d70946/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5f89ee23936b35581b460ca3/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/diana-ross-its-my-house-tout.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58062066e80a4ab648ad0f86/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-khloe-kardashian-denim.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/587921ac2a677fe11973b4d8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/trump-inaugural-performers-jon-voight-jennifer-holliday-3-doors-down.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/624135e75c979a86c628fa4c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6182aa8bb249a91844f19a68/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/Emily_Ratajkowski_opener.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/60db42a32da4e9b34d9f2585/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/VF0721_Tavi_Gevinson_Tout.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5878e81e2a677fe11973b4a6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kim-kardashian-selfie.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58795baf001d758258d70946/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Kenzie Bryant", "June", "November", "October"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/01/revenge-body-khloe-kardashian-tabloids", "title": "How Did the \u201cRevenge Body\u201d Become a Real Thing?", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Per tabloids and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, you too can morph into your best self to show those who hurt you what they\u2019re missing.", "id": "58795d0a2a677fe11973b4fa", "keywords": "khloe kardashian,revenge body,katie holmes,kim kardashian,vanities", "news_keywords": "khloe kardashian,revenge body,katie holmes,kim kardashian,vanities", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "58795d0a2a677fe11973b4fa", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Per tabloids and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, you too can morph into your best self to show those who hurt you what they\u2019re missing.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58795baf001d758258d70946/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/t-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58795baf001d758258d70946/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/t-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Per tabloids and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, you too can morph into your best self to show those who hurt you what they\u2019re missing.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58795baf001d758258d70946/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "How Did the \u201cRevenge Body\u201d Become a Real Thing?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/01/revenge-body-khloe-kardashian-tabloids"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-01-13T23:05:39.861Z", "modified_time": "2017-01-13T23:05:39.861Z", "author": "Kenzie Bryant"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Per tabloids and Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian, you too can morph into your best self to show those who hurt you what they\u2019re missing.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58795baf001d758258d70946/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-khloe-kardashian-revenge-body.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "How Did the \u201cRevenge Body\u201d Become a Real Thing?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1484348739.861, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
