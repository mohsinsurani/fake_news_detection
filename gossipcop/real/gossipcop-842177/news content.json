Watch all the highlights from the explosive finale in the video above.\n\nA source confirms to Us Weekly that the 43-year-old attorney will not be returning for season 10 after starring on seven seasons of the hit reality show. \u201cPhaedra is not coming back as of now,\u201d a source tells Us. \u201cBravo is not planning to ask her back.\u201d (Bravo had no comment.)\n\nParks\u2019 departure comes after the finale of the four-part season 9 reunion revealed that she spread a rumor that Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home fellow cast member Porsha Williams. When host Andy Cohen said that she was caught in a \u201cmegawatt lie,\u201d Parks said, \u201cWhat more can I do? I apologized already and the person I\u2019m most concerned about is Porsha. I\u2019m sorry that it hurt Kandi as well.\u201d\n\nA source previously told Us in late April that the reunion episodes were \u201cdisastrous\u201d for Parks. \u201cIt would be understandable if Phaedra didn\u2019t come back, but it\u2019s not finalized yet,\u201d the source said. \u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be Phaedra\u2019s decision, but Bravo\u2019s. It\u2019s bad.\u201d The insider added that that Parks\u2019 actions were \u201cincredibly painful and shocking.\u201d\n\nAt the time, Parks\u2019 rep slammed the rumors that the lawyer was fired as \u201cuntrue.\u201d\n\nParks\u2019 exit could mean more screen time for Kim Zolciak-Biermann, who will be returning to RHOA for season 10. The Don\u2019t Be Tardy star \u201cwon\u2019t be a full-time Housewife, but will be in a smaller role,\u201d a source told Us in April. \u201cHow many episodes she\u2019s in is being determined.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/phaedra-parks-zoom-c035eef5-7320-4d94-9c98-ef671ae83513.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/phaedra-parks-zoom-c035eef5-7320-4d94-9c98-ef671ae83513.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/phaedra-parks-is-not-coming-back-to-rhoa-w481350/", "title": "Phaedra Parks Is \u2018Not Coming Back\u2019 to \u2018RHOA'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Phaedra Parks is \u2018not coming back\u2019 to \u2018Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u2019 a source confirms to Us Weekly \u2014 find out why", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Phaedra Parks Is \u2018Not Coming Back\u2019 to \u2018RHOA'", "description": "Phaedra Parks is \u2018not coming back\u2019 to \u2018Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u2019 a source confirms to Us Weekly \u2014 find out why", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/phaedra-parks-is-not-coming-back-to-rhoa-w481350/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:08:06+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/phaedra-parks-zoom-c035eef5-7320-4d94-9c98-ef671ae83513.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/phaedra-parks-zoom-c035eef5-7320-4d94-9c98-ef671ae83513.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-05-08T20:58:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:08:06+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Phaedra Parks Is \u2018Not Coming Back\u2019 to \u2018RHOA'", "description": "Phaedra Parks is \u2018not coming back\u2019 to \u2018Real Housewives of Atlanta,\u2019 a source confirms to Us Weekly \u2014 find out why", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/phaedra-parks-zoom-c035eef5-7320-4d94-9c98-ef671ae83513.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494277080.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
