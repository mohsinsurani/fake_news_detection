Bonet graduated from Birmingham High School, in Van Nuys, California and later studied acting at the Celluloid Actor's Studio in North Hollywood.[10][11]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nAfter being in beauty competitions and appearing in guest spots on television series as a child, Bonet landed the role of Denise Huxtable on The Cosby Show, the second-oldest child of the parents played by Bill Cosby and Phylicia Rashad.[12] In 1987, she briefly left The Cosby Show to star in the spin-off series A Different World, which focused on Denise's life at college. That year, Bonet, then 19, played 17-year-old Epiphany Proudfoot in the movie Angel Heart opposite Mickey Rourke.[13] In the film, several seconds of an explicit scene she shared with Rourke (filmed when she was 18) were edited to ensure an R rating.[14] For Angel Heart, Bonet earned a nomination for the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress. It was followed by a topless centerspread in Interview magazine.[15]\n\nIn 1986, Bonet earned a nomination for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series.[16] After announcing her pregnancy during the run of A Different World, Bonet left the series.[17] She returned to The Cosby Show the following year, but was fired in April 1991 because of \"creative differences\".[18] After The Cosby Show, Bonet appeared in direct-to-video releases and made-for-television movies. In September 1992, Bonet hosted Why Bother Voting?, an election special focusing on young voters' concerns and apathy. She had supporting roles in the 1998 film Enemy of the State and the 2000 film High Fidelity. In 2003 she played Queenie in Biker Boyz, which reunited her with her A Different World co-star Kadeem Hardison.[19]\n\nBonet co-starred in the film Whitepaddy in 2005.

Bonet recalled of their relationship: \"It was interesting when we were first finding out about each other, that our backgrounds were so similar. When I first told him my mom was Jewish, and he said \"So's my dad,\" I thought that was both unusual and enchanting. I felt like, \"Okay, here's someone who really knows how it is.\" And I think I trusted him a little more with my feelings and let him inside a little more than I ordinarily would have.\"[22][23] Bonet gave birth to their daughter Zo\u00eb Isabella Kravitz on December 1, 1988.[24] She and Kravitz divorced in 1993.\n\nIn 2005, Bonet began a relationship with actor Jason Momoa.
