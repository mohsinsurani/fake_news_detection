But there are two interesting bits right off the bat about this Fifty Shades Freed teaser. First, at 66 seconds, it\u2019s damn well long enough to be the full trailer. At this point, you\u2019re either in or you\u2019re out concerning this third film in E.L. James\u2019 bondage-flavored romantic drama. Aside from maybe Star Wars: The Last Jedi, I can\u2019t think of a movie that needs less of an actual marketing campaign, at least in terms of spoiler-y footage.\n\nSecond, it teases the actual theatrical trailer for November, meaning this is a two-months\u2019 early sneak peak of said trailer. That may be a something of a record. Sony dropped a Ghostbusters trailer teaser on Feb. 14, 2016 in advance of its March 3, 2016 trailer launch, but I can\u2019t think of any movie that debuted their trailer teaser two months in advance. I can only assume we\u2019ll see the trailer attached to STX Entertainment\u2019s A Bad Moms Christmas unless Universal/Comcast Corp. feels like being funny and attaching it to Sony\u2019s The Star. As for the actual teaser, the footage is at least somewhat promising a bit kinky sex than we had the last time out. So at least this time fans might get what they paid for.\n\nFifty Shades Darker was essentially about how Anastasia Steele (still a great name for a 007 villain) molded Mr. Grey into \u201chusband material,\u201d which meant a lot more conventional sex but a lot less kink. Also of note, we get more conventional violence this time out, including a guy who I presume is Steele\u2019s former boss holding a knife to her throat. So for those who want rescue fantasies with their BDSM, there you go.\n\nTwenty dollars says we\u2019ll get far more thinkpieces about Steele\u2019s consensual sexual activities than about the violence directed upon her sans her consent, but that\u2019s a conversation for another day. At this point, the Fifty Shades trilogy is a lot like The Hobbit trilogy, in that the first film made so much money ($571 million worldwide) that the next two are essentially paid for. Sam Taylor-Johnson\u2019s Fifty Shades of Grey cost $40 million and James Foley\u2019s Fifty Shades Darker cost $55m. Assuming Fifty Shades Freed cost around the same (let\u2019s say $65m to potentially over exaggerate just in case), we\u2019re looking at a trilogy that cost Universal and friends $160m.\n\nSo the first film alone made back 3.5x the budget of the entire series. And since the sequel made $379 million worldwide, we\u2019re already at $950m worldwide with one more to go. Even if this installment takes another dive and makes (spitballing it here) $250m worldwide, we\u2019re still looking at a $1.2 billion total gross for these R-rated, female-targeted erotic dramas. Even if it pulls a Divergent, it's still all gravy (and the franchise is over after this one anyway). It\u2019s almost like Universal made a non-tentpole movie into an event by creating an A-level release out of something entirely unlike anything else in the marketplace and targeted at an underserved demographic.
