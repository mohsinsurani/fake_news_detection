Rollo Ross reports. Video provided by Reuters Newslook\n\nIconic French sex symbol Brigitte Bardot made it clear she does not back the #MeToo movement in a new interview with Paris Match, a French magazine akin to People.\n\n\"Regarding actresses \u2014 not women in general \u2014 the vast majority of cases are hypocritical, ridiculous and without interest,\" Bardot, 83, said in an article translated by USA TODAY.\n\nShe added, \"It takes away from important themes that need to be discussed. Me, I was never the victim of sexual harassment. And I always found it charming when someone told me I was beautiful or I had a cute (butt). This kind of compliment is nice.\"\n\nBardot believes,\"There are a lot of actresses who tease producers in order to get roles. Then later they say they were harassed. In reality, this harms them more than it helps.\"\n\nEarlier this month, fellow French film icon Catherine Deneuve, 74, apologized publicly after she joined 99 other prominent female writers, entertainers, historians, journalists, curators, academics and intellectuals in signing an open letter in Parisian newspaper Le Monde likening the #MeToo movement to a \"witch hunt.\"\n\nThe piece argued, \"This urge to send men to the slaughterhouse instead of helping women be more autonomous helps the enemies of sexual freedom.\"\n\nNearly 150 powerful men in industries ranging from media to tech have been accused of sexual misconduct (ranging verbal harassment to rape) from since film producer Harvey Weinstein was accused in October.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f4a926cd0bc53ec955d82c2f6468e64b9956469/c=0-799-2599-2267/local/-/media/2018/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636518726323804189-AFP-AFP-WX9EK.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5706470968001_5706463864001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f4a926cd0bc53ec955d82c2f6468e64b9956469/c=0-799-2599-2267/local/-/media/2018/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636518726323804189-AFP-AFP-WX9EK.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jayme Deerwester"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/18/brigitte-bardot-most-actresses-harassment-claims-hypocritical-and-ridiculous/1044130001/", "title": "Brigitte Bardot: Most actresses' harassment claims are 'hypocritical and ridiculous'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/18/brigitte-bardot-most-actresses-harassment-claims-hypocritical-and-ridiculous/1044130001/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Brigitte Bardot: Most actresses' harassment claims are 'hypocritical and ridiculous'", "description": "Bardot,  who says she has never been harassed, says majority of #MeToo claims are \\", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7f4a926cd0bc53ec955d82c2f6468e64b9956469/c=0-799-2599-2267/local/-/media/2018/01/18/USATODAY/USATODAY/636518726323804189-AFP-AFP-WX9EK.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Bardot,  who says she has never been harassed, says majority of #MeToo claims are \\", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516233600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
