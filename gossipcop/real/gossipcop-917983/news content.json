The pair were seated together at the 2018 Academy Awards, held at Los Angeles\u2019 Dolby Theater, both sipping white wine and laughing together through the show.\n\nIn the opening monologue, host Jimmy Kimmel made a joke about the 2017 Oscars Best Picture flub when Stone\u2019s film La La Land was announced as the winner when it was actually Moonlight that had won. \u201cThis year, when you hear your name called, don\u2019t get up right away \u2026 give us a minute,\u201d Kimmel said. Following the joke, the camera panned to Lawrence pointing at Stone, playfully making fun of her.\n\nUs Weekly spotted Stone, 29, and Lawrence, 27, throughout the night having a great time together! In the lobby, the actresses were drinking sauvignon blanc and chardonnay and mingling with Judd Apatow. Lawrence was also overheard making a Grease reference to the Easy A actress. \u201cYou\u2019re Sandra Dee and I\u2019m like Rizzo,\u201d she told her friend.\n\nThe pair have been pals for years. In 2016, the Red Sparrow star said that she doesn\u2019t like to stay out late because then she parties too hard and gets sick. \u201cAsk Emma Stone,\u201d she said in an interview with Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cIt was the night we saw Adele in L.A. She just started rubbing my back. She was really sweet. I was like, \u2018Get out of here. It\u2019s so gross.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn January 2018, Lawrence posted a video on Facebook revealing that Stone had asked her to go to a Golden Globes afterparty with her \u2014but then changed her mind last minute, when Lawrence had half her makeup done. \u201cWell, you had told me that you wanted me to be your date to afterparties so I got us some tickets to the afterparties, I booked a car and I was halfway through glam when you told me that you didn\u2019t want to go. You just wanted to come over to my house. So I sent my hair and makeup team home,\u201d she said in the video, showing off her half made-up face.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/emma-stone-jennifer-lawrence.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C1700px%2C893px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/emma-stone-jennifer-lawrence.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1700px%2C961px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/emma-stone-jennifer-lawrence.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C1700px%2C893px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/oscars-2018-jennifer-lawrence-and-emma-stone-were-the-cutest-bffs/", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone Were the Cutest BFFs at the Oscars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Oscars", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone stole the show at the Sunday, March 4, Academy Awards \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone Were the Cutest BFFs at the Oscars", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone stole the show at the Sunday, March 4, Academy Awards \u2014 details", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/oscars-2018-jennifer-lawrence-and-emma-stone-were-the-cutest-bffs/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-05T15:49:36+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/emma-stone-jennifer-lawrence.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C1700px%2C893px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/emma-stone-jennifer-lawrence.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C1700px%2C893px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-05T15:49:36+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Longeretta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone Were the Cutest BFFs at the Oscars", "description": "Jennifer Lawrence and Emma Stone stole the show at the Sunday, March 4, Academy Awards \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/emma-stone-jennifer-lawrence.jpg?crop=0px%2C78px%2C1700px%2C893px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520264976.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
