She had to hit the rise and fall of the movement, essentially matching Boylston - if not in quality than in dynamics and with the correct paulement, or placement of the shoulders.\n\nJennifer Lawrence has danced before on film, memorably in a duet with Bradley Cooper in Silver Linings Playbook. But while it was a delight, the number, despite a couple of harrowing lifts, had little in common with ballet.\n\nFroman is \"the ballet-boot-camp guy, and in a great way,\" Francis Lawrence said. \"He knows how to teach ballet to lay people, to ease them in as best as possible.\" And he knows their limits, Lawrence added. \"He was the one who told me: 'Jen will never get up on pointe. It's too dangerous.'\"\n\nFor three and a half months, Froman worked with Lawrence \u2013 mainly in her garage in Los Angeles \u2013 for four hours a day, five days a week. They started with stretching and working with discs to help Lawrence grasp turnout, or the opening of the legs from the hips.\n\n\"I wanted her to understand what muscle groups were involved, and how most people walking on the street are internally rotated with their shoulders \u2013 their palms are facing back,\" Froman said. \"With ballet dancers, you have to spin that back so it looks more like their arms are an extension of their back, and that whole alignment lengthens your neck. It widens your shoulder line.\"\n\nFroman made her hold a ball to bring awareness to her arm. \"When there's weight in it and when you're activating those fingers, it's different than just having your arm as a prop or lifeless,\" he said. \"By the time we started working on choreography, she had beautiful hands and a really nice neck and shoulders.\"\n\nAnd he didn't make the exercises easy. \"Even for an actor, they have to understand this world,\" he said. \"It's almost like a religion. Every day there's a checklist going through your head: Where's my centre of gravity? Are my ribs closed?\"\n\nDuring the filming, Froman stood behind the camera facing Lawrence instead of using a microphone as he talked her through the movement. \"I wanted it to be just between the two of us,\" he said. \"Immediately, she performed exactly the quality of work that we had rehearsed. It didn't all go out the window because of nerves.\"", "images":
