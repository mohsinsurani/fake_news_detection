I never heard any stories like this \u2014 I never heard anything specific \u2014 but it\u2019s devastating to hear,\u201d the Gossip Girl alum, 30, told The Hollywood Reporter on Tuesday, October 11. \u201cThe No. 1 thing that can happen is that people who share their stories, people have to listen to them and trust them, and people have to take it seriously.\u201d\n\nThe Green Lantern actress added: \u201cAs important as it is to remain furious about this, it\u2019s important to also say that this exists everywhere so remember to look everywhere. This isn\u2019t a single incident. This cannot happen, this should not happen, and it happens in ever single industry.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt happens to women all over the place, all the time, to the point where women don\u2019t even think that this is a real assault,\u201d she continued. \u201cI\u2019ve had plenty of things happen to me whether it be trying on a dress for prom at some clothing store, to a director being inappropriate, to a guy walking down the street where you don\u2019t think, \u2018Oh well, that wasn\u2019t actually sexual assault \u2014 this just just, like, grabbed my butt.\u2019\u201d\n\nIn a call to action, The Shallows star noted, \u201cIt\u2019s important that women are furious right now. It\u2019s important that there is an uprising. It\u2019s important that we don\u2019t stand for this and that we don\u2019t focus on one or two or three or four stories, it\u2019s important that we focus on humanity in general and say, \u2018This is unacceptable.\u2019\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, 65-year-old Weinstein was fired from his own company amid allegations of sexual harassment and assault made against him. The former studio exec denied the claims in a statement to Us Weekly. \u201cAny allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein,\u201d his spokesperson Sallie Hofmeister said. \u201cMr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. Mr. Weinstein obviously can\u2019t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual.\u201d\n\nWeinstein\u2019s wife, Georgina Chapman, recently announced that she is leaving him to focus on their children\u2019s wellbeing. The Miramax producer reportedly flew to Arizona on Wednesday, October 11, to seek treatment for sex addiction.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/673058600_harvey-weinstein-blake-lively-zoom-3d706119-3f96-48cd-a230-08824cba4cf2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/673058600_harvey-weinstein-blake-lively-zoom-3d706119-3f96-48cd-a230-08824cba4cf2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-lively-condemns-harvey-weinstein-amid-allegations-w508702/", "title": "Blake Lively Condemns Harvey Weinstein Amid Allegations", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Blake Lively spoke out against Harvey Weinstein and supported the multiple women who accused the movie mogul of sexual misconduct \u2014 see more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Lively Condemns Weinstein: \u2018This Is Unacceptable\u2019", "description": "Blake Lively spoke out against Harvey Weinstein and supported the multiple women who accused the movie mogul of sexual misconduct \u2014 see more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-lively-condemns-harvey-weinstein-amid-allegations-w508702/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:25:46+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/673058600_harvey-weinstein-blake-lively-zoom-3d706119-3f96-48cd-a230-08824cba4cf2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/673058600_harvey-weinstein-blake-lively-zoom-3d706119-3f96-48cd-a230-08824cba4cf2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-10-12T22:24:36+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:25:46+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blake Lively Condemns Weinstein: \u2018This Is Unacceptable\u2019", "description": "Blake Lively spoke out against Harvey Weinstein and supported the multiple women who accused the movie mogul of sexual misconduct \u2014 see more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/673058600_harvey-weinstein-blake-lively-zoom-3d706119-3f96-48cd-a230-08824cba4cf2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507847076.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
