Her full face was not in view in the photos she posted to social media, and she even penned a note to the members of her fan club on Jan. 1, warning them that her appearance might be altered the next time they saw her.\n\nHere\u2019s a bit more about her accident, which occurred while she was taking her dogs out for a walk.\n\n\u2018I Might Look A Bit Different\u2019\n\nIn Underwood\u2019s fan letter, she wrote:\n\n\u201cAnd when I am ready to get in front of a camera, I want you all to understand why I might look a bit different. I\u2019m hoping that, by then, the differences are minimal, but, again, I just don\u2019t know how it\u2019s all going to end up.\u201d\n\nIn January, Underwood shared an X-ray image of her wrist that showed the extent of the injury\u2014and it certainly looked painful.\n\n\u201cLast check up on the old wrist this morning!!\u201d she wrote on her post. \u201cThanks, Dr. Wurth and my PT angel, Renee, a.k.a. \u2018Bulldog\u2019 for fixing me up!!! \ud83d\ude09 I\u2019m good to go!\u201d\n\nAs you can see, there is a piece of hardware in place.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BeIscOiFMJN/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=embed_ufi\n\n\u201cIn addition to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I\u2019ll spare you the gruesome details, but when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told Mike (Fisher, Underwood\u2019s husband, pictured below with her last October before her fall) that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in.\u201d\n\nGetty Images | Rick Diamond\n\nAll the photos that Underwood shared in the months after her accident had her face partially covered, making it hard to see any visible injuries.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BdOBtCxlnXD/?utm_source=ig_embed&utm_campaign=embed_ufi\n\nIn Underwood\u2019s letter to fans, she wrote \u2014 a bit ominously \u2014 that there was part of the story that she hadn\u2019t \u201cbeen ready to talk about.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere is also another part of the story that I haven\u2019t been ready to talk about, since I have still been living it and there has been much uncertainty as to how things will end up,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how a freak random accident can change your life.\u201d\n\nBetween her letter and keeping her face out of the public eye, Underwood certainly kept fans guessing.\n\nOn Dec. 12 of last year, reality star Adrienne Gang of \u201cBelow Deck\u201d spotted Underwood working out at a gym and tweeted a photo of herself alongside the star, who appeared healthy and happy:\n\nJust worked out next to @carrieunderwood NBD\u2026 she is adorable and so gracious\u2026 LOVE HER! #BelowDeck pic.twitter.com/scDPGudEe3 \u2014 Adrienne Gang (@AdrienneGang) December 12, 2017\n\nGang noted in her caption that she found Underwood \u201cadorable and gracious,\u201d noting that she didn\u2019t notice anything remarkable on Underwood\u2019s face and that she had no idea the singer had taken a fall.\n\nMuch Ado About Nothing?\n\nAs the star started to resurface, people were confused when she looked, basically, exactly the same. Expecting a major change in her appearance, fans began to feel that the singer had made much ado about nothing.\n\nOn May 10, Underwood appeared on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday,\u201d and anchor Hoda Kotb said what everyone\u2019s been thinking when she remarked, \u201cI\u2019m looking at you, and I feel like you look the same.\u201d\n\nWatch the clip below:\n\nA Triumphant Return\n\nUnderwood called her fall a \u201cfreak accident\u201d and credits her unchanged appearance to a \u201cdedicated team of professionals who can spackle and paint and paste.\u201d\n\nWith her accident now firmly in the rearview mirror, Underwood made a triumphant return to the spotlight when she earned a standing ovation singing her new single, \u201cCry Pretty,\u201d at the Academy of Country Music Awards on April 15.\n\nKotb suggested that there was something different about the powerhouse performance, and Underwood agreed, saying that when you\u2019re singing something that comes straight from the heart, \u201cit\u2019s easy to just be in the moment and be connected to it.\u201d\n\nGetty Images | Ethan Miller\n\nA couple weeks later, se brought the house down when she performed an impassioned rendition of the the \u201cStar-Spangled Banner\u201d prior to the NHL Stanley Cup Playoffs game in Nashville, Tennessee, on April 29.\n\nMaking the performance even more special, of course, was the fact that her her husband, Fisher, was playing for the Nashville Predators in their game against the Winnipeg Jets. The \u201cproud hockey wife\u201d even donned her husband\u2019s jersey for the occasion.\n\nCheck out her awesome performance below:\n\nCelebrating 10 Years At The Opry\n\nFollowing this string of public appearances, Underwood celebrated another major milestone on May 11. The Grand Old Opry marked the singer\u2019s 10th anniversary of her induction.\n\nBased on one of her recent social media posts, it\u2019s clear the singer is starting to feel more like herself.\n\nWe\u2019re so glad Underwood is back and better than ever!", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2075%2075'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20702%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_59499035-120x120.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/946714036_carrie-underwood-acm-awards.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%202250'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%20996'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/AdobeStock_15907096-120x120.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ic_scripps.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20550%20110'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/carrie-underwood.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201500%201103'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-948936452-702x500.jpg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/866041454_carrie-underwood-mike-fisher.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/AdobeStock_197077261-120x120.jpeg", "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/cropped-cropped-simplemost_logo550new.png"], "top_img": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/carrie-underwood.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Streit"], "canonical_link": "https://www.simplemost.com/hoda-kotb-tells-carrie-underwood-she-looks-the-same-post-accident/", "title": "Hoda Kotb Tells Carrie Underwood She Looks The Same", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Carrie Underwood Opens Up To Hoda Kotb About Her Return After Her Freak Accident", "description": "Last November, Carrie Underwood suffered a fall outside her home, which resulted in a broken wrist and injuries to her face that required more than 40 stitches.\r...", "url": "https://www.simplemost.com/hoda-kotb-tells-carrie-underwood-she-looks-the-same-post-accident/", "site_name": "Simplemost", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/carrie-underwood.jpg", "width": 1500, "height": 1103}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/simplemostsite", "published_time": "2018-05-10T19:57:05+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-16T12:51:23+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Simplemostsite", "site": "@Simplemostsite", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Kate Streit", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "5 minutes"}, "news_keywords": "carrie underwood, carrie underwood face, carrie underwood fall, carrie underwood stitches, hoda kotb, the today show", "original-source": "https://www.simplemost.com/hoda-kotb-tells-carrie-underwood-she-looks-the-same-post-accident/", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.simplemost.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/cropped-simplemost_logo-s-270x270.png", "priority": 1}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/MdZmi9HGd9w?feature=oembed", "https://www.youtube.com/embed/rs-mqG7gzoI?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1525982225.0, "source": "https://www.simplemost.com", "summary": ""}
