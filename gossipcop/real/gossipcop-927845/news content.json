He has a lawyer he doesn\u2019t pay,\u201d Kimmel quipped. \u201cBy the way, I\u2019m thinking of hiring Michael Cohen as my lawyer. He only has three clients and apparently, he works for free. He doesn\u2019t take money from anyone.\u201d\n\nThis new controversy comes just over a week after the two television personalities engaged in a heated back-and-forth on Twitter that ended with an apology from Kimmel.\n\nWatch the full clip below.\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jesse-Bryant-skiing-at-JHMR-e1612191790559.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-9-57-34-am.png?w=1182&h=628&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-10-29-21-am.png?w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-9-57-34-am.png?w=1182&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5242992/jimmy-kimmel-sean-hannity-michael-cohen-client/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Rips Sean Hannity Over Michael Cohen Reveal", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0apparently couldn't help but have some fun with the news that\u00a0Sean Hannity is lawyer Michael Cohen's mystery \"third client.\"", "og": {"title": "Jimmy Kimmel Rips 'Pal' Sean Hannity Over Michael Cohen Reveal", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5242992/jimmy-kimmel-sean-hannity-michael-cohen-client/", "description": "The Fox News host was revealed as Cohen's secret \"third client\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-9-57-34-am.png?w=1182&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1182, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5242992/jimmy-kimmel-sean-hannity-michael-cohen-client/", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel\u00a0apparently couldn't help but have some fun with the news that\u00a0Sean Hannity is lawyer Michael Cohen's mystery \"third client.\"", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-9-57-34-am.png?w=1182&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5242992/jimmy-kimmel-sean-hannity-michael-cohen-client/", "title": "Jimmy Kimmel Rips 'Pal' Sean Hannity Over Michael Cohen Reveal", "description": "The Fox News host was revealed as Cohen's secret \"third client\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/screen-shot-2018-04-17-at-9-57-34-am.png?w=1182&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
