After some days since the Aussie actress lashed out at Katy Perry and her brand new music, Ruby Rose resurfaced on Twitter. She seemingly went back to the whole ordeal, and in some messages which she shared this Saturday, she shed more light on the situation.\n\nRuby Rose said that her mission is to \u201cstick up for the underdogs\u201d and she also admitted that fact that usually, she doesn\u2019t like to speak out against other people.\n\n\u201cBeing mean doesn\u2019t suit me and leaves me feeling dirty,\u201d the Orange Is the New Black starlet posted.\n\n\u201cTruth is being mean leaves more leaks in your camp than the titanic and I\u2026 get so triggered when I think bullies don\u2019t get held accountable, and it makes me think I should say something.. but it\u2019s not [my] place.\u201d\n\nShe continued saying that she has always believed that Karma does exist and the truth always comes to the surface no matter what you do.\n\nShe also admitted the fact that she is not God and she is not able to tell when this will happen.\n\n\u201cClearly comes from being bullied in school & wanting to stick up for the underdogs,\u201d she concluded. \u201cHowever I shouldn\u2019t stoop because then the [message] is mixed.\u201d\n\nThe whole drama began when Ruby Rose targeted Katy Perry and her \u201csloppy mess\u201d (how she called it) of newly released tracks and also the singer\u2019s participation in Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for president.\n\nShe also said that she think that everything that is going on in the world from re-branding as political activist only to ditch it and go low is quite a bummer.\n\nAfter this, rumors began speculating the fact that Ruby\u2019s rand was inspired by her friendship with Taylor Swift who is currently in a feud with Perry.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWhile the Song to the Rythm songstress still had to respond to all these comments coming from Rose, she revealed the meaning behind her newest diss track with Nicki Minaj, Swish Swish. \u201cThat\u2019s kinda what this record is about, it\u2019s just like 360-degree liberation,\u201d she said.", "images":
