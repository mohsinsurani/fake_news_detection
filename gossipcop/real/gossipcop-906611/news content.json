(Video: Reuters)\n\nGift Article Share\n\nDespite an imminent government shutdown, it took only two words for Kanye and Kim Kardashian West to break into the news cycle Friday. As they do. This time, it was with \u201cChicago West,\u201d the announcement of the name of their third child, a baby girl born by surrogacy Jan. 15. She joined older siblings North West and Saint West, whose names also received their fair share of scrutiny after they were bequeathed.\n\nKim tweeted the name Friday afternoon \u2014 and the jokes came immediately: Chicago West sounded like the name of a hospital. Would the child\u2019s nickname be \u201cWindy\u201d? Would she always be cold? Kim Kardashian, one person argued, had just out-Kim Kardashianed herself.\n\nKim and Kanye named their baby Chicago West. She's 7 lbs, 6 oz and -14\u00b0 with wind chill. \u2014 comedycentral (@ComedyCentral) January 19, 2018\n\nBut, given that the nation\u2019s third-largest city often finds itself in the news for other, less positive reasons, Chicagoans\u2019 responses to the name of the newest Kardashian West child were mostly good-natured. Choose Chicago, the city\u2019s tourism bureau, immediately approved.\n\nWe like it, Kimye.\n\n\n\nWelcome, Chicago West! \u2014 Choose Chicago (@ChooseChicago) January 19, 2018\n\n\u201cWe congratulate Kim and Kanye on the wonderful addition to their family,\u201d Choose Chicago president David Whitaker said in a statement. \u201cWe realize this is a special time for them and we\u2019re thrilled that they\u2019ve chosen a name that represents a city we\u2019re so proud to call home. And, we look forward to welcoming Chicago for her first visit.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Chicago Bears and Chicago White Sox also acknowledged the tribute.\n\nChicago Bears est. 1920\n\nChicago West est. 2018 \u2014 Chicago Bears (@ChicagoBears) January 19, 2018\n\nThe restaurant chain Portillo\u2019s offered the child a lifetime supply of its Chicago-style eats \u2014 \u201credeemable by your parents until you can eat solid foods.\u201d\n\nEven the Windy City\u2019s self-proclaimed cynics begrudgingly voiced their appreciation for the moniker.\n\nNot to be outdone by real life, NBC\u2019s array of Chicago-themed shows \u2014 \u201cChicago Fire,\u201d \u201cChicago Med\u201d and \u201cChicago PD\u201d \u2014 jumped aboard the Chicago West train, joking it would be \u201ccoming soon\u201d to the network.\n\nJokes aside, the name tribute brought some unexpected positive attention to a city that is perpetually used by politicians as a proxy for conversations about crime, policing and violence. In his first major television interview after taking office, President Trump last year highlighted Chicago\u2019s homicide rate \u2014 which had reached a two-decade high \u2014 and suggested police and city officials were \u201cnot doing the job,\u201d perhaps because they were \u201cbeing overly politically correct.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTrump once threatened to \u201csend in the Feds!\u201d and said the city\u2019s crime was \u201ctotally out of control,\u201d two of about a half-dozen tweets he has posted over the past year about Chicago. All but one, a tweet welcoming the Chicago Cubs to the White House, were negative.\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder the city would welcome such a tribute, even in the form of a celebrity baby name. The announcement prompted a couple of Chicago\u2019s suburbs to try to ride the coattails of the trending topic to promote themselves, with varying degrees of success.\n\nWe're thinking \"Oak Park\" could be a good nickname... \ud83d\ude00 \u2014 Visit Oak Park (@VisitOakPark) January 19, 2018\n\nWe\u2019re not technically Chicago west, or West Chicago, but we think Chicago West would love our western Chicago suburb. Kanye and Kim could take her on a stroller ride along our Riverwalk. Bring North and Saint along, too. #ChicagoWest \u2014 NapervilleIL (@NapervilleIL) January 19, 2018\n\nAs The Washington Post\u2019s Sonia Rao pointed out, Chicago might actually be a perfect name for Kim and Kanye\u2019s baby for several reasons, not the least of which is Kanye\u2019s deep ties to the city:\n\nAfter his parents divorced when he was 3, Kanye and his mother, Donda, moved to Chicago . He grew up in Oak Lawn and references the city in his work quite often, most prominently in the 2007 song, \u201cHomecoming.\u201d Featured artist Chris Martin sings about fireworks at Lake Michigan, and Kanye raps about meeting a girl named Windy, a blatant metaphor for the Windy City that could double as a nickname for his child. In case it was not clear, he later raps, \u201cIf you don\u2019t know by now, I\u2019m talkin\u2019 \u2019bout Chi-town.\u201d Rumor has it the Wests named their first daughter North because she represented a high point in their lives. Saint was reportedly chosen for their second child because he was a blessing after Kim\u2019s difficult pregnancy. Chicago seems to be just as special to the couple.\n\nThe rapper Common, a frequent Kanye collaborator who also hails from Chicago, told TMZ that it was a fitting name, and not just because of Kanye\u2019s devotion to Chi-town.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cHe deserves to be able to name his child Chicago, for as much as he does for our city, and as much as he loves our city,\u201d Common told the celebrity news site. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a fresh name for a kid. I love it.\u201d\n\nA spokesman for Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel \u2014 who also hosts the podcast \u201cChicago Stories\u201d \u2014 did not immediately respond to a request for comment Saturday morning on the unexpected tip of the hat toward his city.\n\nRead more:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2018-01-19/AP/People-Kardashian_Baby_Name_21852-dcabb.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2018-01-19/AP/People-Kardashian_Baby_Name_21852-dcabb.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy B Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/20/kim-and-kanye-named-their-new-baby-girl-chicago-west-and-the-city-is-loving-the-attention/", "title": "Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention", "meta_data": {"description": "Chicago is the newest member of the Kardashian West clan, joining siblings North and Saint.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/20/kim-and-kanye-named-their-new-baby-girl-chicago-west-and-the-city-is-loving-the-attention/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2018-01-19/AP/People-Kardashian_Baby_Name_21852-dcabb.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention", "description": "Chicago is the newest member of the Kardashian West clan, joining siblings North and Saint."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim and Kanye named their new baby girl Chicago West, and the city is loving the attention", "description": "Chicago is the newest member of the Kardashian West clan, joining siblings North and Saint."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-12-03T05:19:47.457Z", "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-20T19:02:36.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-12-03T05:19:47.457Z", "section": "Arts & Entertainment", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 71, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2018/01/20/kim-and-kanye-named-their-new-baby-girl-chicago-west-and-the-city-is-loving-the-attention/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516406400.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
