He was so excited. We're both just so excited.\"\n\nJoanna and Chip already have 13-year-old son Drake, 11-year-old daughter Ella, 9-year-old son Duke and 8-year-old daughter Emmie.\n\n\"Every single time they see my belly they have to rub it,\" Joanna said of her kids. \"I think it's sweet because they're older now, and I can see them wanting to be a part of this. We're all rallying around this baby, which I feel is a sweet gift to our family.\"\n\nJoanna announced her pregnancy in January following news Fixer Upper would end after Season 5. She said in an interview last week that new products and her kids have made her fifth pregnancy easier.\n\n\"It feels like it's all brand-new, even the things that are available now to moms, the star told Entertainment Tonight. \"Everything is so fun, these things are really going to help me!\"\n\n\"I am having so much [fun] now that my kids are older,\" she added. \"I was right in the thick of it, trying to figure things out, and now I have four older helpers. They are so excited.\"\n\nA post shared by Chip Gaines (@chipgaines) on Apr 3, 2018 at 4:22pm PDT\n\nFixer Upper aired its final episode on HGTV in April. The show followed Chip and Joanna as they renovated homes in the Waco, Texas, area.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180503075901im_/https://www.upi.com/upi/dw/img/upi_logo.svg",
