Cheryl Cole shut down a report that suggested her boyfriend, Liam Payne, was acting inappropriately with one his dancers.\n\n\u201cI usually don\u2019t bother myself to respond to stupid articles. But in my silence they hold the pen,\u201d the singer, 34, tweeted onFriday, March 30. \u201cThis is a stupid article, clutching at very small straws. But I can\u2019t ignore this story involving an innocent dancer colleague of Liam\u2019s who has a fianc\u00e9, and dragging them into this desperate attempt to try to cause problems between Liam and I. Nor do I understand the daily onslaught of stories.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other \u2018mystery woman\u2019 in the story happens to be my long-term friend and manager (that\u2019s embarrassing) I also happen to love Katy Perry,\u201d she wrote, adding a shrugging emoji. Cole\u2019s mention of the \u201cChained to the Rhythm\u201d singer, 33, is likely in reference to the former One Direction guy, 24, being criticized after he shared an Instagram photo of himself hugging Perry on Tuesday, March 27.\n\nGood luck tonight @katyperry \ud83d\udca5 A post shared by Liam Payne (@liampayne) on Mar 27, 2018 at 3:53am PDT\n\n\u201cOh and you can save yourselves from \u2018Cheryl hits back\u2019 blah blah articles bc honestly No.. one.. cares!\u201d The X Factor judge continued.\n\nNow.. off on our holiday. And the only thing we\u2019re making are memories. And breaking is our healthy eating \ud83d\ude01 toodles \ud83d\ude4b\ud83c\udffb\u200d\u2640\ufe0f \u2014 Cheryl (@CherylOfficial) March 30, 2018\n\nShe also liked a fan\u2019s tweet responding to her posts, which said: \u201cAlways remember\u2026 Rumors are carried by haters, spread by fools, and accepted by idiots.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Payne has also addressed the speculation surrounding their relationship and revealed that although they haven\u2019t split up, the pair have dealt with issues in the past. \u201cThe funniest thing was a week before we were getting married. The next week we\u2019re splitting up,\u201d Payne said in his cover story for London\u2019s ES magazine, published on March 21. \u201cAnd the thing for me is, I just like to think we\u2019re somewhere in the middle. You know, we have our struggles \u2014 like, of course, I\u2019m not gonna sit here and say that everything\u2019s absolutely fine and dandy, because of course you go through different things, and that\u2019s what a relationship is.\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cBut we go through them together as a family and that\u2019s the most important thing for me.\u201d\n\nThe duo, who has been dealing with speculation about their relationship since they first got together, shut down break up rumors by making a rare appearance as a couple on the red carpet at the 2018 Brit Awards in February. The pair first met in 2008 when the \u201cBedroom Floor\u201d singer auditioned for The X Factor when the former Girls Aloud member was a judge on the U.K. singing competition show. They began dating in 2015 and are now parents to their 1-year-old son, Bear.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/533933040_cheryl-cole-liam-payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/533933040_cheryl-cole-liam-payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/533933040_cheryl-cole-liam-payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cheryl-cole-denies-liam-payne-cheated/", "title": "Cheryl Cole Shuts Down Liam Payne Cheating Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Cheryl Cole took to Twitter on Friday, March 30, to shut down a report that claimed that Liam Payne was cheating on her \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cheryl Cole Shuts Down Liam Payne Cheating Rumors", "description": "Cheryl Cole took to Twitter on Friday, March 30, to shut down a report that claimed that Liam Payne was cheating on her \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cheryl-cole-denies-liam-payne-cheated/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-30T18:57:10+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/533933040_cheryl-cole-liam-payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/533933040_cheryl-cole-liam-payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-30T18:56:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-30T18:57:10+00:00"}, "author": "Karla Rodriguez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cheryl Cole Shuts Down Liam Payne Cheating Rumors", "description": "Cheryl Cole took to Twitter on Friday, March 30, to shut down a report that claimed that Liam Payne was cheating on her \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/533933040_cheryl-cole-liam-payne-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522436209.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
