Two nights after Morris had performed on the main stage at Las Vegas\u2019 Route 91 Harvest Festival, loved ones were frantically trying to reach her: Did she make it home OK? Was everyone she knew safe? Then, the singer started to read the news: the previous evening, after she had gone to bed, and in front of the very same stage on which she had performed, the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history had taken place.\n\n\u201cI felt this sick pit in my stomach,\u201d Morris tells Rolling Stone. \u201cI had been there the night before and, reading that the shooter had checked into the hotel Thursday, he could have picked any of the days of the festival to carry out this horrific plan. It gives you a bit of survivor\u2019s guilt.\u201d\n\nMorris\u2019 Saturday evening performance, which took place just before Sam Hunt\u2019s headlining set, had been one of the most feel-good shows she\u2019d played all year. \u201cThe festival was so fun and well-organized. It was very secure, it felt so safe to be there, and it was one of the favorite festivals I\u2019ve played. You couldn\u2019t even see the edge of the crowd, it was that big. It sounds cliche I guess, but it just seemed like the least likely place where something this tragic could go down.\u201d\n\nFeeling paralyzed with guilt and sick with inaction, Morris then thought of a song she had written more than two years earlier, just two days after the 2015 Charleston, South Carolina, church shooting. \u201cIt was a really emotional day to write that song,\u201d Morris says. The song, \u201cDear Hate,\u201d was a prayer of belief in the power of healing and hope in the face of obscene violence. \u201cI\u2019ve had the song in my pocket for the last few years and I never knew when to release it,\u201d says Morris. \u201cI wanted to be precious with it because it is such a sensitive subject. It\u2019s just insane how relevant the message still is today. \u201d\n\nLast year, Morris sent the song to Vince Gill to see if the legendary singer would like to record a vocal for the track. \u201cHe immediately called me and said he was on board and did the whole thing for free.\u201d Less than 24 hours after Morris has released \u201cDear Hate\u201d \u2013 a portion of the proceeds of which she will be donating to the Music City Cares fund for victims in Las Vegas \u2013 the song has racked up more than 500,000 plays on YouTube.\n\nLike so many artists who performed at Route 91, Morris is still recovering. \u201cI\u2019m trying not to think too far into it because when things like this happen it does make you start to fear and second guess going on stage. You just don\u2019t know what can happen. But I also think this is a time when as artists and fans and music lovers in general, we can band together and not stop going to shows, going to festivals, going to concerts. The biggest thing we can do besides donating money and donating blood is not being afraid to still enjoy live music.\u201d\n\nAs for the song\u2019s message, Morris is convinced that even in today\u2019s polarized world of social media vitriol, her \u201csong of hope and love and kindness\u201d is surely something on which everyone can agree.\n\n\u201cThe song is really not partisan, it\u2019s just about bringing love and kindness to the world,\u201d says the singer. \u201cI\u2019m staring at all the facets of hatred, the horrific things that have happened throughout history. In the last couple of years, especially, it just feels like we\u2019ve been bashed over the head with horrible headlines.\u201d\n\nDespite its nonpartisan message, Morris says that releasing the song, which references the Selma Bridge and the assassination of JFK, represents a transformational point for the singer. \u201cHate is everywhere, and I\u2019m sick of not doing enough,\u201d she explained on Instagram.\n\nIndeed, Morris believes strongly that the tragedy in Las Vegas needs to inspire debates and conversations on the issue of guns, which up until now has traditionally been a third-rail topic of public discussion in country music.\n\n\u201cI think there always needs to be conversations about that,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t really speak on everything because I know they\u2019re still confirming so many details, but I do feel more awake, and I hope that the rest of the world is too because there\u2019s clearly a problem. While we are still mourning and in shock right now, those questions are all being asked, which I do think is a slight silver lining through everything. I hope that we take action to figure out how to prevent this from ever happening again.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-846257782-9c86350d-06d0-49a5-a3f7-b2ce9c7b4b98.jpg?w=1581&h=1054&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-846257782-9c86350d-06d0-49a5-a3f7-b2ce9c7b4b98.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-846257782-9c86350d-06d0-49a5-a3f7-b2ce9c7b4b98.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Bernstein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-country/maren-morris-talks-las-vegas-shooting-response-song-dear-hate-122398/", "title": "Maren Morris Talks Las Vegas Shooting, Response Song \u2018Dear Hate\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#df3535", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Maren Morris discusses her new song \"Dear Hate,\" released in the aftermath of the Las Vegas shooting.", "news_keywords": "Las Vegas, Maren Morris", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "rollingstone", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 122398, "author": "Jonathan Bernstein", "pmc-category": "Music,Music Country", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-10-03T19:06:00"}, "pmc-tag": "Las Vegas,Maren Morris", "title": "Maren Morris Talks Las Vegas Shooting, Response Song \u2018Dear Hate\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Jonathan Bernstein", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RS", "application-name": "RS", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 122398, "title": "Maren Morris Talks Las Vegas Shooting, Response Song 'Dear Hate'", "published_at": "2017-10-03 19:06:00", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-846257782-9c86350d-06d0-49a5-a3f7-b2ce9c7b4b98.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Maren Morris", "topics": "Music Country", "body": "On Monday morning, Maren Morris woke up to 50 text messages from friends and family.
