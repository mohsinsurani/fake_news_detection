Yet, Chastain says that might be how her Italian in-laws, the parents of her fashion executive husband fashion executive Gian Luca Passi de Preposulo, feel about her. Last night when she stopped by Jimmy Kimmel Live, she opened up about an awkward season of holiday meals with her husband\u2019s family as well as her own \u2014 mostly due to her vegan diet and cultural differences.\n\nThe two families met in the Alps, Cortina d\u2019Ampezzo, Italy, where things got \u201cinteresting.\u201d \u201cMy family is from Northern California,\u201d Chastain told Kimmel. \u201cAnd his family is from Veneto, Italy. My family doesn\u2019t speak [Italian] and his family speaks very little English\u2026 It was a very quiet holiday, but there was a lot of pointing and a lot of food.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s where the families differed: \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for about six years and Americans eat in about an hour,\u201d says Chastain. \u201cA meal starts and then it\u2019s done. When I went to Italy, I didn\u2019t realize that meals last for three or four hours\u2026 I don\u2019t understand this but Sunday brunch will go from 1 pm to 5 pm. You eat one course and it\u2019s delicious. Then the second your plate is done, his mom is putting more food on my plate. So I have a trick where I just push the food around on my plate for hours.\u201d\n\nChastain\u2019s vegan diet, however, poses more of an issue for her in these situations than the duration of the meals. \u201cIn the beginning, I would say I\u2019m vegan. Which is like the worst thing. I don\u2019t eat 10 meals and I\u2019m vegan. I would say, \u2018I\u2019m sorry I can\u2019t eat that,\u2019 and [my mother-in-law] would say, \u2018No problem, we have fish\u2019.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you think they hate you?\u201d Kimmel asks, to which Chastain responds, \u201cMaybe that\u2019s why it\u2019s so quiet. They just hate me.\u201d\n\n[#youtube: https://www.youtube.com/embed/4RYZEOZqWGk]\n\nChastain explained why she went vegan last year, telling W, \u201d I found myself going to veganism because a friend of mine had a two week vegan food delivery program she wasn\u2019t going to use so I used it, and immediately I just had more energy than I\u2019ve ever had in my life\u2026 Being vegan was not anything I ever wanted to be. I just really was listening to what my body was telling me.\u201d\n\nRelated: Jessica Chastain Says \u2018Major Change\u2019 Is Coming to Hollywood in Palm Springs International Film Festival Speech\n\n[#gallery: /galleries/58d53c2d2d05881d66ad26f1]||||||", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/12/15/5852b9d357dfc3b0230f481a_arss-jessica-chastain-artist-portfolio-04-v.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/12/15/5852b9d357dfc3b0230f481a_arss-jessica-chastain-artist-portfolio-04-v.jpg?w=414&h=532&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/5/47b5fa0f-fc48-4cb1-9604-6f5821fa832d-getty-1430611960.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5093&fp-y=0.3502", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/8/29/9f122c0b-8ad0-4d04-b2cf-3379547870db-tswifty.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.532&fp-y=0.228"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/12/15/5852b9d357dfc3b0230f481a_arss-jessica-chastain-artist-portfolio-04-v.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/jessica-chastain-vegan-italian-inlaws", "title": "Jessica Chastain Worries Her Italian In-Laws \u201cHate\u201d Her Because She\u2019s a Vegan", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marissagmuller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/jessica-chastain-vegan-italian-inlaws", "type": "article", "title": "Vegan Jessica Chastain Had an Awkward Holiday Meal With Her Italian In-Laws", "description": "\"They just hate me.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2016/12/15/5852b9d357dfc3b0230f481a_arss-jessica-chastain-artist-portfolio-04-v.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "\"They just hate me.\""}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
