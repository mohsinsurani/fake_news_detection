Maybe that\u2019s why they\u2019re always twinning in adorable matching outfits. In addition to being the G.O.A.T. in tennis, Williams is a happily married mom. We get to see that on her social media, and it\u2019s so sweet.\n\nShe\u2019s also a successful business mogul. (Watch out for the upcoming launch of her reported cosmetics line!) In addition, she bravely uses her voice and platform to speak out for important issues. After she experienced medical complications following the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr., by emergency C-section in 2017, she talked about the racism inherent in the American health care industry and the importance of doctors listening to women about their own bodies.\n\nBasically, Serena Williams is an incredibly accomplished woman. Who wouldn\u2019t look up to her? When she posts about her daughter on social media, she\u2019s sharing her joy, and that\u2019s beautiful. Baby Alexis Olympia has already graced magazine covers with her mom, proving she\u2019s a fashion mogul in the making. So, it\u2019s no wonder Williams was thrilled to dress in matching outfits with her daughter for Easter weekend. Williams shared their ensembles via her Instagram Story on Saturday, even detailing their accessories. (Because c\u2019mon, no look is complete without the right accessories.)\n\nJust look at this gorgeous mother-daughter duo!\n\nHere\u2019s how Serena Williams described their coordinating looks:\n\n\"Olympia is wearing a beautiful tulle dress with gold, and it's white, and that's why I decided to wear white,\" Williams said. \"Now check out her gold shoes! Olympia decided that she wanted to wear gold shoes, so mommy decided to wear gold shoes to match her, and we decided we'd try to be twinsies.\"\n\nWe think you nailed it and then some, Serena.\n\nTruthfully, the two look adorably happy together in every pic, even when they\u2019re not matching.\n\nHappy Easter, Serena and Alexis Olympia!", "images":
