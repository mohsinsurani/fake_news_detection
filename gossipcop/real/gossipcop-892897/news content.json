{"url": "https://people.com/archive/mel-gibson-out-of-control-vol-74-no-1/", "text": "For one sunny summer weekend, at least, there was peace in the mad, mad world of Mel Gibson. He spent July 10 and 11 playing and enjoying time with his 9-month-old daughter Lucia in his Malibu home. \u201cHe\u2019s okay as long as he\u2019s with her,\u201d says a friend. \u201cHe loves that baby.\u201d Meanwhile his ex-girlfriend and Lucia\u2019s mom, Oksana Grigorieva, 40-his adversary in a ferocious ongoing custody battle-was photographed 15 miles away, grocery shopping.\n\nBut as soon as the weekend was over, one of Hollywood\u2019s nastiest breakups went ballistic again. On July 12 an eight-minute recording allegedly of Gibson viciously ranting at Grigorieva was posted on Radaronline.com, which has posted several leaked tapes despite a judge\u2019s ordering them sealed. Hyperventilating with fury during the phone conversation early this year, Gibson, 54, screams and curses while seemingly admitting to having hit Grigorieva in the face while she held Lucia and threatening to bury Grigorieva \u201cin an [expletive] rose garden \u2026 I\u2019m capable of it\u201d (see box). Gibson\u2019s raw, hate-filled outbursts-other tapes, reportedly made by Grigorieva, included racial and ethnic slurs-have people wondering how the life of a movie star once renowned for his charm and humility could have gone so far off the rails.\n\nGibson may have to answer that in court: The L.A. County Sheriff\u2019s Department announced it is investigating Grigorieva\u2019s claims that he hit her in the face \u201cmore than once\u201d this January, knocking out a dental veneer. (A Gibson source said the actor was restraining Grigorieva from shaking Lucia \u201clike a rag doll\u201d; Gibson also claims to have evidence Grigorieva was using tapes to try to extort money from him.) L.A. criminal defense attorney Trent Copeland calls the tapes \u201ca smoking gun of domestic violence\u201d that will create public pressure to charge Gibson, perhaps with battery and making threats. But \u201cas inflammatory as this tape is, it\u2019s not a slam dunk against Mel,\u201d says former L.A. prosecutor Jeffery Rubenstein. \u201cThe legality of the tapes will be fought over, and it could be argued that she deliberately pushed his buttons.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime Gibson\u2019s vitriolic rants, on top of anti-Semitic remarks he made during his 2006 arrest for drunk driving, have turned some of Hollywood against him. His agency William Morris Endeavor announced on July 9 that it would no longer represent him, a few days after the death of his longtime personal agent Ed Limato. Ari Emanuel, the head of WME, \u201cpersonally hated the things Mel has said and done,\u201d says an industry source. \u201cHe was embarrassed to have him at William Morris.\u201d And while Gibson has often financed his films himself, his future as a bankable mainstream actor is in doubt. His Jodie Foster-directed dark comedy The Beaver, shot last fall, still has no release date, while a proposed Viking epic with Leonardo DiCaprio \u201cwill never happen [with Leo],\u201d says a source. \u201cAt a certain point, it\u2019s five strikes and you\u2019re out,\u201d says one Hollywood insider. \u201cHe has expressed hate towards so many kinds of people, I think he\u2019s toast.\u201d\n\nSome who know Gibson say he began losing control of his life after separating from his wife of 26 years, Robyn, in 2006 and particularly after she filed for divorce in April 2009. \u201cRobyn always had a calming influence on Mel, and he always felt safe with her,\u201d says a source close to the family. \u201cHis family always stood by him through good and bad. Now Mel is like a lost boy without her.\u201d\n\nGibson seemed to rebound after his 2006 DUI arrest, apologizing for drunkenly telling cops that Jews were responsible \u201cfor all the wars in the world.\u201d He also landed the lead role in the thriller Edge of Darkness. But then he started publicly stepping out with Grigorieva, a Russian-born musician (Lucia was born last October; they broke up this March). From the beginning, say friends, they were not an ideal match. \u201cShe has no sense of humor,\u201d an acquaintance says of Grigorieva. \u201cI thought, \u2018God, Mel loves to joke, so what\u2019s he going to do with this girl?\u2019 You had an impulsive, damaged, funny man with an opportunistic, cold survivor. It was destined for doom.\u201d Sources close to Gibson\u2019s camp believe Grigorieva only dated him to benefit her career and bank account: \u201cMel realized how unhealthy the relationship was and recognized he was getting his buttons pushed. He wanted to figure out how to extricate himself peacefully and calmly,\u201d says one friend. Gibson began seeing a therapist earlier this year to help him deal with the troubled relationship, says the source, noting the actor is still in therapy.\n\nGibson has long admitted to problems controlling his emotions. In a 2002 interview he said he had been diagnosed as manic depressive; he entered rehab for alcoholism after his 2006 DUI arrest. Lately he seemed to have been staying sober. On the set of Edge of Darkness, Gibson \u201cdid not drink, and he wasn\u2019t going crazy,\u201d says production assistant Jill Habelow. A source on the set of Gibson\u2019s movie How I Spent My Summer Vacation, filmed in Mexico this spring, says Gibson \u201cwas not raging around. He was just one of the guys, and [crew members] would run through a wall for him.\u201d\n\nBut the way Gibson\u2019s anger has erupted is new and alarming, says the Gibson family source. \u201cMel never talked to Robyn in a disrespectful way,\u201d says the source. \u201cHe\u2019s had anger issues all his life, but Robyn knew how to deal with him. To hear how Mel speaks to Oksana in such a hateful manner is very sad. It shows how far off the track Mel has gone.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/jRCcVBrw35jCraV89Tn9opxBjSY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(159x0:161x2)/oksana-grigorieva-320-1-47d8958353794877bb87e27140253e59.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/CjrRo6E_i_61OEL2ScuT6One3ts=/900x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(149x0:151x2)/20100726_58-61-69e342ee5348471a9a189fb1d441c8d1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/CW2Z1jGtACcALSrZgy5ZRKHY67Y=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(216x0:218x2)/mel-gibson-435-14-6f7768bf076c46f5993b2cbafffd0018.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8cJmVZc7Ok6w5_4Wwxc14qmMsU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_generic-1885945d8bd544778fbbf4be88a63f00.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BDuxxtyyMsqJLRJaTM7BiCz1qIo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(119x0:121x2)/mel-gibson-240-72baef0ad1e8404b8f8252c0d266e344.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tpZ8chvmPe089XfLyYufaeB6Qjs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(119x0:121x2)/mel-gibson-2-240-f1f8a6d7987f4bc69a459480012277a1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_jZgzFzKjqEtlvvbo3MmW9Mm9QM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(119x0:121x2)/mel-gibson-240-1-9eb8b88e9e4b45b6900ef34080228293.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/s2TP9ac8HEtpToGiTfY_QSyjxWM=/300x195/filters:fill(auto,1)/20100726_58-61-69e342ee5348471a9a189fb1d441c8d1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Wb97FVtVcBeujoIYBUywS3hYNbo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(159x0:161x2)/mel-gibson-320-1-2ee176b29f6341f6be4056a7b3793833.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/BYIfgwzDCSIOYPXzJ-Ha1WEE4Pg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(159x0:161x2)/m_gibson320-5e8f06cca50e4af9bcd35980e4ab4095.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/qed6a60yz707-3tl61DuoJVF6gs=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(159x0:161x2)/mel-gibson-4-320-3f0d1653f4344f7e8132fd0f21862883.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/s2TP9ac8HEtpToGiTfY_QSyjxWM=/300x195/filters:fill(auto,1)/20100726_58-61-69e342ee5348471a9a189fb1d441c8d1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Tresniowski"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/archive/mel-gibson-out-of-control-vol-74-no-1/", "title": "Mel Gibson: Out of Control", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOINDEX, FOLLOW", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Amid a bitter custody fight, tapes surface of Mel Gibson allegedly spewing hate and threatening his ex-girlfriend", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "PEOPLE", "sailthru.author": "Alex Tresniowski", "article": {"section": "People", "opinion": "false", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/peoplemag"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Peoplemag", "url": "https://people.com/archive/mel-gibson-out-of-control-vol-74-no-1/", "title": "Mel Gibson: Out of Control", "description": "Amid a bitter custody fight, tapes surface of Mel Gibson allegedly spewing hate and threatening his ex-girlfriend", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/s2TP9ac8HEtpToGiTfY_QSyjxWM=/300x195/filters:fill(auto,1)/20100726_58-61-69e342ee5348471a9a189fb1d441c8d1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "title": "Mel Gibson: Out of Control", "description": "Amid a bitter custody fight, tapes surface of Mel Gibson allegedly spewing hate and threatening his ex-girlfriend", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/s2TP9ac8HEtpToGiTfY_QSyjxWM=/300x195/filters:fill(auto,1)/20100726_58-61-69e342ee5348471a9a189fb1d441c8d1.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
