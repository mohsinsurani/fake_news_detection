Looking for a spot, Alba took to a fitting room.\n\njessicaalba / Instagram\n\nSharing the very real motherhood moment on Instagram, the actress and Honest Company co-founder captioned a selfie of her and newborn, writing: \u201cTired eyes,\u201d and \u201cBreastfeeding in a Target dressing room.\u201d\n\nTarget has a mommy-friendly breastfeeding policy that reads supports nursing \"in any area of our stores, including our fitting rooms, even if others are waiting.\" It's also been reported that Target has been testing out designated nursing stations at some locations. That's something we'd love to see more of!\n\nThe \"Dark Angel\" actress has been outspoken and proud about breastfeeding her 7-week-old, sharing updates on social media before the Golden Globes, while watching Netflix and even after going to the spa.\n\nHayes, born on New Year\u2019s Eve, is Alba\u2019s third child with husband Cash Warren, joining daughters Honor Marie, 9, and Haven Garner, 6.\n\nDespite all of her successes, Alba still feels all of the typical pressures of motherhood, impromptu nursing breaks included.\n\n\u201cAny mom who all of the sudden has little people that rely heavily on them for survival needs to maintain her own sense of self,\u201d Alba told TODAY. \u201cYou need to cut yourself some slack and bite off what you can chew. Things will be compromised and you just have to be okay with that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just pray that my kids are happy,\u201d the strong mom said back in 2015. \u201cIf they\u2019re giggling more than they\u2019re crying, and if they\u2019re curious and talkative, then I know they\u2019re good.\u201d", "images":
