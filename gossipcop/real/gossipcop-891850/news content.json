His co-stars Shannon Purser and Noah Schnapp took to Twitter to defend Wolfhard\u2018s actions, along with \u2018Game Of Thrones\u2019 Sophie Turner \u2013 arguing that all people \u2018need a break\u2019, especially when they\u2019re young.\n\n\u201cHey everybody!,\u201d Wolfhard has since posted on Twitter. \u201cI don\u2019t wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but you are for real you will harass my friends, or my co-workers. Y\u2019all know who you are.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe added: \u201cWhy I even have to tweet that, I don\u2019t know. Anyone who calls themselves a \u2018fan\u2019 and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous. Think b4 ya type boiiii.\u201d\n\nHey everybody! I don't wanna ex-communicate anyone from this fandom, but if you are for real you will not harass my friends, or co-workers. Ya'll know who you are. \u2014 Finn Wolfhard (@FinnSkata) November 8, 2017\n\nWhy I even have to tweet that, I don't know. Anyone who calls themselves a \"fan\" and actively goes after someone for literally acting and doing their job is ridiculous. Think b4 ya type boiiii \u2014 Finn Wolfhard (@FinnSkata) November 8, 2017\n\nDefending Wolfhard for not stopping to meet fans, co-star Shannon Purser who played Barb in season one wrote on Twitter: \u201cOkay, no. No actor is under any obligation to stop for anyone. Finn is an incredibly kind human. But he\u2019s human and he needs breaks too.\u201d\n\n\u201cI experience this on a significantly smaller scale, obviously, but I\u2019ve had people waiting for me in hotel lobbies, at my airport gate, etc. And I\u2019m an adult. I can\u2019t imagine being inundated with all this attention at his age. It\u2019s intimidating. So, from one big sister to the world, don\u2019t you DARE make young actors feel guilty or indebted to you because they couldn\u2019t say hi. They give you their art. They love their fans. Don\u2019t take advantage of that. And if you can\u2019t handle them needing space, stay away.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-869052230_stranger_things_1000.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-869052230_stranger_things_1000-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-869052230_stranger_things_1000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew Trendell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/finn-wolfhard-calls-stranger-things-fans-stop-harassing-cast-2157835", "title": "Finn Wolfhard calls on \u2018Stranger Things\u2019 fans to stop \u2018harassing\u2019 the cast", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "'Stranger Things' star Finn Wolfhard has called upon fans to stop 'harassing' his 'friends and co-workers'.", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Finn Wolfhard calls on 'Stranger Things' fans to stop 'harassing' the cast", "description": "'Stranger Things' star Finn Wolfhard has called upon fans to stop 'harassing' his 'friends and co-workers'.", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/finn-wolfhard-calls-stranger-things-fans-stop-harassing-cast-2157835", "site_name": "NME", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-869052230_stranger_things_1000.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "published_time": "2017-11-09T10:12:51+00:00"}, "author": "Andrew Trendell", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nme", "site": "@nme", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Andrew Trendell", "label2": "Estimated reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510222371.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
