Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm.\n\nThe former WWE wrester, 38, and the businessman, 43, secretly tied the knot in March 2014. They welcomed their first child, daughter Ava Grace, now 3, that August.\n\nThree months after giving birth to their daughter, Keibler, who dated actor George Clooney from 2011 to 2013, revealed she never thought about marriage or parenthood until she started a relationship with her now-husband.\n\n\u201cLife can be unpredictable. You feel one way, and then \u2026 boom!\u201d Keibler wrote on her lifestyle blog in December 2014. \u201cYou need to entirely change your perspective. That is certainly what happened to me this past year. Until I started dating Jared, the idea of being married and having a family was never on my radar. I was just hoping that the right love would find me.\u201d\n\n\u201cBut after a serendipitous reconnection with Jared, a friend who turned out to be my soulmate, we created a family together almost instantly,\u201d she continued. \u201cTalk about a serious change in my reality! This year and the holiday season especially has me feeling so nostalgic about family \u2014 my family, my new family, and of course, the newest addition to our family. Ava has graced us with such joy, such light and such love\u2013we never saw it coming. She is our special little lady, and I couldn\u2019t be more thankful for how she has opened my heart.\u201d\n\nThe Dancing With the Stars season 2 alum has maintained a low profile since becoming a mother. In addition to shutting down her blog, Keibler has not updated her Instagram account since September 2015. The last post she shared on the social media platform was of herself reading a book titled \u201cWhat Does It Mean to Be Kind?\u201d to Ava.\n\nClooney, for his part, also started a family after his split from Keibler. The Oscar winner, 57, welcomed twins Alexander and Ella in June 2017 with his wife, Amal Clooney, whom he wed in September 2014.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stacy-keibler.jpg?crop=0px%2C381px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stacy-keibler.jpg?crop=0px%2C320px%2C2000px%2C1129px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stacy-keibler.jpg?crop=0px%2C381px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/stacy-keibler-is-pregnant-expecting-baby-no-2-with-jared-pobre/", "title": "Stacy Keibler Is Pregnant, Expecting Baby No. 2 With Jared Pobre", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Stacy Keibler and Husband Jared Pobre\u00a0Are\u00a0Expecting Baby No. 2", "description": "Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/stacy-keibler-is-pregnant-expecting-baby-no-2-with-jared-pobre/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-25T21:55:02+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stacy-keibler.jpg?crop=0px%2C381px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stacy-keibler.jpg?crop=0px%2C381px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-05-25T21:55:02+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Stacy Keibler and Husband Jared Pobre\u00a0Are\u00a0Expecting Baby No. 2", "description": "Stacy Keibler is pregnant and expecting her second child with her husband, Jared Pobre, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/stacy-keibler.jpg?crop=0px%2C381px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527285302.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
