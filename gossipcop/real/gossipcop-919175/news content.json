Neither William nor Catherine was present on Tuesday evening, the Mail reported.\n\nThe decision to conduct the rite at the Chapel Royal at St James\u2019s Palace will hold special importance for Prince Harry. The body of his mother, Diana, the late Princess of Wales, lay there for a week before her 1997 funeral. More recently, it was the chapel chosen to host the christening of Prince George in 2013.\n\nFemale empowerment\n\nOn Thursday, Prince Harry and Markle will visit Birmingham to launch a project aimed at inspiring female students to mark International Women\u2019s Day.\n\nThe pair hope to encourage young women to pursue STEM careers at an event hosted by social enterprise Stemettes.\n\nThe pair have made numerous public appearances since their engagement as well as spending a traditional Christmas with other members of the royal family including the Queen and her husband, Prince Philip.\n\nPrince Harry, Meghan Markle, Catherine, Duchess of Cambridge and Prince William, Duke of Cambridge attend the first annual Royal Foundation Forum held at Aviva on February 28 in London.

David Conner and the Archbishop of Canterbury, Kensington Palace revealed last month.\n\nThis story has been updated to correct the Duchess of Cornwall\u2019s title.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/131008091716-lauren-said-moorhouse.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180211191049-001-royal-wedding-route.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1123,w_1995,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180228133036-meghan-markle-royal-foundation.jpg?q=x_0,y_108,h_1211,w_2153,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180228110531-01-royals-0228.jpg?q=x_3,y_229,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180426114549-royal-wedding-harry-meghan-branding-logo-large-169.png?q=h_40,w_370,x_0,y_0/w_1280"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180228133036-meghan-markle-royal-foundation.jpg?q=x_0,y_108,h_1211,w_2153,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Said-Moorhouse"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/08/europe/meghan-markle-baptized-intl/index.html", "title": "Meghan Markle baptized in private ceremony", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Meghan Markle baptized in private ceremony | CNN", "description": "The American actor was reportedly baptized and confirmed in a private service at St James's Palace in London on Tuesday evening with Prince Harry by her side.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180228133036-meghan-markle-royal-foundation.jpg?q=x_0,y_108,h_1211,w_2153,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/03/08/europe/meghan-markle-baptized-intl/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Meghan Markle baptized in private ceremony | CNN", "description": "The American actor was reportedly baptized and confirmed in a private service at St James's Palace in London on Tuesday evening with Prince Harry by her side.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180228133036-meghan-markle-royal-foundation.jpg?q=x_0,y_108,h_1211,w_2153,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNN"}, "description": "The American actor was reportedly baptized and confirmed in a private service at St James's Palace in London on Tuesday evening with Prince Harry by her side.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "world", "meta-branding": "royal-wedding", "theme": "world", "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-08T10:26:38Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-09T06:59:47Z", "tag": "belief, religion and spirituality, british royal family, catherine, duchess of cambridge, celebrities, christianity, church of england, europe, meghan markle, northern europe, prince harry, queen elizabeth ii, religious groups, royal wedding of prince harry and meghan markle, royalty and monarchy, society, united kingdom, weddings and engagements", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "belief, religion and spirituality, british royal family, catherine, duchess of cambridge, celebrities, christianity, church of england, europe, meghan markle, northern europe, prince harry, queen elizabeth ii, religious groups, royal wedding of prince harry and meghan markle, royalty and monarchy, society, united kingdom, weddings and engagements", "author": "Lauren Said-Moorhouse", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520467200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
