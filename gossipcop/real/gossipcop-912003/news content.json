USA TODAY\n\nPHILADELPHIA \u2013 Carson Wentz will be the Eagles\u2019 starting quarterback on Sunday.\n\nHead coach Doug Pederson announced Monday the third-year signal caller has been medically cleared nine months after tearing his left anterior cruciate ligament and will lead the Birds\u2019 offense against the Colts at Lincoln Financial Field.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s cleared, he goes,\u201d Pederson said less than 24 hours after Philly\u2019s first loss of the season, a 27-21 setback in Tampa Bay. \u201cI\u2019ve said all along that he\u2019s our guy. We drafted him to be our guy.\u201d\n\nWentz was injured during the Eagles\u2019 43-35 victory over the Rams on Dec. 10 last year.\n\nNick Foles replaced Wentz as the starter and led the team to its first-ever Super Bowl championship, winning game MVP honors in the process.\n\nHowever, despite Foles\u2019 accomplishments, which included a 334-yard, one-touchdown effort against the Bucs on Sunday, there was no ill will on his demotion, according to Pederson.\n\n\u201cThe greatest thing for me is that room has no egos,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cNick all along has understood that this is Carson\u2019s football team, we drafted Carson to be the guy and we owe a lot of gratitude to Nick Foles for what he\u2019s done, what he has done, obviously what he\u2019s done this season, and how he\u2019s led this football team and he\u2019s a pro\u2019s pro. No egos, they check \u2018em at the door and he\u2019ll be very supportive, has been very supportive and will be that way from here on.\u201d\n\nWentz threw for 3,296 yards and 33 touchdowns in just 13 games last season, finishing third in the MVP voting.\n\nWhile Pederson admitted it\u2019ll take some time for Wentz to \u201cget back into the rhythm and the flow of the game,\u201d he\u2019s confident Wentz will find his legs again.\n\n\u201cJust watching him move around physically and some of the things he\u2019s done, you know he\u2019s ready,\u201d Pederson said. \u201cHe\u2019s ready to take the reins again and move forward.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/17/USAT/48fc3b91-31c2-4e73-8087-65195eeef5a2-USATSI_10986562.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1625,914,x0,y6&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2018/09/17/USATODAY/usatsports/usatsi_11264944.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/17/USAT/48fc3b91-31c2-4e73-8087-65195eeef5a2-USATSI_10986562.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1625,914,x0,y6&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Friedman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2018/09/17/eagles-carson-wentz-cleared-start-colts/1335499002/", "title": "Eagles QB Carson Wentz cleared for return, will start against Colts", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/eagles/2018/09/17/eagles-carson-wentz-cleared-start-colts/1335499002/sports/nfl/eagles", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Eagles QB Carson Wentz cleared for return, will start against Colts", "description": "The Eagles will finally have their star quarterback in action when Carson Wentz returns this Sunday.", "site_name": "Delaware News Journal", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/presto/2018/09/17/USAT/48fc3b91-31c2-4e73-8087-65195eeef5a2-USATSI_10986562.jpg?auto=webp&crop=1625,914,x0,y6&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "The Eagles will finally have their star quarterback in action when Carson Wentz returns this Sunday.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1537138800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
