A woman identified as Jane Doe filed a $10 million lawsuit against him in Los Angeles County Superior Court on Friday. Mr. Simmons, the music mogul who co-founded Def Jam Recordings, denied the claim.\n\nIn the suit, the woman alleges that she and her son met Mr. Simmons at a concert. Following the performances, Mr. Simmons invited them backstage and, after dropping her son off at home, took the woman out for drinks. At the end of the night, Mr. Simmons asked her to accompany him to his hotel room: \u201cShe was reluctant, but Simmons insisted it was not an invitation to have sexual relations since he was dating a well-known model,\u201d the complaint reads. The suit then alleges that he raped her in the room.\n\nThe complaint seeks $10 million in damages for forcible rape, intentional infliction of emotional distress and negligent infliction of emotional distress. The lawsuit does not specify when the woman says she met Mr. Simmons.\n\nIn a statement to Billboard, Mr. Simmons said he \u201cvehemently\u201d denied all of the allegations. \u201cThey have shocked me to my core as I have never been abusive or violent in any way in my relations with women,\u201d the statement said. \u201cI have submitted myself to multiple lie detector tests.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/us/26simmons-item1/01xp-simmons-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=41fbb00941a72a0a113bad2f93d7530ea18ecbe0cbcfe65ec774f3c19c4fb680&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/us/26simmons-item1/merlin_130708328_4e01d78c-5241-40b3-8d90-f8572f5a9ea9-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/12/16/us/26simmons-item1/01xp-simmons-facebookJumbo-v2.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=41fbb00941a72a0a113bad2f93d7530ea18ecbe0cbcfe65ec774f3c19c4fb680&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Andrew R.
