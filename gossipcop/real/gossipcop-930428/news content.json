Now, the cast is back with a brand new season, Jersey Shore Family Vacation \u2014 except for Sammi, 31, who opted out of the reboot to avoid \u201cpotentially toxic situations.\u201d (\u201cI\u2019m at a completely different place in my life right now focusing on my businesses and my relationship,\u201d she explained on Instagram.)\n\nWell, it\u2019s no surprise that Sammi\u2019s absence was a major focus of Thursday\u2019s two-hour season premiere \u2014 with Ronnie, 32, finally opening up about what ultimately tore them apart for good.\n\n\u201cOnce we left the shore house, me and Sam decided we were going to take the next step \u2014 we moved in with each other,\u201d he explained. \u201cAnd we were getting towards that stage where it was like, I either have to s\u2014 or get off the pot.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe gave me a timeline. She was like, I want to get married in six months \u2014 and I\u2019m still trying to figure my life out,\u201d he continued. \u201cI got cold feet. I wanted to do the right thing, but there was a part of me that was like, \u2018I\u2019m not going to do the right thing.\u2019 So I didn\u2019t do it. I ended up cheating, she found out. I blew it. It\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nSammi \u201cSweetheart\u201d Giancola and Ronnie Ortiz-Magro. Chris Roque/Getty\n\nAnd Sammi\u2019s not the only one who moved on: At the time the episode was filmed, Ronnie\u2019s girlfriend Jen Harley was seven months pregnant. (The couple welcomed a baby girl Tuesday.)\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not the most ideal situation, but what is?\u201d he said, confiding in his costar Pauly \u201cDJ Pauly D\u201d DelVecchio. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a s\u2014ty husband, I\u2019ll always be a s\u2014ty boyfriend, but I\u2019ll never be a s\u2014ty father.\u201d\n\nAs for how the rest of the cast dealt with Sammi\u2019s decision to skip out on the reunion? Well, Pauly did his best to lighten the mood, bringing in a custom, life-size doll designed to look and talk just like Sammi. (\u201cRahhhhhnnnn! Staaaaahhhhp!\u201c) But as jokes were inevitably made at Sammi\u2019s expense, Deena Cortese intervened.\n\n\u201cSam\u2019s my girl,\u201d she said. \u201cWe talk all the time, and I told her I wasn\u2019t going to let anybody talk badly about her.\u201d\n\n\u201cListen, I\u2019ll never say anything bad about her,\u201d said Ronnie. \u201cShe\u2019s a great woman, she\u2019s going to make a great mother, a great wife. She is absolutely amazing. She just was not for me.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

Finally, he confronted her about it at the club. (Where else?)\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s not here. She\u2019s not our friend. She doesn\u2019t have our backs,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause if she did, she\u2019d be here with us. I\u2019m having a motherf\u2014ing kid and I\u2019m still here. What the f\u2014 does she got going on that\u2019s more important than me?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhy are we still talking about Sam?\u201d said Deena. \u201cHe has a pregnant girlfriend at home, and I still clearly he\u2019s still not over her. That\u2019s not good for him.\u201d\n\nEventually, Deena revealed the deeper reason she was harboring resentment towards Ron: After her dad died, he was the only cast member that didn\u2019t reach out to her. She finally confronted him about it, and he apologized.\n\n\u201cWhen Deena\u2019s dad passed away, I was in a bad place,\u201d he said. \u201cMe and Sam had broken up. I was going through my own personal stuff at the time \u2014 depression, or whatever you want to call it. I was dealing with my own issues, and I made a mistake by not reaching out.\u201d\n\nMTV\n\nOpening up to PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue, Ronnie admits that not having his ex around did have its upside.\n\n\u201cOn the one hand, it sucked because we all started this together so we wanted to end it together,\u201d he says. \u201cBut at the same time, it worked out better for me because it was just less drama for the house. Less fighting and bickering. Who really wants to live in a house with their ex? That\u2019s just the most uncomfortable feeling in the world.\u201d\n\nFor more on the Jersey Shore reboot, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s chosen a path in her life and she closed the door on Jersey Shore,\u201d he added. \u201cThat was one chapter in her life, and now she\u2019s opened up another one, and she has a boyfriend and she\u2019s really happy and that\u2019s a decision that she made. And us as a family and as castmates and friends that have known her for so long, we\u2019re just going to support whatever she does.\u201d\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays (8 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
