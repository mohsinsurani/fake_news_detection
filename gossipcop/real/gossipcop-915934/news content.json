That is much more needed and it still will always be. The bigger picture of everything is we have a responsibility to my amazing four-year-old son, to raise him in the most comfortable, amazing, loving, secure household that we can. That\u2019s why we don\u2019t live together.\u201d\n\nShe went on to say that the rumors she posted about on social media, regarding Herbert impregnating another woman, were inaccurate. \u201cThis is what my so-called friends were saying,\u201d she added. \u201cThe pregnancy rumor came from my friends.\u201d\n\nTamar, who had Herbert arrested for spousal assault in December, also claimed that those pregnancy rumors had nothing to do with the divorce.\n\n\u201cVince and I have been through a lot. The reason I filed for divorce was not because of those rumors,\u201d she added. \u201cI filed for divorce because we worked together, he\u2019s my baby father, we\u2019re together each and every single day, we were attached at the hip, and it just got to be too much.\u201d\n\nHerbert was on hand for the talk and said that he believes they still have a shot at a reconciliation. \u201cI love this lady with all my heart,\u201d he explained. \u201cI love my family with all my heart. I will never stop fighting for my family, and trying to make it be great.\u201d\n\nTamar, who also opened up about her departure from \u201cThe Real\u201d during the interview, said that she believes Herbert\u2019s new promise. \u201cI don\u2019t believe, at this point, he has anything to lie about,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m already gone. I already filed for divorce.\u201d\n\nThe divorce and subsequent drama is set to be featured on the upcoming season of \u201cBraxton Family Values,\u201d which premieres next month.", "images": ["https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tamar-braxton-view.jpg", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/themes/sloth/dist/images/logo-black.png", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/logo-black.png", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/r-logo.png", "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/themes/sloth/dist/images/logo-white.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7513696&cv=3.6.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tamar-braxton-view.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.rap-up.com/2018/02/23/tamar-braxton-addresses-marriage-rumors-on-the-view/", "title": "Tamar Braxton Addresses Marriage Rumors on 'The View'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tamar Braxton Addresses Marriage Rumors on 'The View'", "url": "https://www.rap-up.com/2018/02/23/tamar-braxton-addresses-marriage-rumors-on-the-view/", "site_name": "Rap-Up", "image": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tamar-braxton-view.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/rapup", "modified_time": "2022-04-30T11:19:56+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tamar Braxton Addresses Marriage Rumors on 'The View'", "image": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/tamar-braxton-view.jpg", "site": "@rapup"}, "generator": "Powered by WPBakery Page Builder - drag and drop page builder for WordPress.", "fb": {"pages": 40433812843}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.rap-up.com/2018/02/23/tamar-braxton-addresses-marriage-rumors-on-the-view/?ia_markup=1"}, "google-site-verification": "hg8TJjxD0R_w7C1yMhSQlqwYmfhi3W3LpVJNMA5wJNs", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.rap-up.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/rap-up-favicon.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519344000.0, "source": "https://www.rap-up.com", "summary": ""}
