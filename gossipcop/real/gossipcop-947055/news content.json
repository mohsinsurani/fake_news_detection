{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-bachelorette-season-14-episode-5-recap", "text": "Last week, I complained that Garrett and Lincoln's pasts have cast a shadow of doubt on all the men this season of The Bachelorette. That feeling was completely verified tonight by Chris, a sweaty pocket square come to life.\n\nAs he threw tantrum after tantrum, both in front of Becca and behind her back, I wondered if any of these guys are worthy partners. Sure, some have bigger, scarier red flags than the others; but the few who do seem somewhat decent, like John or Blake, don't get enough screen time to actually confirm whether they are good people or not. Only one stood out to me this week\u2014Wills\u2014but we'll get to that. First, let's break down what happened.\n\nWe're in Las Vegas, and the guys have packed their best scoop-neck T-shirts for the occasion. Colton gets the first solo date of the week, and it's a doozy: He meets Becca at the Virgin River for a \"safari\" which is really just riding camels in the desert while two less-than-enthused dusty dudes guide the animals. Colton seems...thrilled. This, uh, romantic journey leads them to a random hot tub the producers have lugged out into the middle of the camel pen.\n\nQuestion: What do the camel guys do while these two dodos drink Chardonnay and make out in a hot tub? Sit in an air-conditioned van nearby? Feed the camels? Watch? TBH, I'm more invested in their afternoon than Becca and Colton's conversation. I just don't trust him after the whole Tia drama!\n\nIt must have gone well, though, because Becca wears her best sequined dress\u2014and she has a lot of sequined dresses\u2014to dinner that night.\n\n\"We were in the middle of the desert in a hot tub.\" - Becca. \"I know.\" - Colton. RIVETING.\n\nColton shares his big sob story: He's only said \"I love you\" once before, to a girlfriend who didn't say it back and then broke up with him. That's it? Seems contrived to me, but Becca gives him a rose.\n\nThe next day is a group date with Wills, Garrett, Blake, John, Connor, Leo, Lincoln, Jason, and Chris. The fellas wonder where they're headed, and Garrett hopes there's some \"banana hammock\" action involved, to which I say: Oh hell no. Leave Magic Mike Live to the professionals, please.\n\nInstead, the date is at the home of Mr. Vegas himself: Wayne Newton. But as he gave everyone a tour of his home, I realized I don't know that much about Newton. So, I Googled for more. I wish I hadn't because some of the first stories that came up were this and this. Sigh.\n\nAnyway, the purpose of this date: The guys have to write a song for Becca. Bachelorette producers, we've already done this date this season! With Chris and Richard Marx! How could you forget?\n\nSide note: The most exciting part about the group date is Wills' floral two-piece set.\n\n\"Hey, hey, hey. I see you've found my favorite rock.\" - Wayne Newton bonding with Chris", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b319f66d70acf580cdaf201/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/149127_9929.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633ef8eaf0197d1ce66b2735/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633dcb5fa325f3cb9d2d5dcc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632ab5a1e30f1cc04f9fbf0b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633ed4b17d57616688c0365d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b319fe39ba6445983d42677/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149127_9929.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/image/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b3197dca38ed44ca8e97d38/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/149127_0232.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/631fca50bc5642323a14d08b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632484d849f9a667e4ae50a1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b319fe39ba6445983d42677/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149127_9929.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Anna Moeslein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-bachelorette-season-14-episode-5-recap", "title": "The Bachelorette Season 14 Episode 5 Recap: These Guys Are All the Worst", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "On the latest episode of 'The Bachelorette,' Chris loses his mind, Wills sticks up for himself, and the crew heads to Vegas.", "id": "5b318d6dd79d6f51a2bce48e", "keywords": "the bachelorette,tv,reality tv,becca kufrin", "news_keywords": "the bachelorette,tv,reality tv,becca kufrin", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b318d6dd79d6f51a2bce48e", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"On the latest episode of 'The Bachelorette,' Chris loses his mind, Wills sticks up for himself, and the crew heads to Vegas.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b319f66d70acf580cdaf201/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/149127_9929.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b319f66d70acf580cdaf201/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/149127_9929.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Chris is the worst.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b319fe39ba6445983d42677/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149127_9929.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Are Any of 'The Bachelorette' Guys Worthy of Becca?", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/the-bachelorette-season-14-episode-5-recap"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-06-26T03:41:34.655Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-26T03:41:34.655Z", "author": "Anna Moeslein"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Chris is the worst.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5b319fe39ba6445983d42677/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/149127_9929.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Are Any of 'The Bachelorette' Guys Worthy of Becca?"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529984494.655, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
