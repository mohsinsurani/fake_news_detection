Selena Gomez stepped out in New York City on Tuesday, July 10, in a bold T-shirt after her ex Justin Bieber\u2019s quick engagement to Hailey Baldwin.\n\nThe \u201cBack to You\u201d singer, 25, wore a $49 black Storets top that featured the phrase \u201cOnly the Strong Survive\u201d written on its front pocket. She paired it with gray sweatpants, white sneakers and large black sunglasses. She appeared to be in good spirits while showing off her new long hair.\n\nGomez\u2019s outing came three days after Bieber, 24, proposed to Baldwin, 21, while the couple were on vacation in the Bahamas. The model showed off her huge engagement ring while out and about with her new fianc\u00e9 the next day.\n\nThe Grammy winner confirmed the news via Instagram on Monday, July 9, writing in part, \u201cYou are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn\u2019t want to spend it with anybody else.\u201d Baldwin later tweeted, \u201cNot sure what I did in life to deserve such happiness but I am so utterly grateful to God for giving me such an incredible person to share my life with! No words could ever express my gratitude.\u201d\n\nThe hashtag #SelenaIsFreeParty quickly became a worldwide trending topic on Twitter on Sunday, July 8, after the engagement news broke. \u201cSHE. DON\u2019T. NEED. A. MAN,\u201d one of Gomez\u2019s fans wrote. Another added, \u201cShe deserves all the love, respect and happiness. I\u2019m so glad she\u2019s feeling all confident and happy. And no more drama.\u201d\n\nHowever, a source told Us Weekly exclusively that the Wizards of Waverly Place alum has moved on from Bieber, whom she dated on and off from 2011 to 2014 and again from November 2017 until this March. \u201cSelena doesn\u2019t care,\u201d the insider said. \u201cShe\u2019s over Justin and the last time they broke up allowed her to get over him fully.\u201d\n\nFor the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cWatch With Us\u201d below\n\n", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/selena-gomez-only-the-strong-survive-hsirt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1758px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/selena-gomez-only-the-strong-survive-hsirt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1758px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-wears-bold-shirt-after-justin-biebers-engagement/", "title": "Selena Gomez Wears Bold Shirt After Justin Bieber\u2019s Engagement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Selena Gomez stepped out in an \u2018Only the Strong Survive\u2019 T-shirt after her ex Justin Bieber\u2019s quick engagement to Hailey Baldwin \u2014 see the photo!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Did Selena Just Respond to Justin\u2019s Engagement in the Form of a T-Shirt?", "description": "Selena Gomez stepped out in an \u2018Only the Strong Survive\u2019 T-shirt after her ex Justin Bieber\u2019s quick engagement to Hailey Baldwin \u2014 see the photo!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-wears-bold-shirt-after-justin-biebers-engagement/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:01:49+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/selena-gomez-only-the-strong-survive-hsirt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1758px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/selena-gomez-only-the-strong-survive-hsirt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1758px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-10T19:03:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:01:49+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Did Selena Just Respond to Justin\u2019s Engagement in the Form of a T-Shirt?", "description": "Selena Gomez stepped out in an \u2018Only the Strong Survive\u2019 T-shirt after her ex Justin Bieber\u2019s quick engagement to Hailey Baldwin \u2014 see the photo!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/selena-gomez-only-the-strong-survive-hsirt.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1758px%2C924px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531249407.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
