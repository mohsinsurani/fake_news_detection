Carey Mulligan stepped out for dinner in London on Thursday, June 1, and showed off what appeared to be a very noticeable baby bump.\n\nThe actress, 32, and husband Marcus Mumford welcomed their first child, Evelyn, in September 2015. \u201cThey have been loving being parents and their friends and family are thrilled,\u201d a source told Us at the time.\n\nMulligan opened up about first-time motherhood weeks after giving birth. \u201cThe last couple of weeks have been pretty stressful,\u201d the Suffrage star said at the Elle\u2019s Women in Hollywood event in October 2015, per E! News. \u201cDoing press and doing it with a tiny baby, timing has been very important and babies do what they want, which is a challenge.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cBut it\u2019s really helpful when you have Meryl Streep backstage at events shouting at people on your behalf \u2014 telling them to hurry the hell up because you have a nursing mother here.\u201d\n\nMulligan and her musician hubby, 30, tied the knot in a stunning April 2012 wedding ceremony in Somerset, England. The Walker star and the Mumford & Sons frontman were previously childhood pen pals before their friendship turned romantic in 2011. Famous pals including Jake Gyllenhaal, Sienna Miller and Colin Firth attended the pair\u2019s nuptials.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re a great couple,\u201d an insider previously told Us. \u201cVery sweet.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-9ff76d5f-40e2-4c89-962b-aaac1cb66585.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1230px%2C691px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-9ff76d5f-40e2-4c89-962b-aaac1cb66585.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1230px%2C646px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-9ff76d5f-40e2-4c89-962b-aaac1cb66585.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1230px%2C646px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/is-carey-mulligan-pregnant-with-baby-no-2-w485652/", "title": "Is Carey Mulligan Pregnant With Baby No. 2?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Carey Mulligan stepped out for dinner in London on Thursday, June 1, and showed off what appeared to be a very noticeable baby bump \u2014 see the pic", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Is Carey Mulligan Pregnant With Baby No. 2?", "description": "Carey Mulligan stepped out for dinner in London on Thursday, June 1, and showed off what appeared to be a very noticeable baby bump \u2014 see the pic", "url": "/celebrity-moms/news/is-carey-mulligan-pregnant-with-baby-no-2-w485652/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:01:15+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-9ff76d5f-40e2-4c89-962b-aaac1cb66585.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1230px%2C646px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-9ff76d5f-40e2-4c89-962b-aaac1cb66585.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1230px%2C646px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-06-02T23:21:39+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:01:15+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Is Carey Mulligan Pregnant With Baby No. 2?", "description": "Carey Mulligan stepped out for dinner in London on Thursday, June 1, and showed off what appeared to be a very noticeable baby bump \u2014 see the pic", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carey-mulligan-marcus-mumford-9ff76d5f-40e2-4c89-962b-aaac1cb66585.jpg?crop=0px%2C20px%2C1230px%2C646px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496445699.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
