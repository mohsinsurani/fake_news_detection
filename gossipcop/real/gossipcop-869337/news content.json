They could have just zipped to the office, but instead they took a detour landing up in a parking lot where Usher instructed Corden on how to properly enter a club.\n\nUsher\u2019s top tip? Ditch the jazz hands, James!\n\nThat kept us pretty amused but, not surprisingly, there was more hilarity to come. The entertainers swung by the Hollywood Walk of Fame to visit Usher\u2019s star. And, lo and behold, there were some scuffs. Without pause, the two got down on their hands and knees to shine it up.\n\nIf you want something done properly, do it yourself:\n\nFollowing the cleanup, Corden ushered pedestrians away from the star bellowing, \u201cWalk around the star of Usher!\u201d Then it was back in the car for more dueting with a feverish rendition of the 2004 hit, \u201cCaught Up,\u201d and a frank discussion about the Usher\u2019s attempt to eat a vegan diet: \u201cI had some really thin sliced beef yesterday.\u201d Umm, that\u2019s really not how it works! Cue a heated debate about what it means to be vegan.\n\nIn between pit stops and rounds of friendly bickering there was, of course, more singing, most notably Usher\u2019s super sexy \u201cYeah.\u201d Yeah! We love it.\n\nIs Carpool Karaoke still doing it for you?", "images":
