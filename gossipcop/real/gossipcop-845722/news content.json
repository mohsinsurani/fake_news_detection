Twitter took special interest in the pineapple theory.\n\n\u201cStill don\u2019t definitively know who killed #JonBenet but my question is, who tf eats a bowl of pineapple with milk?! #ThatsCrazy,\u201d said one twitterer.\n\n\u201cIf having pizza with Burke Ramsey make sure you get him the Hawaiian. Guy would kill for some pineapple. #thecaseofjonbenet #JonBenet,\u201d joked another.\n\nUproar over the pineapple stems from a bowl filled with pineapple and milk found on a table by investigators, who said autopsy results revealed partially-digested pineapple in JonBenet\u2019s stomach. Theory holds that Burke was eating the pineapple when his sister swiped some, and then he struck her with a flashlight in a fit of rage, accidentally killing her. The theory also maintains that parents John and Patsy Ramsey covered up the incident.\n\nAlso Read: JonBenet Ramsey Special Cut Back to 4 Hours at CBS\n\nThe investigators also revealed that Burke had hit JonBenet with a golf club a year earlier after \u201closing his temper.\u201d\n\nNaturally, there were those who wanted to believe.\n\n\u201c@CBS I really believe your team solved the murder. #Burke killed his sister. I hope one day there will be #Justice for #JonBenet,\u201d one of the show\u2019s more fervent viewers tweeted.\n\n\u201cPUT THIS CBS JONBENET SPECIAL INVESTIGATION TEAM IN CHARGE OF ALL MYSTERIES PLEASE,\u201d posted another, fighting through a broken Caps Lock button.\n\nHowever, there were those who felt no closer to closure than they did before the series aired.\n\nAlso Read: Katy Perry Is JonBenet Ramsey? Online Conspiracy Theory Goes Viral (Video)\n\n\u201cSo the A&E documentary and CBS mini series on JonBenet Ramsey basically contradict each other,\u201d wrote one Twitter user.\n\n\u201comg wtf ~one documentary convinced me it was an intruder + another documentary convinced me it was her brother,\u201d tweeted another, understandably perplexed.\n\nBurke, John and Patsy Ramsey have all denied any involvement in the murder of JonBenet. Patsy died of cancer in 2006.\n\nRead the tweets below.\n\nI\u2019m on https://t.co/9ByO75CIuj right now and I can\u2019t tell if I\u2019m watching the JonBenet documentary or the new Kevin James sitcom. \u2014 Bill Narducci (@Zuckermanfan) September 20, 2016\n\nCBS is realllllllly reaching with this JonBenet \u201cdoc\u201d pic.twitter.com/PAg0txCXqK \u2014 lauren ashley smith (@msLAS) September 20, 2016\n\nStill don\u2019t definitively know who killed #JonBenet but my question is, who tf eats a bowl of pineapple with milk?! #ThatsCrazy \u2014 James Harsha (@rainejames) September 20, 2016\n\nIf having pizza with Burke Ramsey make sure you get him the Hawaiian.
