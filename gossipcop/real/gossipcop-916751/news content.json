In fact, he\u2019s encouraging his son Axl, 4, to have the same appreciation.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019ll go exploring and gathering things \u2013 whether it\u2019s flowers or rocks. He really has a fascination with sticks. He\u2019s just like me \u2013 he loves to be out there, he loves to get outside,\u201d the father of one said.\n\nAdding, \u201cFor me, it\u2019s important to get my son interested in that kind of stuff and excited about the adventures of the great outdoors as much as possible.\u201d\n\nMost recently after announcing his separation from Fergie after eight years of marriage, Duhamel purchased a ranch-style house in Los Angeles that accommodates his outdoor hobbies.", "images":
