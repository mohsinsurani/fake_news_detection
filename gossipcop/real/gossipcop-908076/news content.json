So we have to honor them by picking the right actor to play them\u2014while making a link between the actors who played these characters in the first seasons.\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Menzies hinted that he was not sure whether he would be returning to Game of Thrones, telling Digital Spy that his character is \u201cobviously somewhere in a prison, he\u2019s still around alive somewhere . . . I feel like they have so many stories to tie up, whether that\u2019s a story they\u2019ll want to go back to, I don\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nOn Wednesday, Menzies\u2019s Outlander co-star Caitriona Balfe celebrated the casting by tweeting the initial report along with the message, \u201cCongratulations darling. So excited for you and so excited to see this!!!\u201d\n\nLast fall, The Crown cast Olivia Colman as Queen Elizabeth II. Claire Foy, who played Queen Elizabeth during the drama\u2019s first two seasons, has joked that audiences will quickly forget about the original cast.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll forget all about me and the rest of the cast,\u201d she quipped in December. \u201cYou\u2019ll be like, \u2018Who are they?\u2019 We\u2019re the warm-up act.\u201d\n\nDeadline reported that Menzies \u201csigned on for the next two seasons, and begins shooting this summer in the U.K.\u201d\n\nThe Crown\u2019s third season will pick up in the 1970s and introduce Camilla Parker Bowles, then Camilla Shand, who met Prince Charles at a polo match in 1971. While little else is known about The Crown\u2019s new season, Nina Gold teased that Philip and Elizabeth\u2019s eldest children, Charles and Anne, will have larger roles than they did in the initial seasons.\n\n\u201cCharles, Camilla, and Anne are going to be pretty interesting characters to follow, because they are just coming into their own,\u201d said Gold. \u201cWe\u2019ve cast a pretty wide net for these new young characters.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a82143d47ef634077a69d83/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/The-Crown-Season-3-Casting.jpg",
