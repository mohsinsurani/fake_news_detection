Even though he was hospitalized at the UCLA Neuropsychiatric Hospital Center around Thanksgiving, few knew the full extent of what West endured in the aftermath of a psychological breakdown.\n\nNow The Hollywood Reporter has obtained an explosive new $10 million lawsuit that details an extensive medical examination of the music star.\n\nWest is suing various syndicates of insurer Lloyd\u2019s of London, alleging they are stalling on paying out claims emanating from a canceled tour. A loss claim was tendered just two days after West checked himself into a psychiatric center, but he and his company \u2014 Very Good Touring, Inc. \u2014 still have not been paid more than eight months later, according to the suit.\n\n\u201cNor have they provided anything approaching a coherent explanation about why they have not paid, or any indication if they will ever pay or even make a coverage decision, implying that Kanye\u2019s use of marijuana may provide them with a basis to deny the claim and retain the hundreds of thousands of dollars in insurance premiums paid by Very Good,\u201d states a complaint filed Tuesday in California federal court. \u201cThe stalling is emblematic of a broader modus operandi of the insurers of never-ending post-claim underwriting where the insurers hunt for some contrived excuse not to pay.\u201d\n\nWest originally planned a \u201cSaint Pablo Tour\u201d consisting of 38 events between Aug. 12 and Nov. 2, 2016. His managers reached out to Lloyd\u2019s to get \u201cpeace of mind\u201d in case cancellations needed to occur. The star made most of the dates but was forced to cancel two concerts when his wife, Kim Kardashian, was robbed at gunpoint in Paris on Oct. 2. (Indeed, he famously walked off stage when he learned of the incident.)\n\nThanks to the success of the tour, though, additional dates were arranged. The second performance during this leg of the tour is where everything started to fall apart.\n\nIn San Jose, West told the crowd, \u201cI said something that was politically incorrect. I told you I didn\u2019t vote, but if I were to have voted, I would have voted for [Donald] Trump.\u201d\n\nHe was booed.\n\nTwo days later, West appeared for a concert in Sacramento and launched a 15-minute tirade about various public figures, including Beyonce (\u201cI was hurt \u2019cause I heard that you said you wouldn\u2019t perform unless you won Video of the Year over me\u201d), Jay Z (\u201cI know you got killers. Please don\u2019t send them at my head\u201d) and Hillary Clinton (\u201cThis Saint Pablo tour is the most relevant [thing] happening. If your old ass keeps following old models, you\u2019ll be Hillary Clinton\u201d).\n\nWest\u2019s lawsuit addresses this latter concert and notes the \u201cstrained, confused and erratic\u201d behavior in Sacramento, as well as the decision made the following day to cancel the balance of the tour and issue full refunds. He was soon hospitalized at UCLA, and the insurance companies were informed and later provided with sworn testimony from his primary physician there that West suffered a debilitating medical condition that required he not tour.\n\nBut that wasn\u2019t good enough for the insurance companies, according to the suit.\n\n\u201cAlmost immediately after the claim was submitted, Defendants selected legal counsel to oversee the adjustment of the claim, instead of the more normal approach of retaining a non-lawyer insurance adjuster,\u201d states West\u2019s complaint. \u201cImmediately turning to legal counsel made it clear that Defendants\u2019 goal was to hunt for any ostensible excuse, no matter how fanciful, to deny coverage or to maneuver themselves into a position of trying to negotiate a discount on the loss payment.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s court papers reveal the extent to which he has been attempting to convince the insurers that his mental breakdown was indeed real.\n\n\u201cWhile Kanye was still under medical care for his disabling condition, the Defendant syndicates demanded that Kanye submit to an immediate IME,\u201d state the court papers, referring to an independent medical examination. \u201cKanye was made available for a purported IME by a doctor, hand-selected by the insurers\u2019 counsel, who was predisposed to look for some reason to deny the claim. Yet even Defendants\u2019 selected doctor had to admit that Kanye was disabled from being able to continue with the Tour. As demanded by the insurers, Kanye was also subsequently presented for an examination under oath (\u201cEUO\u201c), and at least eleven other persons affiliated with Kanye and Very Good were similarly presented for EUOs.\u201d\n\nWest still can\u2019t get answers about why the insurance companies won\u2019t pay up, but according to court papers, the insurers demanded to interview others outside of West\u2019s control to make a determination. The defendants are also said to be raising \u201cirrelevant facts\u201d bearing on the issue of coverage. While those facts aren\u2019t discussed in the lawsuit, some aggressive tabloids have been pushing for information about the canceled tour and its aftermath, raising everything from drug use to song lyrics as fodder.\n\nThe new lawsuit accuses the insurers of leaking private information regarding the hip-hop star to news outlets.\n\n\u201cPlaintiff is informed and believes that the \u2018planting\u2019 of the Confidential Information with news outlets \u2026 was part and parcel of Defendants\u2019 efforts to impair Plaintiff\u2019s rights to the indemnity payments due under the Insurance Policies,\u201d states the complaint, which nods to a non-disclosure agreement between the parties.\n\nAnd so West has filed a lawsuit alleging breach of contract and breach of good faith and fair dealing against the various entities, including Cathedral Syndicate.\n\nAs West\u2019s lawyer Howard King writes, \u201cPerforming artists who pay handsomely to insurance companies within the Lloyd\u2019s of London marketplace to obtain show tour \u2018non-appearance or cancellation\u2018 insurance should take note of the lesson to be learned from this lawsuit: Lloyd\u2019s companies enjoy collecting bounteous premiums; they don\u2019t enjoy paying claims, no matter how legitimate. Their business model thrives on conducting unending \u2018investigations,\u2019 of bona fide coverage requests, stalling interminably, running up their insured\u2019s costs, and avoiding coverage decisions based on flimsy excuses. The artists think they\u2019re buying peace of mind. The insurers know they\u2019re just selling a ticket to the courthouse.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gettyimages-598209548_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gettyimages-598209548_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/gettyimages-598209548_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eriq Gardner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/kanye-west-files-10-million-lawsuit-tour-canceled-due-his-mental-breakdown-1025718/", "title": "Kanye West Files $10 Million Lawsuit Over Tour Canceled Due to His Mental Breakdown", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "When the hip-hop star scrapped his tour, he submitted to an interrogation under oath.
