A memo was sent out that night, as shown through screenshots posted to the web by journalists.\n\n\u201cOn behalf of the Governors, I want to thank the specially formed task force, led by Governor and Academy Officer David Rubin, whose members dedicated many hours of research and discussion to drafting this document and evaluating future steps,\u201d Academy CEO Dawn Hudson wrote in the letter.\n\nAccording to the new guidelines, \u201cmembers must also behave ethically by upholding the Academy\u2019s values of respect for human dignity, inclusion, and a supportive environment that fosters creativity. The Academy asks that members embrace their responsibility to affirm these principles and act when these principles are violated. There is no place in the Academy for people who abuse their status, power or influence in a manner that violates recognized standards of decency.\n\n\u201cThe Academy is categorically opposed to any form of abuse, harassment or discrimination on the basis of gender, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, disability, age, religion, or nationality. The Board of Governors believes that these standards are essential to the Academy\u2019s mission and reflective of our values.\u201d\n\nShould any member violate these standards or compromise the integrity of the Academy, as determined by the board, \u201cthe Board of Governors may take any disciplinary action permitted by the Academy\u2019s Bylaws, including suspension or expulsion.\u201d\n\nWeinstein, the now former head of The Weinstein Company, was stripped of his Academy membership when decades of sexual misconduct claims against him came to light from droves of women throughout the industry.\n\nWeinstein has denied any allegations of non-consensual sex, but the Board of Governors determined \u201cthe conduct described in the allegations against Harvey Weinstein to be repugnant, abhorrent, and antithetical to the high standards of the Academy and the creative community it represents.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%2067'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&rect=0%2C0%2C2000%2C1000&poi=%5B740%2C106%5D&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-643930138-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-643930138-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&rect=0%2C0%2C2000%2C1000&poi=%5B740%2C106%5D&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-643930138-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "December", "At Am Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/12/07/oscars-academy-standards-conduct-harvey-weinstein/", "title": "Academy sets new 'standards of conduct' amid Weinstein fallout", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "Academy sets new 'standards of conduct' amid Weinstein fallout", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Academy sets new 'standards of conduct' amid Weinstein fallout", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/12/07/oscars-academy-standards-conduct-harvey-weinstein/", "description": "Academy sets new 'standards of conduct' amid Weinstein fallout", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&rect=0%2C0%2C2000%2C1000&poi=%5B740%2C106%5D&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-643930138-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/12/07/oscars-academy-standards-conduct-harvey-weinstein/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-643930138-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/12/07/oscars-academy-standards-conduct-harvey-weinstein/", "title": "Academy sets new 'standards of conduct' amid Weinstein fallout", "description": "Academy sets new 'standards of conduct' amid Weinstein fallout", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&rect=0%2C0%2C2000%2C1000&poi=%5B740%2C106%5D&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-643930138-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/oscars/2017/12/07/oscars-academy-standards-conduct-harvey-weinstein/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512604800.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
