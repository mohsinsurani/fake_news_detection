Kim Kardashian and Kanye West\u2019s surrogate has given birth, meaning that Kim and Kanye are officially parents to three. And while Kim\u2019s journey to motherhood hasn\u2019t been easy, she\u2019s been open about her pregnancy struggles \u2014 as well as her decision to use a surrogate \u2014 every step of the way.\n\nSo why did Kim explore surrogacy when she and husband Kanye West decided they wanted to try for another baby? It turns out that Kim\u2019s first two pregnancies came with lots of complications, and her medical team advised her that trying to carry a third baby could come with potentially life-threatening risks.\n\nIn a post on her website during her second pregnancy, Kim explained in her own words the struggles she experienced in both pregnancies with North and Saint, writing, \u201cLast pregnancy, I had a condition called preeclampsia, which is a serious condition you can get during pregnancy; often, the only way to get rid of it is to deliver early to protect yourself and the baby.\u201d Preeclampsia is extremely rare, and Kim explained, \u201cIt causes your body and face to swell, and that was very uncomfortable for me.\u201d\n\nKim revealed she had \u201cearly-onset preeclampsia,\u201d which forced her to deliver North about six weeks early. She also revealed she experienced an additional complication during delivery called placenta accreta.\n\nShe wrote, \"Right after delivery, the placenta usually then comes out. Mine did not. My placenta stayed attached inside my uterus, which is a condition called placenta accreta. This is a high-risk condition that happens when the placenta grows too deeply into the uterine wall.\"\n\nAccording to the American Pregnancy Association, this condition occurs when the placenta attaches itself to the uterine wall instead of naturally shedding during childbirth.\n\nIt occurs in about one in every 2,500 pregnancies, and caused Kim to have two surgeries post-birth to fully remove the remaining placenta and to remove scar tissue, which was preventing her from getting pregnant a second time.\n\nThough she did eventually have a second successful pregnancy and delivery, her doctors advised her that carrying a third baby on her own would be extremely dangerous.\n\nWe\u2019ve watched Kim open up about the process of using a surrogate on Keeping Up with the Kardashians, admitting that \u201cfinding someone that you really trust really is so much more difficult of a situation than you could really imagine.\u201d She shared that the process took nearly an entire year, before sharing last fall that her surrogate was pregnant with a baby girl.\n\nWe admire Kim for being so candid about what is still all too often a taboo subject. We\u2019re sure her openness will help so many women and couples going through the same thing. We wish the Kardashian-West family nothing but love as they welcome baby number three.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/16/Kim-Kardashian-e1515795850281.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/16/Kim-Kardashian-e1515795850281.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/16/Kim-Kardashian-e1515795850281.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arielle Tschinkel"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/why-did-kim-kardashian-use-a-surrogate/", "title": "Why did Kim Kardashian use a surrogate?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kim Kardashian has been open about her struggles during both pregnancies, but why exactly did she use a surrogate for her third baby?", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Why did Kim Kardashian use a surrogate?", "description": "Kim Kardashian has been open about her struggles during both pregnancies, but why exactly did she use a surrogate for her third baby?", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/why-did-kim-kardashian-use-a-surrogate/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/16/Kim-Kardashian-e1515795850281.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1000, "height": 698, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-16T14:22:53+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T15:05:26+00:00"}, "author": "Arielle Tschinkel", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Arielle Tschinkel", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "3 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516112573.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
