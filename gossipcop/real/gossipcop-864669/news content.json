I thought she was quite well known already from Merlin.\n\nReply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\ni guess because merlin was more known in the UK, so maybe they mean breakout in terms of america? idk\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nlol at the 100\n\nReply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\ni'm glad i bucked tradition and read the OP in its entirety. sense8 winning stuff was kinda weird, but once i started seeing the 100 win shit, i knew fans were responsible for this hot garbage.\n\nReply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\nalso, i have no idea what's going on with this show anymore but i'd be willing to bet all my money and valuables on this winning moment not being the least bit sexy or romance coded \ud83d\ude02\n\n\n\nBest Kiss/Sexiest Moment\n\nWinner: Bellamy caresses Clarke's face (The 100)\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nfrom the source, Best actual kiss: Damon and Elena's reunion kiss (The Vampire Diaries)\n\n\n\nSexiest non-kiss moment: Bellamy caresses Clarke's face (The 100)\n\n\n\n\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\ud83d\ude44\n\n\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\nExpand\n\nLink\n\nThe moment was a goodbye moment I think.

That's like not even fair because Cole's been acting since he was like 3 years old and has been in a number of iconic and memorable things. Homeboy is worth millions, like he broke out already lol. If anyone should've gotten breakout star from Riverdale it should've been Madelaine Petsch because Cheryl Blossom is easily the best character.\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\ni love Cheryl!\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nyikes bellarke fans still exist?\n\nReply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\nBest Series Finale\n\n\n\nWinner: Person of Interest (CBS)\n\n\n\nthe best win this award has offered.\n\n\n\nlowkey bitter that the last season had no love .\n\n\n\nMost Anticipated 2017/2018 Show\n\nWinner: The Gifted (Fox)\n\n\n\nlbr amy acker fans voted for this. idky but i'm not feeling the show. i think sarah's show is much better. the best win this award has offered.lbr amy acker fans voted for this. idky but i'm not feeling the show. i think sarah's show is much better.\n\nReply\n\nThread\n\nLink\n\nperson of interest never got the love it deserved \ud83d\ude14\n\nReply\n\nParent\n\nThread\n\n\n\nLink\n\nthe show was slept on.
