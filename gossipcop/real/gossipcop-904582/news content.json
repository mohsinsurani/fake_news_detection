Give me a minute. Give me a minute!\"\n\nHis wish was the Golden Globes' command because he got to continue his acceptance speech.\n\n\"For 25 years I have handcrafted very strange little tales made of motion, colour, light and shadow,\" he explained. \"In three precise instances, these strange stories, these fables, have saved my life. Once with Devil's Backbone, once with Pan's Labyrinth, and now with Shape of Water, because as directors, these things are not just entries in a filmography. We have made a deal with a particularly inefficient devil that trades three years of our lives for one entry on IMDb. And these things are biography and they are alive.\"\n\nThe Shape of Water stars Octavia Spencer, Michael Shannon, Sally Hawkins and Doug Jones.\n\nWearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Show all 55 1 /55 Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Meryl Street and Ai-jen Poo Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Rosa Clemente and Susan Sarandon Getty Images Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Shailene Woodley and activist Calina Lawrence NBCU Photo Bank via Getty Images Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Emma Watson and Marai Larasi Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Amy Poehler and Saru Jayaraman Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Laura Dern and M\u00f3nica Ram\u00edrez Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Michelle Williams and Tarana Burke Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Debra Messing Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Caitriona Balfe Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Allison Williams Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Zoe Kravitz Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Viola Davis and Julius Tennon Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Tracee Ellis Ross Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Sarah Paulson Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Sadie Sink Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Rita Moreno Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Octavia Spencer and Jessica Chastain Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Millie Bobby Brown Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Michelle Pfeiffer Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Margot Robbie Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Mandy Moore Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Maggie Gyllenhaal Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Lily James Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Kendall Jenner Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Kit Harrington Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Kerry Washington Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Kelly Clarkson Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Dakota Johnson Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Kate Hudson Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Jessica Biel Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Jamie Chung Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes James Franco and Dave Franco Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Issa Rae Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Isabelle Huppert Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Heidi Klum Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Gwendoline Christie Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Geena Davis Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Claire Foy Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Elisabeth Moss Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Diane Kruger Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Catherine Zeta-Jones Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Angelina Jolie Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Nicole Kidman Rex Features Wearing black for women \u2013 activists and actors at the Golden Globes Mary J.
