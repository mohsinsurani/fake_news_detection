And as quickly as the target of their hate fires back, they vanish, deleting their comments as others smack them down in defense of the person they initially criticized.\n\nThe typical victims of these cowards are those who are living their best life. Celebrities, entertainers, high profile athletes and, of course, their spouses are easy targets because of their social media presence. But we\u2019ve seen it before. Kelly Clarkson has been a victim, as have Blake Shelton and Gwen Stefani. Even Carrie Underwood and sweet Lauren Akins, wife of Thomas Rhett, have been the bullseye of these haters\u2019 arrows. It\u2019s ridiculous.\n\nRELATED: The sexiest man alive, Blake Shelton, gets a chuckle out of his haters\u2019 tweets\n\nFrom time to time, sassy stars like Kelly, or super sweet and supportive spouses like Lauren, fire back. And while their methods may be different, the result is the same\u2014they aren\u2019t having it.\n\nNow Jason Aldean\u2019s wife, Brittany, has had enough, too.\n\nJason and Brittany are taking an adults only vacation with their great friends Dee Jay Silver and his wife, gorgeous Jenna Perdue. The couples are enjoying some much-needed grownup beach time without their respective little ones, Memphis and Wake.\n\n\ud83d\udc20\ud83d\udc33\ud83d\udc19\ud83c\udf34 A post shared by Brittany Aldean (@brittanyaldean) on Mar 3, 2018 at 10:30am PST\n\nBoth Brittany and Jenna have shared photos of their tropical locale and some of the great outfits and swimsuits they are both wearing, and, apparently, the haters were commenting on Jason\u2019s lack of boots. One commented that he looked like he was in a boy band, and another asked if he was only country when he was in concert. Still another said, \u201cTalk about a woman who totally changed a guy. Pathetic. She\u2019s the one who wants him to wear skinny jeans and vneck shirts. He\u2019s never dressed like that his entire life.\u201d\n\nHmm \u2026 his \u201centire life?\u201d Must be a lifelong friend of Jason\u2019s.\n\n\ud83d\udda4\ud83c\udf34\ud83d\udda4 A post shared by Jenna Perdue (@_jennamichelle_) on Mar 4, 2018 at 6:10am PST\n\nOf course, like shamers and keyboard critics are inclined to do, many deleted their comments after Jason and Brittany\u2019s loyal following began calling them out, but the beautiful blonde eventually had enough and put her foot down.\n\nRELATED: A precious pic from Brittany Aldean shows Daddy Jason getting some sweet snuggles\n\nSharing a photo of herself with her handsome hubs, Brittany wrote, \u201cMuch needed vacay\u2600 Just a word of wisdom for all the parent shamers \u2026 vacations are OM for new parents to take. Sometimes after being pregnant for almost a year, cooped up in a house for weeks at a time, you need a little sunshine and adult time. It is not OK to leave your ignorant comments. If you don\u2019t agree with something, please \u2026 do me a favor and unfollow me. You will NOT be missed\u2665 And for all the sweet, positive, happy people \u2026 we love you and thank you!!\ud83d\udc8b\ud83d\udc8b\u201d\n\nWhat? What? \u201cUnfollow me?\u201d But Brittany, what would these haters do with their anger then? Girl, we got you.\n\nObviously, we\u2019re being sarcastic and we applaud the heck out of Brittany for speaking out against this unnecessary form of bravado. We\u2019d also like to add, DANG SISTER! You look AMAZING for just having had a baby! Good on ya!\n\nHaters, lighten up. We\u2019re sure Jesus appreciates ya, but he can handle the judging on his own.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-38KriKc8Foyx-.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/rory-feek.jpg?w=891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/chase-braynt.png?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2017/02/screenshot-colton-swon.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/jason-aldean-brittany-aldean-jenna-perdue-dee-jay-silver.jpg?w=1200&h=627&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/heidi-feek-picnic.png?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/chrisley-knows-best-stars.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://ct.pinterest.com/?tid=4zyabz5KGmz&value=0.00&quantity=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/troy-gentry.png?w=891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2017/03/tim-mcgraw-oscars1.png?w=100&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/cox-rare-platform/assets/brands/rare-country/img/signup-tab.png ", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/marlee-mcdonald.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/memphis-aldean.jpg?w=891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://t.co/i/adsct?txn_id=nunws&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/jenna-perdue.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=281660582191764&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035944&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/cox-rare-platform/assets/brands/rare-country/img/rare-country.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/ronnie-prophet-death.png?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2017/10/dolly-parton-xm.png?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/brantley-gilbert-hatless.png?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://analytics.twitter.com/i/adsct?txn_id=nunws&p_id=Twitter&tw_sale_amount=0&tw_order_quantity=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/caroline-boyer-luke-bryan1.jpg?w=409&h=225&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/kelsea-ballerini-sick.png?w=891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/reba-skeeter-valentines-day.jpg?w=891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2016/07/tammy-ragusa-headshot-voice.jpg?w=80&h=80&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180307022805im_/https://coxrarecountry.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/jason-aldean-brittany-aldean-jenna-perdue-dee-jay-silver.jpg?w=1200&h=627&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tammy Ragusa", "Tricia Despres", "Hunter Kelly", "Rare Country Staff", "Samantha Stephens", "Tammy", "About The Author", "Rare Country Contributor", "Based In Nashville", "Tammy Is A Veteran Of The Country Music Community.
