The Teen Mom 2 star has been released from jail after he was arrested for violating his probation.\n\nAs previously reported, Lind was taken to the Minnehaha County Jail in South Dakota for violating his no contact order in a domestic assault case, on Tuesday, December 5.\n\nRadar Online reports that the 28-year-old MTV star was released on a personal recognizance bond.\n\n\u201cHis bail was dropped because he agreed to show up at court for his next hearing,\u201d the clerk reportedly explained to the publication.\n\nLind was arrested last month and his ex-girlfriend, Stasia Huber, filed and received an order of protection against him.\n\nThe reality star, who shares 8-year-old daughter Aubree with Houska, and 4-year-old daughter Paislee with ex-girlfriend Taylor Halbur, has had other run-ins with the law prior to this. He was arrested several times for driving under the influence and driving without a license. During the August 7 episode of Teen Mom 2, it was revealed Lind tested positive for methamphetamines.\n\nLind first appeared on MTV during the second season of 16 & Pregnant when Houska was pregnant with Aubree in 2010. Teen Mom 2 just wrapped its eighth season, and included a storyline where Houska wanted to change Aubree\u2019s name to include her husband Cole DeBoer\u2019s last name.\n\nHouska moved on from Lind with DeBoe in August 2015. The pair welcomed son Watson in January 2017. According to Radar, Lind\u2019s next court hearing is schedule for December 21 at 9 a.m.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/adam-lind-arrested.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C1328px%2C751px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/adam-lind-arrested.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1328px%2C698px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/adam-lind-arrested.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1328px%2C698px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-mom-2s-adam-lind-released-from-jail/", "title": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Adam Lind Released From Jail", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Teen Mom", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Adam Lind has been released from jail after violating a no contact order in a domestic assault case \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Adam Lind Released From Jail", "description": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Adam Lind has been released from jail after violating a no contact order in a domestic assault case \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/teen-mom-2s-adam-lind-released-from-jail/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/adam-lind-arrested.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1328px%2C698px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/adam-lind-arrested.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1328px%2C698px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-07T22:58:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:48+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Adam Lind Released From Jail", "description": "Teen Mom 2\u2019s Adam Lind has been released from jail after violating a no contact order in a domestic assault case \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/adam-lind-arrested.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1328px%2C698px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512687493.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
