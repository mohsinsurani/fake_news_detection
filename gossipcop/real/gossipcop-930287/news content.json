Now, Will and Kate Middleton have announced what the baby boy\u2019s name is.\n\nThe royal baby name is Louis Arthur Charles, Kensington Palace announced on Twitter Friday. His royal title will be His Royal Highness Prince Louis of Cambridge.\n\nWhile the royal baby name odds on Louis were 33/1 could make it appear to be a surprising choice, the names Louis, Arthur and Charles have significance within the royal family. Louis was the name of Prince Phillip\u2019s grandfather, Prince Louis Alexander of Battenberg, as well as Prince Charles\u2019 great-uncle Earl Louis Mountbatten, who was assassinated by the IRA in 1979. Louis is also a middle name for both Prince William and Prince George.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their newborn son.

Arthur of course also brings to mind King Arthur (though experts say there\u2019s no evidence of any actual historical king behind the famous Arthurian legends).\n\nPrince Louis shares his third name, Charles, with his grandfather, Prince Charles.\n\nLouis Arthur Charles is the third child for the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, who welcomed a son, Prince George, in 2013 and a daughter, Princess Charlotte, in 2015.\n\nAhead of Louis Arthur Charles\u2019s birth, the couple announced via the official Kensington Palace Twitter account that Middleton was expecting in September 2017, but opted not to reveal the baby\u2019s gender (something they had done with their previous two children) ahead of the birth.\n\nThe baby\u2019s birth is just one of a series of exciting life events for the royal family this spring, as Prince Harry and Meghan Markle will be getting married next month on May 19th.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/will-kate-royal-baby-42318.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/prince-harry-barack-obama-michelle-obama-prince-william-kate-middleton.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/donald-trump-joe-biden-election.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C35px%2C2400px%2C1601px&resize=160%2C106&strip", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/royal-baby.jpeg?quality=85&w=3500"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/will-kate-royal-baby-42318.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5192470/royal-baby-name-louis-arthur-charles/", "title": "Royal Baby's Name Is Louis Arthur Charles, Will and Kate Announce", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Prince William and Kate Middleton revealed the name of the royal baby, who they recently welcomed: Louis Arthur Charles.", "og": {"title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Just Announced Their Royal Baby's Name", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5192470/royal-baby-name-louis-arthur-charles/", "description": "Fit for the newest addition to the royal family", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/will-kate-royal-baby-42318.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5192470/royal-baby-name-louis-arthur-charles/", "description": "Prince William and Kate Middleton revealed the name of the royal baby, who they recently welcomed: Louis Arthur Charles.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/will-kate-royal-baby-42318.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5192470/royal-baby-name-louis-arthur-charles/", "title": "Kate Middleton and Prince William Just Announced Their Royal Baby's Name", "description": "Fit for the newest addition to the royal family", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/will-kate-royal-baby-42318.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
