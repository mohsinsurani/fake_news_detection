USA TODAY\n\nJimmy Kimmel is ready for his second stint hosting the Oscars Sunday on ABC (8 ET/5 PT), and he hopes for a repeat performance of last year\u2019s Envelopegate, in which Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway announced the wrong film as best picture.\n\nDespite painstaking efforts by the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences and its accountant to avoid another debacle, \u201cI want it to happen again,\u201d Kimmel jokes in an interview. Especially because no one blamed him for it, \u201cnor should they have.\u201d\n\nMore: Oscars 2018: There won't be another envelope flub. They promise. Really!\n\nBut Beatty appears in a playful new promo with Kimmel, raising the question of whether Oscar producers will have a little fun with the notorious gaffe on Sunday\u2019s live broadcast. Is Beatty booked to return? \u201cI do not know,\u201d Kimmel claims, suspiciously. \u201cIt\u2019s outside of my area of responsibility.\u201d\n\nMore: Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway's return to the 2018 Oscars will be the ultimate Hollywood ending\n\nKimmel won\u2019t say much about his emcee plans, but he volunteers which of the nine best-picture nominees is the ripest for joke material.\n\nLeading contender \u201cThe Shape of Water is about a woman who has sex with a sea monster. So probably that one \u2014 that\u2019s got to be right at the top. That\u2019s something we haven\u2019t seen in the movies before, certainly not in an Oscar-nominated movie. I haven\u2019t done the research, but I\u2019m pretty sure that\u2019s true.\u201d\n\nHe says he has watched all of the nominated films, \u201cand I hope that the audience has also watched them.\" But last year, he felt he'd seen \"a lot more of the movies than the crowd at the Oscars,\" and \"it\u2019s hard to do a joke if people don\u2019t know what the reference is.\"\n\nAnd if the Hollywood crowd hasn\u2019t seen them, does a field of contenders with few box office hits bode poorly for Oscars ratings? The show sunk to a near-record low 32.9 million viewers last year when Moonlight (domestic box office: $27.9 million) aced out La La Land after that infamous envelope mix-up. \u201cI don\u2019t concern myself with those sorts of things,\u201d except on Jimmy Kimmel Live, he says. \u201cI worry about my ratings.\u201d\n\nThe hardest part, he says, is whittling down \"thousands\" of jokes from his writers without being able to test them in front of an audience. \"Some of the hosts who are stand-up comics will go to comedy clubs, but I\u2019m too paranoid someone is going to have a video camera and is going to tape them and ruin the whole deal. I prefer to just roll the dice.\u201d\n\nSince his last Oscars stint, Kimmel made headlines speaking out emotionally about the health care debate as his son, Billy, went through surgeries to correct a birth defect.\n\nMore: Joined by his son Billy, an emotional Jimmy Kimmel makes the case for CHIP\n\nMore: Jimmy Kimmel pleads with Trump to 'do something' about gun control in moving monologue\n\nIn essence, he became the political conscience of a generation and inspired rivals, including John Oliver. \"That is a label that I did not give myself, nor do I agree with it,\" he says. \"But it feels weird. It's not really gratifying. I wish I didn\u2019t have to talk about any of this stuff,\" even if \"it does make me feel good to hear people say thank you for speaking about this. I hope it actually is having some positive impact.\"\n\nMore: How Jimmy Kimmel inspired John Oliver to share his own son's health scare\n\nHe\u2019s also not the first awards-show host to tackle the Me Too moment, but he\u2019ll \u201capproach it as I approach every subject, with a tremendous amount of class and dignity,\u201d he says, laughing. \u201cIt will definitely be part of the show. How big a part I\u2019m not sure, because I\u2019m still digging through a mound of material.\u201d\n\nBut does he worry about blowback, tackling a touchy subject while hosting what's typically the largest TV event outside the Super Bowl? \u201cEverything everyone says gets attacked at all times. This is our new reality,\u201d he says. \u201cI see a future of great silence.\u201d Otherwise, \u201cyou carry on, and you have to realize what sometimes seems like an uproar is really four people tweeting. You also have to acknowledge that almost every subject is going to upset someone.\u201d He adds he\u2019s convinced the producers of Peter Rabbit did not expect to be targeted for mocking a food allergy.\n\nAnd Kimmel won\u2019t commit to repeating as host, if he\u2019s asked.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to focus on this year, and we\u2019ll see what happens after that,\u201d he says. \u201cWhat you really want is to get to the point where you\u2019re just taken for granted and resented.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0dc37a4205fb6b98090f86891ddc7831e45fc844/c=0-139-2062-1304/local/-/media/2018/02/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636552356092917734-145621-0339c.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5739352308001_5739169691001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0dc37a4205fb6b98090f86891ddc7831e45fc844/c=0-139-2062-1304/local/-/media/2018/02/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636552356092917734-145621-0339c.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gary Levin"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/02/27/oscars-2018-jimmy-kimmel-secretly-hoping-another-oscars-envelope-gate/375195002/", "title": "Oscars 2018: Jimmy Kimmel is secretly hoping for another 'Envelopegate'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2018/02/27/oscars-2018-jimmy-kimmel-secretly-hoping-another-oscars-envelope-gate/375195002/life/tv", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Oscars 2018: Jimmy Kimmel is secretly hoping for another 'Envelopegate'", "description": "Jimmy Kimmel hosts his second Oscars ceremony; will there be a repeat after Warren Beatty named the wrong film as best picture in 2017?", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0dc37a4205fb6b98090f86891ddc7831e45fc844/c=0-139-2062-1304/local/-/media/2018/02/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636552356092917734-145621-0339c.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Jimmy Kimmel hosts his second Oscars ceremony; will there be a repeat after Warren Beatty named the wrong film as best picture in 2017?", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/bGZ1xaJglLU?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1519689600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
