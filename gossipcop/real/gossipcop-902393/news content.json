They have two children together.\n\nKirke \u2014 whose solo exhibition of oil paintings, which is running at downtown gallery Sargent\u2019s Daughters through Jan. 21, is a commentary on weddings and marriage \u2014 told the magazine that she doesn\u2019t particularly enjoy weddings unless they\u2019re \u201cfun.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d she answered when asked if she had fun at hers. \u201cI mean, it was fine, it was quick, it was simple, but it was pointless. Either you\u2019re throwing a party, or you\u2019re doing it out of necessity.\u201d\n\nDespite her strong opinions on marriage, Kirke said she \u201cmight\u201d get married again.\n\n\u201cIt wouldn\u2019t be under any delusions of thinking it would mean that it would improve anything or change things for the better,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/jemima-kirke.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/jemima-kirke.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/jemima-kirke.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["December"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/12/27/jemima-kirke-says-her-wedding-was-pointless/", "title": "Jemima Kirke says her wedding was \u2018pointless\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
