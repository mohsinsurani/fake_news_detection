That\u2019s nothing to sneeze at for a franchise that is ostensibly all about love but has been panned for not producing many lasting relationships.\n\nParadise \u2014 a spinoff that brings together past Bachelor and Bachelorette contestants for a few weeks at a Mexican resort \u2014 has been showing up its sibling series in that regard. In five seasons, Paradise has yielded two marriages with children and two ongoing engagements (plus five more engagements which ended in breakups). Its failed relationships speak to the difficulty of transferring a relationship nurtured in the unreality of, well, Paradise into the real world, and keeping it going amid rampant tabloid and fan interest.\n\nGates and Gottschalk, who were in Toronto Friday for the annual Eligible Magazine TIFF Bachelor Party, have some advice in that regard: keep the lion\u2019s share of your relationship to yourself.\n\n\u201cI think people are still super curious about our relationship,\u201d said Gates, a former Bachelor fan favourite who met Bachelorette contestant Gottschalk last year on Season 4 of Paradise.\n\nGates says she shares \u201ca little bit\u201d of her life with Gottschalk with fans on Instagram, \u201cbut we also have a clear, strict rule of what\u2019s between us is between us and our relationship, at the end of the day, when our heads hit the pillow at night, is between him and I, no one else.\u201d\n\nThough they\u2019re not engaged yet, Gates and Gottschalk are talking about marriage. But they don\u2019t plan to follow in the footsteps of two Paradise couples \u2014 Jade Roper Tolbert and Tanner Tolbert, and Carly Waddell and Evan Bass \u2014 by getting hitched on TV.\n\n\u201cI want our vows to be so spiritual and connected with each other, and with our closest friends and our families, that I think being on TV for me would not be as genuine, and also I think that we just don\u2019t want to be on TV again on the show. We just want to live our normal lives and get married just like normal people,\u201d Gates said.\n\nBut she and Gottschalk did appear on the most recent season of Paradise because Gates was told that her best friend, cast member Tia Booth, \u201cneeded me in a critical way with her decision-making.\u201d\n\nSo, on the Aug. 21 episode, she and Gottschalk joined Booth and Colton Underwood on a date. And Gates gave her friend some tough love, telling Booth she didn\u2019t think Underwood\u2019s intentions were good.\n\nBooth ignored the advice and agreed to be Underwood\u2019s girlfriend, but they split just three episodes later and Underwood was announced as the new Bachelor the next morning.\n\nGates says she believes being Bachelor was Underwood\u2019s goal all along, a sentiment shared by many fans underwhelmed by the franchise\u2019s choice of star.\n\nGates and Gottschalk also weighed in on the couples who ended the most recent Paradise season together. They have high hopes for Krystal Neilson and Chris Randone, two former franchise villains who got engaged, as well as Astrid Loch and Torontonian Kevin Wendt, who are dating and were seen around the city together last week.\n\nThey\u2019re less sure about Kendall Long and \u201cGrocery Store\u201d Joe Amabile, although Amabile is moving from Chicago to Los Angeles to be with Long and compete on Dancing With the Stars. \u201cI feel like their relationship is good, but there are too many differences between them,\u201d Gottschalk said.\n\nThere has also been one notable breakup: fan favourite Jordan Kimball and Jenna Cooper ended their engagement just a day after the finale aired over a cheating scandal (Cooper has denied cheating with an ex and said she wants to get back together with Kimball).\n\nDespite misses like that, Gottschalk and Gates still have faith in Bachelor in Paradise as a gateway to lasting relationships.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just a firm believer in it,\u201d Gottschalk said. \u201cI think that the producers do a really good job taking men and women from previous seasons and putting them together.\u201d\n\nThe one thing they don\u2019t expect to last is reality-TV fame.\n\n\u201cEveryone (in the cast) has jobs to support themselves; that has to stay in the back of your mind because, when this is all said and done, this is the real world,\u201d said Gottschalk.\n\n\u201cWe live every day doing our normal things and paying bills like everyone else does. The Instagram ads and everything are good short-term money goals, but you\u2019ve got to think about what\u2019s coming.\u201d\n\nDebra Yeo is a deputy entertainment editor and a contributor to the Star's Entertainment section.
