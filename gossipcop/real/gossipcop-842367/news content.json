Gomez, who, along with her mom, pushed for the series to be made, served as an executive producer on the show.\n\n\u201cI would do anything to be able to have a good influence on this generation, but I definitely relate to everything that was going on,\u201d said the 24-year-old during a Netflix press event in February. \u201cI was there for the last episode, and I was a mess just seeing it all come to life, because I\u2019ve experienced that.\u201d\n\nNow, the story is getting even more personal for Gomez. Along with two of the show\u2019s breakout stars, Tommy Dorfman (who plays Ryan Shaver) and Alisha Boe (Jessica Davis), the pop star got a semicolon tattoo over the weekend to represent Project Semicolon, a suicide prevention and mental health awareness organization. The symbolic punctuation represents the idea that when one thought ends, a new one begins \u2014 that \u201cthis is not the end but a new beginning.\u201d\n\nThe trio showed off the matching ink on Instagram. \u201cProject Semicolon is a movement dedicated to presenting hope for those suffering from depression, thoughts of suicide, addiction, and self-injury,\u201d captioned Boe on her Instagram.\n\nDorfman also describes his own personal struggles with mental health in his past. \u201cI struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college,\u201d he wrote alongside a photo of the gang\u2019s matching tattoos. \u201cI reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I\u2019d never live past the age of 21. Today I\u2019m grateful to be alive, in this new chapter of life in recovery, standing with my colleagues and friends, making art that helps other people.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Reed"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/selena-gomez-tattoo-matching-semicolons-13-reasons-why-cast-992400/", "title": "Selena Gomez and \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "For a good cause.", "news_keywords": "Style News", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Sam Reed", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 992400, "title": "Selena Gomez and '13 Reasons Why' Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "published_at": "2017-04-10 10:01:24", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Style News", "topics": "Style", "body": "Selena Gomez has spoken at length about the personal significance of the new Netflix series 13 Reasons Why, which tells the story of the thirteen reasons why a bullied high school student commits suicide.

Those of you watching 13 Reasons Why and identify with Hannah Baker, please check out Beyond The Reasons on netflix, or check out the link in my bio. Rest In Peace Amy Bluel, who started this movement.

Another day to be grateful to be alive. Alisha, Selena, and I went together to get ; tattoos. The ; symbol stands for an end of one thought and a beginning of another. Instead of a period, authors use the semicolon to continue a sentence. For us, it means a beginning of another chapter in life, in lieu of ending your life. I struggled with addiction and depression issues through high school and early college. I reached out and asked for help. At the time, I thought my life was over, I thought I'd never live past the age of 21. Today I'm grateful to be alive, in this new chapter of life in recovery, standing with my colleagues and friends, making art that helps other people. If you're struggling, if you feel suicidal, I urge you to click the link in my bio. Ask for help. Start a new chapter with the support of others. and RIP Amy Bleul, who started the semicolon movement.\r\n\t\tA post shared by TOMMY DORFMAN (@tommy.dorfman) on Apr 9, 2017 at 7:16pm PDT", "fb": {"pages": 14425952749}, "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Selena Gomez and \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/selena-gomez-tattoo-matching-semicolons-13-reasons-why-cast-992400/", "description": "For a good cause.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 577}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-10T10:01:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-11T09:23:47+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Selena Gomez and \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 Castmates Got Matching Tattoos", "description": "For a good cause.", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624757174-h2016.jpg?w=1296"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491818484.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
