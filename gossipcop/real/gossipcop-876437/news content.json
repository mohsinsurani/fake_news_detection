I'm not afraid to say that,\" the reality star told Us Weekly.\n\nThe couple stepped out at the MTV Movie and TV Awards during happier times in their relationship.

It helps me stay positive.\"\n\nFor her part, Grimaldi also appears to be leaning on friends. She posted a photo to Instagram with the caption, \"It's okay to feel broken. It's okay to cry. It's okay to lean on a friend. In the end, it will always be okay.\"", "images":
