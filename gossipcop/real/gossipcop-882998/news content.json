She spent months away from social media and hadn\u2019t returned to the country for almost two years.\n\nOn Sunday\u2019s episode of Keeping Up with the Kardashians, Kim, 37, explained why she decided to visit the City of Lights again for the Louis Vuitton spring/summer 2019 menswear show in June.\n\nKim\u2019s husband Kanye West planned to attend the fashion show because Louis Vuitton\u2019s Men\u2019s Artistic Director Virgil Abloh is a longtime friend of his from Chicago. While the rapper wanted to be there for his \u201cbrother,\u201d West understood that Kim might have had reservations about going with him.\n\nDominique Maitre/WWD/Shutterstock\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to put any pressure on you to go to Paris,\u201d West, 41, told Kim. \u201cI know that was really hard the last time you were in Paris. So I think just for the culture, for Kim K. to show up to the first black designer at [a] Louis Vuitton show who was the best man at my wedding, just the world would just love to see you there.\u201d\n\nInitially, Kim said, \u201cI have to think about it.\u201d\n\nWhen the mother of three consulted her sisters, Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney offered support of her one day trip to Paris.\n\n\u201cI definitely want to be there to support Kanye and Virgil but the last time I was there obviously [was] like a horrific experience for me,\u201d Kim said in an on-camera interview. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m going really cautiously, and I think going for such a short period of time def helps me mentally. But I guess you never know what could happen.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9, 34, agreed, \u201cIt\u2019s time.\u201d\n\nMomager Kris Jenner also encouraged her daughter to head to France.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re a really good friend to go back to a place where you\u2019re not the most comfortable,\u201d she told Kim. \u201cBut it\u2019s a good putting your toe in the water.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kim Kardashian Says She Was High on Ecstasy During First Wedding \u2014 and When She Made a Sex Tape\n\nKim expressed hope that the quick visit would help bring back a positive view of Paris.\n\n\u201cI have so many special memories in Paris,\u201d the KKW Beauty guru said. \u201cI hope that this trip will just be so good that I can start to remember all the magical things about Paris and why Kanye and I fell in love with it.\u201d\n\nIn the car after landing in Paris \u2014 where West was fascinated with the number of bike shops he saw in the city \u2014 the couple discussed lodging arrangements.\n\n\u201cNo more staying in small hotels,\u201d Kim stated of why they wouldn\u2019t be checking into a boutique hotel this time around.\n\nShe added to the cameras, \u201cBeing here in Paris, honestly, it\u2019s like really nerve-wracking honestly, but I\u2019m not trying to focus on anything negative.\u201d\n\nChesnot/WireImage\n\nWhen it was time to head to the show, Kim was warned that there were a lot of paparazzi outside the hotel and she had a bit of a freakout about making sure enough security were around.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s so many people, so much paparazzi, it just reminds me of everything that went on the last time that I was here,\u201d Kim told the cameras. \u201cI\u2019m just hypersensitive to this right now.\u201d\n\nKim and West got into the car safely and she even posed for the cameras upon arriving at the show. She ended up loving the new Louis Vuitton collection and so did West. He and Abloh embraced and cried in each other\u2019s arms at the end of the show.\n\n\u201cKanye and Virgil have the sweetest moment and they\u2019re both crying, all of our friends were crying,\u201d Kim said. \u201cIt\u2019s just such an emotional day. The fact that Virgil\u2019s come this far. It\u2019s just, it\u2019s like a symbol. Like, they made it. They did it. They\u2019re taking over the fashion world when everyone told them they couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nStephane Cardinale/Corbis/Getty\n\nBack in California, during a visit to Saved By the Bell\u2019s The Max pop-up restaurant, Kim recounted to Khlo\u00e9 and Kourtney, 39, how happy she felt about her first trip back to Paris.\n\n\u201cIt was so good,\u201d she told her sisters. \u201cLike, honestly, I\u2019m so glad we went. Like he had to be there.\u201d\n\nThough Kim admitted, \u201cFor a second, I was like, I was so stressed out over my security, just the movement of everyone. But other that, it was fine. I didn\u2019t really have a lot of anxiety.\u201d\n\nThe reality star even believed she could go back for a longer visit.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019ll ever really forget my experiences in Paris \u2014 the good or the bad \u2014 and I think that\u2019s okay,\u201d Kim said in an on-camera interview. \u201cIt all has made me who I am. Thinking about it, I think I could go back and spend more time and feel safe and comfortable.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays on E! at 9 p.m. ET.", "images":
