Well, get ready for your new obsession. This very bingeable Danish drama series is a Scandinavian (and, dare we say, superior) take on The West Wing that focuses on high-level politics in Denmark through the eyes of candidate turned Prime Minister Birgitte Nyborg (Sidse Babett Knudsen), her key aides, and members of the press, including Katrine F\u00f8nsmark (Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen). Three seasons (all now streaming on Netflix) originally aired from 2010-13, but today brings an all new, Netflix-co-produced fourth season (subtitled \"Power & Glory\") which takes place in the present day, when Nyborg is now serving as Minister for Foreign Affairs and F\u00f8nsmark has a new job as a TV news director. Much of the original cast returns with the notable exception of Pilou Asb\u00e6k.\n\nThe Croods: Family Tree Animation/Family Hulu/Peacock\n\nFamily Built Reality HGTV, 10p\n\nFire Masters Reality Cooking, 9p\n\nFor the Love of Jason Trailer Comedy ALLBLK\n\nHer Majesty: The Queen News 10p\n\nHosted by Her Majesty: The King (Gayle).\n\nI Love Us Reality/Comedy BET+\n\nMystic Drama UP, 9p\n\nRescheduled from March 10. Returning with new episodes for the first time in three years, Seth MacFarlane's Star Trek spoof/homage finds the show moving from Fox to Hulu for its third season and adopting an altered title. The season\u2014which could be the show's last, at least for quite a while, given its stars' commitments to other upcoming series\u2014will feature the final performance by the late Norm Macdonald (returning as the voice of Yaphit), while new faces include Anne Winters and Babylon 5 star Bruce Boxleitner.\n\nOutsiders Drama BET+\n\nAlso streaming on Sundance Now, this comedic, seven-episode adaptation of Adam Kay's medical memoir stars Ben Whishaw as a low-level doctor struggling with the long hours and high demands of working in an OB-GYN ward of a British NHS hospital, with the series following him (and his colleagues) both at work and in their personal lives. British critics loved the series when it aired on the BBC earlier this year. New episodes stream weekly.\n\nYuri Mar\u00e7al: Honest Mistake Comedy speical", "images": ["https://static.metacritic.com/images/products/movies/4/d7d4220e6af7758a9b7debdc9ba94cc1-98.jpg",
