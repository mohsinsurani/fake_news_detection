He will be greatly missed by many, including his wife Crystal, my sister Christie and my brothers David and Marston, and all of us at Playboy Enterprises.\u201d\n\nMega\n\nMega\n\nCooper \u2014 son of Henfer and his second wife Kimberley Conrad \u2014 is the chief creative officer of Playboy Enterprises, making the decision in February to bring nude photos back to the magazine after a 2015 decision to stop publishing them.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit that the way in which the magazine portrayed nudity was dated,\u201d Cooper tweeted at the time, \u201cbut removing it entirely was a mistake. Nudity was never the problem because nudity isn\u2019t a problem. Today, we\u2019re taking our identity back and reclaiming who we are.\u201d\n\nTaylor Hill/FilmMagic\n\nPreviously, Hefner\u2019s daughter Christie served as CEO of Playboy Enterprises.\n\nHefner\u2019s only daughter \u2014 from his first marriage to Millie Williams \u2014 began working in the family company in 1975. By 1982, she was named company president, and in 1988, she rose to become the chairman and CEO. During her time at the company, she transformed the brand, shutting down the original Playboy Clubs \u2014 a chain of nightclubs featuring waitresses dressed in Playboy bunny costumes \u2014 and helped launch Playboy TV and Playboy.com.\n\nIn 2009, Christie stepped down from her position and is currently the chairman of Hatch Beauty, a brand and innovation strategy company.\n\nPaul Zimmerman/WireImage\n\nWATCH: Hugh Hefner\u2019s Most Iconic \u2018Playboy\u2019 Covers\n\nHefner\u2019s oldest son David\u2014 also from Hefner\u2019s union with Williams\u2014 has remained entirely out of the spotlight and away from the Playboy lifestyle. Little is known about his career path, though he reportedly has worked as a computer programmer.\n\nIn August, Hugh\u2019s son Marston tweeted a photo of David enjoying a game of backgammon with his father and sister Christie.\n\nMarston \u2014 Hefner\u2019s first child with second wife Conrad\u2014 actually grew up living in the Playboy Mansion with Cooper, until he moved in next door with his mother when he was 8 years old.\n\nIn 2012, the then-21-year-old was arrested for allegedly attacking his live-in girlfriend, Playboy Playmate Claire Sinclair. He was later released on $20,000 bail on the misdemeanor offense, according to Pasadena police.\n\nMarston was sentenced to 52 weeks in a domestic violence program, according to TMZ.\n\nThough he was initially positioned as a co-heir apparent, he\u2019s remained mostly out of the public eye since the incident.", "images":
