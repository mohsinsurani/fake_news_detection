Perry's ability to package provocative lyrics into refreshing, radio-friendly pop was undeniable. Her breakout single \"I Kissed A Girl\" not only helped fuel her growing fame, it landed her on the red carpet of the 2008 VMAs, hanging out with Miley Cyrus and Taylor Swift. She managed to score an invite to perform two songs at the ceremony itself too.\n\nSoon-to-be-Katy Cats were still getting to know the beauty with the big, blue eyes, but the 2008 VMAs were huge for Perry: It was a major performance before a massive audience, and captured the kind of televised attention that would follow Perry from that point forward. But it was also the beginning of Perry\u2019s long, involved history with the MTV awards show, one that often coincided with personal and professional milestones. To celebrate her grand return and her gig hosting the whole shebang on August 27, here's a look back at her major moments \u2014 and how it all comes back to the VMAs.\n\n2008: Katy Perry Kissed A Girl And [Everyone] Liked It\n\nAfter palling around with Swift and Cyrus on the red carpet, Perry joined Travis Barker and DJ AM onstage at the VMAs to tackle two formidable tracks. First, she tried her hand at Madonna\u2019s \u201cLike A Virgin,\u201d which Madge performed on the VMA stage back in 1984. Perry updated it for a 2008 audience thanks to her cheeky \"Like A [Jonas]\" tweaks. She followed that up with \u201cI Kissed A Girl,\u201d and in the accompanying clip, Perry, walks off-stage after the performance, cracks up at host Russell Brand\u2019s praise of her single and his newfound (and X-rated) appreciation for cherry chapstick.\n\nShe\u2019s all smiles, and for good reason: In addition to the performance, \u201cI Kissed A Girl\u201d earned Perry nominations in a number of categories, including Best New Artist and Best Female Video, and she was just thrilled to be joining the ranks of Rihanna and Britney Spears. In a backstage interview, Perry was bowled over \u2014 and grateful \u2014 for the consideration in the Best Female Video category, especially. \"It\u2019s a very challenging VMA!\" she said. \"I\u2019m very honored to have anybody like my song and nominate me for a chance to win. I think the challenge is tough, but I always put up a good fight, and if I don\u2019t win, that\u2019s okay! I\u2019m new at this game! I might win in the future.\u201d Might? If she only knew ...\n\n2009: She Will Rock You\n\nWhat do Queen, Kanye West, one of the most notorious moments in VMA history, \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\u201d and a diamond ring have in common? They\u2019re all tied up in the 2009 VMAs \u2014 a night that changed the course of Perry\u2019s life.\n\nThe success of One of the Guys and her Best Female Video nomination for her \"Hot n Cold\" video gave Perry a major bump, as far as her involvement with the show was concerned: She kicked things off on the main stage for the show-opener, which featured her belting out Queen\u2019s \u201cWe Will Rock You\u201d alongside Joe Perry of Aerosmith. Brand \u2014 who made his appearance at the tail-end of the song \u2014 and Perry hit it off at rehearsal, sparking a romance that would lead to a proposal just a few months later on New Year\u2019s Eve. Before she walked into Radio City Music Hall that night, Perry joked around with Adrienne Bailon about how she was \u201ctrying to snag a man\u201d (and went so far as to say she was eyeballing Robert Pattinson). And hey! She did.\n\nThe reverberations of the 2009 VMAs extended beyond Perry\u2019s personal life, too. To close the show, Jay Z and Alicia Keys brought the crowd at Radio City to their feet with \u201cEmpire State of Mind,\u201d and that track would go on to inspire Perry to write \u201cCalifornia Gurls,\u201d which would serve as the first single of her next album. Though it wasn\u2019t necessarily that specific performance that would eventually bring Perry, Snoop, and some crazy cans of whip cream together for one of her most eye-catching videos, the spiritual connection between the two songs is strong \u2014 so it\u2019s perfect that her next hit after this particular VMAs is so closely tied to its grand finale.\n\n2010: Just Dream-y\n\nBy the time she strolled into Los Angeles\u2019 Nokia Theatre on September 12 for the VMAs, Perry was completely and totally consumed by her sophomore full-length, Teenage Dream \u2014 and so was the rest of the country.\n\nTeenage Dream came out just three weeks before the VMAs on August 24, and as such, she had a low-key year at the VMAs, by her standards: She presented the Best Male Video award alongside Nicki Minaj, and her candy-coated \"California Gurls\" video earned nominations in two categories.\n\n2011: Baby, You're A Firework \u2014 In Formalwear\n\nIf 2010 was chill, 2011 had none of it, as this was Perry's record-breaking year on multiple levels. Perry was the most-nominated artist, with 10 nods to her name thanks to videos for Teenage Dream\u2019s title track; \u201cFirework\u201d; \u201cE.T.,\u201d her collaboration with West; \u201cTeenage Dream\u201d; and \u201cLast Friday Night (T.G.I.F.).\u201d She\u2019d go on to take home the top honor of the evening, Video of the Year, for \u201cFirework,\u201d and the Best Collaboration and Best Visual Effects awards for \u201cE.T.\"\n\nBeyond the VMAs, Perry \u2014 and Teenage Dream \u2014 thrived. In the year following its release, five Teenage Dream tracks would hit No. 1 on the Billboard Hot 100, a record previously held only by Michael Jackson, and thus Perry became the first female artist to earn that distinction in the history of the chart. Perry also had her first major animated feature debut when The Smurfs hit theaters that summer and audiences realized that the voice of Smurfette sounded a little too familiar. If we had to pick one word to sum up Perry's VMA spoils, commercial triumphs, and every other accolade she collected in 2011? It'd be incendiary. You know, kind of like a firework.\n\n2012: The Pre-Prism Calm\n\nBy this point, Perry was a seasoned VMA vet, a singer still reaping the rewards of the oh-so-successful Teenage Dream, and a gal whose appearances at the VMAs were just as regular as the hits she was putting out. Perry was a nominee at the 2012 VMAs \u2014 \"Wide Awake\" scored a Moon Person (then still known as a Moonman) for Best Art Direction, and nods for Video of the Year, Best Female Video, and Best Visual effects \u2014 as well as a presenter.\n\nPerry had the honor of giving One Direction their first VMA win, as she presented the guys \u2014 well, the boys, really, because look at those baby faces! \u2014 with the Best Pop Video prize for \"What Makes You Beautiful.\"\n\nBeyond the VMAs, 2012 saw the end of Teenage Dream's album cycle, and a slow-down in Perry's world as a result. She kicked off her year with a performance of \"Firework\" at the Grammy Awards, and she and Brand settled their divorce just a month before the VMAs that July.\n\n2013: We Heard Her Roar\n\nThe VMAs ventured to Brooklyn, New York, for the first time in 2013 \u2014 and Perry performed beneath the borough's most recognizable landmark for one knockout of a grand finale. Perry was still over a month out from the release of Prism, her fourth studio album, by the time of the ceremony, but first single \"Roar\" saw its release just a couple of weeks before the VMAs, which made it a perfect choice for an epic closer.\n\nIn a ceremony full of extremely memorable performances, Perry's stood out as historic in that she quite literally broke new ground: She took \"Roar\" to a boxing ring by the foot of the Brooklyn Bridge, and duked it out with the tune that would become one of her biggest \u2014 and most motivational \u2014 smashes with its iconic arches looming above her. As she did with Teenage Dream, Perry used the VMAs as the unofficial launchpad for the next chapter of her career \u2014 and \"Roar\" made for an energetic, uplifting ascent into her Prism period.\n\n2014: Reign of the \"Dark Horse\"\n\nFrom start to finish, Perry's night out at the 2014 VMAs was that of a winner. She and her date, Riff Raff, showed up in matching, head-to-toe denim ensembles that were a modern update on a red carpet look Spears and Justin Timberlake rendered legendary in 2001. She spent most of the show hanging out with Sam Smith and Cyrus, but took a break from posing for the occasional selfie with her friends to make her way to the mic for her acceptance speech.\n\nThe winning visual? The insane vid for her collaboration with Juicy J, \"Dark Horse,\" which had Perry trying on Cleopatra's look for size while putting her own surrealistic spin on that timeless, jet black bob and eyeliner. \"Dark Horse\" gave Perry her sixth Best Female Video nomination and her fifth VMA win, and would go on to be crowned the top song of 2014 on a ton of year-end lists, including Billboard's Top 40 chart.\n\n2017: To Be Witnessed\n\nPerry may have come at us like a dark horse in 2014, but now \u2013 months out from the release of Witness, her latest album, and with a handful of 2017 nominations \u2014 could this year be her most intense yet at the VMAs? We'll just have to wait and see, but one thing's for sure: She's familiar with the territory, and she knows how to make the VMAs a night to remember.", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:365426e4-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:79ad7f25-c2ed-4cf9-a1ba-6e57be5286f5?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c45b759e-5caf-44a0-a5f1-07d21156312b?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:af26ecc9-8660-466d-954d-47a5d29bbd2d?quality=0.7"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:365426e4-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mtv.com/news/0ciouk/katy-perry-best-moments-vmas", "title": "Katy Perry's Most Unforgettable VMA Moments, From Red Carpets To 'Roar'", "meta_data": {"app_version": "d8d613330-2688-2022-10-07", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Looking back on Katy Perry's best VMA moments from her debut at the show in 2008 to winning Video of the Year in 2011 \u2014 and beyond.", "original-source": "https://www.mtv.com/news/0ciouk/katy-perry-best-moments-vmas", "search": {"title": "Katy Perry's Most Unforgettable VMA Moments, From Red Carpets To 'Roar'", "description": "She's performed, presented, walked out a winner \u2014 and she's got plenty of stories that start with VMA", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:365426e4-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7", "imageHeight": 2021, "imageWidth": 3000, "url": "/news/0ciouk/katy-perry-best-moments-vmas", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2017-08-22T13:18:18.000Z"}, "news_keywords": "VMAs,Pop Music", "og": {"site_name": "MTV", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:365426e4-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "description": "She's performed, presented, walked out a winner \u2014 and she's got plenty of stories that start with VMA", "title": "Katy Perry's Most Unforgettable VMA Moments, From Red Carpets To 'Roar'", "url": "https://www.mtv.com/news/0ciouk/katy-perry-best-moments-vmas", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "She's performed, presented, walked out a winner \u2014 and she's got plenty of stories that start with VMA", "title": "Katy Perry's Most Unforgettable VMA Moments, From Red Carpets To 'Roar'", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:365426e4-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.com", "summary": ""}
