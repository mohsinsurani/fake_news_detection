Plummer is nominated for best supporting actor in a motion picture for his portrayal of billionaire oil tycoon J. Paul Getty. The upcoming historical drama also received nominations for best director (Ridley Scott) and best actress in a motion picture drama (Michelle Williams).\n\nPlummer, 87, replaced Spacey, 58, in All the Money in the World after several men accused the House of Cards star of sexual harassment and assault. In an unprecedented move, the Sound of Music actor reshot the character\u2019s scenes in mid-November, just weeks before the film\u2019s scheduled release date, which was slightly adjusted from December 22 to 25.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going to be different, naturally,\u201d Plummer told Us Weekly and other reporters at the Man Who Invented Christmas premiere in New York City on November 12. \u201cThe situation is very sad. \u2026 Kevin is such a talented and gifted actor. It\u2019s just so sad. It\u2019s such a shame.\u201d\n\nDespite the last-minute change, the Oscar winner was excited to join the movie. \u201cI\u2019m used to big roles and lots of words. I\u2019m used to that,\u201d he told Us. \u201cI\u2019m trying to be as good as I can be, but [the script] fascinates me. It\u2019s very well-written.\u201d\n\nSpacey apologized to actor Anthony Rapp, the first man to accuse him of sexual misconduct, in October. He publicly came out as gay in the same statement, which was met with criticism from several celebrities and members of the LGBTQ community. Spacey has not commented on the allegations that followed.\n\nThe 2018 Golden Globe Awards, hosted by Seth Meyers, air on NBC on Sunday, January 7, at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/christopher-plummer-earns-golden-globe-nod-for-kevin-spacey-role-2/", "title": "Christopher Plummer Earns Golden Globe Nod for Kevin Spacey Role", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Christopher Plummer snagged a Golden Globe 2018 nomination after replacing Kevin Spacey in \u2018All the Money in the World\u2019 \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Christopher Plummer Earns Golden Globe Nod for Kevin Spacey Role", "description": "Christopher Plummer snagged a Golden Globe 2018 nomination after replacing Kevin Spacey in \u2018All the Money in the World\u2019 \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/christopher-plummer-earns-golden-globe-nod-for-kevin-spacey-role-2/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:12+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-11T15:26:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:11:12+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Christopher Plummer Earns Golden Globe Nod for Kevin Spacey Role", "description": "Christopher Plummer snagged a Golden Globe 2018 nomination after replacing Kevin Spacey in \u2018All the Money in the World\u2019 \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/christopher-plummer-kevin-spacey.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513006007.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
