News broke in March that Capshaw and Drew \u2014 who have been with the Shondaland drama for 10 and nine seasons, respectively \u2014 would be departing at the conclusion of the current season.\n\nAfter a penultimate episode in which Drew\u2019s April Kepner came this close to death, the finale jumped forward a few weeks to reveal that she\u2019d quit her job at Grey Sloan Memorial to \u201cdo God\u2019s work.\u201d It brought the religious character\u2019s crisis-of-faith storyline to a close and was capped off when April and Matthew (Justin Bruening) tied the knot after Alex (Justin Chambers) and Jo\u2019s (Camilla Luddington) destination wedding went off the rails. (Don\u2019t fret, Alex and Jo got married on a ferry, with Meredith \u2014 ordained online \u2014 performing the ceremony.)\n\nAs for Capshaw\u2019s Arizona, well, she got her happily ever after as well. Following her decision to move from Seattle to New York so her daughter, Sofia, could be in the same city with her other mother, Callie (former series regular Sara Ramirez). What\u2019s more, Arizona revealed that Callie was now single as well as the former married couple seemed poised to start anew.\n\nCreator Shonda Rhimes acknowledged the duo Thursday after the finale.\n\nI will never stop being grateful for the chance to work with @sarahdrew and @JessicaCapshaw. In April and Arizona, they created powerful unforgettable characters. #GreysAnatomy #TGIT \u2014 shonda rhimes (@shondarhimes) May 18, 2018\n\nThat Arizona and April would both find love with their respective former flames Callie and Matthew was a fitting way for the onscreen friends to go out together in a season that has increasingly honored its history. In a nod to its roots, the finale also featured a cameo of sorts by Ramirez as her cover of Brandi Carlile\u2019s \u201cThe Story\u201d from the season seven musical was featured during the double-wedding final scene.\n\nThe decision to part ways with Capshaw and Drew was a creative one, showrunner Krista Vernoff said, and not based on salary or budget factors after Pompeo inked a new $20 million annual deal that made her TV\u2019s highest paid actress on a primetime drama.\n\n\u201cThe suggestion \u2026 that our cast changes are in any way related to Ellen Pompeo\u2019s salary renegotiation is wrong and hurtful and misguided,\u201d wrote Vernoff, who like Pompeo, has been a vocal advocate of salary parity. \u201cIt smacks of an old, broken, patriarchal notion that women must be pitted against each other and that one woman\u2019s success will be costly to others.\n\nCapshaw has been with Grey\u2019s for 10 seasons, nine as a series regular playing Arizona, the openly gay pediatrics surgeon who was almost immediately embraced by the LGBTQ community. With former star Ramirez, Capshaw was part of one of primetime\u2019s first lesbian weddings. The character helped Grey\u2019s receive multiple awards from LGBTQ watchdog group GLAAD, while also representing a traditionally underserved community in an era when gay characters were still few and far between.\n\nDrew, with the Shondaland drama for nine seasons (eight as a regular), came in as an intern and has been wildly praised for April\u2019s commitment to her Christianity, which was put to the test this season.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s always hard for me to say goodbye to any of my characters. Both Arizona Robbins and April Kepner are not only beloved but iconic \u2014 both the LBGTQ and devout Christian communities are underrepresented on TV,\u201d Rhimes said back in March when news of their departures broke. \u201cI will be forever grateful to both Jessica and Sarah for bringing these characters to life with such vibrant performances and for inspiring women around the globe. They will always be a part of our Shondaland family.\u201d\n\nCapshaw and Drew become the second and third series regulars to exit Grey\u2019s this season. They join Martin Henderson (Nathan), who was written out after a two-season run. (For her part, Drew quickly booked a post-Grey\u2019s role in CBS\u2019 Cagney and Lacey pilot that ultimately was passed over at the network.)\n\nThe exits come as Grey\u2019s \u2014 ABC\u2019s No. 2 drama behind The Good Doctor \u2014 is in a period of change. After saying farewell to series regular Jerrika Hinton (Stephanie) last year, star Jason George (Ben) transitioned to Station 19, the recently renewed firefighter spinoff. The drama, which welcomed back Vernoff as co-showrunner (after her stint in seasons one through seven) as creator Rhimes prepared her move to Netflix, also introduced six new interns as the veteran drama looks to repopulate its ranks.\n\nElsewhere in the finale, former star Kim Raver (Teddy) returned following a one-episode bottle episode in which Owen (Kevin McKidd) traveled to Germany to make a play for his old Army friend and colleague. The finale opened the door for Raver to return in a more permanent role as Bailey (Chandra Wilson) \u2014 enjoying the financial rewards of her \u201cTrailblazer\u201d \u2014 tapped Teddy to serve as interim chief as Grey Sloan\u2019s newest (former) doc also revealed she was pregnant (following her romp with Owen).\n\nAs for who else could return in the recently announced 15th season, the door remains open for Scott Speedman to reprise his role as the charismatic Nick Marsh, a transplant surgeon who hit it off with Meredith (Pompeo) earlier this season. (The finale also featured an interesting moment between Meredith and her daughter, Zola, about finding love again.)\n\nWhat did you think of how April and Arizona\u2019s storyline ended?
