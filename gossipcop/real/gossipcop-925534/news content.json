At first I thought I had been bitten by something, or it was just back fat. A couple of weeks later, I noticed that it was still there and seemed to be growing,\u201d she says in a statement.\n\nBailey\u2019s doctor told her the growth was lipoma, a fatty tumor that grows in the body\u2019s immune system, and she started to panic.\n\n\u201cI Googled it immediately, and was blown away by the photos of the worst cases in particular. I was scared because as soon as I heard the word tumor, I immediately thought cancer,\u201d she says.\n\nOn Saturday, Bailey shared a photo from the doctor\u2019s office and told her followers that she had an \u201cearly morning doctor appointment today. Had a little health scare. Thankfully I\u2019m okay.\u201d\n\nBailey set up surgery to remove the lipoma, and doctors were able to remove it, but with some difficulty. Thankfully, the tumor was not cancerous.\n\n\u201cSurgery went well, however it went much longer than expected because the tumor was embedded very deeply in my back and partially under a muscle,\u201d she explains. \u201cIt was also larger than expected. In the end, thankfully all the lipoma was removed successfully, and it is benign.\u201d\n\nBailey says she\u2019s now back at her home, which she calls \u201cLake Bailey,\u201d and recovering well.\n\n\u201cThanks to everyone for all the well wishes, texts, and flowers,\u201d she says.", "images":
