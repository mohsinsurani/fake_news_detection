The high-power entertainment couple trailed through Europe and North America producing visually-stunning performances filled with personal moments and endless hits. For her second co-headlining tour, Beyonc\u00e9 took her costumes to the next level recruiting custom designs from Mugler, Vivienne Westwood and Versace. In addition to her signature bodysuits and thigh-high boots, stylist Marni Senofante incorporated hats and masks to truly dazzle the crowd.\n\nWe\u2019ve rounded up our favorite style moments from the unforgettable OTR II tour. Read on below and let us know your top picks.\n\nOlivier Rousteing was recruited to create an iridescent costume complete with leggy boots and a windbreaker to match. The two recently collaborated on a capsule inspired by her Coachella 2018 performance where she sported a bejeweled hoodie with custom graphics. This look set the standard for the rest to come.\n\nBurberry\u2018s comeback is now official thanks to Queen Bey. The luxury English label crafted a vintage check bodysuit with a cropped jacket to pair. Completing the outfit is a pair of matching sunnies and gloves.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 stripped down her Givenchy gown into a form-fitting bodysuit for her joint numbers with JAY-Z. The long-sleeved garment is covered in star-like jewels that glimmer when hit with the light. The bow on the front says \u201cMrs. Carter\u201d but the V-cut is more \u201cSasha Fierce.\u201d\n\nFor the peak of her two-hour set, Beyonc\u00e9 sported a new design from Dapper Dan x Gucci\u2019s Fall/Winter 2018 collection. Her signature hip-cut shorts are covered with the \u201cGG\u201d zippered overcoat which also complements her boots. To fully transform into Bonnie (of Bonnie & Clyde) she threw on Gucci\u2019s FW18 balaclava mask which somehow didn\u2019t affect her vocals.\n\nAs the OTR II tour progressed, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s looks became more extravagant. She kicked off the series sporting a sleek black costume with a matching Mugler hat designed by creative director Casey Cadwallader. For the latter dates, Cadwallader created a stunning silvery suit with the same hat showcasing the evolution of the look.\n\nOff-White\u2122\u2019s Spring/Summer 2019 neon gown was snatched straight off of the runway and delivered to Beyonc\u00e9 for the last dates of her tour. The \u201cTrack and Field\u201d-inspired garment has a T-shirt top that merges into a ruffled, neon yellow ball gown. This item was the perfect option for her ballad segment.\n\nVersace\u2019s ubiquitous baroque style has returned to the forefront of fashion thanks to Donatella. The gold, white and black patterning is perfect for the stage and looks even better on Beyonc\u00e9 when backed by similarly-styled dancers. Though she was outfitted in a full-length cape and waist-cinching belt, she still delivered, as always, the performance of a lifetime.\n\nPhotographer Raven Varona caught the majesty of Vivienne Westwood\u2019s cascading bodysuit at the right moment. It is clear that a lot of detail was paid to the off-the-shoulder catsuit which was accented with a flowing train. The asymmetrical sunglasses and the \u201cB\u201d ring are some of our favorite accessories from the tour.", "images":
