It's that enchanting and emotional. But the New Jersey-born singer has many other talents. Allure exclusively reports that Halsey is the new face of Yves Saint Laurent Beaut\u00e9. The stunning singer will also be flipping the script with her brand ambassadorship by showing off her skills as a makeup artist.\n\nInstead of simply appearing in ad campaigns and commercials hawking the brand's luxe makeup, Halsey will create makeup looks herself. She will then post them on her multi-million-strong Instagram.\n\nShe is taking an influencer route with this partnership \u2014 and will speak directly to her fanbase and makeup-loving millennials with this approach.\n\nSo if you love Halsey's ever-shifting look, you will learn how to replicate it. She will share all of her beauty techniques via her posts. With Halsey x YSL Beaut\u00e9, it'll be like the singer is your own personal MUA.\n\n\"Recording artist, Halsey, well-known for her music and poetry, will soon be working with YSL Beaut\u00e9 to create makeup looks that speak to the millennial consumer,\" the brand revealed in a press release delivered to Allure.\n\nYSLB further stated, \"While everyone knows about her chart-topping music, her talent as a makeup artist is a secret to many. Not for long as YSL Beaut\u00e9 taps into Halsey's unique vision of beauty and offering her fans makeup tips and tricks.\"\n\nThe brand finished by saying, \"In this partnership, Halsey will showcase her makeup looks to her 6.5M Instagram followers on a monthly basis.\"\n\nUltimately, Halsey is changing the rulebook for celebrity partnerships with beauty brands. She will be super hands on and dive in, showing customers how to use the products IRL.\n\nThis isn't Halsey\u2019s first time partnering with a major makeup brand. Halsey teamed up with MAC for a mermaid blue x gray lipstick back in 2016. The collab was part of the brand's #FutureForward campaign with emerging artists. The shade was something else \u2014 a rich, deep, and unbelievably unique matte. It was not a hue that everyone can pull off at any time. But Halsey\u2019s precise pout made it look easy.\n\nIlya S. Savenok/Getty Images Entertainment/Getty Images\n\nIt's totally obvious why YSL Beaut\u00e9 would want to team up with Halsey. She largely focuses on her eyes and lips for makeup looks.
