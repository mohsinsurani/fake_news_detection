It showcased the extraordinary diversity of cultures and cuisines, and how much we all have in common \u2013 all through the simple act of sharing meals.\n\nTragically, he proved this again on Friday. Bourdain\u2019s death shook television viewers around the world. The most common sentiment: \u201cI feel like I\u2019ve lost a friend.\u201d\n\nAnthony Bourdain on January 4, 2017, in Port of Spain, Trinidad David S. Holloway/CNN\n\nAsking for help The suicide rate in the United States has seen sharp increases in recent years. Studies have shown that the risk of suicide declines sharply when people call the national suicide hotline: 1-800-273-TALK. There is also a crisis text line. For crisis support in Spanish, call 1-888-628-9454. The lines are staffed by a mix of paid professionals and unpaid volunteers trained in crisis and suicide intervention. The confidential environment, the 24-hour accessibility, a caller\u2019s ability to hang up at any time and the person-centered care have helped its success, advocates say.\n\n\n\nThe International Association for Suicide Prevention and Befrienders Worldwide also provide contact information for crisis centers around the world.\n\nThe gifted chef and storyteller used his books and later television shows to explore culture and cuisine. He spent years as a line cook and sous chef at restaurants in the Northeast before becoming executive chef at Brasserie Les Halles in Manhattan.\n\n\u201cTony was a symphony,\u201d his friend and fellow chef Andrew Zimmern said Friday.\n\nThe news of Bourdain\u2019s death was met by profound sadness within CNN, where \u201cParts Unknown\u201d has aired for the past five years. In an email to employees, the network\u2019s president, Jeff Zucker, remembered him as an \u201cexceptional talent.\u201d\n\n\u201cTony will be greatly missed not only for his work but also for the passion with which he did it,\u201d Zucker wrote.\n\nCNN said Bourdain was in France working on an upcoming episode of his award-winning CNN series, \u201cParts Unknown.\u201d His close friend Eric Ripert, the French chef, found Bourdain unresponsive in his hotel room Friday morning. He was 61 and took his own life.\n\n\u201cAnthony was my best friend,\u201d Ripert tweeted. \u201cAn exceptional human being, so inspiring & generous. One of the great storytellers who connected w so many. I pray he is at peace from the bottom of my heart. My love and prayers are also w his family, friends and loved ones.\u201d\n\nAnthony was my best friend. An exceptional human being, so inspiring & generous.

May he rest in peace now. He was a friend, a collaborator, and family. A huge personality, a giant talent, a unique voice, and deeply, deeply human. My heart goes out to his daughter and family, and his longtime partners and friends at ZPZ. \u2014 Christiane Amanpour (@amanpour) June 8, 2018\n\nPresident Donald Trump extended his condolences to Bourdain\u2019s family on Friday morning. \u201cI enjoyed his show,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHe was quite a character.\u201d\n\nFormer President Barack Obama recalled a meal he shared with Bourdain in Vietnam while Obama was on a trip through Asia in 2016 \u2013 an encounter captured in a \u201cParts Unknown\u201d episode that year.\n\n\u201c\u2018Low plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer.\u2019 This is how I\u2019ll remember Tony,\u201d Obama posted to Twitter on Friday. \u201cHe taught us about food \u2013 but more importantly, about its ability to bring us together. To make us a little less afraid of the unknown. We\u2019ll miss him.\u201d\n\n\u201cLow plastic stool, cheap but delicious noodles, cold Hanoi beer.\u201d This is how I\u2019ll remember Tony.

She remembered Bourdain as someone who \u201cgave all of himself in everything that he did.\u201d\n\nLast year, he advocated for Argento as she went public with accusations against disgraced Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. \u201cHe was my love, my rock, my protector. I am beyond devastated.\u201d\n\nAfter #MeToo, Anthony Bourdain stood \u2018unhesitatingly and unwaveringly\u2019 with women\n\nBourdain\u2019s death came days after fashion designer Kate Spade died in a suicide at her Manhattan apartment.\n\nSuicide is a growing problem in the United States, where rates have increased by 25% nationwide over nearly two decades ending in 2016. Twenty-five states experienced a rise in suicides by more than 30%, according to a government report published this week.\n\n\u2018The Elvis of bad boy chefs\u2019\n\nBourdain was a master of his crafts \u2013 first in the kitchen and then in the media. Through his TV shows and books, he helped audiences think differently about food, travel and themselves. He advocated for marginalized populations and campaigned for safer working conditions for restaurant staffs.\n\nAnthony Bourdain shone a different light on the Middle East | Was a voice for the underdog\n\nAlong the way, he received practically every award the industry has to offer.\n\nIn 2013, Peabody Award judges honored Bourdain and \u201cParts Unknown\u201d for \u201cexpanding our palates and horizons in equal measure.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s irreverent, honest, curious, never condescending, never obsequious,\u201d the judges said. \u201cPeople open up to him and, in doing so, often reveal more about their hometowns or homelands than a traditional reporter could hope to document.\u201d\n\nThe Smithsonian once called him \u201cthe original rock star\u201d of the culinary world, \u201cthe Elvis of bad boy chefs.\u201d His shows took him to more than 100 countries and three networks.\n\nWhile accepting the Peabody award in 2013, Bourdain described how he approached his work.\n\nExplore \u201cParts Unknown\u201d: Everywhere he traveled\n\n\u201cWe ask very simple questions: What makes you happy? What do you eat? What do you like to cook? And everywhere in the world we go and ask these very simple questions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe tend to get some really astonishing answers.\u201d\n\nFriends and acquaintances remembered Bourdain\u2019s curiosity for the world\u2019s variety of cultures and cuisine rubbing off on them.\n\nHis good friend Michael Ruhlman said he was stunned by news of the suicide.\n\n\u201cThe last I knew, he was in love. He was happy,\u201d Ruhlman told CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d \u201cHe said, \u2018Love abounds\u2019 \u2013 some of the last words he said to me.\u201d\n\nRuhlman said Bourdain was much more sensitive than people realized, but that sensitivity coupled with Bourdain\u2019s bravado made him a great storyteller.\n\nRuhlman and chef James Syhabout both said that when people found out they knew Bourdain, they would ask what he really was like.\n\nExactly like he was on camera, they said.\n\n\u201cAnd that\u2019s the beauty of him,\u201d Syhabout told CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d \u201cHe\u2019s unapologetically honest. \u2026 It all gives us courage to be ourselves and be individuals and that\u2019s what really radiates from him.\u201d\n\nChef and writer Edward Lee, who hosted a season of a show produced by Bourdain, looked back at their time working together and wrote that \u201cTony gave us a world that we didn\u2019t know we needed.\u201d\n\nOthers who fondly recalled their interactions with Bourdain included chef Gordon Ramsay, who said Bourdain \u201cbrought the world into our homes and inspired so many people to explore cultures and cities through their food.\u201d\n\nFrom \u2018happy dishwasher\u2019 to addiction to fame\n\nBourdain grew up in Leonia, New Jersey, and started working in kitchens in his teens \u2013 including on Massachusetts\u2019 Cape Cod during the summer.\n\n\u201cI was a happy dishwasher,\u201d he said in a 2016 interview on NPR\u2019s \u201cFresh Air.\u201d \u201cI jokingly say that I learned every important lesson, all the most important lessons of my life, as a dishwasher.\u201d\n\nIt was during those early jobs, he said, that he began using drugs, eventually developing a heroin addiction and other problems that he later said should have killed him in his 20s. He often talked of his addiction later in life.\n\n\u201cSomebody who wakes up in the morning and their first order of business is (to) get heroin \u2013 I know what that\u2019s like,\u201d Bourdain said in a 2014 \u201cParts Unknown\u201d episode highlighting an opioid crisis in Massachusetts.\n\nAfter spending two years at New York\u2019s Vassar College, he dropped out and enrolled in culinary school. He spent years as a line cook and sous chef at restaurants in the Northeast before becoming executive chef at Manhattan\u2019s Brasserie Les Halles.\n\nA different passion \u2013 his writing \u2013 helped put him on the map by his early 40s.\n\nInside Anthony Bourdain\u2019s globe-trotting career\n\nHe published two suspense novels before drawing widespread public attention with his 1999 New Yorker article, \u201cDon\u2019t Eat Before Reading This.\u201d The article was about the secrets of kitchen life and shady characters he encountered along the way.\n\n\u201cIn America, the professional kitchen is the last refuge of the misfit. It\u2019s a place for people with bad pasts to find a new family,\u201d he wrote.\n\nThe article morphed into a best-selling book in 2000, \u201cKitchen Confidential: Adventures in the Culinary Underbelly,\u201d which was translated into more than two dozen languages.\n\n\u201cWhen the book came out, it very quickly transformed my life \u2013 I mean, changed everything,\u201d he told NPR.\n\nBourdain found himself on a path to international stardom. First, he hosted \u201cA Cook\u2019s Tour\u201d on the Food Network, then moved to the Travel Channel with \u201cAnthony Bourdain: No Reservations,\u201d a breakout hit that earned two Emmy Awards and more than a dozen nominations.\n\nOpinion: Anthony Bourdain saw the humanity in all of us\n\nIn 2013, both Bourdain and CNN took a risk by bringing him to a network still best known for breaking news and headlines. Bourdain quickly became one of its principal faces and a linchpin of its prime-time schedule.\n\nSeason 11 of \u201cParts Unknown\u201d premiered last month on CNN, with destinations including Uruguay, Armenia and West Virginia. The series has been honored with five Emmys.\n\nIn his final weeks, Bourdain said he was especially looking forward to an episode about Hong Kong, which aired Sunday.\n\nHe called it a \u201cdream show\u201d in which he linked up with longtime Hong Kong resident and cinematographer Christopher Doyle.\n\n\u201cThe idea was just to interview him and maybe get him to hold a camera. He ended up being director of photography for the entire episode,\u201d Bourdain told CNN in April. \u201cFor me it was like asking Joe DiMaggio to, you know, sign my baseball and instead he joined my Little League team for the whole season.\u201d\n\nHe helped a kid fighting leukemia make his culinary dream trip\n\nThe show\u2019s website on Friday posted an homage to Bourdain featuring one of his many oft-repeated quotations \u2013 one that seemed to embody his philosophy: \u201cIf I\u2019m an advocate for anything, it\u2019s to move. As far as you can, as much as you can. Across the ocean, or simply across the river. Walk in someone else\u2019s shoes or at least eat their food.\u201d\n\n\u2013\n\nHow to get help: In the United States, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255.
