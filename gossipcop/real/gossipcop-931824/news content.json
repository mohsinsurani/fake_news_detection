The hip-hop mogul is facing at least 13 accusations of sexual harassment and rape, and is the subject of a New York City police department special victims unit investigation.\n\nSimmons has repeatedly denied accusations against him, including in court documents filed on 4 April, in which he denied raping film-maker Jennifer Jarosik, who attempted to sue him for $5m (\u00a33.68m) \u2013 the lawsuit was later dismissed. In a statement posted to his Instagram account as the caption to an image that stated, \u201cShoutout to black women just because\u201d, Simmons reiterated this position, but accepted the net benefits of the #MeToo movement: \u201cA little blood on my shoulders so that my daughters see a better world is worth it.\u201d\n\nAllow Instagram content?

In November 2017, Simmons stepped down from his role in Def Jam records, the label he cofounded with Rick Rubin, along with his yoga lifestyle brand, other media properties and CNNMoney. HBO removed his name from All Def Comedy, a series he created to showcase up-and-coming comedians.\n\nIn response to allegations of sexual assault from screenwriter Jenny Lumet last November, Simmons wrote: \u201cWhile her memory of that evening is very different from mine, it is now clear to me that her feelings of fear and intimidation are real. While I have never been violent, I have been thoughtless and insensitive in some of my relationships over many decades and I sincerely apologise.\u201d\n\nFollowing four further accusations of rape in December 2017, Simmons posted another now-deleted statement to Instagram, pledging to clear his name: \u201cToday, I begin to properly defend myself. I will prove without any doubt that I am innocent of all rape charges,\u201d Simmons posted, beneath an image that read #NOTME.\n\nAllow Instagram content?

West and his wife, Kim Kardashian West, have said that speculation about West\u2019s mental health is invasive.\n\nSimmons suggested West was \u201cunravelling in public\u201d, and called on the hip-hop community to support him: \u201cI refuse to believe a black man who supports black empowerment but now says \u2018Slavery was a choice\u2019 is operating with a healthy state of mind,\u201d Simmons wrote.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Russell+Simmons%2CMusic%2CCulture%2CSexual+harassment%2C%23MeToo+movement%2CKanye+West%2CRace%2CUS+news%2CWomen", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53fbc0b3e76f2fe56ffb9403d9961e0bfe49eba/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53fbc0b3e76f2fe56ffb9403d9961e0bfe49eba/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4c7260f95c9059f2182ee2c3c7dfbc73"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53fbc0b3e76f2fe56ffb9403d9961e0bfe49eba/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4c7260f95c9059f2182ee2c3c7dfbc73", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Snapes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/03/russell-simmons-issues-statement-supporting-metoo", "title": "Russell Simmons issues statement supporting #MeToo despite sexual assault allegations", "meta_data": {"description": "The hip-hop mogul says the #MeToo conversation has inspired him \u2018to look beyond my personal scenario\u2019, while he has repeatedly denied multiple accusations of sexual harassment and rape", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/03/russell-simmons-issues-statement-supporting-metoo", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53fbc0b3e76f2fe56ffb9403d9961e0bfe49eba/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=4c7260f95c9059f2182ee2c3c7dfbc73", "height": 720}, "title": "Russell Simmons issues statement supporting #MeToo despite sexual assault allegations", "description": "The hip-hop mogul says the #MeToo conversation has inspired him \u2018to look beyond my personal scenario\u2019, while he has repeatedly denied multiple accusations of sexual harassment and rape", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/laura-snapes", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-05-04T17:01:00.000Z", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2018-05-03T11:01:41.000Z", "tag": "Russell Simmons,Music,Culture,Sexual harassment,#MeToo movement,Kanye West,Race,US news,Women"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2018/may/03/russell-simmons-issues-statement-supporting-metoo?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/may/03/russell-simmons-issues-statement-supporting-metoo", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2018/may/03/russell-simmons-issues-statement-supporting-metoo?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2018/may/03/russell-simmons-issues-statement-supporting-metoo?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/c53fbc0b3e76f2fe56ffb9403d9961e0bfe49eba/0_200_3000_1800/master/3000.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=87b1053ef100b6a9e976bc2c72ba1b62", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525302000.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
