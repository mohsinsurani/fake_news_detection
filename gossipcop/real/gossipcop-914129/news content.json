They\u2019re soft, make you feel like a teddy bear, and are a favorite of celebrities like Kim Kardashian, Hailey Baldwin, Rosie Huntington-Whiteley, and Elsa Hosk. (Just to name a few.) The coat is so popular that three of the four have worn the exact same one.\n\nOn Valentine\u2019s Day, Kardashian stepped out in Los Angeles wearing a fuzzy Balenciaga shearling teddy coat. The \u201cKeeping Up with the Kardashians\u201d star paired the light-brown trench\u2014which retails for a whopping $5,600\u2014with gray sweat pants, a hot-pink sports bra, and white heeled booties.\n\nIf the coat looked familiar, it\u2019s because three of fashion\u2019s most notable \u201cIt\u201d girls wore near-identical jackets a couple months prior. Huntington-Whiteley was the first to wear it when she stepped out in New York City in December bundling herself up in Max Mara\u2019s Teddy Bear Icon Coat. (Not exactly the same as Kim\u2019s but pretty close.)\n\nA day after Huntington-Whiteley paired the coat with luxe leggings and pleather booties, Hosk styled the outerwear with cropped light-washed jeans and a denim shirt. Baldwin kept the casual looking going a month later in January with a messy bun and comfy sneakers.\n\nIf Kardashian\u2019s $5,600 Balenciaga coat is out of your price range, you won\u2019t have much luck with Hosk, Huntington-Whiteley, and Baldwin\u2019s favorite. The fashion girls\u2019 Max Mara favorite retails at $3,950\u2014about $1,600 less than Kardashian\u2019s, but still a pricy buy. Guess we\u2019ll just have to stick on gawking at pictures or splurge on the once-in-a-lifetime purchase.
