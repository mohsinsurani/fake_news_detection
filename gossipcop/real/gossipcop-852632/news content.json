The Idol format has taken on original versions in 55 countries around the world, and American Idol itself has played to a worldwide audience of over 460 million across 53 countries. At its new home on ABC, American Idol will continue to be a force in the television landscape, reaching every corner of the country in its search for the next great music sensation.\n\nAmerican Idol is produced by FremantleMedia North America and 19 Entertainment, a division of CORE Media Group.
