It felt like the show could see into the future, because the reference was just so timely. And now, they\u2019ve done it again \u2014 except that this time they\u2019ve had to edit the reference out.\n\nThe episode set to air tonight, titled \u201cThe 20s,\u201d revolves around a flashback to Halloween of years past. The official synopsis reads: Trick-or-treating with the 10 year olds goes awry for Jack and Rebecca; and Randall, Kevin and Kate have life-changing Halloweens. The episode \u2014 which was made available to press ahead of time, and yes, I have watched it \u2014 takes us back to a Halloween when the Big Three were 10, and also 18 years later in the year 2008, when they\u2019re all 28.\n\nIt\u2019s in this 2008 flashback where we see Kevin struggling as an actor in Los Angeles. During the episode, Kevin\u2019s roommate at the time comes home from a day auditioning and excitedly shares that he\u2019s just booked a role on an upcoming Kevin Spacey movie.\n\nOut of all the actors This Is Us could have picked, they had to go with Kevin Spacey. Back in 2008, the actor had just wrapped a role as Lex Luthor in Superman Returns and was about to star in HBO\u2019s Recount, which earned him an Emmy and Golden Globe nomination. So talking about Spacey being an actor everyone wanted to collaborate with isn\u2019t such a far off idea \u2014 but 2008 seems like an eon ago.\n\nAnd now, following allegations that Spacey made sexual advances toward Anthony Rapp when Rapp was a minor (Spacey was 26, Rapp was 14), his prestigious star power has started to fall. TV Line was the first to report this Spacey edit; only one mention was made of Spacey, and it wasn\u2019t a big plot point of the episode. NBC and 20th Century Fox (the production companies behind the series) issued a statement to press who received the episode early, explaining:\n\n\"In light of recent events, the producers have decided to remove the brief reference to Kevin Spacey.\"\n\nSo once again, either This Is Us has some foresight they\u2019re not sharing with us, or the NBC series is just really good at making references.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/31/this-is-us.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/31/this-is-us.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/31/this-is-us.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paige"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/this-is-us-kevin-spacey-joke/", "title": "\"This Is Us\" has edited out a Kevin Space joke from tonight's episode", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The latest episode of \"This Is Us,\" titled \"The 20s,\" makes a very poorly timed Kevin Space joke.
