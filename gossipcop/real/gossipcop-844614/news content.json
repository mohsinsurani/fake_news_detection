His parents ran an acting and writing school out of their home, which influenced Roberts and his sisters Lisa and Julia Roberts to all become actors. Roberts' first big break came in 1976, when he was cast as Ted Bancroft on the soap opera Another World. He was later nominated for an Oscar for Runaway Train and more recently appeared in The Dark Knight and The Expendables.\n\nEarly Life Eric Roberts was born on April 18, 1956, in Biloxi, Mississippi, and was raised in Atlanta. He grew up immersed in the theater scene and was surrounded by actors. His mother and father ran a successful acting and writing school out of their home. His parents' livelihood had a great effect on him and his sisters, Julia and Lisa; all three would go on to become actors. Roberts developed a stutter as a child and found that the only time he could speak completely fluidly was when he memorized speeches and later delivered them. As a result, Roberts began participating in his parents' classes from a young age as a form of speech therapy. Roberts' first acting role came when he was a child. He was cast in a locally produced Sunday morning television show entitled The Little Pioneers. While Roberts was very close with his father, his parents divorced when he was a little boy and he subsequently became estranged from his mother because he disliked her new husband. His difficult childhood led him into substance abuse at a young age. Despite his difficult upbringing, Roberts continued to pursue acting. As a teenager he studied at the Royal Academy of Dramatic Art in London and later at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts in New York.\n\nCommercial Success Roberts' first big break came in 1976, when he was cast as Ted Bancroft on the soap opera Another World. He did not enjoy the job and turned to the stage instead, working off-Broadway. Soon after, Roberts was discovered by agent Bill Treusch, who helped the struggling actor land his first film role. Roberts appeared in the cult favorite King of the Gypsies, for which he earned a Golden Globe nomination, and then opposite Sissy Spacek in the 1981 film Raggedy Man.

As a result of his facial trauma there was a change in both Roberts' looks and subsequently the roles he was offered. He found himself playing villains, which led to a breakout performance in Bob Fosse's Star 80. By 1985 he was nominated for an Oscar for his role as Buck McGeehy in Runaway Train opposite Jon Voight. However, by the late 1980s Roberts' career began to consist of B-movies and direct-to-video releases. Roberts made a comeback in 1996, around the time when he gave up drugs, with the film It's My Party. The versatile actor has appeared in numerous films and television series. He has also earned small supporting parts in large blockbusters such as The Dark Knight and The Expendables.", "images": ["https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMzgxOTEwMDIwNzkzODk1/robert-redford-gettyimages-1186761501.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgwNDM3MjkzNzgwMTgyMTY2/gettyimages-107635904.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNjEyMDExODE5OTM1MjY4/gettyimages-1082526236.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTY3MzE1MjAxMDc0MzU3/gettyimages-1404884042.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMzgyNjk2ODA1MTE1NDMx/robert-downey-jr-gettyimages-1193444415.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE4MDAzNDEwMzI0NDU2OTc0/eric-harris-235982-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTIwNjA4NjM0MTcxNzIxMjI4/16th-annual-los-angeles-times-festival-of-books---day-2.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTM0MTQ5NzA3NDQxNzE5/navbarwhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgxMjk1ODI4NDgzMTg3ODE1/gettyimages-93746553.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgwMTU3NTMxMTUzMjQ1MzA2/gettyimages-51036852-copy.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzE2NjQyNzcyNDkx/6th-annual-toscar-awards.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgwNDgzMjUzNjg4MzQ2MDcz/gettyimages-670929930-copy.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTcwNjUwMjQzMTc5Njk2/gettyimages-1146332483.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTg1MzMxNzU3NzExNjMxOTk5/gettyimages-1026620082.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_458/MTQ1NTMzOTkyNDA0MjY0NTAz/sitelogowhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1280/MTY4Mjc5OTY4NzQ3ODg5ODI5/black-background.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTE5NTU2MzE2NjQyNzcyNDkx/6th-annual-toscar-awards.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzE2NjQyNzcyNDkx/6th-annual-toscar-awards.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Biography.Com Editors"], "canonical_link": "https://www.biography.com/actor/eric-roberts", "title": "Eric Roberts", "meta_data": {"author": "Biography.com Editors", "description": "Find out more about Eric Roberts's acting career, battle with drug addiction and relationship with sister Julia Roberts, at Biography.com.", "section": "Actors", "pagetype": "person", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "item-id": "ci01a87e1d86f3860f", "published": "2014-04-03T00:03:53Z", "modified": "2019-08-28T04:15:45Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "Biography and the Biography logo are registered trademarks of A&E Television Networks, LLC.", "dcterms.dateCopyrighted": 2022, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bio", "url": "https://www.biography.com/actor/eric-roberts", "image": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzE2NjQyNzcyNDkx/6th-annual-toscar-awards.jpg", "description": "Actor Eric Roberts, brother of actress Julia Roberts and father of actress Emma Roberts, is an Academy Award nominee and recently appeared in The Dark Knight.", "domain": "www.biography.com"}, "og": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.biography.com/actor/eric-roberts", "title": "Eric Roberts", "description": "Actor Eric Roberts, brother of actress Julia Roberts and father of actress Emma Roberts, is an Academy Award nominee and recently appeared in The Dark Knight.", "image": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzE2NjQyNzcyNDkx/6th-annual-toscar-awards.jpg", "site_name": "Biography"}, "fb": {"pages": 123492867697144, "app_id": 104784826244596}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Biography", "parsely-title": "Eric Roberts -
