When Karen & Co. went to visit an then-ailing Rosario in the hospital, Karen promised to throw her a quinceanera when she was discharged because Rosario\u2019s mother had never given her one.\n\nHowever, Rosario died in the hospital soon thereafter from complications and Karen then turned the funeral for her longtime sidekick into \u2014 yup \u2014 a quinceanera.\n\n\u201cWe knew that we weren\u2019t going to have Shelley anymore and so the character wasn\u2019t going to be on the show,\u201d co-creator Max Mutchnick tells The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cAs writers, it just presented us with a situation that was too interesting to not explore and to write.\u201d\n\nGiving Rosario a funeral also allowed the show a chance, as co-creator David Kohan put it, \u201cto give her a proper sendoff.\n\nThe creators, who also serve as showrunners, revealed in August that Morrison would not be returning for the revival after appearing in all eight seasons of the show\u2019s original run. During her 68-episode run, Morrison not only played Karen\u2019s maid and BFF but also Jack\u2019s (Sean Hayes) wife when they married to secure a green card in season two.\n\nAlthough Morrison appeared in the first cast reunion, the 2016 \u201cVote Honey\u201d video created to support Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign, she had otherwise retired from acting. Her last onscreen appearance was in a 2006 episode of My Name Is Earl that aired seven months after the Will & Grace series finale. She continued doing voiceover work until 2012.\n\nWhen it came to write Rosario out of the series, Mutchnick and Kohan said they told Morrison about their plans to kill Rosario off ahead of time.\n\n\u201cTo deal with Karen dealing with death and how that character would manage herself and how she would ultimately have a moment of truth in dealing with it \u2014 that was too rich of an area for us to not write and so we went for it,\u201d Mutchnick says. \u201cAs we suspected, Megan Mullally delivers a tour-de-force performance in this episode.\u201d\n\nThursday\u2019s episode also addressed the December 2016 death of Debbie Reynolds, who appeared in 10 episodes of the show\u2019s original run as Grace\u2019s mom, Bobbi Adler. Eagle-eyed viewers might have noticed Reynolds\u2019 appearance in previous episodes of the revival, specifically in a photo of her and Messing in character that was featured prominently in Will and Grace\u2019s apartment in the new episodes.\n\nThursday\u2019s episode revealed that Reynolds\u2019 character had passed away some time before the events of the revival. In Thursday\u2019s episode, Grace (Debra Messing) tried to console Karen by talking about her mother\u2019s death.\n\n\u201cI get what you\u2019re going through. When my mother died, I was a wreck. On the day of her funeral, my sister had to dress me. I couldn\u2019t even do my own blowout and I really wanted pretty hair for my mom, you know? But I made it and everyone said how brave I was and how pretty I looked and everyone said how proud they were of me,\u201d Grace said as she started to cry. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change how much it hurts.\u201d\n\nHowever, in the end it was Will (Eric McCormack), not Grace, who was able to get through to Karen with the simple act of a hug. Although Karen had missed nearly the whole funeral to drown her sorrows at a nearby bar, she went to the church and said an emotional goodbye to Rosario.\n\n\u201cSorry I wasn\u2019t here, but come on, what the hell was I going to say?\u201d Karen said. \u201cShe was my maid. She was my sparring partner. She was my best friend. You were my everything, Rosario Yolanda Salazar.\u201d\n\n\u201cPeople keep asking, \u2018What do you need? What do you need?\u2019 I need for you to not be gone,\u201d she continued as she gave Rosario a ring from her hand, a family heirloom that previously belonged to her mother.\n\n\u201cIt was actually a very emotional night and it was something that we took very seriously. There was a hush on the stage the two times that Megan delivered her goodbye to her best friend,\u201d Mutchnick recalls. \u201cIt was something that I will never forget and one of the best nights I\u2019ve ever had on the stage of making this show. It was an incredible thing to witness and highly emotional.\u201d\n\nWill & Grace airs Thursdays at 9 p.m. on NBC.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nup_179298_3184_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nup_179298_3184_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nup_179298_3184_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Stanhope"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/will-grace-season-9-rosario-dies-1053124/", "title": "\u2018Will & Grace\u2019 Creators Break Down That \u201cHighly Emotional\u201d Fan-Favorite Farewell", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The NBC revival addressed the absence of two beloved actresses who appeared on the show during its original run.", "news_keywords": "autoplay, David Kohan, Max Mutchnick, Will and Grace", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Kate Stanhope", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1053124, "title": "'Will & Grace' Creators Break Down That \"Highly Emotional\" Fan-Favorite Farewell", "published_at": "2017-11-02 18:30:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/nup_179298_3184_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Will and Grace", "topics": "TV News", "body": "[Warning: This story contains spoilers from Thursday's episode of Will & Grace, \"Rosario's Quinceanera.\"]\r\nWill & Grace said goodbye to one of its most beloved characters on Thursday.\r\nThursday's tearful episode of the revival saw the death of Karen's longtime maid Rosario (Shelley Morrison) following a heart attack.
