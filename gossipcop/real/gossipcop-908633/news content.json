In the Instagram caption, Daphne, who welcomed her third child in December, shares that there\u2019s no such thing as bouncing back.\n\n\"Seven weeks post-partum, still looking three months pregnant,\" she captioned a mirror selfie of herself in a black bra and underwear. \"There is no bounce-back, it's all onwards and upwards. Every day has moments of total splendor and also a decent number of WTFs. I especially want the new mamas out there to hear that, because we see so much of how glossy motherhood can be and not enough of how real 3D life is always complicated (and better for it).\"", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/5e9616fdd2a576586b9271ae?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(154,80)&quality=80", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b?ops=resize(900,506),quality(10)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b?ops=gravity(\"center\"),ratio(1,1),fit(190,190),quality(75)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/624492e2f83409bfcc81dbd6?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(128,44)&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2018-01-24-daphne-ozs-body-realness-7-weeks-after-giving-birth-no-bounce-back/", "title": "Daphne Oz\u2019s Body Realness 7 Weeks After Giving Birth: \u2018No Bounce-Back'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "title": "Daphne Oz\u2019s Body Realness 7 Weeks After Giving Birth: \u2018No Bounce-Back' | On Air with Ryan Seacrest | Ryan Seacrest", "description": "Read her honest, relatable PSA to new mamas:", "url": "https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2018-01-24-daphne-ozs-body-realness-7-weeks-after-giving-birth-no-bounce-back/", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "type": "article", "site_name": "Ryan Seacrest"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#17aae2", "twitter": {"title": "Daphne Oz\u2019s Body Realness 7 Weeks After Giving Birth: \u2018No Bounce-Back' | On Air with Ryan Seacrest | Ryan Seacrest", "description": "Read her honest, relatable PSA to new mamas:", "url": "https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2018-01-24-daphne-ozs-body-realness-7-weeks-after-giving-birth-no-bounce-back/", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@onairwithryan", "creator": "@onairwithryan", "domain": "onairwithryan.iheart.com", "tile": {"image": {"alt": "Read her honest, relatable PSA to new mamas:"}, "template": {"testing": 1}}, "": {"tile": {"image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)"}}}, "parsely-title": "Daphne Oz\u2019s Body Realness 7 Weeks After Giving Birth: \u2018No Bounce-Back' | On Air with Ryan Seacrest | Ryan Seacrest", "description": "Read her honest, relatable PSA to new mamas:", "keywords": "ryan, Ryan Seacrest, on-air, hollywood", "parsely-tags": "ryan, Ryan Seacrest, on-air, hollywood", "parsely-link": "https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2018-01-24-daphne-ozs-body-realness-7-weeks-after-giving-birth-no-bounce-back/", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5a68c5e2ec059840e34d1371?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "On Air with Ryan Seacrest", "fb": {"app_id": 1574631376170440, "pages": 24636146951}, "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://onairwithryan.iheart.com/featured/ryan-seacrest/content/2018-01-24-daphne-ozs-body-realness-7-weeks-after-giving-birth-no-bounce-back/", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-01-24T17:43:00Z", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "parsely-author": "Sierra Marquina", "parsely-section": "Headlines"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516752000.0, "source": "https://onairwithryan.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
