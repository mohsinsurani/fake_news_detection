E! News caught up with Metz, who talked about overcoming childhood abuse, learning to forgive those who hurt her and most of learning to love herself. The last two go hand in hand as she realized in order to have self-love she must not only forgive those who hurt her, like her stepfather but she also must forgive her self.\n\nI put it down for one second! @ChrissyMetz: tell your story, sing your song. Your positivity and inspiration is something we could all use a little more of these days.\n\n\n\nHonored to write for you, prouder to be your friend. #ThisIsMe pic.twitter.com/tG7wcZK7et \u2014 Dan Fogelman (@Dan_Fogelman) March 27, 2018\n\nTHETALKO VIDEO OF THE DAY\n\n\u201cI am not perfect and I am not screaming that from the mountain tops at all. It's more about being work in progress and being gentle and kind with yourself,\" she shared as she expressed learning to love herself is a contestant struggle for her.\n\nRELATED: KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN POSTS BODY-POSITIVE LOVE NOT TO HERSELF\n\nPart of learning how to self-love is also being uncomfortable and facing the scary truth, which is exactly what Metz did by writing her book.\n\n\u201cI think any time we have to verbalize the truth and or rehash it and be that vulnerable about what happened and then wonder what the reaction is going to be is very scary. I have to get used to being comfortable with being uncomfortable,\" the NBC star revealed.\n\nAnother way the actress is learning to love herself is by accepting her struggle with food and realizing there will be good days and bad days. It is no secret Metz has battled her weight her whole life, which was a basis of her stepfather\u2019s abuse.\n\n\u201cI definitely have great days and I have days that are I am like, 'Oh! Womp, womp' but I think that's when I get in my own head and I get in my own way,\" said Metz.\n\nChrissy Metz talks about self-love in her new memoir. As she continues to achieve success in her career, she shares her story about learning to forgive and love herself.
