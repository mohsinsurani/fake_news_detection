Shortly after rumors spread this morning claiming that the couple split and called off their wedding, the Hunger Games actor posted a video with Cyrus on his Instagram story, proving they're still going strong.\n\nThe couple doesn't explicitly address the split gossip in the clip. Instead, they show themselves dancing and getting silly in the car. Miley films a selfie video of them grooving to the music until Liam screams and scares her.\n\n\"I'm gonna beat the sh\u2014,\" she jokingly threatens in response to his prank. He just smiles and says, \"Number one!\" to the camera.\n\n\n\n\n\nThe clip is a candid, intimate, and sweet portrait of their relationship that says, \"See? Everything's normal!\"\n\n\n\nFans have seen Hemsworth pull that stunt on Cyrus before. This spring, Miley posted a selfie video from the front seat where she and Liam are dancing in the front seat during a drive\u2014but then he shouts, \"Oh sh*t!\" and causes her to drop her phone.\n\nAnd back in 2016, the duo was singing along to Justin Bieber's \"Love Yourself\" during a ride with their beagle, but Liam interrupted that sweet moment with another shouting prank too. Miley reprimands him, \"Babe, stop, seriously!\"\n\nBefore today's Instagram video, there was already one solid piece of evidence that Cyrus and Hemsworth were still together, despite the breakup rumors: one fan spotted the couple landing in the Nashville airport yesterday.\n\nWe've had enough celebrity breakups in 2018; thankfully we don't have to add this one to the list.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2478974-012-1665067784.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miley-liam-instagram-video-1532026738.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-liam-hemsworth-miley-cyrus-861007068-1532026991.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-on-september-26-news-photo-1665065585.jpg?crop=0.941xw:1.00xh;0.0304xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665155826.jpg?crop=0.984xw:1.00xh;0.00962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2479931-003-1665162992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0192xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665151779.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-arriving-for-lunch-at-the-abbey-of-san-news-photo-1665070515.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0551xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-and-gisele-b-c3-bcndchen-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1664907170.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-del-castillo-teresa-mendoza-lrds3-tlmd-2-1664910940.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0566xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miley-liam-instagram-video-1532026738.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22478538/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-breakup-rumors-instagram-video/", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Shut Down Breakup Rumors with an Adorable Instagram Video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Shut Down Breakup Rumors with an Adorable Instagram Video", "description": "This is so sweet.", "keywords": "liam hemsworth, miley cyrus, miley cyrus and liam breakup, miley cyrus breakup, miley cyrus and liam hemsworth breakup, miley cyrus instagram, liam hemsworth instagram", "theme-color": "#000000", "og": {"site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth Just Shut Down Breakup Rumors with an Adorable Instagram Video", "description": "This is so sweet.", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miley-liam-instagram-video-1532026738.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22478538/miley-cyrus-liam-hemsworth-breakup-rumors-instagram-video/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "section": "Celebrity News", "modified_time": "2021-11-02T00:40:32Z", "published_time": "2018-07-19T19:48:00Z"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miley-liam-instagram-video-1532026738.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miley-liam-instagram-video-1532026738.jpg?crop=0.439xw:0.878xh;0,0.122xh&resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miley-liam-instagram-video-1532026738.jpg?crop=0.439xw:0.878xh;0,0.122xh&resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miley-liam-instagram-video-1532026738.jpg?crop=0.439xw:0.878xh;0,0.122xh", "auto-publish": "timely", "sailthru.excerpt": "Miley Cyrus and Liam Hemsworth want you to know that everything is fine.
