And as with any New Year, this one comes as a blank slate ready to be filled with possibilities, resolutions, and brand new memories. And the fact that this year marks the beginning of a brand new decade makes everything that more exciting. Not only does the past feel unimportant, but now the future feels filled with endless possibilities. The end of 2019 and the beginning of 2020 gave people around the world a reason to celebrate. And whether your mode of celebration was staying in with a cup of hot cocoa, or dancing your butt off until the crack of dawn, know that there is no one right way to ring in the New Year.\n\nAnd if, by this point, you\u2019re still too busy fighting off your New Year\u2019s Eve hangover to be thinking about 2020 goals, know you\u2019re not alone. As the old saying goes, stars are just like us, and they too spent January 31st in various states of drunkenness. Thankfully, Instagram is here to help us spy on our favorite stars and see how they celebrated the beginning of a new decade. Read on to see how your favorite Latino celebs celebrated the New Year!\n\n1. Mariah Carey spent her New Year\u2019s in the Dominican Republic.\n\nAfter a super-eventful holiday season, Mimi was getting some much-needed R&R in Punta Cana. We wonder if this was before or after her Twitter account was unceremoniously hacked by a mischievous troll\u2026\n\n2. Salma Hayek and Zoe Saldana rang in the New Year together furthering their BFF goals status.\n\nWe have to admit, we suffered from FOMO seeing these two have fun together. But, we love seeing strong Latinas celebrate their friendship together! Salma Hayek shared this adorable video of herself and Saldana counting down to the stroke of midnight with their respective husbands. So cute!\n\n3. Thalia spent hers partying in Miami.\n\nLeave it to Thalia to dance the night away after all these years. Her zest for life puts us all to shame!\n\n4. Sofia Vergara spent her New Year\u2019s Eve in a tropical paradise.\n\nNot only was Vergara surrounded by the sun and the sand, she also was surrounded by her hunky husband, Joe Manganiello.\n\n5. Eva Longoria spent time with friends and family in Cabo.\n\nLongoria rang in the New Year with her new baby in Cabo. If you\u2019re interested in seeing more, her Instagram feed is chock-full of photos documenting her super-fun vacation during the holidays.\n\n6. Maluma spent his snowboarding.\n\nWhile some people chose to spend the New Year on the beach, Maluma opted for a snowier location. Sure, we wouldn\u2019t have minded seeing him lounging on the beach without his shirt, but he looks super cute in snow gear anyway.\n\n7. Wilmer Valderrama spent his New Year\u2026getting engaged.\n\nNot one to be out-shone by the turn of the decade, Valderrama proposed to his girlfriend of eight months, model Amanda Pacheco, on January 1st.\n\n8. America Ferrera announced her pregnancy.\n\nAmerica Ferrera took the New Year as an opportunity to announce that she\u2019s expecting her second child with husband Ryan Piers Williams.\n\n9. Ana de Armas spent it with friends in Cuba.\n\nThe \u201cKnives Out\u201d actress and upcoming Bond girl spent New Years Eve in her home country.\n\n10.
