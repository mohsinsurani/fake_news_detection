And the two brought the best out of each other, because not only is Jennifer Jason Leigh stupendously compelling as the captured fugitive Daisy Domergue, but Quentin Tarantino clearly enjoys putting her in increasingly violent and gory situations.\n\nBecause of the brutal way that her character is treated in The Hateful Eight, The Hollywood Reporter decided to ask Jennifer Jason Leigh for her thoughts on whether Quentin Tarantino is a misogynist. And she was rather emphatic with her response:\n\nHe's about the most un-misogynistic person I've ever met. He loves women. He writes the best parts for women around, really.\n\nCalls of misogyny against Quentin Tarantino are a tad perplexing, considering some of the iconic roles that he has created for women. Sure, women are reduced to bit-parts in Reservoir Dogs, but Pulp Fiction\u2019s promotional campaign was mostly built around the iconic image of Uma Thurman\u2019s Mia Wallace wearing black, laying on a bed, and seductively smoking a cigarette.\n\nQuentin Tarantino then followed this up with four films that were each led by women too, with Jackie Brown, Kill Bill: Volume 1, Kill Bill: Volume 2, and Death Proof. In each of these films the female characters were written in a strong, complex and original style.\n\nIn fact, over the last two decades Quentin Tarantino has probably been the most prolific director for giving women leading roles in mainstream American cinema. OK, they might get themselves into some scraps along the way, but that\u2019s always going to be the case since Quentin Tarantino\u2019s film worlds consist of heavy amounts of violence.\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh\u2019s Daisy Domergue is the victim of some particular abuse, especially from Kurt Russell\u2019s John Ruth \"The Hangman,\" but that\u2019s only par for the course with The Hateful Eight\u2019s story. And Leigh\u2019s reactions and performance in response to this abuse are either outrageous or shocking, and always entertaining. In fact, she\u2019s so scene-stealingly fantastic in The Hateful Eight that she rivals Samuel L. Jackson for its star performer. It's not just those two who excel though, as everyone in The Hateful Eight is superb.\n\nJennifer Jason Leigh didn\u2019t stop there with her praise for Quentin Tarantino though, because when she was asked to praise the filmmaker in just three words in the same interview she called him a \"genius\" as well as \"enthusiastic\" and then insisted that he was \"loving\" too. You\u2019ll get to experience their lovein' yourself when The Hateful Eight is finally released on Christmas Day.", "images": ["https://www.cinemablend.com/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbLt5x6r3q2QtL23xXmjeh-1200-80.jpg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbLt5x6r3q2QtL23xXmjeh-320-80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbLt5x6r3q2QtL23xXmjeh-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gregory Wakeman", "Window.Slicecomponents", "Window.Reliabledomcontentloaded.Then", "Var Componentcontainer", "Document.Queryselector", "Slice-Container-Authorbio", "If Componentcontainer", "Var Data", "Layout", "Default"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Quentin-Tarantino-Absolutely-Doesn-t-Hate-Women-According-His-Leading-Lady-99637.html", "title": "Quentin Tarantino Absolutely Doesn't Hate Women, According To His Leading Lady", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2015-12-11T22:27:20+00:00", "description": "Jennifer Jason Leigh has leapt to the defense of Quentin Tarantino after being asked whether the director is a misogynist.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,noindex", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/tbhqzd9bso1619422461.png", "og": {"site_name": "CINEMABLEND", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbLt5x6r3q2QtL23xXmjeh-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "title": "Quentin Tarantino Absolutely Doesn't Hate Women, According To His Leading Lady", "url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Quentin-Tarantino-Absolutely-Doesn-t-Hate-Women-According-His-Leading-Lady-99637.html"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cinemablendnews/", "published_time": "2015-12-11T22:27:20Z", "modified_time": "2015-12-11T22:27:20Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "4eEtkoADb1A1VYxw7UJT2Q", "parsely-pub-date": "2015-12-11T22:27:20Z", "parsely-title": "Quentin Tarantino Absolutely Doesn't Hate Women, According To His Leading Lady", "parsely-link": "https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Quentin-Tarantino-Absolutely-Doesn-t-Hate-Women-According-His-Leading-Lady-99637.html", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbLt5x6r3q2QtL23xXmjeh.jpg", "parsely-section": "Movies", "parsely-tags": "Category: Movies,Category: News,Pulp Fiction,kill bill,Pulp Fiction,The Hateful Eight,exclude-from-homepage,van-exclude-latest,no-index,serversidehawk,videoarticle", "parsely-author": "Gregory Wakeman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cinemablend", "title": "Quentin Tarantino Absolutely Doesn't Hate Women, According To His Leading Lady", "creator": "@cinemablend", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/YbLt5x6r3q2QtL23xXmjeh-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 9696142}, "google-site-verification": "Oo3uNFWgI6psN58Pjx7Zjo3yYih1rOwQViWbItBCpyo", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.cinemablend.com/new/Quentin-Tarantino-Absolutely-Doesn-t-Hate-Women-According-His-Leading-Lady-99637.html"}, "botify-site-verification": "2pzcQZFibLjk9GJgSZgweA8MU9al6utA", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1449872840.0, "source": "https://www.cinemablend.com", "summary": ""}
