A series of Boomerangs captured the children jumping off rocks into the water and floating along with the stream. Out of the water, they had a blast burying themselves in the sand and riding ATVs.\n\nStefani, donning a green tank top and reflective aviator-style shades, also made sure to share a selfie. She even appears to have captured Shelton in the wilderness despite his camo attire.\n\nAlong for the fun was Stefani\u2019s goddaughter Stella, who proved to be a model in the making while posing for a shot on the singer\u2019s Instagram page wearing camo overalls.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

The family has spent holidays like Thanksgiving and Christmas out in the country.\n\nIn her cover story for Marie Claire\u2019s Holiday 2017 issue, the pop star said that things can get pretty dirty when she spends time at Shelton\u2019s Oklahoma ranch.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very tribal,\u201d she said. \u201cBlake has a sister, she comes with her kids. We cook and get muddy and dirty. There are ATVs. Being a mother of three boys, it\u2019s kind of the perfect place. Everything is real now, whereas before, things didn\u2019t seem so real.\u201d\n\nThe adorable couple have recently been apart while Shelton traveled as part of the Country Music Freaks tour.\n\n\u201cMissing being a girlfriend on tour w this country boy,\u201d Stefani captioned a selfie on her Instagram story earlier this month. Shortly after, she posted the same image to her Instagram with a caption offering Shelton encouragement before his concert in Houston. \u201cHave a good show tonight we r missing u in L.A,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Blake Shelton\u2019s Story of Falling in Love with Gwen Stefani Will Make You Swoon\n\nThe reigning Sexiest Man Alive Shelton opened up to PEOPLE in November about his love for his fellow Voice coach\u2019s sons.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s days where you go, \u2018Oh my God, when does school start?\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAn hour later you\u2019re going, \u2018God, I can\u2019t wait \u2019til they get home.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re so damn funny,\u201d added the country singer. \u201cIt\u2019s just my first time being around it, and it\u2019s easy to fall in love with those kids. They\u2019re pretty special.\u201d", "images":
