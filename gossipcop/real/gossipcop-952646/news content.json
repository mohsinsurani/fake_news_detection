HBO has a longstanding relationship with SDCC, and we are very grateful for the fans' enthusiastic response over the years. We look forward to returning in the future.\"\n\nHBO has offered a \"Game of Thrones\" panel every year since the show's premiere. Skipping it now, ahead of the launch of the show's eighth and final season in 2019, seems more than a little anti-climactic. And while \"Westworld\" only made its Comic-Con debut last year, it seemed by all accounts poised for another buzzy panel in 2018, following all of its season two shakeups.\n\nOf course, HBO isn't the only notable name that won't be presenting a panel in Hall H this year: Marvel is also passing on that noteworthy annual event, instead simply offering fans a floor exhibit honoring 10 years of the MCU. But according to Deadline, HBO won't even be doing that, skipping any sort of Comic-Con presence entirely (and that includes a rumored sneak peek at one of the potential \"Thrones\" spinoffs). Bummer.\n\nRegardless of those glaring absences, Comic-Con will be overflowing with other offerings -- more information can be found here. The event runs from July 19 through July 22.\n\n[via: Deadline]", "images": ["https://d2j1wkp1bavyfs.cloudfront.net/legacy/assets/mf-no-image-horizontal-1020x510.jpg?q=80", "https://cdn.moviefone.com/legacy/assets/mf-mih-header-icon.png", "https://d2j1wkp1bavyfs.cloudfront.net/legacy/assets/x.gif", "https://d2j1wkp1bavyfs.cloudfront.net/legacy/assets/mf-no-poster-available-v3.gif", "https://d2j1wkp1bavyfs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/legacy/posts/195674ec-509d-4f64-8c90-ea05d553f3ce.jpg?q=80", "https://d2j1wkp1bavyfs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/legacy/posts/195674ec-509d-4f64-8c90-ea05d553f3ce.jpg?q=50"], "top_img": "https://d2j1wkp1bavyfs.cloudfront.net/wp-content/legacy/posts/195674ec-509d-4f64-8c90-ea05d553f3ce.jpg?q=50", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Roberts", "Freelance Writer", "Katie Nowak Roberts Is A Freelance Writer", "Pop Culture Junkie Based In Rochester", "New York.
