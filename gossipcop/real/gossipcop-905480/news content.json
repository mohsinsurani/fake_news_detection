News, revealing that he still has a \"great relationship\" with the \"Fergalicious\" singer.\n\n\"All we want is the best for our son, so it's a bit of a juggling act.\"\n\nFergie and Josh Duhamel may have separated romantically, but their priorities remain the same.\n\nDuhamel recently opened up about their co-parenting style in an interview with E! News, revealing that he still has a \"great relationship\" with his ex. He also praised the \"Fergalicious\" singer, calling her a \"great mother.\"\n\n\"It's going really well,\" Duhamel said. \"All we want is the best for our son, so it's a bit of a juggling act but we're both grown ups who can handle a lot. And he's happy. That's the main thing.\"\n\nThe former couple shares a 4-year-old son, Axl. They were together for 13 years before announcing their split in September.\n\nSanta baby \ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffb\ud83c\udf85\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude02\ud83d\ude02 A post shared by Fergie (@fergie) on Dec 24, 2016 at 5:24pm PST Dec 24, 2016 at 5:24pm PST\n\nFergie echoed Duhamel's sentiments in multiple post-breakup interviews. In September, she revealed to Entertainment Tonight that although the two are \"not a romantic couple anymore,\" they still prioritize their son and family dynamic.\n\n\"We are still Axl's parents through and through, and our families \u2014 each other's families, the cousins, my nieces and nephews \u2014 it's all the same,\" she said. \"Our families are families together and that cannot change.\"\n\nmy boyz r hangin loose, while im rock n rollin A post shared by Fergie (@fergie) on Jan 11, 2017 at 10:13pm PST Jan 11, 2017 at 10:13pm PST\n\nDuhamel has also spoken openly about Fergie's parenting prowess before. The \"Unsolved\" star discussed their \"questionable parenting decisions\" on Ellen DeGeneres' talk show back in June.\n\n\"I have no idea what I'm doing half the time. She's definitely more evolved than I am and more patient,\" he told DeGeneres. \"I'm just doing the best I can and trying not to screw him up for life.\"\n\nCo-parenting is a difficult but noble task for many couples. We applaud Duhamel and Fergie for their honesty and commitment to Axl's happiness.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["https://i.insider.com/5a577ae0402764ec008b457a?width=700", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://i.insider.com/5a5774794027647d008b4657?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a7204a6ec1ade2da01889a0?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a5774794027647d008b4657?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Callie Ahlgrim"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/josh-duhamel-fergie-co-parenting-divorce2018-1", "title": "Josh Duhamel called co-parenting with Fergie a 'juggling act' in first interview since their divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Josh Duhamel called co-parenting with Fergie a 'juggling act' in first interview since their divorce", "datePublished": "2018-01-11T15:45:21Z", "dateModified": "2018-01-11T15:45:24Z", "news_keywords": "Relationships, Parenting, Celebrities, Health, Wellness, Culture, Callie Ahlgrim", "description": "Josh Duhamel and Fergie were together for 13 years before announcing their split in September.
