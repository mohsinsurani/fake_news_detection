I think it would make her life,\u201d Brie, 34, says, adding that when she had discussed the prospect of Nikki\u2019s dad walking her down the aisle, their mother \u201ckind of got a bit of attitude\u201d about it.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s my wedding, though,\u201d Nikki noted, as she pointed out that the \u201cbig\u201d and \u201cvery emotional decision\u201d was up to her.\n\nMeanwhile, her fianc\u00e9 John Cena thinks that instead of her father or JJ walking her down the aisle, it should be her sister Brie.\n\n\u201cYou asked my opinion, so I\u2019m giving it to you,\u201d he says. \u201cI know traditionally it is the father, but I guess I don\u2019t think traditionally like that.\u201d\n\nWeighing in on the matter in a confessional, Bella explains part of the reason for her indecision, saying, \u201cto think of the relationship I have with my father and other male relationships I have, I just feel so confused.\u201d\n\nShe also adds that while \u201cthere\u2019s a part of me that wants to get married\u201d there\u2019s also \u201ca part of me that just wants to be alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI just feel like this wedding turns into what everyone else wants but me,\u201d Nikki later tells her sister Brie.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want this whole thing to turn into like, \u2018Who\u2019s going to walk Nicole down the aisle?\u2019 As if it\u2019s like some game show,\u201d she continues, adding that she hasn\u2019t made up her mind and everybody\u2019s suggestions are still on the table.\n\nJamie McCarthy/WireImage\n\nAfter calling off their engagement in April, just three weeks before their May 5 wedding date, PEOPLE confirmed earlier this month the couple is back together. Sources previously told PEOPLE that her decision to call it quits was due to their differing stances on marriage and having kids.\n\nEarlier this month, Cena also publicly confirmed that after years of insisting he had no desire to start a family, he\u2019d had a change of heart, and vowed to get his vasectomy reversed.\n\nHowever, there may still be trouble ahead: PEOPLE\u2019s exclusive look at the rest of the season showed Bella questioning if she needed to call off the wedding again due to \u201cdeeper problems.\u201d\n\n\n\nTotal Bellas airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
