He has a lot of responsibilities and he thought it best to go away for a while and get help,\" a source told the publication.\n\nExpand Close Irish actors Colin Farrell (pictured) and Saoirse Ronan were among the guests at the ninth annual Governors Awards in Los Angeles at the weekend Photo: Getty / Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsapp Irish actors Colin Farrell (pictured) and Saoirse Ronan were among the guests at the ninth annual Governors Awards in Los Angeles at the weekend Photo: Getty\n\nHe has not been drinking again, but went to a treatment facility for a break.\n\nFarrell has enjoyed a successful second chapter in his career, recently embracing more independent films over the big budget blockbusters that made him a household name in the noughties. Last year alone, he starred in The Killing of a Sacred Deer, The Beguiled and Roman J. Israel, Esq.\n\nThe Castleknock native previously said he was \"out of control\" with alcohol and drugs when he first entered rehab in 2006, after Miami Vice wrapped filming, saying: \"Basically, I'd been fairly drunk or high since I was 14, so it was a tough life change, and I was dying. I'm one of the lucky ones.\"\n\nLast year, in an interview with the Sunday Independent, he was committed to maintaining his sobriety and reflected on his life-changing decision to give up drugs and alcohol 12 years ago.\n\nExpand Close Killer performances: Barry Keoghan and Colin Farrell are excellent in The Killing Of A Sacred Deer / Facebook\n\nTwitter\n\nEmail\n\nWhatsapp Killer performances: Barry Keoghan and Colin Farrell are excellent in The Killing Of A Sacred Deer\n\n\"I had just had it, man. I was done. For a long time I put the brakes on. For a long time. I could go mad for three, six months, and then I could pull back for a few months to try to re-enter the atmosphere. I couldn't find the handbrake,\" he said.\n\nHe later said his mother had \"the best sleep she's had in 15 years\" when he completed treatment.", "images":
