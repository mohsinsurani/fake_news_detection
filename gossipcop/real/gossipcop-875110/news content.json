home an industry-leading pretax paycheck of $239 million in the calendar year between June 1, 2017 and June 1, 2018, Forbes reported.\n\nThough he didn't appear in a film during that period, Clooney brought in his career-high salary on the strength of the $700 million sale of his tequila brand, Casamigos Tequila, in June 2017.\n\nHe was followed on Forbes' list by Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson, Robert Downey Jr., and seven other actors.\n\nForbes said that its pretax earnings estimates are \"based on data from Nielsen, ComScore, Box Office Mojo and IMDB, as well as interviews with industry insiders.\"\n\nHere are the ten highest-paid actors in the world, according to Forbes:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E",
