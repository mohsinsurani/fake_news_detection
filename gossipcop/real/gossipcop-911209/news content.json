I would have no problem with my son kissing me like that.\u201d\n\nThis is not the first time people have taken issue with Mr. Brady\u2019s shows of affection, the Atlanta Journal-Constitution noted. He sparked controversy last year after he was photographed kissing his father on the lips after his Super Bowl win against the Atlanta Falcons.", "images":
