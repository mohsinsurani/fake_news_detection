The sprawling hilltop home will serve as the backdrop for the couple's upcoming reality-TV show, \"Very Cavallari,\" premiering on E! on July 8.\n\nThe superstylish mansion offers seven bedrooms, seven full baths, and three half bathrooms spread across just under 20,000 square feet. Built in 2007, the Mediterranean-style villa sits on 8.5 wooded acres, offering seclusion as well as breathtaking views. The duo purchased the home in 2012 for $5.3 million.\n\nExterior realtor.com\n\nFamily realtor.com\n\nKitchen\n\nLibrary realtor.com\n\nMaster bed realtor.com\n\nMaster bath realtor.com\n\nWine cellar realtor.com\n\nIt's been seven years since Cavallari was reality-TV royalty, thanks to her starring role on \"The Hills.\" Now that she is a wife and mother, her new show chronicles all the behind-the-scenes drama of her latest venture, a lifestyle and jewelry brand based in Nashville called Uncommon James.\n\nAcross all of its massive 25 rooms, the estate reflects the brand's style\u2014just a little bit rustic, while remaining cool and refined.\n\nThe show's trailer features the celeb couple at home in the mansion.\n\nCutler and Cavallari were married five years ago and have three children. After Cutler was released by the Chicago Bears after eight seasons with the team, the family settled in Nashville. The couple were thrown for a bit of a loop with the sale of their Chicago-area home. Listed for $4.75 million in June 2017, the Illinois home sold in November for $3.6 million.\n\nNo word on why Cutler and Cavallari have decided to sell their Nashville digs, but according to the Tennessean, they plan to relocate to another home in the area. Perhaps after being featured on their series, the couple is concerned about security.\n\n\u201cThis house has a lot to offer,\u201d Cutler told the Tennessean. \u201cWe have a lot of memories in that house, and we will miss it. We got married and had three children since we have owned that house, so it\u2019s been a huge part of our life, and hopefully someone will enjoy it as much as we have.\u201d\n\nWith a new home on the horizon, it sounds as if the team at Uncommon James are about to get a whole new project.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/82613788/c7c0d1121cf62eb7e0bbc443430c2e9dw-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/1555559345/1dd032edd2a556a9e449b7b3a9fb868dw-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/480819640/65dbceed1640e056b51082a6a7592ddew-c0xd-w300_h169_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://assets-jpcust.jwpsrv.com/thumbs/GeF6jtEw-320.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/1703679362/cde543dbf3779e8e91cf728db5a6e8e2w-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=156626651472275&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/363859857/a08565e515fc93a6f1b77cd30b909441w-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/320073995/8ecb8b5c10a19ccbe1daba7bc38ec77cw-c334918xd-w300_h169_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/652616499/45ede2e96b1078a874008bf3bd5cec32w-c0xd-w300_h169_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://rdcnewscdn.realtor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jay-Cutler-and-Kristin-Cavalleri-1024x576.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/kristin-cavallari-jay-cutler-nashville/", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/616080492/f6dcc35dbd342bc9c2eb7515296faf3bw-c0xd-w300_h169_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/173575770/ecb99ea3e98c0e07f804c22165b22b40w-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/1618444759/084d1f6b48784ccf9010e1b2e885d4ebw-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/119730176/4374c644f2370d72e87a465a4780d1f7w-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://na.rdcpix.com/1574276032/547a6644d440c607101c857888e6bbc3w-c0xd-w685_h860_q80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://rdcnewscdn.realtor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jay-Cutler-and-Kristin-Cavalleri-1024x576.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Becky Bracken"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902/https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/kristin-cavallari-jay-cutler-nashville/", "title": "Kristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler Selling $7.9M Nashville Home Featured in Upcoming Reality Show", "meta_data": {"google-play-app": "app-id=com.move.realtor", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "theme-color": "#d92228", "description": "Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler and reality-TV star Kristin Cavallari\u00a0are selling their massive estate in Nashville for just under $8 million.", "fb": {"pages": 35368227870}, "csrf-param": "authenticity_token", "csrf-token": "0wPIM56rMSJMcFoM0HjUDIXyx9DYCK0XRHYmyUuvXZoWQasK4mvpWuMyHSpP41HdpD3QH5L/QKJTF/xZY8U/ug==", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902/https://www.realtor.com/news/celebrity-real-estate/kristin-cavallari-jay-cutler-nashville/", "title": "Kristin Cavallari and Jay Cutler Selling $7.9M Nashville Home Featured in Upcoming Reality Show", "description": "Former NFL quarterback Jay Cutler and reality-TV star Kristin Cavallari\u00a0are selling their massive estate in Nashville for just under $8 million.", "site_name": "Real Estate News and Advice | Realtor.com\u00ae", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180709170902im_/https://rdcnewscdn.realtor.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Jay-Cutler-and-Kristin-Cavalleri-1024x576.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "updated_time": "2018-07-07T00:17:21+00:00"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/realtor.com", "tag": "Nashville TN,NFL,Professional Athlete Homes,Tennessee", "section": "Celebrity Real Estate", "published_time": "2018-07-09T14:00:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-07T00:17:21+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@realtordotcom", "creator": "@realtordotcom", "domain": "Real Estate News and Advice -
