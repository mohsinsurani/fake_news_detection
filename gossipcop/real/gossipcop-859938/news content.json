Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is pregnant and expecting her first child with her boyfriend, Tristan Thompson, multiple sources confirm exclusively to Us Weekly.\n\nThe Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 33, and Thompson, 26, began dating in September 2016 after meeting on a blind date set up by one of her friends. \u201cI\u2019m in the best relationship I\u2019ve ever been in and it doesn\u2019t take a ring for me to feel that way,\u201d she gushed in a recent interview with You magazine, shutting down engagement rumors.\n\n\u201cMy boyfriend is very protective of me,\u201d she continued. \u201cFeeling loved and validated and secure is a huge thing. Tristan is protective of my entire family, which is beautiful. And I love that everything we do is as a union. When he speaks, it\u2019s \u2018us\u2019 and \u2018we,\u2019 and that\u2019s important because it shows that you\u2019re sharing life.\u201d\n\nEvery Athlete & Rapper Khloe Kardashian Has Dated\n\nKardashian joked on the season 13 finale of KUWTK in June that her beau would like to have enough children to start his own basketball team. \u201cHe wants to have, like, five or six kids with me, and that\u2019s lovely,\u201d she said of the Cleveland Cavaliers center. \u201cWe could start at one and then grow from there. But now, knowing I\u2019m not on birth control, it\u2019s really scary. It\u2019s like a really big step.\u201d\n\nDespite her fears, the Good American designer has repeatedly stated through the years that she\u2019d like to start a family of her own. \u201cShe definitely wants a big family,\u201d a source exclusively told Us in April. \u201cShe wants multiple kids!\u201d\n\nAnd absence makes the heart grow fonder. \u201cShe flies [to Cleveland] to see [Thompson] almost every week,\u201d a source told Us of the couple\u2019s long-distance romance. \u201cThings are going really well. The relationship is very serious.\u201d\n\nKardashian and Thompson\u2019s relationship began while she was still legally married to Lamar Odom, her husband of seven years, though she split from the former NBA player, 37, in late 2013. Meanwhile, Thompson shares a 9-month-old son, Prince, with his ex-girlfriend Jordan Craig.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 isn\u2019t the only expectant member of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. Kim Kardashian and husband Kanye West are expecting their third bundle of joy via surrogate, and Kylie Jenner is pregnant with her first child with boyfriend Travis Scott.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-4ec23808-7e06-4480-96da-dcb69889be9b.jpg?crop=46px%2C0px%2C1341px%2C705px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-4ec23808-7e06-4480-96da-dcb69889be9b.jpg?crop=46px%2C0px%2C1341px%2C705px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/is-khloe-kardashian-pregnant-with-tristan-thompsons-baby-w501625/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Pregnant With Tristan Thompson's Baby", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Khloe Kardashian is pregnant and expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, multiple sources exclusively confirm to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Is Pregnant, Expecting First Child With Tristan Thompson", "description": "Khloe Kardashian is pregnant and expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, multiple sources exclusively confirm to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details!", "url": "/celebrity-moms/news/is-khloe-kardashian-pregnant-with-tristan-thompsons-baby-w501625/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2019-05-16T17:38:53+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-4ec23808-7e06-4480-96da-dcb69889be9b.jpg?crop=46px%2C0px%2C1341px%2C705px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-4ec23808-7e06-4480-96da-dcb69889be9b.jpg?crop=46px%2C0px%2C1341px%2C705px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-09-26T21:25:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-05-16T17:38:53+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Is Pregnant, Expecting First Child With Tristan Thompson", "description": "Khloe Kardashian is pregnant and expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, multiple sources exclusively confirm to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/khloe-kardashian-tristan-thompson-4ec23808-7e06-4480-96da-dcb69889be9b.jpg?crop=46px%2C0px%2C1341px%2C705px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506461100.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
