The actress, 43, is blissed out as Ryan Gosling\u2019s leading lady; the mom of Esmeralda, 2, and Amada, 11 months; and the successful head of a fashion line, the Eva Mendes Collection at New York & Company, and a beauty brand, Circa. She\u2019s also savoring her role as Ryan\u2019s rock behind the scenes as he hits the awards circuit for La La Land. \u201cWhat people don\u2019t know about me is that I love being home,\u201d Eva says. \u201cInstead of hitting the red carpet, I\u2019d rather be with our girls.\u201d\n\nAnother thing Eva relishes is ex\u00ad\u00ader\u00ad\u00adcise, and that too is evident in her strong body and beautiful skin. \"Working out allows me to spend time on myself,\" she says. \u201cKnowing that I have an hour to dedicate to my wellness is a priority for me now.\" She tries to eat \u201cas clean as possible\u201d but also digs into her favorite indulgences with gusto. One of Eva\u2019s top treats: Cadbury eggs. \u201cThe mini ones and the big ones with the filling,\u201d she says. And then there\u2019s her mother\u2019s delicious Cuban cooking. \u201cMy mom makes the best black beans in the world,\u201d she says. \"I'll never stop devouring them.\"\n\nListen in as Eva expands on the life philosophies that keep her healthy and radiantly happy.\n\nBelieve in finding the One...workout\n\n\"I love doing intervals, like running and sprinting, and I see great results with that versus the 30 or 45 minutes of steady cardio I used to do on the treadmill. Between intervals, I lift weights. Right now I\u2019m sticking to light weights because I have a herniated disc in my lower back. It\u2019s pretty severe, and I have to work around it. I love squats, but I\u2019ve been told that I have to do lunges instead of squats for the time being. I know a lot of people wouldn\u2019t find that heartbreaking, but I really do!\n\n\"I\u2019m off-season right now, so I work out three days a week. But when I\u2019m getting ready for an event or in the summer, it\u2019s five days a week. I don\u2019t exercise more than that though, because I see better results when my body has a rest period.\"\n\nThere are perks to everything\u2014you just have to look\n\n\"In some ways, it\u2019s been more challenging to get back in shape after my second daughter. Yet it\u2019s not as hard as I thought it would be, because I\u2019m always running around with the kids. I never sit down\u2014I\u2019m on the move all day. And I don\u2019t keep junk food at home anymore, because I\u2019m trying to set a good example. So there are no more Krispy Kremes for me to grab. But there is this app called Postmates that delivers whatever you want in minutes. It\u2019s almost as bad as having the food in your kitchen. Don\u2019t laugh, but they\u2019re on the way here right now!\"\n\nRely on tricks to look lit\n\n\"For me, glowing skin comes from the inside. I start to get sallow if I\u2019m not eating well. I take fish oil supplements. And I love coconut oil. I apply it to my face. That\u2019s my go-to. I also drink a lot of water. I always keep a bottle with me and kind of force myself to drink. My skin just looks better when I\u2019m hydrated.\n\n\"I wear makeup every day. Typically, it\u2019s minimal\u2014a little eyeliner, lip liner and balm, and some concealer. It takes me about five minutes to apply it. But when I get ready for an event or a dinner, I do like to take my time putting my makeup on. To me, the process of getting ready can be really, really romantic. It takes me probably 45 minutes because I go very slow.\n\n\"I\u2019ve learned some very good makeup tricks too, like how important it is to work with your face shape. Because I have a long face, my makeup artist taught me to swipe blush across one cheek and lightly over the nose, then over the other cheek to help break up the length a bit. Another great tip to try: Add some illumination to your Cupid\u2019s bow right above your lip by putting a little bit of highlighter\u2014or even a dab of light eyeshadow\u2014there. That will give some pop to your lips.\"\n\nProtein is your power\n\n\"I usually start my day with eggs. I think they\u2019re like magic\u2014you can do so much with them. I mostly keep it simple and have scrambled eggs and a piece of Ezekiel toast for breakfast. But if somebody brings over muffins or some other kind of delicious treat, I\u2019ll eat that with my coffee instead. It\u2019s a terrible way to begin my day, though. I really regret it later, because I just don\u2019t have as much energy. I find that when I start out with the right source of protein, it definitely helps.\n\nI grew up eating rice and beans, so I want some kind of grain in every meal. For lunch, I usually have salmon and rice or quinoa, and I try to include a salad. I\u2019ll eat the same thing for dinner. I\u2019m a creature of habit in that way. I don\u2019t get bored with food. I try to think about it as fuel for my body. But what I am looking forward to is the time when dinner becomes a sit-down situation again. Right now I\u2019m in survival mode with two babies, eating on the go.\u201d\n\nA little sugar is important too\n\n\"Sweets are my thing. It\u2019s ongoing, and I have to manage my sugar cravings constantly. I\u2019ve gotten used to having something sweet after every meal, so I\u2019m always bartering with myself: No, no, I can\u2019t have that after dinner, but maybe I can have it after lunch instead. The kid in me thinks, I work out, so I can support my sugar habit. I know that\u2019s not a very wise thing to say, but I really do feel like I\u2019m working it off!\"\n\nFor more from Eva, pick up the April issue of Shape, on newsstands March 14th.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/all/modules/custom/shopnation_footer/images/shape_shop_logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/u398/eva-mendes-3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/themes/meredith/images/meredith_logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/eva-mendes-fb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/u398/eva-mendes-2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/themes/meredith/images/monetate--footer.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/eva-mendes-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mar", "Pam O'Brien"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632/http://www.shape.com/celebrities/videos/eva-mendes-shares-fitness-and-beauty-tips-keep-her-looking-so-damn-glowy", "title": "Eva Mendes Shares Her Beauty and Fitness Tips In the April Issue of Shape", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"description": "Spoiler: Tough workouts, healthy meals, loads of coconut oil, and Ryan Gosling.", "title": "The Food Eva Mendes Won't Start Her Day Without", "type": "article", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632im_/http://images.shape.mdpcdn.com/sites/shape.com/files/eva-mendes-fb.jpg", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170309150632/http://www.shape.com/celebrities/videos/eva-mendes-shares-fitness-and-beauty-tips-keep-her-looking-so-damn-glowy", "site_name": "Shape Magazine"}, "article": {"section": "Celebrity Videos", "author": "By Pam O'Brien", "published_time": "2017-03-08T09:00:00-06:00"}, "Generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "theme-color": "#f50057"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1488985200.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
