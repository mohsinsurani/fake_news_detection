"text": "Seamus Duff The Sun\n\nBELLA Hadid looked confident and unconcerned as she hit the Paris Haute Couture catwalk with her boobs on display.\n\nThe 20-year-old reality star turned-model was one of the ladies showing off designs in the French capital on Tuesday.\n\nShe was strutting in front of invited guests at the Alexandre Vauthier show, Runway, Fall Winter 2017, Haute Couture Fashion Week show.\n\nAt one point in the show, Bella had been dressed in a sheet navy top that left nothing to the imagination.\n\nThe completely see-through material showed off her breasts for all to see.\n\nShe wore dramatic earrings and a jaunty hat as part of the collection look.\n\nAnd she had some power-dressing trousers on, a purple leather tier-around belt, and some marble effect boots.\n\nA second outfit offered more dazzle \u2014 but again was high on the flesh flashing.\n\nA silver dress \u2014 that didn\u2019t look too dissimilar from a nightgown \u2014 shimmered on the catwalk as Bella stomped down the room.\n\nWearing no bra and with a wide, gaping neckline, Bella again faced the risk of exposing her boobs.\n\nThe design also had a dramatic split straight up the front of the dress \u2014 allowing Bella\u2019s leg to take some of the attention.\n\nIt was not the only fashion event in Paris on Tuesday \u2014 as Katy Perry and Cara Delevingne were among stars attending the Chanel show.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun and has been republished with permission.", "images":
