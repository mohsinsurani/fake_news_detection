Since premiering during the Warner Bros Hall H panel, the Aquaman trailer has more than 19M views from the WB upload alone, far outpacing any other trailer revealed during Comic-Con 2018.\n\nIn his second appearance in the DCEU, Jason Momoa's Aquaman finally takes on a leading role in his own film, which Warner Bros. hopes will rekindle fan excitement after the disappointing critical reception and box office performance of last year's Justice League.\n\n\"I wanted our film to be more unique. So my movie plays more like a science fiction fantasy film than a traditional superhero movie,\" Wan said before the trailer's reveal at Hall H of San Diego Comic-Con 2018.\n\nAnd at least at first look, Wan's delivering on the fantasy angle, with talk of thrones, legacy and leadership breaking up the trailer's aquatic action.\n\nTake a look at the trailer below:\n\nNow playing: Watch this: Aquaman Comic-Con trailer brings Arthur Curry home for...\n\nAquaman is scheduled for release December 21, 2018.
