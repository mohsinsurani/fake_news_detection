{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/meghan-markle-cover-story", "text": "For almost a year, rumors have flown about the romance between the 36-year-old actress and Britain\u2019s 33-year-old Prince Harry\u2014the redheaded hell-raiser, former army captain who had completed two tours of duty in Afghanistan, and all-around favorite royal. If Markle and Prince Harry are indeed headed to the altar, she will become the first American to marry into the royal family since Wallis Simpson famously wed King Edward VIII, forcing his abdication from the throne, almost 81 years ago.\n\nMarkle is the calm in the center of the media storm inspired by her year-long relationship with the prince. The couple met in London through friends in July 2016, Markle says. Since then, media coverage of their romance has been so intense\u2014and much of it so unpleasant\u2014that Prince Harry was moved to issue a statement asking the press and public, essentially, to back off. They haven\u2019t. Even Bogart and Guy have become Instagram stars.\n\nMarkle, new to fame, has handled the hoopla with surprising aplomb. \u201cIt has its challenges, and it comes in waves\u2014some days it can feel more challenging than others,\u201d she says. \u201cAnd right out of the gate it was surprising the way things changed. But I still have this support system all around me, and, of course, my boyfriend\u2019s support.\u201d\n\nWhile arguably the most popular member of the British royal family, Prince Harry is also the most iconoclastic. He\u2019s loved for having been the bad boy in his youth and now the regular guy of the family, for his 10 years of army service, including his time in Afghanistan (the only place he ever felt \u201cnormal,\u201d he\u2019s said), and in recent years for his philanthropy on behalf of combat veterans.\n\nV.F. contributing editor Sally Bedell Smith, who wrote a biography of Prince Charles, says, \u201cHarry, who could have been the scapegrace sibling, was that for a while.\u201d There was the widely released photo of him looking tipsy at a London nightclub. There was the scuffle with a photographer outside another London nightclub at around three A.M. that resulted in the photographer\u2019s cut lip. There was the \u201cColonials and Natives\u201d costume party of 2005, in Wiltshire, to which Harry came dressed like Nazi general Erwin Rommel, complete with desert uniform, German Wehrmacht badge, and swastika armband. A photo of the prince in this costume landed on page one of the British tabloid The Sun. The public was outraged, and Harry apologized. More recently, cell-phone pictures of Harry carousing with friends in Las Vegas in 2012 went viral. \u201cIt was probably a classic case of me being too much army and not enough prince,\u201d he later admitted.\n\nAfter Harry ended his stint in the army, he focused on veterans\u2019 issues. In September 2014, he organized the Invictus Games, a charity event for wounded combat veterans named after the 1875 William Ernest Henley poem schoolboys in England once had to memorize, with the famous lines \u201cI am the master of my fate / I am the captain of my soul.\u201d When Harry turned 30, he inherited $16 million from the estate of his mother, Princess Diana, and that is when he determined to spend his time and efforts supporting veterans with physical and psychological injuries.\n\nAs Diana\u2019s younger son, Harry continues to bask in the public\u2019s love for \u201cthe People\u2019s Princess.\u201d He has been forgiven his occasional wildness, his drift, the acting out of a broken heart that had sent him into grief counseling in his late 20s. As the royal favorite, there is keen interest in\u2014and much speculation about\u2014the woman he may marry. A rumor floating in cyberspace has that he popped the question last month when they were vacationing in Botswana.\n\nAs in the 1957 Marilyn Monroe-Laurence Olivier film, The Prince and the Showgirl, a feeding frenzy surrounds royal-and-nonroyal couplings. Though Markle is extremely pretty and she stars in a TV show, you would never call her a \u201cshowgirl.\u201d She is too serious, too well brought up. (And outside of Vegas, who\u2019s called a \u201cshowgirl\u201d anymore?) \u201cGrounded\u201d is the word that is often used to describe her.\n\n\u201cI was born and raised in Los Angeles, a California girl who lives by the ethos that most things can be cured with either yoga, the beach, or a few avocados,\u201d she once wrote. Until recently, she maintained a popular lifestyle blog called The Tig. She is a self-described foodie, a passion, incidentally, given to her character on Suits. \u201cI mean, this bread is so good!\u201d she enthuses over the delicious meal she prepared. \u201cIt\u2019s that perfect crunch and then the softness. They call it the \u2018crumb,\u2019 all of these little holes\u2014oh!\u201d\n\nSuits, in which Markle plays ambitious paralegal turned lawyer Rachel Zane, first brought the actress to wide attention. (Before that she\u2019d appeared briefly in the movies A Lot Like Love and Horrible Bosses and had minor roles on television in the science-fiction drama Fringe and the soap opera General Hospital, among others.) I asked the boyishly attractive, 36-year-old actor Patrick J. Adams, who plays the likable but fraudulent lawyer Mike Ross, Rachel\u2019s love interest on Suits, to describe the series and its popularity.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968264ef611786ce8c2e1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5824deca364154776b0ba9d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-kate-middleton-meghan-markle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825106117712f34f887/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968254a3663211bf43089/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825e025da666cd492e9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5908b35e16779f27abc0a375/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-meghan-markle-style.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61bb68208185dc60dfd416d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825e025da666cd492e7/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96826600c2752b9cb62d3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61f2a5fdbc6733c4e6a4c2e1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a96825f472d37f5e2f7265/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle-1017-ss01.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/59a968264ef611786ce8c2e1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-meghan-markle-10-17-cover.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Sam Kashner", "Peter Lindbergh", "Jessica Diehl"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/09/meghan-markle-cover-story", "title": "Cover Story: Meghan Markle, Wild About Harry!", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Battered by the tabloids\u2014to the point where her boyfriend, Prince Harry, issued a statement defending her\u2014actress and activist Meghan Markle has largely ignored the media storm.
