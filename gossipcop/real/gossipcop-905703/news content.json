More than any other Hollywood union, the Directors Guild\u2019s top award is heavily predictive of Oscar gold, with nearly 80 percent of all D.G.A. best director winners\u2019 pictures going on to land the academy\u2019s top prize.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/arts/12dga-nom2/12dga-nom2-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/arts/12dga-nom2/12dga-nom2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=146a758e2f49e8b087b2c89730a4d1afcb5f763e4e8e8206e840f40bd5385677&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/arts/12dga-nom2/12dga-nom2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=146a758e2f49e8b087b2c89730a4d1afcb5f763e4e8e8206e840f40bd5385677&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cara Buckley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/arts/jordan-peele-greta-gerwig-directors-guild-nominations.html", "title": "Jordan Peele and Greta Gerwig Get Directors Guild Nominations", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The top prize awarded by the Directors Guild of America is heavily predictive of the Oscar for best picture.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/11/arts/jordan-peele-greta-gerwig-directors-guild-nominations.html", "type": "article", "title": "Jordan Peele and Greta Gerwig Get Directors Guild Nominations (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/01/12/arts/12dga-nom2/12dga-nom2-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=146a758e2f49e8b087b2c89730a4d1afcb5f763e4e8e8206e840f40bd5385677&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Jodan Peele at the National Board of Review gala on Tuesday, where he won best directorial debut.
