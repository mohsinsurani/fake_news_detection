I can\u2019t believe I have a boss. I really have a boss.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen my baby wanna eat, she wanna eat,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not like, \u2018Oh, three minutes,\u2019 no. \u2018Gimme the milk now!\u2019 You gotta burp her right away \u2014 everything, everything, everything. She wants everything.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

My ass is broken. This baby broke my ass.\u201d\n\nJohn Parra/Telemundo/NBCU Photo Bank via Getty\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Cardi B Says She Hasn\u2019t Gotten a Nanny for Daughter Kulture: I \u201cWant to Learn How to Be a Mom\u201d\n\n\n\nThe rapper told viewers that her \u201cbody is extremely weak right now,\u201d and that part of her decision came from the pressure of having to perform in big arenas \u2014 something that would be much more difficult while recovering from childbirth.\n\n\u201cAnd my mind is so weird,\u201d she revealed. \u201cPostpartum s\u2014, it\u2019s real. It\u2019s really real, y\u2019all.\u201d\n\nCardi B also admitted having a baby is beyond anything she read about in parenting books and that, \u201cI respect mothers more than ever now.\u201d\n\n\u201cI see moms differently \u2014 especially the young ones [who] barely have experience, they barely have money,\u201d said the \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d hitmaker. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t know how they could do it.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMatt Baron/Shutterstock\n\nCardi B also shared a few teases about upcoming projects and promised to continue to post videos, but her main focus for now will be on her daughter.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m gonna work. My life is not over, you know? I just have to take my time to do certain things because my body really can\u2019t take it,\u201d she lamented.\n\n\u201cI really love my little baby,\u201d Cardi B raved of Kulture. \u201cShe\u2019s so cute. She looks like me, of course. She looks like her daddy, and she looks like [Cardi B\u2019s sister] Hennessy. \u2026 And she just melts me. I don\u2019t feel like nobody could tend [to] my baby like me.\u201d", "images":
