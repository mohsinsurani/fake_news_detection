This is it, friends. After these 10 episodes, there will be no more shirtless Toby makeout scenes, no more Hanna one-liners\u2014and no more fan theories.\n\nFan theories have become a very important part of the Pretty Little Liars universe. The PLL army uses the gaps between seasons to hypothesize future storylines, romances, and villains. Right now the biggest mystery is unmasking Uber A, but there are other questions PLL needs to answer before the final season ends. Does Toby live? Who is the father of Alison's baby? Do Aria and Ezra get married? Who the hell is making those eerily lifelike face masks?!\n\nHundreds of fan theories exist right now that cover these questions and more. We scoured the Internet for the craziest ones that are still possible given everything that's happened. These 14 are the winners, and\u2014wow\u2014they're all certifiably batshit.\n\nSpencer is Uber A.\n\n\u00a9ABC Family/courtesy Everett Collection\n\nAs a diehard Pretty Little Liars fan, I find it highly unlikely that one of the five liars is Uber A. But I'm alone on this ship: Every liar has a convincing fan theory on the Internet that positions her as the Big Bad. Even Emily. If this is true, the liar with the most evidence stacked against her is Spencer Hastings\u2014as this very detailed Tumblr theory points out. Red flags went off for fans in season three when Spencer said the lead female character in Basic Instinct was a \"genius\" for writing a novel to cover up her murder. (After Charlotte is murdered, Spencer reveals the way it happened is similar to a scenario she wrote in a college essay. Coincidence? Hell no. There are no coincidences in Rosewood.) The theory also notes the strange costume Spencer donned one year for Halloween: Mary Queen of Scots, the woman who conspired to assassinate Queen Elizabeth I. And then there's Spencer's Radley connection: All of the previous A's have ties to the mental institution, and she's the only liar who spent time there as a patient.\n\nToby dies, and his organs are used to save Spencer's life.", "images": ["https://media.glamour.com/photos/633dcb5fa325f3cb9d2d5dcc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b778612263873c4ca4/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/jenna.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b5f802062edf81b3cb/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/caleb.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b7d1b3556215ed5217/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/SPENCER%2520AND%2520TOBY.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b5098528298ebf5123/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/alison.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632484d849f9a667e4ae50a1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6335ad2f9d2301bc3bf524cb/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/631cb578756bfb7545c0c909/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b7594519668d13f414/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/spencer.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d3f18f594519668d13f407/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretty%20little%20liars.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b6d1b3556215ed5213/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/emily.JPG", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/631cb50c91774a27eec4cefa/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b6f637da1811a70cc0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/HANNA's%2520mom.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d3f18f594519668d13f407/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/pretty%2520little%2520liars.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b778612263873c4ca3/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/maya.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b578612263873c4ca0/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/aria.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633ef8eaf0197d1ce66b2735/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b7f637da1811a70cc2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/spencer%2520twin.JPG", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1490193318/glamour_here-s-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-equal-rights-amendment.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b6d1b3556215ed5215/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/HANNA.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d418b7594519668d13f415/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/wilden.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/58d3f18f594519668d13f407/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/pretty%20little%20liars.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/pretty-little-liars-fan-theories", "title": "14 Pretty Little Liars Fan Theories That Will Keep You Up Tonight", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "These 14 \"Pretty Little Liars\" are so crazy, they will keep you up tonight.
