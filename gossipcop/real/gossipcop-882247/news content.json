He is grateful for the support and love from his fans and looks forward to coming back stronger than ever before.\"\n\nFollowing the news, Carter also took to Twitter to address his fans.\n\n\"Only I can change my life. No one can do it for me,\" the \"I Want Candy\" singer tweeted.\n\nRELATED: Aaron Carter Avoids Recommended Rehab Treatment After \u2018The Doctors,\u2019 Releases Statement\n\nOnly I can change my life. No one can do it for me. \u2014 AARON CARTER (@aaroncarter) September 22, 2017\n\n\"He begins his treatment immediately,\" a source close to the singer tells ET exclusively.\n\n\"It was his decision [to check into the facility]. He wasn\u2019t required to go or forced to go. It was 100 percent his decision. Ultimately, what led to the decision was that he saw the impact his health was having on his life, both personally and professionally, and he couldn\u2019t pretend these problems weren\u2019t affecting his life,\" the source says.\n\n\"Aaron\u2019s decision has been on the table for a little while. Various people close to him have been encouraging him,\" the source adds. \"Those closest to Aaron, including his family members, fully support him in this decision.\"\n\nET has also learned that the facility Carter is checking into is much more of a wellness center that helps people deal with anxiety, stress and eating disorders, among other things.\n\n\"There were many people that recognized Aaron\u2019s potential, what he could do, if he just got back on track,\u201d the source continues. \"They put it on the table for him and said 'make a choice' and fortunately he made the right choice.\"\n\nRELATED: Aaron Carter Takes Drug Test on \u2018The Doctors,\u2019 Is Told His Combination \u2018Is How Many People Accidentally Die\u2019\n\nEarlier this month, Carter appeared on The Doctors -- the episode was filmed in August -- where he broke down in tears talking about his gaunt appearance and personal health. The musician also took a drug test, where he tested negative for both cocaine and meth. Though, Dr. Travis Stork did note that the combination of drugs that the singer did test positive for weren\u2019t necessarily safe. \"THC aka marijuana was positive,\" Stork said. \"Benzodiazepines, Xanax, for instance...positive, it was also positive for opiates, hydrocodone.\"\n\n\u201cWhat scares me about that drug panel is that your sister [Leslie] perished from a drug overdose,\u201d Stork also told Carter. \u201cYou have a mixture of benzodiazepines with opiates, which is how many people accidentally can die. These medications -- and I\u2019m speaking now purely from the doctor\u2019s perspective -- can be very, very scary.\u201d\n\nCarter noted that he takes those medications for his extreme stress and anxiety, but that he is trying to find other methods of dealing with his emotional problems. Following his appearance on the medical show, the singer was recommended to the Alo House in Malibu, California, to receive rehab treatment for his prescription medication use. At the time, Carter hadn't made a decision to seek additional help.\n\nSee more in the video below.\n\nReporting by Brendon Geoffrion", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-08/GettyImages-1240426139.jpg?h=05c564aa&itok=Dkqb34Us", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2017-07/1280_aaron_carter_GettyImages-682751098.jpg?itok=rs0tzeWw", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%2011.17.16%20AM.png?h=22ea39b5&itok=NjZh8lt3", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_aaron_carter_GettyImages-682751098.jpg?itok=KKvPvxTB"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_aaron_carter_GettyImages-682751098.jpg?itok=KKvPvxTB", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Liz Calvario"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/aaron-carter-entering-facility-improve-health-and-wellness-only-i-can-change-my-life-87892", "title": "Aaron Carter Entering Facility to Improve Health and Wellness: 'Only I Can Change My Life'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "The 29-year-old singer is grateful for the support of his fans.", "keywords": "News, Aaron Carter", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/aaron-carter-entering-facility-improve-health-and-wellness-only-i-can-change-my-life-87892", "title": "Aaron Carter Entering Facility to Improve Health and Wellness: 'Only I Can Change My Life'", "description": "The 29-year-old singer is grateful for the support of his fans.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_aaron_carter_GettyImages-682751098.jpg?itok=KKvPvxTB", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The 29-year-old singer is grateful for the support of his fans.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Aaron Carter Entering Facility to Improve Health and Wellness: 'Only I Can Change My Life'", "creator": "Liz Calvario\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/aaron-carter-entering-facility-improve-health-and-wellness-only-i-can-change-my-life-87892", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-07/1280_aaron_carter_GettyImages-682751098.jpg?itok=KKvPvxTB"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
