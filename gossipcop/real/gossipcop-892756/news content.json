Photo: 2017 Getty Images\n\nDays after actress Kristina Cohen alleged that Gossip Girl star Ed Westwick raped her at his home, a second actress has come foward. In a Facebook post on Wednesday, former actress Aur\u00e9lie Wynn (known professionally as Aurelie Marie Cao) claimed that Westwick raped her in 2014. Westwick has denied the allegations.\n\nIn her post Wynn wrote, \u201c[A]nd like Kristina, I said no and he pushed me face down and was powerless under his weight. I was wearing a one piece bathing suit that he ripped, I was in complete shock, I am also very tiny.\u201d\n\nWynn wrote that she told her boyfriend at the time, Glee actor Mark Salling, about the incident. Salling, who has since pleaded guilty for possession of child pornography, allegedly broke up with her and blamed her. She also wrote that she was encouraged by friends to stay quiet and that people would think she was \u201cjust out trying to get my 10 seconds of fame.\u201d\n\nWestwick responded to Cohen\u2019s claims on Tuesday in an Instagram post saying he did not know Cohen and had never raped anybody.\n\nA post shared by Ed Westwick (@edwestwick) on Nov 7, 2017 at 8:46am PST\n\nCohen filed a report with the Los Angeles Police Department, which is now investigating if the \u201csuspect forced victim to have sexual intercourse inside his residence \u2026 three years ago.\u201d\n\nFollowing Wynn\u2019s allegations, Westwick posted a second denial on Instagram on Thursday.\n\nA post shared by Ed Westwick (@edwestwick) on Nov 9, 2017 at 9:52am PST\n\nThis post has been updated to include Westwick\u2019s second statement.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/327/78c/23c94f6e111407d37a898278be2dd347aa-9-Ed-Westwick.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/327/78c/23c94f6e111407d37a898278be2dd347aa-9-Ed-Westwick.rsquare.w700.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/327/78c/23c94f6e111407d37a898278be2dd347aa-9-Ed-Westwick.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Spellings"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/ed-westwick-accused-of-raping-a-second-actress-aurlie-wynn.html", "title": "Ed Westwick Denies Rape Allegations of Aur\u00e9lie Wynn", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "sexual assault, ed westwick, culture, celebrity, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Gossip Girl Star Denies Rape Accusations After New Woman Comes Forward", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/11/ed-westwick-accused-of-raping-a-second-actress-aurlie-wynn.html", "description": "Aur\u00e9lie Wynn made the allegations on Facebook.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/327/78c/23c94f6e111407d37a898278be2dd347aa-9-Ed-Westwick.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ed Westwick Denies Rape Accusations by Second Actress", "description": "Aur\u00e9lie Wynn made the allegations on Facebook.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/327/78c/23c94f6e111407d37a898278be2dd347aa-9-Ed-Westwick.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@sjspellings", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-09T07:37:49.155-05:00", "tag": "sexual assault, ed westwick, culture, celebrity", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "\u201cGossip Girl\u201d star Ed Westwick denied rape accusations raised by a second actress, Aur\u00e9lie Wynn, days after Kristina Cohen came forward.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "sexual assault, ed westwick, culture, celebrity", "author": "Sarah Spellings", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510231069.155, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
