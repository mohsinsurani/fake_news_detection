Joe Giudice (Real Housewives of New Jersey): I don't think that Teresa Giudice is blameless in the Giudice couple being convicted for bankruptcy and bank fraud, but anyone who has watched the show knows that Joe was up to some shady business. There's nothing dreamy about going to prison for a year because of your man.\n\n52. Kelsey Grammer (Real Housewives of Beverly Hills): Yes, that Kelsey Grammer, star of Cheers and Frasier, was briefly on the first season of this show before unceremoniously divorcing his wife Camille and then refusing to talk to her. Though whenever he was onscreen with St. Camille of Grammer, as she came to be known, he hardly seemed interested in being near her. At least she got a boatload of money for her trouble.\n\n51. David Foster (RHOBH): As soon as Yolanda Hadid Foster got sick with Lyme disease, you just had a feeling that the smarmy Grammy-winner and serial reality-television participant was going to dump his fourth wife. Then he did.\n\n50. Josh Taekman(Real Housewives of New York): No one really liked the condescending (though admittedly handsome) entrepreneur and serial bad-hat-wearer before he got caught in the Ashley Madison hacking scandal. Now we think that former Housewife Kristen is crazy for staying with him.\n\n49. Kordell Stewart (Real Housewives of Atlanta): Sure, it wasn't nice of Porsha Williams to spread rumors about her ex's sexual orientation after he divorced her following one season on the show and two years of marriage. But the former NFL player didn't treat his young wife all that well onscreen, either.", "images": ["https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852069/414x310/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60;progressive.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852073/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852106/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852128/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852069/1200x600/scale", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852134/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852125/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852122/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852123/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852133/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852088/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852076/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2773316/size/_original;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852078/792x735/scale;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852097/381x254/crop;webp=auto;jpeg_quality=60.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852069/1200x600/scale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Moylan", "Published On At Am"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-real-housewives-husbands-ranked", "title": "All 53 'Real Housewives' Husbands, Ranked", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "thrillist editorial, nation, entertainment, brian moylan, full width, small screened, tv, alcohol, brandy, wine, beer type, food, context, dinner, travel, domestic destinations, miami, chicago, dallas, atlanta, tropical destinations, mexico, other, health, mental health, work, sex and dating, marriage, amber, occasion, baseball, birthday, brand, season, people, events, unhealthy, sugar, indoors, shopping, type, tech, money, supercompressor, financial planning, real estate, home, sports, nfl, tennis, movie and tv genres, music genres, crime, disaster, drama, family, history, music, oscar winning, winning, reality tv, real housewives, rock, activities, hamptons, car topics, accidents, condiments, salt", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "description": "The men of New Jersey, New York, Orange County, and the rest, run down by the most important metric: dreaminess.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Thrillist"}, "parsely-title": "All 53 'Real Housewives' Husbands, Ranked", "parsely-link": "https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-real-housewives-husbands-ranked", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852069/1200x600/scale;", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-12-06T05:01:22.000Z", "parsely-section": "Entertainment", "parsely-author": "Brian Moylan", "parsely-tags": "tv,small screened,entertainment", "fb": {"pages": 101800100890, "app_id": 111767172173562}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.thrillist.com/fbihtml/entertainment/nation/best-real-housewives-husbands-ranked"}, "og": {"site_name": "Thrillist", "url": "https://www.thrillist.com/entertainment/nation/best-real-housewives-husbands-ranked", "type": "article", "title": "All 53 'Real Housewives' Husbands, Ranked", "description": "And you thought the wives were wild.", "image": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852069/1200x600/scale;"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thrillist", "image": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/1852069/1200x600/scale;", "description": "And you thought the wives were wild.", "title": "All 53 'Real Housewives' Husbands, Ranked"}, "placeholder": {"1": "ph", "2": "ph", "3": "ph", "4": "ph", "5": "ph", "6": "ph", "7": "ph", "8": "ph", "9": "ph"}, "next-head-count": 58}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.thrillist.com", "summary": ""}
