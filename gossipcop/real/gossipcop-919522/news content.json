She is seeking an order that Corey Bohan\u2018s visitation with their one-year-old daughter, Kirra, be stripped and that a restraining order be issued against him.\n\nPatridge claims during a court-ordered hand-off with their daughter on March 5, Corey threatened her by saying, \u201cYou better start f**king playing nice, I\u2019m f**king warning you.\u201d She says she recorded that incident, but claims on other occasions Bohan has aggressively followed her out of the parking lot and \u201cone time swerved his vehicle dangerously close to my sister.\u201d\n\n\n\nMEGA\n\nPatridge also claims her ex is \u201cstalking\u201d her on social media by picking apart her public posts and trying to attack her character. One example she references is after a post about attending church, Bohan allegedly posted on his own social media, \u201cONE THING I CANNOT STAND IS THOSE PEOPLE WHO ARE PURE EVIL PUSHING THE \u2018I LOVE CHURCH\u2019 BEHAVIOR.\u201d\n\nShe says Bohan\u2019s obvious response to her posting supports her theory that he is keeping tabs on her, as well as publicly disparaging her.\n\nPatridge claims Bohan is being \u201cangry, rude and emotionally abusive\u201d towards Kirra, and tells her that \u201cMommy doesn\u2019t pick you up anymore because she\u2019s an L.A. party girl.\u201d She says sometimes her mom picks Kirra up if she\u2019s away on business, and claims Bohan tries to punish her for working.\n\nThe reality star says she believes her ex has participated in anger management and parenting classes since their split, but claims he hasn\u2019t participated in any individual therapy and therefore believes has not fully addressed his issues.\n\nBecause of the volatility between the two, Patridge says, \u201cI am more afraid of him now than ever, and fear for the safety of our daughter Kirra when she is in his care.\u201d\n\nShe backs up her statement with an example of recklessness, referring to a Snapchat video Bohan posted that appears to show him driving with their daughter in the car while he is filming on his phone. She also says that the video shows the child\u2019s \u201ccar seat is facing the wrong way.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve reported, Patridge filed for divorce from Bohan back in September. At the time, she had also filed for a temporary restraining order after accusing him of pushing her while she was holding their child.\n\nBohan also got into a heated argument with his estranged wife\u2019s father, and it got so bad that the two men almost came to blows. He was later ordered to vacate the house he shared with Patridge, and she got full custody of Kirra, with Bohan getting visitation.\n\nPatridge\u2019s claims and requests will be addressed in court on their next scheduled hearing.", "images": ["https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/Tayler-Holder-Settles-Lawsuit-Against-Austin-McBroom-scaled-e1637107329911.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MEGA876781_015-scaled-e1664956951532.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/group-NUP_197298_00031.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MEGA834711_001-scaled-e1658838045196.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mega477322_004-scaled-e1654311461915.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/61300398_341671993188134_7669920017703656447_n-2-scaled-e1661759955396.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Blast_v06_Temptation-Island-Desktop2-05.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MEGA464180_055-scaled-e1665070030410.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/Untitled-design-2022-06-20T153245.668-1.png?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/c0d15c98e4143f8f64f8f7ad2e945c35.jpg", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mega817118_004-scaled-e1645478756847.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/temptation-island-logo.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MEGA858158_001-scaled-e1660820330888.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/252b54b03d0563c115918748828e16cb.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300&quality=75", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MEGA897484_057-scaled-e1664997997603.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FFyBHpzXEAQH0FI.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/FG0yKGrWYAEDrKa-e1639763194789.png?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/89267709_194922195070300_5303850567596110229_n-e1642161732562.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Police-Officers-Dog-Brutally-Murdered-In-Tagreted-Attack-e1639610935870.png?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390"], "top_img": "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/audrina-patridge-visitation-threat-corey-bohan-custody/", "title": "Audrina Patridge Says Her Ex Threatened Her and Is \u2018Stalking\u2019 Her, Wants Custody Stripped", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Audrina Patridge Says Her Ex Threatened Her and Is 'Stalking' Her, Wants Custody Stripped", "description": "Audrina Patridge just went to court claiming the escalating aggression and resentment of her estranged husband has reached an all-time high to the point of actual threats and she wants him kept away from not just herself, but from her daughter as well.
