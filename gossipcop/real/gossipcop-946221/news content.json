The 34-year-old opened up about her decision to take a step back from modeling in her cover interview for Net-a-Porter's digital magazine, The Edit, saying she's focusing now on her organic skincare line, Kora Organics, thanks to a push from her new hubby, Snapchat CEO Evan Spiegel.\n\nSo how is she adjusting to life away from the cameras and inside the Kora offices? Kerr talks all about her newlywed life and the more feminine and masculine roles she and Spiegel (respectively) take on at home.\n\nPhotographed by Raf Stahelin, courtesy of The EDIT, NET-A-PORTER\n\n\"Evan inspired me,\" Kerr old the magazine of her decision to take a break from modeling. \"He said, 'Why are you spending your energy working for other companies when you should be focusing on your own? You need to take a risk. If you believe in this, put everything into it.'\"\n\nFROM PEN: Jada Pinkett Smith Talks Celebrating 20 Years with Will Smith\n\nShe adds: \"I've modeled for 20 years, it's just not a priority anymore,\" she says. \"Now, if an opportunity comes up, I think, 'Is this in the best interest of my family?' and 'Will this interrupt Kora?' If it passes through those two gates, and if the shoot's in LA, then\u2026\"\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: They Do! Celebrity Bridesmaids\n\nPhotographed by Raf Stahelin, courtesy of The EDIT, NET-A-PORTER\n\nHer life these days involves getting her son, Flynn, off to school, working at Kora's office and getting home in time to cook her family dinner. \"My grandma taught me that men are visual and you need to make a little effort,\" she said. \"So when [Evan] comes home, I make sure to have a nice dress on and the candles lit. We make time to have a nice dinner together.\"\n\nShe also slips into a slightly different vibe at home than when she's at the office. \"At work, I'm like, 'We need to do this!' and, 'This needs to happen!' But at home, I slip into my feminine and empower Evan to be in his masculine.\"\n\nIf that mindset of Kerr's sounds familiar, she told The Edit back in 2013 something very similar when describing her relationship with now ex-husband Orlando Bloom.\n\n\"I am quite dominant in my career, so what really works for me when I come home, is to relax more into the feminine side,\" she said four years ago. \"If you're really an alpha female, you don't allow [your partner] to have the space to feel like the man in the relationship. Maybe I am too traditional, but men feel important when you ask for their help, instead of thinking you can do it all on your own.\"\n\nTo see The Edit's full interview, go to net-a-porter.com or
