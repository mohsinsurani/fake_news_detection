Pfeiffer, then 32, received the top honor, though PEOPLE editors wrote they learned three things from the process: \"That there is no such thing as perfect beauty. That people have blessedly different ideas about what's beautiful. And that most people are beautiful in some way, and that's about as beautiful as anybody really needs to be.\"\n\n02 of 32 Julia Roberts, 1991 People Editors called the 23-year-old \"a Botticelli beauty,\" and model maven Eileen Ford seconded that superlative. ''She is one of the few new great beauties,\" she said. \"She doesn't look like she's been dragged through the mud like a lot of them now do.''\n\n03 of 32 Jodie Foster, 1992 People The actress, then 29, was fresh from her second Oscar win (for Silence of the Lambs) when she appeared on PEOPLE's Most Beautiful issue. Sharing the honor were Mel Gibson, Elizabeth Taylor and Denzel Washington.\n\n04 of 32 Cindy Crawford, 1993 People Revlon model Crawford was a mere 27 \u2014 and married to Richard Gere \u2014 when she appeared on the cover.

Daniel Day-Lewis, Toni Braxton and \u2014 whoa! \u2014 Joey Lawrence (then on Blossom) also appeared on the cover.\n\n06 of 32 Courteney Cox, 1995 People She was only 30 (and four years into a romance with Michael Keaton) when her role as Monica Gellar on Friends landed the actress the cover (with Halle Berry and George Clooney).\n\n07 of 32 Mel Gibson, 1996 People The actor, then 40, had just earned his Oscar wins for Best Director and Best Picture (for Braveheart) when he appeared on the cover (alongside Michelle Pfeiffer, Brad Pitt and Brandy) for a second time.\n\n08 of 32 Tom Cruise, 1997 People Cruise was 34 \u2014 and still married to Nicole Kidman \u2014 when he graced PEOPLE's 50 Most Beautiful cover with Toni Braxton (her second appearance) and Drew Barrymore.\n\n09 of 32 Leonardo DiCaprio, 1998 People He was the king of the world at 23, starring in the mega-hit Titanic and on the cover of the Most Beautiful issue.

Also on the cover were Britney Spears and George Clooney (his third appearance!).\n\n15 of 32 Jennifer Aniston, 2004 People The actress talked with PEOPLE about the end of Friends \u2014 and her life with then-husband Brad Pitt.

The people I find most beautiful are the ones who aren't trying.\"\n\n26 of 32 Jennifer Aniston, 2016 Earning the title for a second time gave the 47-year-old actress \"this sort of very excited, teenage-y kind of moment,\" she told PEOPLE. Her interview touched on aging \u2014 \"It's funny, it's a really quick transition from not a care and now all of a sudden, we've got to really be mindful of what we put inside our bodies,\" she said \u2014 and life at home with then-husband Justin Theroux. \"He makes me laugh. He's so interesting and so interested ... and he's just a good man.\"\n\n27 of 32 Julia Roberts, 2017 Covering the issue for a record fifth time (her 2010 cover was shared with Sandra Bullock's baby news), Roberts told PEOPLE she was \"flattered\" by the title and believed the best is yet to come: \"I think I'm currently peaking.\"\n\n28 of 32 Pink, 2018 Peggy Sirota In 2018, PEOPLE shifted the title from \"Most Beautiful\" to the \"Beautiful Issue\" \u2014 and Pink, 38, was the perfect person to usher in the new era. The mom of two talked about raising her children to be strong and how life with husband Carey Hart involves laughing a lot. \"[We] try not to take life too terribly seriously,\" she said. \"It's all about our family unit and time spent together, and much less about external stuff.\"\n\n29 of 32 Jennifer Garner, 2019 Growing up in West Virginia, 2019 cover star Garner insisted her own style could initially be described as \"band geek-chic,\" she joked to PEOPLE. \"I was so not one of the pretty girls that I just bypassed insecurity and didn't see myself as attractive at all. It was not part of my life.\" Yet the actress was grateful to her family for keeping her so grounded. \"I felt good about myself back then! That is the lucky trick,\" she added. \"Looks weren't a big deal in my family. I don't think my parents ever said 'You're pretty' and so we just didn't think about it.\"\n\n30 of 32 Goldie Hawn, Kate Hudson & Rani Rose Fujikawa, 2020 Clockwise from top: Kate Hudson, Goldie Hawn and Rani Hudson Fujikawa cover PEOPLE.

And it just made me think about Rani\u2026going, 'I hope I give her that kind of confidence,' you know?\"\n\n31 of 32 Chrissy Teigen, 2021 Mike Rosenthal In another family-focused moment, Teigen shared the 2021 cover with her kids Luna, 4, and Miles, 2 (plus, in a separate shot, her mom!). In her cover story, she touched on a range of topics, including her parenting philosophy with husband John Legend. \"I'm an open, free spirit and I love kids to be kids. For us, kindness is such a big thing. When you meet our kids, they're very warm and friendly,\" she told PEOPLE. \"You instill those things in them, but for the most part let them be creative and wondrous and spirited and curious beings.\"", "images":
