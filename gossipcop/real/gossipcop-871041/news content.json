Unfortunately, it looks like that\u2019s not going to happen. \u201cWe probably won\u2019t do another season of our reality show,\u201d Jessie told HollywoodLife EXCLUSIVELY, while promoting her new collection with JustFab. \u201cI feel good about closing that chapter. But I feel we love working together, so there\u2019s always the possibility of doing television together in some capacity.\u201d\n\nThe first season of Eric & Jessie aired in 2013, followed by season 2 at the beginning of 2014. However, after the birth of their first child, Vivianne, Eric and Jessie decided to take a break for a few years. Now, they certainly have their hands full, as two more kids have come since Vivi: Eric Jr. and Forrest. Meanwhile, Jessie is managing to keep quite busy with her career, even without reality TV \u2014 her first book, Just Jessie, came out earlier this month, and she teased that she\u2019ll be releasing new music and going on tour next year.\n\n\u201cI will be headlining my first tour in two years,\u201d she gushed in our interview. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting to be on the road. I really am looking forward to being back onstage.\u201d\n\nShe also dished ALL about her new boot line with JustFab. \u201cI am a boots girl, so it couldn\u2019t have been a better collaboration to do together,\u201d she explained. \u201cFall is my favorite time of year. I love the fashion and everything about the fall, but I am a boots girl year round! I was really excited when I got to do this collection because I feel like it fits my style perfectly. I am a big fan of shoes and an even bigger fan of boots! I feel like you can wear these boots year round.\u201d", "images": ["https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jessie-james-decker-eric-decker-ftr.jpg?w=384&h=216&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/jessie-james-decker-and-eric-8.jpg?w=440", "https://soaps.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/05/eric-martini-brady-pub-days-of-our-lives-jj.jpg?fit=1230%2C718&w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/heather-locklear-overalls-mega-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/jessie-james-decker-and-eric-9.jpg?w=440", "https://www.sheknows.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/teens-menstrual-cycle-florida-1.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/britney-spears-bikini-beach-ss-ftr1.jpg?w=620", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Nicole-Scherzinger-Black-String-Bikini-Spl-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://www.blogher.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Creative-Corner-Article-Graphic-2.png?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jessie-james-decker-eric-decker-ftr.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/petr-sidorov-GESOWH4YLRI-unsplash.jpg?w=230&crop=1", "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/Jessie.jpg?w=282"], "top_img": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jessie-james-decker-eric-decker-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alyssa Norwin", "Katherine Speller", "Kelly-Jo Potts", "Amy Mistretta", "Richard Simms"], "canonical_link": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/10/10/jessie-james-decker-reality-show-season-4-interview/", "title": "Jessie James Decker Dishes On Returning To TV: Will There Be A 4th Season Of \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jessie James Decker dished to us EXCLUSIVELY about her reality show, 'Eric &amp; Jessie,' and revealed if there will be a fourth season.", "news_keywords": "Eric & Jessie: Game On, Eric Decker, Jessie James", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1400650284", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 94724837471}, "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/10/10/jessie-james-decker-reality-show-season-4-interview/?ia_markup=1"}, "author": "Alyssa Norwin", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Jessie James Decker Dishes On Returning To TV: Will There Be A 4th Season Of \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019?", "url": "https://hollywoodlife.com/2018/10/10/jessie-james-decker-reality-show-season-4-interview/", "description": "We caught up EXCLUSIVELY with Jessie James Decker and got the scoop about whether or not she\u2019ll be returning to reality TV with another season of \u2018Eric & Jessie.\u2019 Plus, much m\u2026", "site_name": "Hollywood Life", "image": {"identifier": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jessie-james-decker-eric-decker-ftr.jpg", "width": 620, "height": 349, "alt": "eric decker jessie james decker"}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-10T14:43:34+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-14T04:08:31+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@HollywoodLife", "creator": "@https://twitter.com/alyssanorwin/", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jessie James Decker Dishes On Returning To TV: Will There Be A 4th Season Of \u2018Eric & Jessie\u2019?", "description": "Jessie James Decker dished to us EXCLUSIVELY about her reality show, 'Eric & Jessie,' and revealed if there will be a fourth season.", "image": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/jessie-james-decker-eric-decker-ftr.jpg?w=620"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/hl_logo.png?w=128"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1539126000.0, "source": "https://hollywoodlife.com", "summary": ""}
