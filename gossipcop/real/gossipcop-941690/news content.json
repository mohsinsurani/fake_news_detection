The actor is the younger brother of the late designer\u2019s husband, Andy Spade.\n\n\u201cKaty at my book signing. I love this pic of her. So pretty. I don\u2019t think everyone knew how f\u2013king funny she was\u2026 Its a rough world out there people. Try to hang on,\u201d the comedian, 53, captioned a Twitter photo of the two.\n\nThe Grown Ups star went on to share a pic of the relatives celebrating the holidays together. \u201cFuzzy picture but i love it. Kate and I during Christmas family photos. We had so much fun that day,\u201d he wrote via Instagram. \u201cShe was so sharp and quick on her feet. She could make me laugh so hard. I still can\u2019t believe it.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly confirmed on Tuesday that Kate died from an apparent suicide at the age of 55. She hung herself with a red scarf in her New York City apartment and was found around 10:20 a.m. ET by her housekeeper. Kate and Andy, 55, tied the knot in 1994 and are the parents of daughter Frances, 13. Last year, they spoke about working together after 30 years of marriage during an interview with BUILD Series. \u201cI think the change is that we really manage our time better, so we have our time to be home with our daughter and then we have our time to kind of go to the office and do our work,\u201d Andy said at the time. \u201cWe worked day and night for the first 20 years at Kate Spade, so now we kind of try to have a life at the same time.\u201d\n\nThe pair were recently experiencing marital problems and had separated before her untimely death.\n\nIf you or someone you know is in emotional distress or considering suicide, call the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/56867996_David-Spade-Kate-Spade-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/56867996_David-Spade-Kate-Spade-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-spade-breaks-his-silence-on-kate-spades-death/", "title": "David Spade Breaks His Silence on Kate Spade's Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "David Spade broke his silence on his sister-in-law Kate Spade's death late Tuesday, June 5 \u2014 read what he wrote", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "David Spade Breaks His Silence on Sister-in-Law Kate Spade's Death", "description": "David Spade broke his silence on his sister-in-law Kate Spade's death late Tuesday, June 5 \u2014 read what he wrote", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-spade-breaks-his-silence-on-kate-spades-death/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-06T12:58:52+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/56867996_David-Spade-Kate-Spade-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/56867996_David-Spade-Kate-Spade-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-06T11:55:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-06T12:58:52+00:00"}, "author": "Stephanie Webber", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "David Spade Breaks His Silence on Sister-in-Law Kate Spade's Death", "description": "David Spade broke his silence on his sister-in-law Kate Spade's death late Tuesday, June 5 \u2014 read what he wrote", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/56867996_David-Spade-Kate-Spade-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C76px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528286123.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
