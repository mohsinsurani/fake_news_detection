Their mother is of Dutch, English, and Scottish ancestry,while their father was a third-generation Armenian American.After their parents divorced in 1991, Houghton remarried to the 1976 Summer Olympics decathlon winner Bruce Jenner in 1991. Through their marriage, Kardashian gained step-brothers Burton \"Burt\", Brandon, and Brody; step-sister Casey; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie Jenner\n\nBorn: October 21, 1980 (age 33), Los Angeles, California, United States\n\nSiblings: Khlo Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Kendall Jenner, Kylie Jenner, Rob Kardashian, Brody Jenner, Brandon Jenner\n\nSpouse: Kanye West (m. 2014), Kris Humphries (m. 2011\u20132013), Damon Thomas (m. 2000\u20132004)\n\nParents: Robert Kardashian, Kris Jenner\n\nChildren: North West\n\n2007\u201309: Career beginnings\n\nKardashian attending the Tribeca Film Festival, April 2009\n\n\n\nIn October 2007, Kardashian, in addition to her mother Kris; her step-father Bruce; her siblings Kourtney, Khloe, and Rob; and half-sisters Kendall and Kylie were commissioned by E! to star in the reality television series Keeping Up with the Kardashians.The series proved successful for E!, and has led to the creations of spin-offs including Kourtney and Kim Take New York and Kourtney and Kim Take Miami.That December, Kardashian posed for a nude pictorial for Playboy.\n\n2010: International success\n\nKardashian backstage at The Heart Truth's Red Dress Collection, February 2010\n\n2010 saw Kardashian venture into several new endorsement deals, including endorsing various food products for Carl's Jr.Beginning in early 2010, Kardashian and her sisters designed and developed clothing lines for Bebe stores and 'Virgins, Saints, and Angels'. In January 2010, she starred as Summa Eve in the film Deep in the Valley.In April, Kardashian sparked controversy over the way she held a kitten for a photograph, holding it by the scruff of its neck.\n\n2011: Marriage to Kris Humphries\n\nKardashian in Sydney in November 2011\n\n\n\nKardashian, who has supported recognition of the Armenian Genocide on numerous occasions, encouraged President Obama and the US government to consider its acknowledgement. On April 21, 2011, days before the 96th anniversary of the Armenian Genocide, Kardashian wrote about the issue on her blog and sent a tweet to her fans, urging its recognition.That April, she also released her third fragrance \"Gold\".\n\n\n\nIn May, she became engaged to NBA player Kris Humphries, then of the New Jersey Nets, whom she had been dating since October 2010.They were married during an extravagant wedding ceremony on August 20 in Montecito, California.[58] Earlier that month, she had released her \"wedding fragrance\" called \"Kim Kardashian Love\" which coincided with her own wedding.A two-part TV special showing the preparations and the wedding itself aired on E! in early October 2011, amidst what The Washington Post called a \"media blitz\" related to the wedding. Also in October, Kardashian and her sisters opened their Kardashian Khaos store in Las Vegas.\n\n\n\nAfter 72 days of marriage, she filed for divorce from Humphries on October 31, citing irreconcilable differences. After filing, Kardashian asked the court to order Humphries to pay his own legal expenses.On December 1, Humphries filed his response to Kardashian's petition, requesting an annulment on the grounds of fraud or if the court would not grant an annulment, a decree of legal separation rather than Kardashian's requested divorce.Several news outlets surmised that Kardashian's marriage to Humphries was merely a publicity stunt, to promote the Kardashian family's brand and their subsequent television ventures.Her former publicist Jonathan Jaxson also claimed that her short-lived wedding was indeed staged and a ploy to generate money. Kardashian filed suit against Jaxson, saying his claims were untrue.A widely circulated petition asking to remove all Kardashian-related programming from the air followed the split.\n\n2012\u2013present: Motherhood and marriage to Kanye West\n\n\n\nIn March 2012, Kardashian debuted her fourth fragrance, titled \"True Reflection\", which she worked with the company Dress for Success to promote. That month, Kardashian and her sisters were named in a $5 million class action lawsuit against QuickTrim, the weight loss supplement they endorse. The complaint, filed in the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York, accuses the Kardashians (along with QuickTrim\u2019s manufacturer, Windmill Health Products; the retailer GNC; and others in the sales and marketing chain) of false and deceptive marketing of the diet aid. The plaintiffs, hailing from several states, brought claims under their respective states\u2019 consumer protection laws. In April, E! renewed Keeping Up with the Kardashians for two additional seasons, in a deal reported to be worth $50 million.\n\nKardashian in Australia for the E! News: Red carpet and dinner in 2012\n\n\n\nKardashian also began dating American rapper and longtime friend Kanye West in April, though she remained legally married to Humphries. In October 2012, Kardashian released her fifth fragrance, \"Glam\", which \"draws on the glamour of her Hollywood lifestyle\", and was made available through Debenhams.In November, Kardashian and her sisters internationally launched the 'Kardashian Collection' in England,as well as launching a line of cosmetics, 'Khroma Beauty'.On December 31, 2012, Kardashian and West announced that she was pregnant with the couple's first child,a girl.\n\n\n\nIn February 2013, a judge ruled that Kardashian's divorce case with Humphries would go to trial, and set a trial date for May.However, on April 19, 2013, 536 days after Kardashian's initial divorce filing, she and Humphries reached an undisclosed divorce settlement, avoiding a trial. The divorce was legally finalized on June 3, 2013.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170521021015im_/http://www.biphoo.com/product-images/celebrities-images/1Bill Veeck-5.jpg",
