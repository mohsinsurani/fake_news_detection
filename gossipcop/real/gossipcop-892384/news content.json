Carey Mulligan may be a multi-talented performer, but her abilities don\u2019t carry over behind the wheel.\n\nDuring a Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance on Tuesday, November 7, Mulligan, 32, confessed that she\u2019s failed her driving test \u2026 five times.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s way harder in England! Over there I failed. Here, it\u2019s easy. I did it here \u2014it was a piece of cake,\u201d the actress said. \u201cYou literally drive around the block and they give you a license.\u201d She added, \u201cI could only drive for like six months while I was living here and then I went back to England and I can\u2019t drive anywhere.\u201d\n\nThe Oscar nominee explained that it\u2019s not her skills but stress that gets to her. \u201cIt\u2019s a pressure thing. I am an excellent driver,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I get in a test environment, someone has a clipboard, and my mind explodes. I cannot do anything and I make mistakes.\u201d\n\nMulligan also reminisced about when she used to take the bus to auditions in Los Angeles: \u201cI didn\u2019t have friends so I would just spend my evenings figuring out my bus route.\u201d\n\nThe mom, who welcomed her second baby with husband Marcus Mumford earlier this year, felt an obligation during both pregnancies to finally get her license, but it still hasn\u2019t happened.\n\n\u201cI get quite far into [my first] pregnancy and I think, \u2018Oh, God, I must learn to drive now because I\u2019m going to be a mother. This is irresponsible,'\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m nine months pregnant, I book my test\u2014and I fail. Then I book another, 10 days before I give birth, and I fail that as well.\u201d\n\n\u201c[During my second pregnancy] I think, \u2018I have two children; I should really get a driver\u2019s license.\u2019 So, I wait until I\u2019m nine months pregnant and I take one test and I fail,\u201d she laughed.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/carey-mulligan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C121px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/carey-mulligan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/carey-mulligan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C121px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/carey-mulligan-failed-her-driving-test-five-times/", "title": "Carey Mulligan Failed Her Driving Test Five Times", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Carey Mulligan admitted to failing her driver's test five times during a Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance on Tuesday, November 7 \u2014 see what she said!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Carey Mulligan Failed Her Driving Test Five Times", "description": "Carey Mulligan admitted to failing her driver's test five times during a Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance on Tuesday, November 7 \u2014 see what she said!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/carey-mulligan-failed-her-driving-test-five-times/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:19:00+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/carey-mulligan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C121px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/carey-mulligan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C121px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-08T18:35:08+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:19:00+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Carey Mulligan Failed Her Driving Test Five Times", "description": "Carey Mulligan admitted to failing her driver's test five times during a Jimmy Kimmel Live! appearance on Tuesday, November 7 \u2014 see what she said!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/carey-mulligan-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C121px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510166108.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
