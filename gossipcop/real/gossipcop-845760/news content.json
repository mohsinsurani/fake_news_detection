But going forward, he said, he\u2019s going to take his time making sure they\u2019re all in ideal shape. \u201cI\u2019m not going to shoot anything until it\u2019s written, and it\u2019s perfectly cast, and I get great number twos in terms of showrunners and directors,\u201d he told reporters at the Television Critics Assn. press tour in Pasadena.\n\nIn the era of Peak TV and streaming, he said it\u2019s tempting to rush projects through, and Murphy \u2014 who has been on hand to present three series (\u201cPose,\u201d \u201c9-1-1\u201d and \u201cAmerican Crime Story: Versace\u201d) admitted that he wasn\u2019t happy with the first iteration of \u201cAmerican Crime Story: Katrina,\u201d which is slated as the next installment in that limited series franchise. \u201cI still had a passion for the story, but it wasn\u2019t the right story,\u201d he said. \u201cI do think there\u2019s such a need and expectation to be constantly feeding the machine.\u201d\n\nThe new version \u2014 which is set to star frequent Murphy collaborator Sarah Paulson and go into production in the fall \u2014 will be based on the book \u201cFive Days at Memorial,\u201d in partnership with producer Scott Rudin. \u201cIt\u2019s really a look at the healthcare industry and disasters in global warming,\u201d he said.\u201dWe decided to do a more intimate version of that story, which is much more interesting and topical.\u201d\n\nAdded Murphy of the Katrina story, \u201cSpike Lee did it better.\u201d\n\nAsked what makes for a compelling season of \u201cAmerican Crime Story,\u201d he said, \u201cIt has to be about something that\u2019s a bigger social issue,\u201d he said. \u201cI would never do Jon Benet Ramsay. I would never do the Menendez brothers because \u2026 I don\u2019t know that they were about any meta social themes. I think \u2018American Crime Story\u2019 has to be about a bigger picture.\u201d\n\nMurphy said he was passionate about the upcoming \u201cVersace\u201d because \u201cit was about homophobia in the \u201990s,\u201d he said, pointing to episodes that deal with coming out to parents and being gay in the military. \u201cThose are incredible social stories,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re very slow to do them. And very quick to say this isn\u2019t working, we\u2019re going to try a different take.\u201d\n\nAs for the next season of \u201cFeud,\u201d which will center around the fractured marriage of Charles and Diana, Murphy said he\u2019s pleased with the scripts and is looking ahead to casting. \u201cWe keep moving the date because I\u2019m working on so many great things,\u201d he said. The project was set to shoot in May, but has now been bumped to the fall. He\u2019s not concerned about comparisons to \u201cThe Crown\u201d (which he admits he\u2019s been binge-watching): \u201cOur take is a much different take,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the monarchy, it\u2019s about the marriage.\u201d That project, too, has yet to be cast; he\u2019s also deciding whether he\u2019s going to direct.\n\nThe Monica Lewinsky project is a \u201cvery tricky one,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re interviewing writers,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re not in any rush to do anything unless it\u2019s done right.\u201d Murphy said he\u2019s trying to set up a dinner with Lewinsky: \u201cI think it\u2019s very important that her point of view is present,\u201d he said. \u201cI want to make sure that we do it right, and I think particularly now in this era we have an obligation to do a lot of research.\u201d No actress is lined up for that role (he said he wants to get input from Lewinsky), but he does want Paulson to play Linda Tripp.\n\nPaulson is also set to star in \u201cRatched\u201d for Netflix. Murphy has arced out four seasons, with Paulson\u2019s Nurse Ratched\u2019s origin story as she faces off a different male adversary each season, with the final installment being her opposite the character played by Jack Nicholson in the film (a role yet to be cast). \u201cIt\u2019s also a feminist tale,\u201d he said. \u201cIt really looks at the birth of a lot of things that were happening in our healthcare system.\u201d There\u2019s no start date for \u201cRatched,\u201d either \u2014 Murphy says he\u2019s waiting until all eight scripts are written. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s a little frustrating from a programming point of view,\u201d he admits, but says Landgraf has been patient.\n\nThe next season of \u201cAmerican Horror Story\u201d will be set in the \u201cnear-distant future,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s a projection,\u201d he said.\n\nMurphy also addressed the Fox/Disney deal given the looming expiration of his overall deal. \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen beyond \u2018Pose,\u2019 which is up in June and my contract is up in June,\u201d he said, adding that he\u2019s waiting to see what happens with Dana Walden and John Landgraf. He said he doesn\u2019t know if he will go independent, and that he\u2019s starting to have a lot of meetings. \u201cI feel open, I feel excited, I feel like I have a lot more stories to tell,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m as excited and nervous as they are.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s almost as if the universe did say, \u2018Shut the f\u2013k up and sit down for a beat,'\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryan-murphy-fx-tca.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryan-murphy-fx-tca.jpg?w=1000"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryan-murphy-fx-tca.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Debra Birnbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ryan-murphy-american-crime-story-katrina-american-horror-story-season-8-1202655273/", "title": "Ryan Murphy on \u2018Katrina,\u2019 \u2018Feud\u2019 and \u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Season 8", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Uber producer Ryan Murphy revealed details about the next iterations of \"American Crime Story,\" \"Feud,\" and \"American Horror Story.\"", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202655273, "author": "Debra Birnbaum", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-01-05T17:45:37"}, "pmc-tag": "American Horror Story,Feud,Ryan Murphy,TCA", "title": "Ryan Murphy on \u2018Katrina,\u2019 \u2018Feud\u2019 and \u2018American Horror Story\u2019 Season 8", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Debra Birnbaum", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "application-name": "Variety", "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ryan-murphy-american-crime-story-katrina-american-horror-story-season-8-1202655273/?ia_markup=1"}, "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202655273, "title": "Ryan Murphy on 'Katrina,' 'Feud' and 'American Horror Story' Season 8", "published_at": "2018-01-05 17:45:37", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/ryan-murphy-fx-tca.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 1, "tags": "TCA", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "With a lineup of seven or eight series currently in development or production, uber-producer Ryan Murphy has more than a full plate.
