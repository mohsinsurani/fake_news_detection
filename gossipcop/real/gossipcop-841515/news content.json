Nate organizes Kyle\u2019s entire life from his clothes to food to getting a pair of special roller skates off Ebay. Apparently, Kyle was a jam skater back in the day and has to hone his skills before an interview.\n\nAs Megan and Kyle are having breakfast, Lisbeth calls. Kyle doesn\u2019t answer, but you can tell he\u2019s caught off guard. He goes to Terence to talk it out. Lisbeth is going on TV for an interview. According to the terms of the agreement she signed, she\u2019s not supposed to contact Kyle at all.\n\nTerence is pissed that Lisbeth is back in Kyle\u2019s life. She\u2019s a liability. He warns Kyle that she \u201cknows everything about you that nobody is supposed to know.\u201d As much as Terence wants to get involved, Kyle wants to set his own boundaries with Lisbeth. He can\u2019t act like his past doesn\u2019t exist. He admits to Terence that he\u2019s already called Lisbeth back and wished her well.\n\nThe reason for Lisbeth\u2019s call isn\u2019t coincidental. She\u2019s broke and has been kicked off a movie for being late and having meltdowns. She\u2019s spiraling and wants to drag Kyle down with her.\n\nDon\u2019t Be Stupid\n\nMeanwhile, Megan and the director, Nate, are still flirting as they work on the play. Leslie notices and gives Megan a lecture. More than anything else, Megan is under contract and has it made being Kyle\u2019s girlfriend. Don\u2019t be stupid, Leslie advises.\n\nMegan winds up listening to Lisbeth\u2019s interview. Even though she left Kyle on their wedding day, she declares that Kyle is the love of her life! Kyle walks in on Megan listening to all of this and assures her that Lisbeth\u2019s confession doesn\u2019t change anything. \u201cYou\u2019re the center of my world,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not changing.\u201d However, he does basically admit that he\u2019s not completely over Lisbeth. At least he\u2019s being honest!\n\nTerence has an even bigger problem on his hands than Lisbeth. The LAPD detective stops by IHM again to tell Terence that a body\u2019s been found, and she thinks it\u2019s Sophie, Kyle\u2019s former therapist and booty call. Terence, what the heck did you do?!\n\nNate is so in love with Megan. He truly thinks they\u2019re meant to be together and wants her to leave Kyle. She can\u2019t believe what she\u2019s hearing and thinks he\u2019s crazy. This is the same girl who met Kyle West and went to Mexico with him on the same day. She walks out, but Nate ends up in the car. He pleads with her to drive to the desert to spend one night together to see what they have.\n\nThis guy is a stage 5 clinger. Run, Megan, run! Suddenly, a car rear ends them. It\u2019s same car who followed Megan at the bonfire! Megan immediately goes to Kyle and asks if Terence is having her followed. He secretly knows that Terence has been because he goes to confront his mentor the next day at the Institute. He interrupts Terence talking with the security guy, Connor, who killed Sophie.\n\nBlast From The Past\n\nKyle demands that Terence stop having Megan followed. Kyle swears Megan\u2019s not hiding anything and won\u2019t hurt him. Terence storms out. His life is starting to spiral. It just gets worse. When Terence and Connor meet up to talk it out again, Connor shoots himself in the head in front of Terence.\n\nLater, Lisbeth stops by Kyle\u2019s place. Kyle keeps her at a distance, but she manages to get under his skin. \u201cI meant every word,\u201d she tells him about the interview. \u201cI love you. I always will.\u201d\n\nKyle doesn\u2019t say anything like, \u201cI don\u2019t love you anymore.\u201d No, all he says is, \u201cYou left.\u201d They kiss! Kyle tells her, \u201cYou left. We can\u2019t go back.\u201d Lisbeth urges Kyle that if he wants his relationship with Megan to work, then stay away from Terence and the Institute. If he wants to ruin his relationship, she\u2019s always available.\n\nKyle ends up buying Megan a new Maserati, partly because she needed one and likely because he\u2019s feeling guilty about Lisbeth. While this may seem like an over-the-top present, this is nothing for Kyle. He can afford 100 Maseratis.\n\nA Deal Made By The Devil\n\nTerence meets with the detective. The Sophie case is pretty much closed, but she\u2019s not letting it go. She knows there\u2019s something going on. He\u2019s willing to pay her any amount of money, but she doesn\u2019t want that. She wants something else, rather someone else. The detective wants to have sex with Kyle. That\u2019s all. If Kyle agrees, she\u2019ll drop the investigation.\n\nKyle refuses at first, but Terence goes for the jugular. He tells Kyle to remember everything he\u2019s fixed for him. \u201cI made you and I love you, but I will end you in a heartbeat if I have to,\u201d he says. BOOM. So that\u2019s where Terence really stands.\n\nIn case you didn\u2019t already know, Anika is batsh*t crazy. She initiates a racy rendezvous with Deann in the car, but things take a turn when Anika starts CHOKING Deann! But Deann doesn\u2019t run in the other direction. After the studio tells that Kyle\u2019s directorial debut film isn\u2019t happening, she goes to Anika\u2019s to let loose.\n\nMegan professes her love to Kyle and reveals how happy she truly is with him just as he\u2019s about to do something really shady. To make everything worst, Terence watches the whole encounter between Kyle and the detective. He\u2019s taking creepy to an insanely dark and twisted level. Terence is disgusting. Kyle should get an Oscar for his performance.\n\nWhen it\u2019s over, the light in Kyle\u2019s eyes have darkened. He looks lost. He still makes it to Megan\u2019s play. Megan is incredible. Kyle cries in the audience, but not about Megan\u2019s performance. He\u2019s crying about what he just did and how he has to keep it from Megan. Just when Kyle gets himself out of a hole, Terence pushes him in another one.\n\nHollywoodLifers, what did you think of tonight\u2019s episode of The Arrangement?
