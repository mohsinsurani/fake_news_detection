The reality star, 38, was spotted in Atlanta, Georgia, on Monday, showing off her trim figure seven months after revealing she dropped 300 lbs. in a drastic body transformation.\n\nFor her outing, Shannon was all smiles, dressed in athletic wear with a gray long-sleeve shirt and patterned form-fitting leggings.\n\nShannon appears to be maintaining her weight \u2014 something she previously told PEOPLE she planned on doing with better food decisions, exercise and portion control after going from 460 lbs. to a size 4 following gastric sleeve surgery in 2015.\n\nMEGA\n\n\u201cI can promise you I\u2019m never going back to that size. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at,\u201d she said.\n\nThen in February, viewers watched Shannon\u2019s stunning transformation on WE tv\u2019s Mama June: From Not to Hot as the mother of four spent upwards of $75,000 to have gastric sleeve surgery, breast augmentation and 9 lbs. of skin removal surgery on her \u201cturkey neck,\u201d \u201cbat wings\u201d and stomach.\n\nRELATED GALLERY: From \u2018Sketti to Skinny: Mama June\u2019s Eye-Popping Weight Loss Journey in Photos\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of crazy. A lot of people don\u2019t recognize who I am until I talk,\u201d Shannon told PEOPLE Now in April. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like I\u2019m in my own disguise. Normally when I walk through the streets, everybody notices me, and now it\u2019s like nobody [does].\u201d\n\nLarry Busacca/Getty Images for GLAAD; Paras Griffin/Getty Images\n\nInstead, she\u2019s been flaunting her body with her new wardrobe.\n\nShannon has shown off her new size 4 figure multiple times, stepping into a red-hot revenge dress, which served as motivation for her to attend ex Mike \u201cSugar Bear\u201d Thompson\u2019s wedding, and even sporting a fitted one-piece red bathing suit for a Baywatch-inspired photo shoot.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t consider a tummy tuck or face skin removal \u2018plastic surgery.\u2019 I believe it\u2019s something that makes you feel better than you did with the skin hanging,\u201d she previously told PEOPLE. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I\u2019m Miss Plastic.\u201d", "images":
