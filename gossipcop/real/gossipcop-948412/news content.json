The couple exchanged vows on Saturday, July 1, Us Weekly can confirm.\n\n\u201cWhat a joy it is to be husband and wife!\u201d the newlyweds told Us in a statement. \u201cOur wedding day was absolutely perfect! What was even more perfect was to see my beautiful bride walking down the aisle. We are so thankful the Lord has brought us to this place and we can\u2019t wait to begin our journey as husband and wife!\u201d\n\nUs exclusively revealed the duo\u2019s engagement in March. \u201cThis is an exciting, big step in our lives and the whole thing was very meaningful,\u201d the Counting On star, 21, said at the time of popping the question to Swanson, 18. \u201cThe place where I proposed to Lauren is the exact spot where her parents were engaged. There\u2019s a lot of family history on this property, making it a special place for Lauren.\u201d\n\nSwanson added: \u201cI\u2019m really excited to be getting married to Josiah. Everything about engagement was such a special moment for me. I\u2019m especially looking forward to spending the rest of my life with him!\u201d\n\nBack in January, Us broke the news that the pair were courting after years of friendship. Swanson dished via a video message on the Duggar family website that she was \u201ctotally shocked\u201d when Duggar showed interest in courting her because, at the time, they were still \u201clearning more about each other\u201d and \u201cputting God first and ourselves second.\u201d\n\nTLC\u2019s Counting On returns Monday, July 30, at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Josiah-Duggar-Lauren-Swanson-zoom.jpg?crop=27px%2C100px%2C1973px%2C1035px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Josiah-Duggar-Lauren-Swanson-zoom.jpg?crop=27px%2C100px%2C1973px%2C1035px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/counting-on-josiah-duggar-marries-lauren-swanson-photo/", "title": "Counting On\u2019s Josiah Duggar Marries Lauren Swanson: Photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Sealed the deal! \u2018Counting On\u2019 star Josiah Duggar wed Lauren Swanson three months after the couple announced their engagement \u2014 get the details and see their wedding photo!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Josiah Duggar and Lauren Swanson Are Married: Pic", "description": "Sealed the deal! \u2018Counting On\u2019 star Josiah Duggar wed Lauren Swanson three months after the couple announced their engagement \u2014 get the details and see their wedding photo!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/counting-on-josiah-duggar-marries-lauren-swanson-photo/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-30T22:45:52+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Josiah-Duggar-Lauren-Swanson-zoom.jpg?crop=27px%2C100px%2C1973px%2C1035px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Josiah-Duggar-Lauren-Swanson-zoom.jpg?crop=27px%2C100px%2C1973px%2C1035px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-30T22:45:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-30T22:45:52+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Josiah Duggar and Lauren Swanson Are Married: Pic", "description": "Sealed the deal! \u2018Counting On\u2019 star Josiah Duggar wed Lauren Swanson three months after the couple announced their engagement \u2014 get the details and see their wedding photo!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Josiah-Duggar-Lauren-Swanson-zoom.jpg?crop=27px%2C100px%2C1973px%2C1035px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530398756.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
