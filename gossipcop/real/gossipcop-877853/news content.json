But although Kylie has scored when it comes to making money as the family's cosmetics queen, Jenner hasn't exactly been a solid hit with reviewers and critical fans on her new show, Life Of Kylie. Despite that failure, Kylie has followers who are willing to pay big bucks to try to look like their reality TV princess, with her cosmetics empire continuing to expand even as the ratings for her show reportedly are in a downward spiral.\n\n\"Kylie Jenner...throws a fit at the dinner table when she finds out she can't eat anything being served!\"\n\nTalking to the camera, Kylie's friend Jordyn Woods, 19, explained what led up to her pal's cranky explosion.\n\n\"When Kylie doesn't eat the whole day, she's not Kylie. She's\u2026a monster.\"\n\n\"I just need some f*cking spaghetti. Mom, I'm really hungry, you know? I just don't think that this is gonna like, really fill me up.\"\n\n\"When you're hungry you don't f*cking want that, you know?\" complained Victoria.\n\nAs for what fans think, many are noting that there's more to be learned about Jenner by following her social media rather than watching her reality TV show. Kylie has emphasized her desire to keep part of her life private, in contrast to her older sisters such as Kim Kardashian who have been willing to bare all (sometimes literally) for Keeping Up With Kardashians.\n\nAmid the rumors that the show is not doing well, however, the E network told Refinery29 that Life of Kylie \"is currently averaging about 1 million viewers between the ages of 18 and 49, and 1.5 million viewers total.\" That update took place on August 21.\n\nHowever, the most recent episode attracted only 666,000 total viewers, showing a drop in the critical group of adults ages 18 to 49 as well as overall viewership, according to In Touch Weekly on September 6.\n\n\"People would rather watch Weather Channel Live and HGTV...than Life of Kylie because the show came in 21st place out of 25 programs for its...time slot.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c4ca7c76-1956-4818-b67f-af1d1f0cfe0c.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa8aa86244d76bf2aee7e2fb5b934ea3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5d5cf9e5-a519-4c4c-a12e-46eff7aecb30.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4484553/kylie-jenner-turns-into-monster-on-life-of-kylie-tv-show-cancellation-rumors-soar-as-ratings-fall/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Turns Into 'Monster' On 'Life Of Kylie:' TV Show Cancellation Rumors Soar As Ratings Fall", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner Turns Into 'Monster' On 'Life Of Kylie:' TV Show Cancellation Rumors Soar As Ratings Fall", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4484553/kylie-jenner-turns-into-monster-on-life-of-kylie-tv-show-cancellation-rumors-soar-as-ratings-fall/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Kylie Jenner Turns Into 'Monster' On 'Life Of Kylie:' TV Show Cancellation Rumors Soar As Ratings Fall", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-09-09 10:02:06Z", "section": "Rumors"}, "description": "Kylie Jenner Turns Into 'Monster' On 'Life Of Kylie:' TV Show Cancellation Rumors Soar As Ratings Fall", "keywords": "Rumors", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504951326.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
