Real Housewives of New York City alum Jill Zarin\u2019s husband, Bobby Zarin, has been hospitalized as he continues to battle thyroid cancer.\n\n\u201cBobby is back in the hospital,\u201d a source close to the couple told Us Weekly. \u201cHe\u2019s not doing well right now.\u201d\n\nThe TV personality, 53, and the businessman, 71, have been getting support from some of their RHONY pals. \u201cDorinda [Medley], Ramona [Singer] and some of the other housewives have been stopping by to visit him,\u201d the source adds.\n\nJill is supposed to be hosting her annual Luxury Luncheon at her Southhampton residence on Saturday, July 29, to raise money for thyroid cancer research. \u201cJill has her annual Hamptons party this weekend,\u201d the insider noted. \u201cShe\u2019s not sure if she\u2019ll be able to make it.\u201d\n\nBobby, who owns Zarin Fabrics, was first diagnosed with thyroid cancer in June 2009. He had his thyroid removed and underwent treatment, but the cancer returned in 2013 and spread to his lungs.\n\nJill revealed to Us in November that her husband\u2019s cancer continued to spread. \u201cWe received the news last week that Bobby\u2019s cancer has spread to his brain,\u201d Jill told Us in a statement at the time. \u201cWe remain strong during this difficult time with the love and support of our family, friends, and fans who remind us that we are not alone in our fight against cancer. Cancer is a disease that affects people all around the world and we must unite through this common bond, and work together to find a cure once and for all.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobby-zarin-jill-zarin-e7ae231b-63a9-47d5-83d2-6fe13d830308.jpg?crop=164px%2C1px%2C937px%2C491px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobby-zarin-jill-zarin-e7ae231b-63a9-47d5-83d2-6fe13d830308.jpg?crop=184px%2C0px%2C897px%2C503px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobby-zarin-jill-zarin-e7ae231b-63a9-47d5-83d2-6fe13d830308.jpg?crop=164px%2C1px%2C937px%2C491px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jill-zarins-husband-bobby-hospitalized-amid-cancer-battle-w494795/", "title": "Jill Zarin\u2019s Husband Bobby Hospitalized Amid Cancer Battle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jill Zarin\u2019s husband, Bobby Zarin, is back in the hospital and \u2018not doing well\u2019 as he battles cancer \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jill Zarin\u2019s Husband Bobby Hospitalized Amid Cancer Battle", "description": "Jill Zarin\u2019s husband, Bobby Zarin, is back in the hospital and \u2018not doing well\u2019 as he battles cancer \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jill-zarins-husband-bobby-hospitalized-amid-cancer-battle-w494795/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:47:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobby-zarin-jill-zarin-e7ae231b-63a9-47d5-83d2-6fe13d830308.jpg?crop=164px%2C1px%2C937px%2C491px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobby-zarin-jill-zarin-e7ae231b-63a9-47d5-83d2-6fe13d830308.jpg?crop=164px%2C1px%2C937px%2C491px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-07-28T18:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:47:05+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jill Zarin\u2019s Husband Bobby Hospitalized Amid Cancer Battle", "description": "Jill Zarin\u2019s husband, Bobby Zarin, is back in the hospital and \u2018not doing well\u2019 as he battles cancer \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/bobby-zarin-jill-zarin-e7ae231b-63a9-47d5-83d2-6fe13d830308.jpg?crop=164px%2C1px%2C937px%2C491px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501264800.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
