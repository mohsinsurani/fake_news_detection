It showed Family Guy\u2019s infant Stewie running naked screaming, \u201cHelp! I\u2019ve escaped from Kevin Spacey\u2019s basement!\u201d\n\nBut that 2005 animated clip went viral when Spacey was accused of assaulting several young men in a November 2017 bombshell that lost the 58-year-old actor his House Of Cards gig and led him to \u201cseek evaluation and treatment\u201d.\n\nFamily Guy creator, and star, Seth MacFarlane said on Thursday at the Television Critics Association\u2019s Winter Press Tour he wasn\u2019t the one who pitched the controversial joke that made its way into the years-old episode and left many fans wondering what MacFarlane knew about Spacey ahead of the public revelations.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t remember who pitched the joke,\u201d he told reporters on Thursday. \u201cI remember when it was pitched that was a rumour that I had actually not heard, and other writers in the writers\u2019 room had. It had to be explained to me.\u201d\n\nShowrunner Alec Sulkin said he too wasn\u2019t the one who came up with it, but he remembered a bit more about its genesis. He said the timing of the quip came because Spacey initially said he had been attacked by a young person in London one night in 2004. Later, he changed his story and said he tripped over his dog after the young person mugged him.\n\n\u201cI think he had sort of been beaten up in a London park and he claimed he was walking his dog and fell and I think that sort of raised a lot of eyebrows,\u201d Sulkin recalled.\n\nMacFarlane insisted the show doesn\u2019t have a sixth sense running the writers\u2019 room.\n\n\u201cThe idea that Family Guy is this cartoon Ouija board that predicts things \u2026 I was just watching things happen from afar,\u201d he told the room full of journalists on Thursday. \u201cI think it\u2019s sort of modern media. The idea that it\u2019s more important to be first than to be right. It\u2019s a strange thing to observe. We write our show the same way as everyone else. We make the same kind of topical jokes that The Simpsons does, [that] South Park does. And you work with what you have whether that be swirling rumours or political [material].\u201d\n\nThe show previously made headlines for a 2009 quip in which Stewie called then Bruce Jenner \u201can elegant, beautiful Dutch woman\u201d. In 2015, the former Olympian opened up about being transgender and began using the name Caitlyn Jenner.\n\n\u201cThe myth that Family Guy is this Kreskin-like prognosticator of this kind of stuff is a little bit sensationalised,\u201d MacFarlane insisted.\n\nThe show is currently celebrating its upcoming 300th episode.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know that anyone ever really expected this show to go this long,\u201d he added.\n\nHe said the show has evolved \u201cwith the times\u201d which has enabled it to succeed.\n\nThis story originally appeared on Fox News and is republished here with
