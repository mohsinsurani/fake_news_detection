I literally know nothing.\u201d\n\nYet reacting to the constant stream of social media criticism, she says, can be a \u201cmaddening game,\u201d adding: \u201cThey want you to stand for something, but once you do, and if you don\u2019t do it perfectly, they\u2019re ready to take you right down.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Katy Perry changes Taylor Swift \u2018Swish Swish\u2019 lyric, tears her pants during livestream concert\n\nShe describes her new album, Witness, as being perfectly reflective of where she\u2019s at now. \u201cIt\u2019s a departure, and it\u2019s a necessary evolution that I have to take,\u201d she says of her new direction.\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cAnd I know that sometimes it feels publicly like I\u2019m dragging cement blocks, but like, the pyramids were made out of cement blocks \u2014 or not cement,\u201d she adds. \u201cBut do you know what I\u2019m trying to say?
