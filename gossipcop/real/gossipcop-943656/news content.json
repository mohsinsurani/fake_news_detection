Tagged as coming \u201cfrom the imagination of Tim Burton,\u201d the film\u2019s new trailer presents a surprisingly grounded vision of the tale of a flying elephant with giant ears.\n\nThe trailer comes with this synopsis:\n\nCircus owner Max Medici (Danny DeVito) enlists former star Holt Farrier (Colin Farrell) and his children Milly (Nico Parker) and Joe (Finley Hobbins) to care for a newborn elephant whose oversized ears make him a laughingstock in an already struggling circus. But when they discover that Dumbo can fly, the circus makes an incredible comeback, attracting persuasive entrepreneur V.A. Vandevere (Michael Keaton), who recruits the peculiar pachyderm for his newest, larger-than-life entertainment venture, Dreamland. Dumbo soars to new heights alongside a charming and spectacular aerial artist, Colette Marchant (Eva Green), until Holt learns that beneath its shiny veneer, Dreamland is full of dark secrets.\n\nBased on what we see in the trailer, Burton\u2019s Dumbo reimagining does a better job of capturing the magic of its source material than his garish 2010 film Alice in Wonderland, also for Disney, which doubled down on many of the director\u2019s worst instincts. Scored to a haunting cover of \u201cBaby Mine\u201d from Norwegian singer-songwriter AURORA, as with the first teaser, this reimagining may just bring you to tears.\n\nDumbo lands in theaters on March 29, 2019.\n\nWatch the trailer (and video of AURORA performing in the Paste Studio) below, and check out the film\u2019s new poster further down.", "images": ["https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/dumbotrailer_main.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/dumbotrailer_main.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Images Via Disney", "Oktay Ege Kozak", "Anna Haas", "Pete Mercer", "Paul Rohrbach", "Jim Vorel", "Garrett Martin", "Jacob Oller", "Kathy Michelle Chac\u00f3n", "Paste Movies Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/dumbo/dumbo-comes-to-life-in-first-trailer-for-disneys-l/", "title": "Dumbo Comes to Life in First Trailer for Disney\u2019s Live-Action Remake", "meta_data": {"title": "Dumbo Comes to Life in First Trailer for Disney\u2019s Live-Action Remake - Paste Magazine", "description": "Tagged as coming \"from the imagination of Tim Burton,\" the film's new trailer presents a surprisingly grounded vision of the tale of a flying elephant with giant ears.", "keywords": "disney, dumbo, tim burton, Dumbo Comes to Life in First Trailer for Disney\u2019s Live-Action Remake, News, News, Articles, Paste", "news_keywords": "disney, dumbo, tim burton", "fb": {"admins": 1185614656, "app_id": 127550380613969, "pages": 18512903240}, "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Paste Magazine", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/dumbotrailer_main.jpg", "width": 633, "height": 356}, "type": "article", "url": "https://www.pastemagazine.com/movies/dumbo/dumbo-comes-to-life-in-first-trailer-for-disneys-l/", "title": "Dumbo Comes to Life in First Trailer for Disney\u2019s Live-Action Remake", "site_name": "pastemagazine.com", "description": "Tagged as coming \u201cfrom the imagination of Tim Burton,\u201d the film's new trailer presents a surprisingly grounded vision of the tale of a flying elephant with giant ears."}, "article": {"tag": "tim burton", "section": "Movies", "published_time": "2018-11-15T11:13:24-08:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-15T11:28:26-08:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/PasteMagazine"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@pastemagazine", "title": "Dumbo Comes to Life in First Trailer for Disney\u2019s Live-Action Remake", "description": "Tagged as coming \u201cfrom the imagination of Tim Burton,\u201d the film's new trailer presents a surprisingly grounded vision of the tale of a flying elephant with giant ears.", "image": "https://cdn.pastemagazine.com/www/articles/dumbotrailer_main.jpg"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "8f36922bc91ba221f10d82c407d8b6a9"}, "viewport": "viewport-fit=cover, width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542309204.0, "source": "https://www.pastemagazine.com", "summary": ""}
