He was diagnosed with liver cancer in November 2016 and the singer, 42, and his wife put their careers on hold while their little boy underwent treatment. (The pair also share a second son, Elias, 2.)\n\nA source told Us in December 2017 that Noah is \u201cdoing well\u201d now and \u201cMichael is ready to think about going back to work.\u201d\n\nBut the source added that the couple\u2019s focus remains on their family. \u201cThis difficult time has brought them closer together and put things in perspective,\u201d the source said. \u201cMichael is keeping his workload light so he can spend as much time as possible\u201d with his wife and sons.\n\nThe \u201cFeeling Good\u201d singer gave an update about Noah\u2019s condition to Us last February. \u201cWe are so grateful to report that our son Noah has been progressing well during his treatment and the doctors are very optimistic about the future for our little boy,\u201d Bubl\u00e9 told Us at the time. \u201cHe has been brave throughout and we continue to be inspired by his courage.\u201d\n\nLopilato opened up about Noah\u2019s health and the impact it had on their family in an interview on Argentinian TV last July.\n\n\u201cThese things, when they happen to you in life, they make you realize that the most important thing isn\u2019t what you thought it was \u2014 it\u2019s to have faith, to be strong,\u201d she told TV host Susana Giminez. \u201cThere were nights I couldn\u2019t sleep, that I prayed to God, because it\u2019s a long process. But thank God the worst is over.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michael-buble-luisana-lopilato-pregnant-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1220px%2C640px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michael-buble-luisana-lopilato-pregnant-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1220px%2C690px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michael-buble-luisana-lopilato-pregnant-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1220px%2C640px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michael-buble-wife-luisana-lopilato-expecting-baby-number-three/", "title": "Michael Buble, Wife Luisana Lopilato Expecting Baby No. 3", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Michael Buble and his wife, Luisana Lopilato, are expecting their third child, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Michael Buble, Wife Luisana Lopilato Expecting Baby No. 3", "description": "Michael Buble and his wife, Luisana Lopilato, are expecting their third child, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michael-buble-wife-luisana-lopilato-expecting-baby-number-three/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-27T21:37:28+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michael-buble-luisana-lopilato-pregnant-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1220px%2C640px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michael-buble-luisana-lopilato-pregnant-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1220px%2C640px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-02-03T22:06:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-27T21:37:28+00:00"}, "author": "Kathy Campbell", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Michael Buble, Wife Luisana Lopilato Expecting Baby No. 3", "description": "Michael Buble and his wife, Luisana Lopilato, are expecting their third child, Us Weekly can confirm \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/michael-buble-luisana-lopilato-pregnant-expecting.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1220px%2C640px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517695609.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
