Here\u2019s everything we know about \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d Season 2, streaming Friday.\n\nSeven New Actors Joined the Cast\n\nThe show\u2019s ensemble cast expands in the second season to include seven new recurring characters played by Anne Winters, Bryce Cass, Chelsea Alden, Allison Miller, Samantha Logan, Kelli O\u2019Hara, and Ben Lawson. Winters plays Liberty High\u2019s newest head cheerleader and beautiful \u201cit girl\u201d Chloe; Cass plays the edgy and mischievous Cyrus; Alden plays Cyrus\u2019 artsy, witty, and outspoken sister Mackenzie; Logan plays respected track star Nina; O\u2019Hara plays a passionate advocate for bullying victims named Jackie; Miller plays a smart and ambitious young litigator named Sonya; and Lawson rounds out the newcomers as Liberty High\u2019s beloved baseball coach, Rick.\n\nKatherine Langford Returns as Hannah Baker\n\nWhile Langford\u2019s character died by suicide in the Season 1 finale, Hannah will reappear in flashbacks and as a haunting figment of characters\u2019 imaginations in the second season. Earlier this month at Netflix\u2019s annual FYSee Kick-Off event in Los Angeles, newcomer Lawson commented on Hannah\u2019s role in Season 2. \u201cWe also see a lot more of what Hannah\u2019s story involved,\u201d Lawson revealed. \u201cThat\u2019s not over. You\u2019ll see a lot more of what happened in the lead up to her suicide.\u201d Langford received a 2018 Golden Globe nomination for her portrayal of Hannah in Season 1.\n\nThe Writers Heard Viewer Criticisms\n\nThe most-tweeted-about show of 2017, \u201c13 Reasons Why\u201d viewers did not hesitate to share their thoughts on Season 1\u2019s handling of difficult topics such as suicide, sexual violence, and bullying. One common critique of the show argued that none of its bully characters faced sufficient consequences for their actions. At the FYSee event, Derek Luke, who plays school guidance counselor Kevin Porter, told Variety that the feedback informed the Season 2 script. \u201cOur Season 2 was affected obviously by the writers\u2019 room, but it was also affected by the outcry of fans who wanted some type of redemption,\u201d Luke said. \u201cWe all went in there feeling a burden to deal with the hurt. Some of that hurt is in the shape of an antagonist that I think people will love to see get dealt with.\u201d\n\nTrigger Warnings Will Precede New Episodes\n\nAfter Netflix conducted multiple studies which found the show had a significant cultural impact, igniting tough conversations and causing viewers to take action in regard to its address of serious issues, the streaming giant announced a formatting change for Season 2 which will feature a warning video to air prior to each episode. In the video, stars Langford, Minnette, Boe, and Justin Prentice warn viewers of potentially triggering topics to come and encourage fans to seek help via crisis resources and a viewing guide to 13ReasonsWhy.Info. Additionally, Season 2 episodes will be followed by new after-show content titled \u201cBeyond the Reasons,\u201d in which actors, experts, and educators will break down each installment\u2019s darker plot threads.\n\nLiberty High Students Face Justice\n\nThe new trailer for Season 2 picks up where the first season left off as Clay, Jessica, Bryce, and the rest of the Liberty High crew testify in a court case Hannah\u2019s parents have filed against the school. In the process of recounting details from the events leading up to Hannah\u2019s suicide, the students also have to face their own personal experiences and truths, expanding on each character\u2019s Season 1 demons.\n\nAdult Characters Evolve, Too\n\nIt\u2019s not only the teenagers who have to come to terms with their respective knowledge and mistakes. The show\u2019s adults, including parents and school faculty members, cannot avoid the harsh realities of a local teen\u2019s suicide as Hannah\u2019s death becomes increasingly publicized. Luke also commented on adult characters\u2019 new Season 2 outlook at the FYSee event. \u201cThe word \u2018accountability\u2019 now for the adults is different because in our story the story has gone public,\u201d Luke said. \u201cSo, anytime you\u2019re in the media\u2019s eye the emotions and the weight get even heavier. I think this season everyone\u2019s looking [for] who to blame, especially the adults.\u201d\n\nSheri Grapples With Guilt\n\nSeason 1 left Sheri in a fragile emotional state as Hannah\u2019s tapes forced her to confront the reality that she took out a stop sign resulting in the death of a classmate, adding to Hannah\u2019s stress as a passenger. At the FYSee event, actress Ajiona Alexus said Season 2 will continue to explore her character\u2019s damaged psyche as she grapples with the guilt and trauma of her secret. Alexus acknowledged that the solution for bullying comes from consequences and \u201cat the end of Season 1, I think you kind of feel like people got away with it.\u201d\n\nPOPULAR ON VARIETY:", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/13-21.jpg", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/13-reasons-why.jpg?w=1000", "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/13rw_203_02742r1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/13-reasons-why.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/rexfeatures_8827691bm.jpg", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/13rw_201_01770r1.jpg", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/13-reasons-why.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christi Carras"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/13-reasons-why-season-2-netflix-katherine-langford-1202812754/", "title": "Everything We Know About \u201913 Reasons Why\u2019 Season 2", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "The Season 2 premiere of Netflix's buzzy teen drama \"13 Reasons Why\" is fast approaching.
