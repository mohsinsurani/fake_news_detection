Time\n\nKatherine Heigl is showing off the results of her 14-month effort to take off the weight after giving birth to her son Joshua Bishop in Dec. 2016.\n\nAnd it's impressive.\n\nHeigl, 39, posted a series of three photos on Instagram showing the progress.\n\n\"It\u2019s been almost 14 months since Joshua Jr was born and it has taken me about that long to really get back in shape,\" Heigl wrote months before she will embark onto USA Network's Suits, replacing the spot left by Meghan Markle.\n\nThe first photo was taken one month after Joshua's birth, the second was a year later.\n\nMore: Katherine Heigl, husband Josh Kelley welcome baby boy Joshua Bishop\n\n\"I wish I had a few from in between the first and second so you could really see how slow my progress was but alas...I was busy covering it all up those months, not posing in my unders!\" Heigl wrote.\n\nThe third, final shot was taken over the past weekend. Heigl says she was inspired by a beach vacation, Suits starting in April \"and my deep desire to feel fit, strong and sexy.\"\n\nThe last two-month push finally allowed her \"to lose the last of my baby weight and do a deep dive search for the ab muscles I knew were buried under that belly somewhere!\" Heigl wrote.\n\n\"I am so grateful I\u2019ve had a full year to find those ab muscles and get my butt back up where it belongs and wasn\u2019t forced by work to snap back into shape,\" Heigl wrote. \"But it is time to make the strength, fitness and overall health of my body a priority.\"\n\nHeigl gave props to the Bikini Body Guide and the accompanying app Sweat.\n\nThe workouts are tough. \"But the progress I\u2019ve made in only 5 short weeks has kept me motivated and inspired to keep going!\" Heigl wrote.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0546bb1e4fb1d6bbea79022bb5db5e5fe70e1b71/c=0-194-3000-1889/local/-/media/2018/02/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636546791223550401-D01-GD-02--97073781.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5736857715001_5736848752001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0546bb1e4fb1d6bbea79022bb5db5e5fe70e1b71/c=0-194-3000-1889/local/-/media/2018/02/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636546791223550401-D01-GD-02--97073781.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryan Alexander"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/19/katherine-heigl-shows-off-her-14-month-post-baby-weight-loss-journey/353755002/", "title": "Katherine Heigl shows off her 14-month post-baby weight loss journey", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/02/19/katherine-heigl-shows-off-her-14-month-post-baby-weight-loss-journey/353755002/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Katherine Heigl shows off her 14-month post-baby weight loss journey", "description": "Heigl shows photo proof of her progress, getting back to shape after giving birth to her son Joshua in Dec. 2016.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/0546bb1e4fb1d6bbea79022bb5db5e5fe70e1b71/c=0-194-3000-1889/local/-/media/2018/02/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636546791223550401-D01-GD-02--97073781.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Heigl shows photo proof of her progress, getting back to shape after giving birth to her son Joshua in Dec. 2016.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518998400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
