(Kate is a Royal Patron of EACH.)\n\nIn the message, mom-of-two Kate highlights the pediatric palliative care and hospice services that exist for the U.K.\u2019s 49,000 children and young people with life-limiting conditions.\n\n\u201cFor any parent, being told that your child may have a life-limiting condition, or may die young, will be one of the most difficult and isolating experiences you can face,\u201d she says. \u201cHaving someone to help you come to terms with this news, and the professional support and care that comes with this, can make an enormous difference. It can help families make the most of every precious moment they have together.\u201d\n\nKate explains that EACH creates an incredible difference in the lives and well-being of children and their loved ones.\n\n\u201cFor these families, having expert care and support is vital, and this is what children\u2019s hospices provide,\u201d she says. \u201cThey deliver first class care in a safe environment that feels as close to home as possible, full of color, warmth, love and support.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cToday as we mark the beginning of Children\u2019s Hospice Week, I hope you will join me in shining a light on the dedicated and inspirational staff and volunteers, and the lifeline services they provide for children and their families. The work they do is extraordinary, and it really does make a world of difference.\u201d\n\nWATCH: How Princess Kate Is Changing the Royal Parenting Rules\n\nThe video plays to \u201cLego House\u201d by the charity\u2019s ambassador Sheeran, who has frequently sold some of his clothes and memorabilia to support the cause.\n\nEACH currently supports 368 children and young people living with a life-threatening condition in Cambridgeshire, Norfolk, Suffolk and North Essex. Many of these children have complex health conditions and need round-the-clock care.\n\n\u201cThe video message recognizes the hard work and expertise of our staff and volunteers, as well as the range of excellent services that we provide,\u201d Graham Butland, EACH Chief Executive said in a statement. \u201cChildren\u2019s Hospice Week is a key date in our calendar and we hope that people will join us by getting involved by raising money and awareness of children\u2019s palliative care services.\u201d", "images":
