The clause can be added to contracts for actors and others working on a movie, requiring that the movie\u2019s producers hire a diverse cast and crew. If the movie wasn\u2019t diverse, it would give the actor a legal reason to back out of the contract \u2014 meaning the rider could have a serious effect on all the hiring practices on a film.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jimmykimmel2018oscars.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/07/Beatrice-Verhoeven-96x96.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thewrap-film-slate.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo_Small.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo-Stacked.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Image-2022-04-26-at-3.00.43-PM-300x81.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beatrice Verhoeven"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/jodie-foster-actual-reason-crutches-oscars-and-it-wasnt-meryls-fault/", "title": "Jodie Foster\u2019s Oscar-Night Crutches Explained \u2013 No, It Wasn\u2019t Meryl\u2019s Fault", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f9f9f9", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-title": "Jodie Foster\u2019s Oscar-Night Crutches Explained \u2013 No, It Wasn\u2019t Meryl\u2019s Fault", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/jodie-foster-actual-reason-crutches-oscars-and-it-wasnt-meryls-fault/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-03-05T07:46:13-08:00", "parsely-section": "awards", "parsely-author": "Beatrice Verhoeven", "parsely-tags": "academy_awards, casey_affleck, frances_mcdormand, jennifer_lawrence, jodie_foster, meryl_streep, oscars", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/JodieFosterOscars-160x105.jpg"}, "description": "On Sunday night, Foster joked she was on crutches because Streep \"I, Tonya'ed\" her", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jodie Foster's Oscar-Night Crutches Explained -
