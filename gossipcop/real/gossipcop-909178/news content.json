Now the third sister is sharing her thoughts.\n\n\u201cI wish that they would have come to us and we would have been involved since the beginning,\u201d Alyssa Milano said during an interview with Entertainment Tonight. \u201cBut having said that, I do hope that it reaches the newer generation and impacts that generation the way ours was able to do for its generation.\u201d\n\nThe CW greenlit the self-described \u201cfierce,\u201d \u201cfunny,\u201d \u201cfeminist\u201d reboot with Sarah Jeffery, Melonie Diaz, and Madeleine Mantock as three sisters who discover they\u2019re actually witches. They must then try to balance their life in a college town with supernatural demon-hunting.\n\nMilano costarred with Combs and Doherty in the original series. Rose McGowan came on as long-lost half sister Paige when Doherty\u2019s Prue character was killed off.\n\nCombs, especially, has been very vocal about the reboot. \u201cLet me say first that I appreciate the jobs and opportunities the Charmed reboot has created,\u201d she wrote, in part, through a statement. \u201cBut I will never understand what is fierce, funny, or feminist in creating a show that basically says the original actresses are too old to do a job they did 12 years ago. I hope the new show is far better than the marketing so the true legacy does remain.\u201d\n\nDoherty had also tweeted initially that the concept was \u201coffensive.\u201d She added, \u201cI love Charmed. I also want it to be respected. I\u2019m simply choosing to be constructive about it because negativity has no place in my life.\u201d\n\nThe new stars and producers have responded to the pushback, also coming from certain pockets of the original fans, multiple times. During the Television Critics Association tour, Mantock said, \u201cOf course, you can\u2019t help but feel disappointed because I think the script is fantastic. I really hope maybe [Combs will] see it and like it.\u201d\n\nExecutive producers Jennie Snyder Urman and Jessica O\u2019Toole also noted how the original show \u201cwrapped up everything up so wonderfully\u201d and they \u201cdidn\u2019t want to mess with that mythology, obviously, because it was eight years.\u201d\n\n\u201cNone of us from the original cast to the original creators, producers, or writers have anything to do with it,\u201d Milano said in a recent interview with Parade. \u201cThe way I feel about it is this, and I\u2019ll just be super, super-honest: If the reboot can give the joy that it gave to our generation to a new generation, then I think that\u2019s really beautiful. Time after time, I\u2019ve heard story after story about how that show meant so much to people, because it was a show that they found while they were battling cancer, or it was a show that they watched with their father, and that was the only thing they could connect with. It really resonated with people in a profound way, and if a new generation can find that, then I think that\u2019s really beautiful.\u201d\n\nShe suggests the new showrunners \u201cshouldn\u2019t try to reinvent the wheel, but really take what was so great about the original and find a way to make it their own.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just glad that it\u2019s here finally, because we\u2019ve been hearing about this reboot for however many years, what has it been, maybe four years now?\u201d she added. \u201cAnd I feel like it\u2019s either going to succeed or not, and if it succeeds again, a whole new generation will be exposed to the beauty of what Charmed was able to be for people, and if it doesn\u2019t succeed, then we don\u2019t have to hear about it anymore.\u201d", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Falyssa-milano-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Falyssa-milano-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "August", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/11/alyssa-milano-charmed-reboot/", "title": "Alyssa Milano addresses The CW's Charmed reboot: 'I wish that they would have come to us'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "The actress, who played Phoebe on the original, also says she hopes series \"reaches the newer generation.\"", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Alyssa Milano addresses The CW's 'Charmed' reboot: 'I wish that they would have come to us'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/11/alyssa-milano-charmed-reboot/", "description": "The actress, who played Phoebe on the original, also says she hopes series \"reaches the newer generation.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Falyssa-milano-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/11/alyssa-milano-charmed-reboot/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Falyssa-milano-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/11/alyssa-milano-charmed-reboot/", "title": "Alyssa Milano addresses The CW's 'Charmed' reboot: 'I wish that they would have come to us'", "description": "The actress, who played Phoebe on the original, also says she hopes series \"reaches the newer generation.\"", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F08%2Falyssa-milano-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/11/alyssa-milano-charmed-reboot/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533942000.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
