To date, she's landed 23 Top 40 hits on the Official Singles Chart, 17 of which peaked inside the Top 10, with four going all the way to the top.\n\nTo mark her 20 years in music, she's begun her first Las Vegas residency Xperience, joining several other stars including Lady Gaga, Britney Spears, Mariah Carey and Gwen Stefani who have reinvigorated what was once a retirement ground for heritage acts.\n\nTake a look at Aguilera's Top 20 biggest singles in the UK at the bottom of the page - it makes for a great show setlist, by the way - but first, some highlights:\n\nGenie in a Bottle\n\nEvery pop superstar's career has to start somewhere and Christina's kickoff was better than most. A genuine phenomenon when released in 1999, demand was so high that the US import charted the week before its official UK release. Shifting 172,000 copies in that first seven days on sale, Genie in a Bottle spent two weeks at Number 1. It lands as her third biggest song with combined sales of 884,000 made up of 718,000 CDs and downloads sales and 25.1 million audio and video streams.\n\nLady Marmalade\n\nCollaborating has been key to Christina's success over the years, and some of her most enduring hits have been her team-ups with other huge artists. 2001's Lady Marmalade was a real turning point for Christina \u2013 while she'd been spotted out and about sporting a more outr\u00e9 look, this was the first time we'd seen Christina fully expressing herself and letting out her wild side. With Lil Kim, Pink and Mya on board, this was a guaranteed hit \u2013 another Number 1. On her rundown, it clocks in as her fourth biggest song overall with 869,000 combined sales, including 41.4m streams.\n\n\n\nImage: Kevork Djansezian/AP/Shutterstock\n\nDirrty\n\nIf Lady Marmalade was the starter, Dirrty was the main. Christina was pulling no punches her \u2013 the video was set at a very rough boxing match \u2013 on this fantastically gritty Number 1 from 2002. The lead from her huge-selling second album Stripped, Dirrty spent two weeks rubbing itself up against the Number 1 spot, and has scored 593,000 combined sales (including 30.6m streams) to land in Christina's all-time Top 5. Despite its success across Europe, Dirrty struggled in the US and stalled at Number 48, mainly due to lack of radio play which counts towards the Billboard Hot 100.\n\nBeautiful\n\nChristina's most recent Number 1 (though she has come painfully close on several occasions since), this self-love empowering ballad knocked Tatu's All The Things She Said off the top in 2003 (Take a look at the chart the week Beautiful went to Number 1 \u2013 it's a corker). It's combined sales stand at 568,000 copies, including 24.6m streams since we started counting in 2014. Its legacy is the countless 'be yourself' torch songs that have dominated the charts ever since.\n\nMoves Like Jagger\n\nNow, a big one. Christina hadn't been in the Top 10 for a while when this insanely catchy track from a revitalised Maroon 5 came along in 2011. Christina's scene-stealing cameo helped Moves Like Jagger to million-selling status \u2013 but it couldn't lift it to Number 1. Yep, Moves Like Jagger spent an agonising seven weeks at 2, beaten to the top by six different songs by the likes of Example, Rihanna ft. Calvin Harris, Pixie Lott and One Direction. Argh.\n\nIn fact, Moves Like Jagger is the second bestselling single in the history of the Official Singles Chart not to get to Number 1, beaten (again) by Wham\u2019s Last Christmas. It was the second biggest selling single of 2011, behind Adele's Someone Like You, and is Christina's biggest song in the UK \u2013 1.9m combined sales including 57.4 million streams. However, while it is her top seller overall, it isn't her most streamed track...\n\nSay Something\n\nAnother memorable feature from Christina, this song became a hit after our leading lady spotted it on So You Think You Can Dance and was anxious to collaborate with A Great Big World on a new version. The Christina-enhanced song reached Number 4 in 2014 and has 1.05m combined sales. It's Christina's most streamed track in the UK, notching up 113m plays, helping it to finish second in her all-time Top 20. It's also her most recent Top 40 hit.\n\nThe Official Top 20 biggest Christina Aguilera songs:\n\nPOS TITLE ARTIST PEAK YEAR 1 MOVES LIKE JAGGER MAROON 5 FT CHRISTINA AGUILERA 2 2011 2 SAY SOMETHING A GREAT BIG WORLD/AGUILERA 4 2014 3 GENIE IN A BOTTLE CHRISTINA AGUILERA 1 1999 4 LADY MARMALADE C AGUILERA/LIL' KIM/MYA/PINK 1 2001 5 DIRRTY CHRISTINA AGUILERA FT REDMAN 1 2002 6 BEAUTIFUL CHRISTINA AGUILERA 1 2003 7 FEEL THIS MOMENT PITBULL FT CHRISTINA AGUILERA 5 2013 8 CANDYMAN CHRISTINA AGUILERA 17 2007 9 AIN'T NO OTHER MAN CHRISTINA AGUILERA 2 2006 10 FIGHTER CHRISTINA AGUILERA 3 2003 11 HURT CHRISTINA AGUILERA 11 2003 12 WHAT A GIRL WANTS CHRISTINA AGUILERA 3 1999 13 TELL ME P DIDDY FT CHRISTINA AGUILERA 8 2000 14 CAR WASH CHRISTINA AGUILERA FT MISSY 4 2004 15 NOBODY WANTS TO BE LONELY RICKY MARTIN/C AGUILERA 4 2001 16 CAN'T HOLD US DOWN CHRISTINA AGUILERA FT LIL' KIM 6 2003 17 COME ON OVER BABY (ALL I WANT IS YOU) CHRISTINA AGUILERA 8 2000 18 TILT YA HEAD BACK NELLY & CHRISTINA AGUILERA 5 2004 19 THE VOICE WITHIN CHRISTINA AGUILERA 5 2003 20 SHOW ME HOW YOU BURLESQUE CHRISTINA AGUILERA N/A 2010\n\n\u00a92019 Official Charts Company.
