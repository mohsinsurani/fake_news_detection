Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2016\n\nTommy Mottola\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s easy to toss around the word \u2018iconic\u2019, but Prince truly epitomized the word to the very core of his being. Lots of big stars have made waves nationally and internationally, but Prince by far was the most groundbreaking more than anyone\u2026from his music, to his concerts \u2014 to even the way he entered a room, always surrounded with that magical air of superstardom, mystique, and genius. Bringing together film and music with Purple Rain was a glimpse into the future of not only the music industry, but the entire media and entertainment industry. When you saw Prince, you never knew what you were going to get, but you always knew it was going to be greatness and something spectacular. He is loved and will be deeply missed forever. The world is experiencing a tremendous loss today.\u201d\n\nNew Girl Executive Producers\n\nWe are all so deeply saddened to hear about the passing of this hero of ours \u2013 and so grateful to have had the opportunity to meet him and to have him on our show. It\u2019s something we will remember forever. Our thoughts go out to his family. We are among the millions of people who will truly miss the brilliant Artist.\n\nFrank Ocean\n\n\u201cI\u2019M NOT EVEN GONNA SAY REST IN PEACE BECAUSE IT\u2019S BIGGER THAN DEATH. I NEVER MET THE MAN (I WAS TOO NERVOUS THE ONE TIME I SAW HIM) AND I NEVER SAW HIM PLAY LIVE, REGRETTABLY. I ONLY KNOW THE LEGENDS I\u2019VE HEARD FROM FOLKS AND WHAT I\u2019VE HEARD AND SEEN FROM HIS DEEP CATALOG OF PROPELLANT, FEARLESS, VIRTUOSIC WORK. MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT HE LEARNED EARLY ON HOW LITTLE VALUE TO ASSIGN TO SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S OPINION OF YOU.. AN INFECTIOUS SENTIMENT THAT SEEMED SOAKED INTO HIS CLOTHES, HIS HAIR, HIS WALK, HIS GUITAR AND HIS PRIMAL SCREAM. HE WROTE MY FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME, \u2018WHEN YOU WERE MINE\u2019. IT\u2019S A SIMPLE SONG WITH A SIMPLE MELODY THAT MAKES YOU WISH YOU THOUGHT OF IT FIRST, EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE \u2013 A FLIRTATIOUS BRAND OF GENIUS THAT FEELS APPROACHABLE. HE WAS A STRAIGHT BLACK MAN WHO PLAYED HIS FIRST TELEVISED SET IN BIKINI BOTTOMS AND KNEE HIGH HEELED BOOTS, EPIC. HE MADE ME FEEL MORE COMFORTABLE WITH HOW I IDENTIFY SEXUALLY SIMPLY BY HIS DISPLAY OF FREEDOM FROM AND IRREVERENCE FOR OBVIOUSLY ARCHAIC IDEAS LIKE GENDER CONFORMITY ETC. HE MOVED ME TO BE MORE DARING AND INTUITIVE WITH MY OWN WORK BY HIS DEMONSTRATION \u2013 HIS DENIAL OF THE PREVAILING MODEL\u2026HIS FIGHT FOR HIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY \u2013 \u2018SLAVE\u2019 WRITTEN ACROSS THE FOREHEAD, NAME CHANGED TO A SYMBOL\u2026 AN ALL OUT REBELLION AGAINST EXPLOITATION. A VANGUARD AND GENIUS BY EVERY METRIC I KNOW OF WHO AFFECTED MANY IN A WAY THAT WILL OUTRUN OBLIVION FOR A LONG WHILE. I\u2019M PROUD TO BE A PRINCE FAN(STAN) FOR LIFE.\u201d\n\nHillary Clinton\n\n\u201cI came out of an event in Hartford, Connecticut, and people told me, and I was so stunned,\u201d she said. \u201cYou think of him as being almost eternal. I mean he was a bigger-than-life personality, he was not only a songwriter and a singer but literally a one-man band. He was such a great showman. I just was so, so sad. And I just want everybody to spend some time reflecting on this American original. He was so extraordinary.\u201d\n\nPatti LaBelle\n\n\u201cI am deeply saddened by Prince\u2019s untimely passing. Not only was he a dear friend to me, but an inspiration. His talent, artistry and influence are unparalleled and there will never be another like Prince! The world has suffered a great loss! May he rest in everlasting peace.\u201d\n\nR. Kelly\n\n\u201cMy thoughts are the same as everybody else\u2019s thoughts; First, I\u2019m stunned and then just sad over the thing,\u201d Kelly told Billboard shortly after the news broke. \u201cI\u2019m just shocked, man. I\u2019m still stunned about the whole situation, man.\u201d\n\nBob Seger\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s so sad. He was way too young. And he was kind of an athlete, such a great performer. You wouldn\u2019t expect it. \u2026 He was just an off-the-charts talent \u2014 instruments, songwriting, singing, performing, producing. You name it, he could do everything. My son loves [Trent] Reznor, and I told him, \u2018Before there was Reznor, there was Prince.\u2019 And of course I\u2019ve heard stories that James Brown did that stuff, too; He would play drums, bass, could do just about it all. So it was kind of a progression. It\u2019s unusual to have somebody be that talented on so many instruments and yet still be a really good producer, songwriter \u2014 everything. \u2026It\u2019s a damn shame, it really is. I know he had greatness still ahead of him. I\u2019m just glad he was around. He was a gift to music.\u201d\n\nDonatella Versace\n\n\u201cI am crying. All my memories are coming back to me. He was one of my closest friends. I will always remember when he rented a club, only for him and me. We listened to his music and spoke about the young generation. The young people were so important to Prince. They have to follow the example he set, to believe in their heart, respect their own soul and never trade their own individuality. It is what made Prince outstanding and relevant forever. I will always love him.\u201d\n\nCameron Strang, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Records\n\nToday, we lost one of the most revolutionary talents of our time. Prince\u2019s untimely passing is deeply shocking, reminding us that unique artists who chart their own course and move culture are precious few and irreplaceable. He leapt onto the scene in 1978 and it didn\u2019t take the world long to realize that pop music had changed forever. He played the studio like an instrument and shattered the definition of live performance. He defined a new kind of superstardom, with a transformative impact not just on music, but on video, film, and style. Prince was the epitome of cool and mystery \u2013 an inspirational soul who created his own universe by bringing together different genres, races and cultures with a purity of sound and spirit unlike any other. His visionary gifts as a songwriter, vocalist, musician, performer and producer placed him in a league all his own. We are honored to have had Prince as a member of the Warner Bros. Records family during two eras of his astonishing career. We express our deepest condolences to everyone who loved him and join his family, friends and legion of fans in mourning his loss.\n\nCarmen Electra\n\n\u201cI was so shocked and heart broken to hear about the loss of my mentor, Prince. The world has lost a truly incredible spirit and musical genius. What a blessing it is to be one of the chosen ones who had the chance to work so closely with him. He gave me my name, he believed in me, and he has inspired an entire generation. I will always love him\u2026. \u201cSometimes it Snows in April.\u201d\n\nGeorge Miller\n\n\u201cWe used one of his songs in \u2018Happy Feet\u2019. We wanted to change two words of his lyrics to suit the penguins. He asked to see the movie. As it finished he picked up his guitar and said he wanted to write a song for us. It arrived completed soon after. As I was about to listen to it for the first time I thought \u2018what if I don\u2019t like it?\u2019. How do I tell this legendary figure his song doesn\u2019t fit? A few seconds in I began to smile. By the end I was dancing. It was perfect. A true genius and a true gentleman. He called me \u2018mister\u2019 I wanted to call him \u2018your majesty\u2019. Such an astonishing loss.\u201d\n\nAlbert Magnoli, Writer, Director and Editor of Purple Rain\n\n\u201cThe news of Prince\u2019s sudden and unexpected passing is very difficult to process. He was my creative partner and friend. We shared tremendous times together during and after the making of Purple Rain. I know his fans are devastated. I know his music meant so very much to so many people. He was a good man, complicated and diligent, and like men of his caliber, he always demanded from himself and others the very best. Travel well, friend, wherever your next journey takes you.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thr Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/princes-death-hollywood-mourns-legendary-886479/", "title": "Hollywood Pays Tribute to Legendary Artist Prince", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Lenny Kravitz, Madonna, Shonda Rhimes, Justin Timberlake, Chris Rock and more expressed their sadness on social media.", "news_keywords": "Obituaries, Prince", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "THR staff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 886479, "title": "Hollywood Pays Tribute to Legendary Artist Prince", "published_at": "2016-04-21 10:26:48", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/gettyimages-52457873-h_2016.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Prince", "topics": "News", "body": "As authorities investigate the cause of Prince's death on Thursday, the entertainment industry mourned the icon's passing.\r\nCelebrities responded with disbelief and sadness. \"I can't.

I find myself being afraid now feeling alone in the world without him, for I believe that he was dealing directly with the Creator on our behalf. Ushering us a little closer towards salvation with each song. What I will miss most is that mediation with Our Master. His confidence in doing so is the evidence that his even greater talent was the ability to listen to the spirit and share shamelessly, unselfishly, and with so much style. He is now and forever immortalized as a noun, as I have often referred to him. Undoubtedly a person, a very special place, and absolutely EVERYTHING.\r\n\t\tA photo posted by CeeLo Green (@ceelogreen) on Apr 21, 2016 at 2:03pm PDT\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\tStill shocked.

I asked for his autograph. He wrote \"Love God\"... My walls were covered with prince posters.. I lived in a two bedroom apartment with my dad and you could see my Prince posters from the street.. Many many years later I connected back with Prince.. And we have remained friends.. I called him a few years back with the idea of @Madonna and Prince going on tour together. I pitched it to Madonna and within a second she said \"I like it, we can call it the Royalty Tour... The Queen and The Prince\".... I love the way she thinks... When I told Prince the idea he said: \"the world isn't ready for this, it's too big\".. I always felt like one day I would pull it off.. @Madonna performed in #stpaul last year and Prince was generous enough to host us and perform for us after that show at his home #paisleypark .. He didn't go on stage until 3am, and per usual the show performance was mindblowing.. He joined me this last New Years in St Bart's and performed for my friends party at what will now be the last time I saw him.. It's the one and only time I was able to actually work with him directly.. I won't forget that electrifying performance.. Or the smile on his face that night.. And the love that he gave me.. He always treated me with kindness.. We didn't always agree.. We would argue for hours... But he understood that I respected him dearly and cared for him.. I tried my best to help him on record business matters.. And even in his passing I'm here to help.. I would have done anything I could and wish I achieved more for him on his very clear issues.. The man had the strongest of opinions on contracts and on artists rights.. This photo was taken summer of 1999.. Yes.. \"1999\".. You can see from the photo that I'm focused on one thing... Prince!!.. I have the original lyrics to \"purple rain\" on my wall and I was always too embarrassed to tell him.. Maybe he would think I was crazy for paying so much years back for those lyrics or maybe he would just take it off my wall and say \"thank you, I was looking for this\".. Who would stop him?.. Not me.. Today not only will doves cry, we all cry.. You will be missed.. I love you.. Rest in peace..\r\n\t\tA photo posted by Guy Oseary (@guyoseary) on Apr 21, 2016 at 11:11am PDT\r\n\t\r\n\r\n\r\n\t\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\r\n\t\t\t\t\u00a0\r\n\t\t\r\n\t\tMy musical brother...

Trump (@realDonaldTrump) April 22, 2016\r\n\r\nTommy Mottola \r\n\t\"It\u2019s easy to toss around the word \u2018iconic\u2019, but Prince truly epitomized the word to the very core of his being. Lots of big stars have made waves nationally and internationally, but Prince by far was the most groundbreaking more than anyone\u2026from his music, to his concerts \u2014 to even the way he entered a room, always surrounded with that magical air of superstardom, mystique, and genius. Bringing together film and music with Purple Rain was a glimpse into the future of not only the music industry, but the entire media and entertainment industry. When you saw Prince, you never knew what you were going to get, but you always knew it was going to be greatness and something spectacular. He is loved and will be deeply missed forever. The world is experiencing a tremendous loss today.\"\r\nNew Girl Executive Producers\r\n\tWe are all so deeply saddened to hear about the passing of this hero of ours - and so grateful to have had the opportunity to meet him and to have him on our show. It's something we will remember forever. Our thoughts go out to his family. We are among the millions of people who will truly miss the brilliant Artist.\r\nFrank Ocean\r\n\t\"I\u2019M NOT EVEN GONNA SAY REST IN PEACE BECAUSE IT\u2019S BIGGER THAN DEATH. I NEVER MET THE MAN (I WAS TOO NERVOUS THE ONE TIME I SAW HIM) AND I NEVER SAW HIM PLAY LIVE, REGRETTABLY. I ONLY KNOW THE LEGENDS I\u2019VE HEARD FROM FOLKS\u00a0AND WHAT I\u2019VE HEARD AND SEEN FROM HIS DEEP CATALOG OF PROPELLANT, FEARLESS, VIRTUOSIC WORK. MY ASSESSMENT IS THAT HE LEARNED EARLY ON HOW LITTLE VALUE TO ASSIGN TO SOMEONE ELSE\u2019S OPINION OF YOU.. AN INFECTIOUS SENTIMENT THAT SEEMED SOAKED INTO HIS CLOTHES, HIS HAIR, HIS WALK, HIS GUITAR AND HIS PRIMAL SCREAM. HE WROTE MY FAVORITE SONG OF ALL TIME, \u2018WHEN YOU WERE MINE\u2019. IT\u2019S\u00a0A SIMPLE SONG WITH A SIMPLE MELODY THAT MAKES YOU WISH YOU THOUGHT OF IT FIRST, EVEN THOUGH YOU NEVER WOULD HAVE - A FLIRTATIOUS BRAND OF GENIUS THAT FEELS APPROACHABLE.\u00a0\u00a0HE WAS A STRAIGHT BLACK MAN WHO PLAYED HIS FIRST TELEVISED SET IN BIKINI BOTTOMS AND KNEE HIGH HEELED BOOTS, EPIC. HE MADE ME FEEL MORE\u00a0COMFORTABLE WITH HOW I IDENTIFY SEXUALLY SIMPLY BY HIS DISPLAY OF FREEDOM FROM AND IRREVERENCE FOR OBVIOUSLY ARCHAIC IDEAS LIKE GENDER CONFORMITY ETC. HE MOVED ME TO BE MORE DARING AND INTUITIVE WITH MY OWN WORK BY HIS DEMONSTRATION - HIS DENIAL OF THE PREVAILING MODEL\u2026HIS FIGHT FOR HIS INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY - \u2018SLAVE\u2019 WRITTEN ACROSS THE FOREHEAD, NAME CHANGED TO A SYMBOL\u2026 AN ALL OUT REBELLION AGAINST EXPLOITATION. A VANGUARD AND GENIUS BY EVERY METRIC I KNOW OF WHO AFFECTED MANY IN A WAY THAT WILL OUTRUN OBLIVION FOR A LONG WHILE. I\u2019M\u00a0PROUD TO BE A PRINCE FAN(STAN) FOR LIFE.\"\r\nHillary Clinton \r\n\t\"I came out of an event in Hartford, Connecticut, and people told me, and I was so stunned,\" she said. \"You think of him as being almost eternal. I mean he was a bigger-than-life personality, he was not only a songwriter and a singer but literally a one-man band. He was such a great showman. I just was so, so sad. And I just want everybody to spend some time reflecting on this American original. He was so extraordinary.\"\r\nPatti LaBelle \r\n\t\"I am deeply saddened by Prince's untimely passing. Not only was he a dear friend to me, but an inspiration. His talent, artistry and influence are unparalleled and there will never be another like Prince! The world has suffered a great loss! May he rest in everlasting peace.\"\r\nR. Kelly \r\n\t\"My thoughts are the same as everybody else's thoughts; First, I'm stunned and then just sad over the thing,\" Kelly told Billboard shortly after the news broke. \"I'm just shocked, man. I'm still stunned about the whole situation, man.\"\r\nBob Seger\r\n\t\"It's so sad. He was way too young. And he was kind of an athlete, such a great performer. You wouldn't expect it. ... He was just an off-the-charts talent -- instruments, songwriting, singing, performing, producing. You name it, he could do everything. My son loves [Trent] Reznor, and I told him, 'Before there was Reznor, there was Prince.' And of course I've heard stories that James Brown did that stuff, too; He would play drums, bass, could do just about it all. So it was kind of a progression. It's unusual to have somebody be that talented on so many instruments and yet still be a really good producer, songwriter \u2014 everything. ...It's a damn shame, it really is. I know he had greatness still ahead of him. I'm just glad he was around. He was a gift to music.\"\r\nDonatella Versace\r\n\t\"I am crying. All my memories are coming back to me. He was one of my closest friends. I will always remember when he rented a club, only for him and me. We listened to his music and spoke about the young generation. The young people were so important to Prince. They have to follow the example he set, to believe in their heart, respect their own soul and never trade their own individuality. It is what made Prince outstanding and relevant forever. I will always love him.\"\r\nCameron Strang, Chairman and CEO, Warner Bros. Records\r\n\tToday, we lost one of the most revolutionary talents of our time. Prince\u2019s untimely passing is deeply shocking, reminding us that unique artists who chart their own course and move culture are precious few and irreplaceable. He leapt onto the scene in 1978 and it didn\u2019t take the world long to realize that pop music had changed forever. He played the studio like an instrument and shattered the definition of live performance. He defined a new kind of superstardom, with a transformative impact not just on music, but on video, film, and style. Prince was the epitome of cool and mystery - an inspirational soul who created his own universe by bringing together different genres, races and cultures with a purity of sound and spirit unlike any other. His visionary gifts as a songwriter, vocalist, musician, performer and producer placed him in a league all his own. We are honored to have had Prince as a member of the Warner Bros. Records family during two eras of his astonishing career. We express our deepest condolences to everyone who loved him and join his family, friends and legion of fans in mourning his loss.\r\nCarmen Electra\r\n\t\"I was so shocked and heart broken to hear about the loss of my mentor, Prince. The world has lost a truly incredible spirit and musical genius. What a blessing it is to be one of the chosen ones who had the chance to work so closely with him. He gave me my name, he believed in me, and he has inspired an entire generation. I will always love him\u2026. \u201cSometimes it Snows in April.\"\r\nGeorge Miller\r\n\t\"We used one of his songs in 'Happy Feet'. We wanted to change two words of his lyrics to suit the penguins. He asked to see the movie. As it finished he picked up his guitar and said he wanted to write a song for us. It arrived completed soon after. As I was about to listen to it for the first time I thought 'what if I don't like it?'. How do I tell this legendary figure his song doesn't fit?\u00a0 A few seconds in I began to smile. By the end I was dancing.\u00a0 It was perfect.\u00a0 A true genius and a true gentleman. He called me 'mister' I wanted to call him 'your majesty'. Such an astonishing loss.\"\r\nAlbert Magnoli, Writer, Director and Editor of Purple Rain\r\n\t\"The news of Prince\u2019s sudden and unexpected passing is very difficult to process. He was my creative partner and friend. We shared tremendous times together during and after the making of Purple Rain. I know his fans are devastated. I know his music meant so very much to so many people. He was a good man, complicated and diligent, and like men of his caliber, he always demanded from himself and others the very best.
