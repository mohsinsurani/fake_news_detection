She also gives out relationship advice.\n\nTaking to Instagram Live, Lala Kent revealed a \"f\u2013king crazy\" direct message that she\u2019d received from a fan who wanted her input.\n\n\"This girl was talking about this guy that she\u2019s pretty into, she\u2019s been seeing him for a while.\"\n\nAnd the girl has a specific reason for talking to Lala for advice.\n\n\"There\u2019s quite an age gap, it\u2019s kind of like me and my man, she\u2019s my age, maybe a little older\u2026he\u2019s like in his later 40s.\"\n\nRandall Emmett is 46. Lala will turn 28 this year.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\n\"And they\u2019ve never been official but he was like really cute at the beginning and then he falls off the earth.\"\n\nUh-oh. That\u2019s not a great sign.\n\n\"He\u2019s like inconsistent, which as women I think is f\u2013ked up, like don\u2019t be inconsistent.\"\n\nIt might mean that he\u2019s unsure about this relationship. It might mean that he\u2019s lying to this girl \u2014 and maybe to someone else in his life.\n\nOr he might be just using this girl to feel young, and then running off when it starts to feel too much like a relationship.\n\nWhatever the cause, Lala doesn\u2019t like it any more than we do.\n\n\"If you\u2019re gonna be inconsistent, women we need to give them the boot, it\u2019s not OK.\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nLala goes on to explain that the girl went to dinner with this older man and that man\u2019s friend before the New Year.\n\nThe girl had a few drinks at the bar because she was nervous.\n\n\"So she gets a little too drunk at the bar she says, they get into a cab and she starts to take her clothes off in the cab.\"\n\nThe girl was making certain that the driver couldn\u2019t see her as she did this.\n\nIt did not go over well.\n\n\"She started taking her pants off and he started reprimanding her and getting upset and made her feel really stupid.\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nOur first thought is that this girl, who\u2019s clearly feeling insecure in this relationship enough that she\u2019s anxious before dinner and then wants reassurance that this older man finds her sexy, should dump his ass.\n\nLala Kent, we\u2019re happy to say, feels the same way.\n\n\"I\u2019ll tell you how I would react, first of all my p\u2013sy is no longer yours to have fun with, you\u2019re a f\u2013king asshole.\"\n\nThat\u2019s good advice.\n\nHere comes the controversy:\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\n\"You make me feel dumb, I\u2019m not about that life; you can call me a homewrecker, you can call me a bitch, you can call me whatever you want, when you make me feel dumb, I\u2019m wiping my hands clean.\"\n\nTo be clear, if a guy\u2019s calling a girl names in a way that she\u2019s not okay with, that\u2019s not any more okay than ridiculing a girl as \"stupid.\"\n\nWhat this girl was doing sounds desperate, which suggests to us that this guy is standoffish and cold \u2014 maybe even more like this in front of his friend.\n\nThat\u2019s no good for a relationship, folks.\n\nIf a guy isn\u2019t friendly or is only friendly sometimes, that means that he has his own emotional issues, and it\u2019s not your job to crack through the ice. Move on to a guy who can show you how much he appreciates you.\n\nAnd if a guy makes you feel dumb \u2014 or calls you ugly names or otherwise demeans you outside of consensual bedroom roleplay \u2014 dump his ass at the curb. It\u2019s 2018 and awful guys don\u2019t deserve great girlfriends.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2015/12/lala-kent-modeling-photo.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/02/lala-kent-photo-877x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/joanna-gaines-baby-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20634%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='634'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lala-kent-and-randall-emmett-image-819x1024.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20877%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='877'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20480%20360'%3E%3Crect%20width='480'%20height='360'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/lala-kent-whale-tattoo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20644%20404'%3E%3Crect%20width='644'%20height='404'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/11/farrah-abraham-bending-back-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/ooh-la-la-kent.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/ooh-la-la-kent-480x360.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20819%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='819'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/ooh-la-la-kent.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20690%20696'%3E%3Crect%20width='690'%20height='696'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_andreicastravel_elizabethpotthast_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/01/lala-kent-and-randall-emmett.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20718%20718'%3E%3Crect%20width='718'%20height='718'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/12/ooh-la-la-kent.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/01/lala-kent-gives-dating-advice-id-rather-be-a-bitch-than-dumb/", "title": "Lala Kent Gives Dating Advice: I'd Rather Be a Bitch Than Dumb!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lala Kent Gives Dating Advice: I'd Rather Be a Bitch Than Dumb!", "description": "It's only been a few days since Vanderpump Rules star Lala Kent went public with her married boyfriend, and now she's offering some dating advice like some sort of relationship expert.
