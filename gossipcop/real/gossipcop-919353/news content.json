We have viral memes, viral videos, viral haircuts, and even viral foods. (Looking at you, Starbucks Unicorn Frap, RIP). Another category we see a lot of viral action from is beauty products.\n\nJust think about how often your Insta feed is plagued with beauty bloggers posing with products. It probably accounts for about 87 percent of the things you see. Despite all of the thousands of products that they sing the praises of, there are some that capture everyone\u2019s attention and everybody wants in on them.\n\nWhile some are definitely over-hyped, there are other beauty products that are definitely worth all of the love poems and heart emojis. So how do you separate the good stuff from the fluff? I\u2019m here to help you out. Have a look at 16 viral beauty products that are actually worth the hype.\n\n1. Becca Champagne Pop by Becca\n\nBuy for $38 from Sephora\n\nThere are certain products that have cult followings and then there are certain shades. This one falls into the latter category. There are tons of highlighters hitting the shelves, but this one was a standout thanks to its prismatic finish and unique but oh-so-flattering color.\n\n2. Molly Cosmetics Silisponge\n\nBuy for $9.90 from Molly Cosmetics\n\nPeople are still obsessed with their beautyblenders, but when the SiliSponge came along, it made people realize that there are other equally awesome sponges out there. The facts that it promised no makeup waste and hygienic use were enough to convince people. However, I\u2019m sure the fact the sponge looked like a gel bra pad definitely helped matters.\n\n3. Savage Blackhead Peel-Off Black Mask\n\nBuy for $16.99 from Savage\n\nI know you have seen the viral videos and photos of this mask. And let me tell you that they aren\u2019t cleverly edited. The black mask delivers results and it delivers them quickly. You can kiss pesky blackheads goodbye after a few uses.\n\n4. Storybook Cosmetics Wizard Wands\n\nBuy for $55 from Storybook Cosmetics\n\nThe beauty industry was a lot less fun before Storybook Cosmetics came into town with its themed brushes and makeup products. These Wizard Wands managed to captivate those who were Harry Potter fans and those who didn\u2019t know the difference between Dumbledore and Hogwarts. And what really sealed the deal was that the brushes were as easy to use as they were gorgeous.\n\n5. Unicorn Lashes Unicorn Makeup Brushes\n\nBuy for $60 from Unicorn Lashes\n\nYou know a product is good when people are willing to ship it halfway around the world, regardless of postage and duty charges. That\u2019s the case with these gorgeous unicorn makeup brushes. They\u2019re cute, high quality, and they actually make your makeup application easier.\n\n6. Kat Von D Alchemist Holographic Palette\n\nBuy for $32 from Sephora\n\nPretty much every Kat Von D product could be featured on this list. This highlighter palette in particular is a winner because it managed to stand out despite the fact 5,000 highlighters are released every year. (That may be a slight exaggeration.) And the palette managed to convince people that you really should be wearing blue, green, and purple highlighters\u2026and sometimes at the same time.\n\n7. BioBelle #UnicornGlow\n\nBuy for $5.99 from BioBelle\n\nWhen a product has a lot of hype before it\u2019s actually released, I become dubious about just how good it actually is. This mask lived up to expectations in terms of Instagram appeal and skin-perfecting benefits. It\u2019s made with good-for-your-skin ingredients that help nourish and hydrate. Plus, the packaging and the actual sheet mask slay.\n\n8. Dr. Brandt Skincare Magnetight Age-Defier\n\nBuy for $75 from Sephora\n\nIt\u2019s a mask with a magnet, how cool is that? This could easily be written off as a gimmick, but the product is actually legit. It uses the magnetic currents to help fight the signs of aging. And even people who have no interest in anti-aging products wanted to use it ASAP.\n\n9. The Ordinary Retinol 1%\n\nBuy for $6.90 from The Ordinary\n\nMeet the product that is turning people who aren\u2019t skincare fans into skincare obsessives who can talk at length about the differences between salicylic acid and lactic acid. The super long waiting lists are a good clue the products are worth it, but all the proof you really need is when you look in the mirror.\n\n10. Sigma Beauty Lip Switch\n\nBuy for $14 from Sigma Beauty\n\nThe *mysterious* name definitely attracted people, but it was the major finish that made these lippies a clear winner. Just a dab will help you unleash your inner unicorn thanks to the dazzling prismatic finish. When Sigma says that glosses \u201cbroke the internet,\u201d the brand is not exaggerating.\n\n11. Winky Lux Flower Balm Jelly Lip Stain\n\nBuy for $14 from Winky Lux\n\n\n\nIt has an actual flower in it, you guys. Obviously, that helped make it go viral, but this isn\u2019t all show and no substance. The magical lippie goes on clear then adjusts to a custom pink shade based on your body\u2019s pH. How\u2019s that for awesome chemistry?\n\n12. Anastasia Beverly Hills Moon Child Glow Kit\n\nBuy for $40 from Anastasia Beverly Hills\n\n\n\nIf you\u2019ve after an alien-like glow, look no further than this palette. It\u2019s the stuff that flawless Instagram beauty looks are made of. And what really makes it is that it looks as good IRL as it does online.\n\n13. Kylie Cosmetics Lip Kit\n\nBuy for $29 from Kylie Cosmetics\n\nDoes this one even need an explanation? Nah. Considering that Kylie Jenner has released about 438 different liquid lipsticks and each one still causes pandemonium, you know that they are worth it. And considering that everyone and their mama has released a liquid lipstick, but people keep going back to Kylie\u2019s definitely says something.\n\n14. Lush Scrubee\n\nBuy for $7.95 from Lush\n\nYou know that a product is good when it goes from being limited edition to being made part of the permanent collection. That\u2019s exactly what happened with Scrubee. Yeah, part of the appeal is that its shaped like an adorable bee, but the delicious scent and its nourishing qualities make it a winner.\n\n15. FLiRT Cosmetics Flashes Lash Applicator\n\nBuy for $28 from FLiRT Cosmetics\n\nTBT false lashes can be waaaaay more effort than they\u2019re worth. However, FLiRT Cosmetics changed the game with its lash applicator. The tool looks like a White Out dispenser but actually dispenses sections of fake lashes into the perfect spot.\n\n16. Forever 21 Rainbow Highlighter\n\nBuy for $5.90 from Forever 21\n\nThe highlighter that launched the obsession. If you were lucky enough to snag one of the constantly-sold-out highlighters, you will know that it looked as good on your face as it did in the package. And of course you can\u2019t beat the budget-friendly price.\n\nWhat viral beauty products have you tried out?
