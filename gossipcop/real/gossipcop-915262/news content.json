And hopefully it will be a fitting remembrance and recognition of what happened, which was so terrible.\u201d\n\nFormer Oasis frontman Liam Gallagher is rumored to step in for the pop star during the tribute.\n\nGrande hosted a televised benefit concert titled One Love Manchester in June 2017 in honor of the victims and families affected by the bombing. Justin Bieber, Miley Cyrus, Niall Horan, Katy Perry, Robbie Williams and Coldplay were among the many artists who took the stage. Grande broke down in tears while closing out the show with a cover of \u201cSomewhere Over the Rainbow.\u201d The concert raised more than $13 million.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ariana-grande-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=51&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ariana-grande-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C9px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ariana-grande-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=51&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ariana-grande-cancels-brit-awards-2018-manchester-tribute/", "title": "Ariana Grande Cancels Brit Awards 2018 Manchester Tribute", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ariana Grande was forced to pull out of her Manchester tribute performance at the Brit Awards 2018 due to an illness \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ariana Grande Forced to Cancel Manchester Tribute: Find Out Why", "description": "Ariana Grande was forced to pull out of her Manchester tribute performance at the Brit Awards 2018 due to an illness \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ariana-grande-cancels-brit-awards-2018-manchester-tribute/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-22T00:08:51+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ariana-grande-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=51&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ariana-grande-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=51&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-02-22T00:08:51+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ariana Grande Forced to Cancel Manchester Tribute: Find Out Why", "description": "Ariana Grande was forced to pull out of her Manchester tribute performance at the Brit Awards 2018 due to an illness \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ariana-grande-sick.jpg?crop=0px%2C21px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=51&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519258131.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
