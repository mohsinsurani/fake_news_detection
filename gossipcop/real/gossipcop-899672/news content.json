Both had an opportunity to speak to the cast before the film commenced, but were first greeted by a very special ambassador.\n\nLoveable droid BB-8 rolled onto the red carpet to say hello, making first sure to follow royal protocol and bow to both the princes.\n\nBoth Prince William and Harry had previously visited the Star Wars set at in Pinewood in April of last year, with Boyega confirming that the pair cameo in the film as Stormtroopers. Which ones? Well, that's where the detective work comes in.\n\n\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook for all the latest on Film, TV, Music, and more.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clarisse Loughrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-the-last-jedi-premiere-bb8-prince-william-and-harry-cameos-stormtroopers-a8109266.html", "title": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi: BB-8 bowed to Prince William and Harry at the premiere", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The droid clearly knows its royal protocol", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "BB-8 bowed to Prince Harry and William at the Star Wars premiere", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/news/star-wars-the-last-jedi-premiere-bb8-prince-william-and-harry-cameos-stormtroopers-a8109266.html", "type": "article", "description": "The droid clearly knows its royal protocol", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 275, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 4, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 2}, "date": "2017-12-14T09:56:11.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "BB-8 bowed to Prince Harry and William at the Star Wars premiere", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The droid clearly knows its royal protocol", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/14/09/star-wars-last-jedi-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Star Wars: The Last Jedi,Prince William,Prince Harry,Star Wars,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513245371.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
