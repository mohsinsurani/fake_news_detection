On Thursday, the Wayward Sisters backdoor pilot makes its debut (The CW, 8/7c), and the female-led offshoot\u2019s timing couldn\u2019t be more, well, timely.\n\n\u201cNow is the time that television and movies are discovering that a lot of women want to have their stories told by women, [and] they want to have their voices heard,\u201d Briana Buckmaster, who plays Jody\u2019s friend/ally Sheriff Donna Hanscum, says. \u201cThis is an opportunity that Supernatural and The CW is giving to all of us as a viewership and a fandom.\u201d\n\nRELATED STORIES Resident Evil Boss Addresses Supernatural Comparisons, Teases Show's Connection to the Video Games\n\nResident Evil Boss Addresses Supernatural Comparisons, Teases Show's Connection to the Video Games The Winchesters Stars Call Playing John and Mary 'An Honor' and Praise EP Jensen Ackles' Guidance -- Watch\n\nHer Wayward co-star Katherine Ramdeen, aka Jody\u2019s surrogate daughter Alex Jones, echoes the sentiment: \u201cStarting off 2018 with this powerful show, with six powerful, strong, female leads, is exactly what the world needs right now. I think people are going to love it.\u201d\n\nThe sisterhood \u2014 which also includes hunter Claire Novak (Kathryn Newton), psychic Patience (Clark Backo) and dreamwalker Kaia (Yadira Guevara-Prip) \u2014 is brought together by a rescue mission after Dean and Sam go missing. (Quick refresher: They got transported to The Bad Place, unbeknownst to Jody & Co.) Like many of the Wayward characters, Alex \u201cowes the boys her life,\u201d Ramdeen notes. \u201cI think she thinks of them as uncles. So she wants to help in any way she can.\u201d\n\nBut the episode is not about propping up Dean and Sam. \u201cThe women in the pilot are not there to solely serve the Winchesters, or to serve any men. They\u2019re there to help others and save themselves,\u201d Buckmaster says. \u201cThat\u2019s an exciting opportunity for viewers to see six regular women from all walks of life learning to save themselves and be their own heroes.\u201d\n\nWith so many diverse characters, the dynamics among the ensemble are bound to be as complicated as they are rich. Case in point: When prodigal daughter Claire returns home, she finds that her bed is being occupied by Patience, who \u201ccomes from a different background than a lot of the women,\u201d Buckmaster explains. \u201cA lot of the women come from rougher beginnings, and Patience was raised at a little bit of a higher class.
