As it turned out she and I did not share the same ethical views on parenting, including the continuing parenting of adult children.\u201d\n\nPenn, 57, who was promoting his new novel, Bob Honey Who Just Do Stuff, did not elaborate on their parenting differences, but he did note that his relationship with his two children is \u201cgoing great.\u201d He added, \u201cThey\u2019re amazing people. They\u2019re both acting and modeling, an industry that I\u2019m not very interested in but they seem to have fun with it.\u201d\n\nWhile the actor said he\u2019s no longer interested in show business, he noted, \u201cI\u2019m supportive of whatever my kids do that keeps them happy and healthy, period.\u201d\n\nAs for his love life, Penn said he hasn\u2019t given up on finding the right person. \u201cI\u2019m never going to take a position that I\u2019ve closed off to love,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people falling in love with each other is a great, great thing.\u201d\n\nRay Mickshaw/WireImage\n\nHowever, he added, \u201cMore and more, I do find that the relationships become pretty transactional and it\u2019s not easy to run into somebody that makes life better the next day for you. But if I did, I\u2019d grab it.\u201d\n\nPenn and Wright, 51, had a tumultuous relationship as they began dating in 1989 after Penn\u2019s divorce from Madonna and continued an on-and-off love affair for over a decade. They tied the knot in 1996 and filed for divorce in 2007 before reconciling shortly after. The couple officially ended their marriage in July 2010.\n\nWright is currently dating Saint Laurent VIP relations manager Clement Giraudet. Penn was previously in a relationship with actress Charlize Theron, but the two split in June 2015.", "images":
