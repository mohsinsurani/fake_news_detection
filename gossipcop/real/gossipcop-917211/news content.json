I\u2019m definitely on the mend in that department but\u2026breastfeeding,\u201d Lauren explained on Instagram Wednesday. \u201cWhile it\u2019s been one of the most beautiful experiences of my life, I have developed Mastitis twice within 3 weeks. For those of you who don\u2019t know what that is, it\u2019s an infection from breastfeeding that creates severe flu-like symptoms.\u201d\n\nFighting a near 104-degree fever earlier this week, Lauren, 31, said it was the \u201csickest\u201d she has ever felt.\n\n\u201cThe pain and aches were unbelievable. For the [mamas who have been there, I know you feel me,\u201d she penned.\n\nLauren hopes her story will inspire and educate fellow moms and parents-to-be.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m feeling a responsibility to share this so that any new [mama-to-be] reading this is aware of these potential issues. If I could give an upcoming mother any advice for this chapter it would be to become well educated about breastfeeding. Take a class, do your research or have conversations with other mothers,\u201d Lauren offered. \u201cThere are so many things that can happen \u2026 an oversupply of milk leading to infection, your baby having trouble latching, having an undersupply\u2026 being aware of this will be so helpful so that you will know how to avoid or handle these things.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cI wanna give a big virtual hug to all the [mamas] out there who have had any type of issue breastfeeding or are dealing with anything physically or emotionally difficult, be it with you or your child. You are not alone.\u201d\n\nAdjusting to life at home with a newborn, Lauren, who married Aaron, 38, in 2013, continues to gush about her growing family.\n\n\u201cI have never loved you more than I do right now. We are so lucky to be your girls forever,\u201d she recently shared on social media.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/aaron-lauren-paul.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/aaron-lauren-paul.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/aaron-lauren-paul.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["March"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/03/01/lauren-paul-struggling-with-infection-from-breastfeeding/", "title": "Lauren Paul struggling with infection from breastfeeding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
