Time is just flying on by BUT I still need to unpack and reorganize. If you\u2019re anything like me, you probably haven\u2019t planned your Easter outfits. I don\u2019t share too much about my faith but this is an extremely important holiday for me. My family isn\u2019t here in LA so although I don\u2019t get the luxury of family brunch (luckily I just saw them), church is still a very important part of my life.\n\nDressing for church or brunch is all about comfort but looking appropriate and chic. If you don\u2019t already have your look planned, I put together four simple last minute Easter outfit ideas you may already have in your closet. And if you don\u2019t, all these items are accessible at your local department store or boutique.\n\nShop The Post\n\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content\n\nFloral Dress (similar) || Sunglasses (similar) || Drop Earrings (similar) || Chloe Bag\n\n1. Little White Dress\n\nThe little white dress is the obvious choice for Easter because it\u2019s spring, a season where we spot white clothing everywhere. Besides, I\u2019m sure you have a collection of LWD stashed away somewhere. Whenever I\u2019m wearing a white dress, I like to add a bright handbag to make my outfit pop! Nude shoes will guarantee no competition against your cheerful accessories.\n\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content\n\n2. Pastel Dress\n\nIf white is too boring, try a pastel dress. My favorite pastel colors fall in the range of nudes and beige, but you can scout for dresses in lavender, pink, or sea foam green. How cute that you\u2019ll match with the eggs right? If you want to up the ante on a pastel outfit, test out a monochromatic ensemble by coordinating your bag to your dress.\n\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content\n\n3. Printed Maxi/Midi Dress\n\nWhen you\u2019re in the mood for prints but not florals, try a paisley or fruity pattern. If those are too funky, I\u2019m also obsessed with leaf prints and the classic polka dots and stripes. The great thing about Spring 2018 is that it provides a huge bank of prints for you to pick from. You just have to pick. Printed dresses are perfect when you want to look unique and stand out.\n\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content\n\n4. Floral Ruffle Dress\n\nFlorals and ruffles are both big spring trends at the moment and Easter is the perfect time to bring them out. If you decide to wear a floral ruffle dress, don\u2019t shy from adding on bright heeled sandals. I don\u2019t usually wear color but it\u2019s a nice way to incorporate a splash of something bright.\n\nTurn on your JavaScript to view content\n\nWhat are your plans for Easter?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_3847-1440x2160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_6052-1440x2161.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABAQMAAAAl21bKAAAAA1BMVEUAAACnej3aAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAAApJREFUCNdjYAAAAAIAAeIhvDMAAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=13554700&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/TGFP_Signature_@2x.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_3847.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/GFP-logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/IMG_3815.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_3836-1440x2160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/IMG_7611-1440x2160.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAfQAAAH0AQMAAADxGE3JAAAAA1BMVEUAAACnej3aAAAAAXRSTlMAQObYZgAAADVJREFUeNrtwTEBAAAAwiD7p/ZZDGAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAOX0AAAEidG8rAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://assets.rewardstyle.com/images/search/350.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_3847.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susan Hang"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/last-minute-easter-outfit-ideas/", "title": "4 Last Minute Easter Outfit Ideas", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "description": "If you don\u2019t already have your look planned, I put together four simple last minute Easter outfit ideas you may already have in your closet.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "4 Last Minute Easter Outfit Ideas - The Girl from Panama", "description": "If you don\u2019t already have your look planned, I put together four simple last minute Easter outfit ideas you may already have in your closet.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/last-minute-easter-outfit-ideas/", "site_name": "The Girl from Panama", "updated_time": "2018-03-27T21:27:04-08:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_3847.jpg", "width": 1920, "height": 2880}}, "article": {"tag": "spring trends", "section": "Fashion", "published_time": "2018-03-28T04:00:30-08:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-27T21:27:04-08:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "description": "If you don\u2019t already have your look planned, I put together four simple last minute Easter outfit ideas you may already have in your closet.", "title": "4 Last Minute Easter Outfit Ideas - The Girl from Panama", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190102203345im_/http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/IMG_3847.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "http://thegirlfrompanama.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/cropped-cropped-GFPlogo-270x270.png", "google-site-verification": "pp84pDnRFrZmjWFlWcYSiIg3N4Uck38qVEo176YMmWU"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522238430.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
