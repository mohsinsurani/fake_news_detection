These lawyers are true believers in the justice system, though not necessarily in their clients\u2019 innocence.", "images": ["https://www.mediavillage.com/static.284/img/placeholder/empty_square_light.f0545aaf967e.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.284/img/main-mv-logos/mv-logo.4903469e3267.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.284/img/placeholder/empty_narrow_light.3f7b62a5fc88.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.284/img/placeholder/empty_rectangle_light.02ccfb73ceea.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/TV_Video_Download_Logo-square.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1200x630_q85_box-0%2C13%2C640%2C348_crop.jpg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.284/img/icons/subscribe-mail.62c1ea9d7fa0.svg", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/landing/tv.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/static.284/img/meetingprep-search-new.bf116ed4e373.png", "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/channels/TV_Video_Download_Logo_2022.png"], "top_img": "https://www.mediavillage.com/media/articles/NUP_1833910004.jpg.1200x630_q85_box-0%2C13%2C640%2C348_crop.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacqueline Cutler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.mediavillage.com/article/in-defense-of-oxygen-series-looks-at-lawyers-who-defend-the-indefensible/", "title": "\u201cIn Defense Of\u201d: Oxygen Series Looks at Lawyers Who Defend the Indefensible", "meta_data": {"copyright": "MediaVillage, 2020.
