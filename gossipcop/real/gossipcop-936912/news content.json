But afterwards watching it on the television, I\u2026 I think it was a very\u2026 it was a lovely gesture,\u201d she says.\n\nOf the emotional moment, Harry adds: \u201cYou\u2019ve gotta say thank you. Just because he\u2019s my father that doesn\u2019t mean I can just sort of go, \u2018Okay, that\u2019s all, I\u2019ll take it from here.\u2019 \u201d\n\nThen he quips, \u201cErr, no, that is what I wanted to say but erm\u2026and I was very grateful for him to be able to do that.\u201d\n\nAs for the moment when Charles took Meghan\u2019s mom, Doria Ragland, by the arm to head into a private room to sign the marriage register, Camilla says: \u201cA lot of people, seeing my husband actually take the bride\u2019s mother by the hand to sign the registry, it\u2019s something that moved everybody.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the things he does behind the scenes that people don\u2019t know about. I don\u2019t think people realize quite how kind he is.\u201d", "images":
