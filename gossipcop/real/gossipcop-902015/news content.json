She also allegedly threatened those nearby, saying: \u201cI\u2019m going to kill you all.\u201d\n\nOn Sunday, she appeared before Judge Ted Booras and was released without bond.\n\nJudge Booras also gave her permission to leave Florida and return to New York.\n\nShe is due back in court on January 25, 2018.\n\nAs for D\u2019Agostino, he\u2019s got his own feelings over his ex-wife\u2019s behavior.\n\nWe\u2019re told he\u2019s very sad about de Lesseps\u2019 arrest, especially since it happened close to where their wedding was held almost exactly a year ago.\n\nBut sources close to the former couple say that the incident casts new light on their breakup. \u201cAt the time people didn\u2019t believe Tom when he said that Luann had scratched him,\u201d said an insider, \u201cBut what happened in Palm Beach shows that this is consistent behavior on Luann\u2019s part. It should make people reassess the story of why their relationship ended.\u201d\n\nThe source added that D\u2019Agostino \u2014 who is currently in Palm Beach \u2014 didn\u2019t know de Lesseps was in town until he read about the arrest.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/gettyimages-614374152.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/gettyimages-614374152.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/12/gettyimages-614374152.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["December"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/12/24/luann-de-lesseps-blames-arrest-on-long-buried-emotions/", "title": "Luann de Lesseps blames arrest on \u2018long-buried emotions\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
