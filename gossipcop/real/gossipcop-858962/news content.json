They\u2019re pretty strict. Two phone calls a week, 10 minutes [for each phone call].\u201d\n\nEdwards\u2019 father, Larry, added that the reality star \u201cjust knew he needed to go.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe picked the [rehab] place. He wants to do better, he wants to get better,\u201d Larry explained.\n\nJen added, \u201cIt is a relapse or a slip, whatever they want to call it. I think that\u2019s why he realized before it gets out of control he needs to get a hold on it.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was about to spiral bad,\u201d Standifer said. \u201cRight before he left he said his kids deserve to have the healthiest dad. What better time to go than now?\u201d\n\nJen and Larry asked Standifer, who has 4-year-old son Hudson from a previous relationship, how she was feeling during her pregnancy without Edwards by her side.\n\nMackenzie Edwards/Instagram\n\n\u201cIf I did not love Ryan I would call him the most selfish a\u2014\u2014 ever for missing this,\u201d she said. \u201c[But] if he\u2019s going to miss [the baby] being born but be healthy forever, what more could I ask for?\u201d\n\nThe conversation soon turned to Edwards\u2019 10-year-old son, Bentley, whom he shares with ex-girlfriend Maci Bookout, and whether he knew his father was in rehab.\n\nLarry and Jen said Bentley and Bookout were not aware of Edwards being in rehab but explained they were waiting for the right time to tell him.\n\n\u201cWe are going to talk to him,\u201d Jen said. \u201cIt makes me sad because he\u2019s going to miss his dad. I\u2019m not sure what Maci\u2019s talked to him about or what he\u2019s heard, but I haven\u2019t told her that he\u2019s back in rehab.\u201d\n\n\u201cI want to talk to Bentley and explain to him: Just because you\u2019re an addict doesn\u2019t make you a bad person,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t really know how much to tell a 9\u00bd-year-old.\u201d (Bentley was 9\u00bd at the time of filming but turned 10 on Oct. 27.)\n\nLarry said he had no qualms about being open with Bentley about his father\u2019s struggles with addiction.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to be totally honest [with Bentley], that\u2019s my plan,\u201d Larry explained. \u201cBut I want him to hear it from us first before he hears it from anybody else.\u201d\n\nEdwards checked into rehab in early October, according to Us Weekly. Standifer gave birth to their first child together \u2014 son Jagger Ryan Edwards \u2014 on Oct. 9, PEOPLE confirmed.\n\nThe reality TV pair secretly tied the knot before Edwards headed to rehab back in May, and they exchanged vows at a church ceremony in November 2017.\n\nIn an April episode of Teen Mom OG, Mackenzie confirmed her pregnancy when she showed a positive test to producer Jeni, who quickly hugged and congratulated her.\n\nWhen asked if her husband was happy, Mackenzie said, \u201c[He] was so excited, he couldn\u2019t contain himself.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom OG airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
