I want him to ask me what\u2019s wrong with me. He doesn\u2019t care.\u201d\n\nWithin minutes, Evans, 25, decided to kick out the MTV show\u2019s crew.\n\n\u201cCan you guys please go away?\u201d she told them. \u201cI\u2019m trying to talk to David alone.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to f\u2014ing relax, and you guys are in my face,\u201d she yelled. \u201cYou guys need to leave and leave for the rest of the f\u2014ing day. I am up to here with everyone right now. Everyone needs to leave. I\u2019m f\u2014ing busy.\u201d\n\n\u201cDo you want us to come back to do the rehearsal?\u201d asked one producer.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m doing a f\u2014ing rehearsal, because everything is f\u2014ed up right now,\u201d shouted Evans. \u201cWe can just cancel the whole f\u2014ing wedding.\u201d\n\nBut regardless of what played out on camera, Evans and Eason \u2014 who share 10-month-old daughter Ensley \u2014 went on to tie the knot on Sep. 23 at their North Carolina home.\n\nIn her recent memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Evans opened up how Eason is different from those she\u2019d dated in the past.\n\n\u201cHe was so different from the other men I had been with,\u201d she wrote, gushing that she \u201cfinally snagged a good man.\u201d\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t want to jump right into a man\u2019s arms or into his bed,\u201d she added. \u201cI wanted to take this one slow. If it was worth my time, I would know.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans Slams Teen Mom 2 \u2014 \u2018We Aren\u2019t Human Beings to MTV\u2019\n\nEvans\u2019 relationship with Eason has been a point of contention this season. Earlier this month, the reality star threatened to quit the show after an episode aired the couple\u2019s marital tension, with Evans telling PEOPLE that she couldn\u2019t stop crying after watching it and felt as though she is \u201calways portrayed as \u2018the bad one\u2019 to them no matter how much I change.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t like the fact that I\u2019ve changed for the better and [I am] happily married, yet [people] perceive David as some angry dad that gets annoyed by his children,\u201d she said. \u201cOr, if MTV does not have the drama from the storyline they want, they try to create drama as hard as they can.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom 2 airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
