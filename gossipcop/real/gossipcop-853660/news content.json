It's time for the 2017 Billboard Music Awards.\n\nSin City's T-Mobile Arena is home to one of music's biggest evenings, as your favorite recording artists across all genres come together to toast their chart-topping achievements,\n\nWith nearly 60 awards to present and more than a dozen live performances: Tonight, expect the unexpected.\n\nHere are five things to know about the 2017 BBMA's:\n\n1997 Billboard Music Awards\n\n1. Pop Divas Unite:\n\nTalk about iconic. Both Cher and Celine Dion will perform at the the Billboard Music Awards. Dion will sing the powerful ballad \"My Heart Will Go On\" to mark \"Titanic's\" 20-year anniversary. Likewise, Cher will perform her hit song \"Believe\" before receiving this year's Icon Award, an occasion that marks the 71-year-old's first award show performance in 15 years.\n\n2. Co-Hostsess With the Mostess:\n\nLudacris returns to the BBMA's for a fourth consecutive year, but this time Vanessa Hudgens joins the festivities as the rapper's co-host. E! News spoke to both hosts before the big show.\n\n\"It's always good to have different dynamics just to keep the show exciting and keep people on their toes by having different women [hosts] as well, because you have that ying and that yang,\" Ludacris said. \"Every time it's going to be different so it's not like you're doing the same thing every time.\"\n\nCraziest Billboard Awards Outfits Ever\n\n3. Nicki's Time to Shine:\n\nNicki Minaj will kick the 2017 Billboard Music Awards off with a major bang, as the hip-hop MC will open the show with a nine-minute medley of her greatest hits. Jason Derulo, David Guetta and Lil Wayne will also join Minaj onstage.\n\n4. Party in the U.S.A.:\n\nFresh off her release of \"Malibu,\" Miley Cyrus continues her buzzed-about return to the music world with her first televised performance of the summertime single. We've already seen a much more subdued version of the typically wild pop star, and her Billboard Music Awards appearance should follow suit.\n\nOther previously announced performers include Camila Cabello, The Chainsmokers, Drake, Florida Georgia Line, Halsey, Sam Hunt, Imagine Dragons, John Legend, Lorde, Bruno Mars and Ed Sheeran.\n\n5. Who Will Win?:\n\nUnforgettable performances and hilarious sketches aside, this night undoubtedly belongs to the winners.
