Before the big day comes promposals, which can be intimidating \u2014 especially when you don't know which way it's going to go. Fear, however, did not stop a Burger King in Lynn, Massachusetts from asking the Wendy's next door (very publicly) to prom via a storefront sign.\n\n\u201c@WENDYS PROM?\u201d Burger King's marquee read.\n\nFrankly, we'd be a little scared if we were Burger King waiting for a reply back from Wendy's, who's delivered some pretty savage burns this year to their competitors on Twitter. This time though, the red head spared BK and agreed to go \u2014 under a few conditions.\n\n\u201cOK, but don\u2019t get handsy and we have to be home by 10,\u201d Wendy\u2019s tweeted.\n\nBurger King then changed their sign and it's pretty adorable.\n\n\"@wendys looking forward to it. let\u2019s aim for king and queen of prom,\" BK tweeted with a photo of the new sign that reads, \"SHE SAID YES! \"\n\n\n\nTwitter users are totally loving the fast food romance, too, flooding their tweets with replies to the saga.\n\n\n\n\n\nScreenshot via Twitter\n\nMoon Pie, the snack company behind those marshmallow-filled, chocolate-covered pies made with graham crackers, is another brand who's social media game has been crazy strong as of lately. Seizing the opportunity to get in on the viral moment, they responded with a hinge of playful jealousy for not asking Wendy's first.\n\n\n\nThe pig-tailed fast food chain may have let Burger King slide this time by saying yes to prom, but McDonald's did not receive the same treatment. Wendy's threw a couple quick jabs at McDonald's via Twitter.\n\nOuch.\n\nApparently Wendy's super bowl ad trolling Mickey D's wasn't enough social media savagery for one year.\n\n\n\nFollow Delish on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/enchirito-taco-bell-1665164618.jpg?crop=0.526xw:1.00xh;0.0505xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-foodhats3-1665084745.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/10/54f93f1f910af_-_icedtea_web.jpg?crop=0.772xw:0.966xh;0.0609xw,0.0341xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ap-hard-dew-i-dew-100522-0277-1665163300.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.769xh;0,0.0886xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fallfoods-1596750864.jpg?crop=0.875xw:0.875xh;0.0705xw,0.0593xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/halloween-pails-lifestyle-1665068130.png?crop=0.565xw:1.00xh;0.218xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/final-liquid-death-martha-mv-square-v4-1665076274.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=1xw:0.7373271889400922xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pete-davidson-1665095314.jpeg?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.0737xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-whiteelephant-1-1664992883.gif?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.216xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2018-05-10-at-4-00-24-pm-1525982448.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hidden-valley-ranch-couch-1665160829.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.804xh;0,0.119xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/delish-eggnog-spice-cake-still003-1574825973.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/delish/static/images/logos/network-logo.921541b.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=0.678125xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-howtotip-1664980462.gif?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.223xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/trader-joes-store-in-princeton-new-jersey-news-photo-1017468134-1545252542.jpg?crop=0.688xw:1.00xh;0.157xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=1xw:0.7373271889400922xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.delish.com/food-news/a20648304/burger-king-asked-wendys-to-prom/", "title": "Burger King Just Asked Wendy\u2019s To Prom And Wendy\u2019s Had The Most Amazing Response", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Burger King Just Asked Wendy\u2019s To Prom And Wendy\u2019s Had The Most Amazing Response", "description": "French fry\u00a0corsage work?", "keywords": "Burger King, Wendys", "theme-color": "#000000", "og": {"site_name": "Delish", "title": "Burger King Just Asked Wendy\u2019s To Prom And Wendy\u2019s Had The Most Amazing Response", "description": "Does a French fry corsage work?", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=1xw:0.7373271889400922xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "url": "https://www.delish.com/food-news/a20648304/burger-king-asked-wendys-to-prom/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 184150621627178, "pages": 41937927436}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/delish", "section": "Food News", "modified_time": "2021-11-01T23:13:05Z", "published_time": "2018-05-10T21:22:00Z"}, "twitter": {"site": "@DelishDotCom", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=1xw:0.7373271889400922xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "6Eu1_apH238CLAgXc5HY1w4El9wSbaIK-bBOqqNNSnU", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=0.678125xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=0.678125xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tl-horizontal-main-1525968737.jpg?crop=0.678125xw:1xh;center,top", "auto-publish": "timely", "sailthru.excerpt": "Late spring is here which means one thing: it is the thick of prom season.
