Our four collectible covers for the 2017 OUT100 are no less inspiring.\n\nRelated | OUT100 2017\n\nLena Waithe has been one of an OUT favorite for years, and first appeared in this list in 2014. But it was her beautiful Emmy speech, for Outstanding Writing for a Comedy Series, that stole our hearts. Her shout out to the LGBTQI community was as rousing as it was compassionate: \u201cThe things that make us different, those our superpowers,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery day when you walk out the door and put on your imaginary cape... go out there and conquer the world, because the world would not be as beautiful as it is if we weren\u2019t in it.\u201d That could serve as the summary for the entire OUT100.\n\nFor Jonathan Groff, being very visibly aligned with the queer community, in large part thanks to his role in HBO\u2019s Looking, was no barrier to being cast in Mindhunter, the latest television \u201cevent\u201d to be helmed by David Fincher. The Netflix series is a career high for the actor who is acutely aware that he\u2019s a beneficiary of many who came before. \u201cI watched the Tab Hunter documentary on Netflix, about the actor who was gay and closeted and set up on dates with Natalie Wood, and I just thought, Wow, I feel like a product of my time in that It\u2019s 2017 and I can be out and playing these parts,\u201d he says. \u201cThat\u2019s not wasted on me.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been an extraordinary year for Chelsea Manning, who had her 35-year life sentence commuted by the departing President Obama in January. Released on May 17, she has spent the subsequent six months establishing her credentials as a leading voice of the progressive left, using her social media presence to motivate those agitating for change. \u201cThis is not a new reality\u2014this is what reality has been the whole time,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s more in our face than it\u2019s ever been before, but after this we\u2019re still going to be facing the same threats\u2014they just seem bigger now.\u201d\n\nThis year saw Shayne Oliver bring Hood By Air's disruptive edge to Helmut Lang as the brand's first ever guest designer. For spring '18, he created a \"love letter\" to Lang himself, subverting the brand's minimalist DNA with his unabashedly queer, femme lens. \u201cThe idea is that I\u2019m different than you, and you have to respect it,\u201d Oliver says of his designer ethos. \u201cAs opposed to, I\u2019m different and I\u2019m also the same as you. We actually don\u2019t like the same things, and that\u2019s OK. Queerness has to do with me being different than you and you saying you can handle it.\u201d\n\nClick here for the complete list of this year's OUT100 honorees.", "images": ["https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/tumblr-Out.png", "https://www.out.com/sites/all/modules/custom/heremedia_fb/images/facebook-share-button.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/07/270covers4_copy_3.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1586530151593576&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=259124211325942&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/Out-Logo300x107.svg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/search.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/fb-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/hulu-hellraiser-jamie-clayton-cast-interview.jpg?itok=lnjF0Axx&timestamp=1665167685", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/07/out_100_2017_covers_reflect_750x563.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/all/modules/custom/heremedia_fb/images/twitter-share-button.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/house-of-hammer.jpg?itok=4nQLCLt9&timestamp=1665166295", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/mail-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/outbanner_300x250_lilnasx_may2022.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/themes/out/logo.png", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/07/270covers_copy_3.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/tw-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/07/270covers3_copy_3.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/outbanner_300x250_rickymartin_may2022.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/jb.jpg?itok=zx51rgWr&timestamp=1665159920", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/00_out305_covers_bros_digital_sm.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/darrenhayesstairsalindsayadler_1.jpg?itok=cXDADFHA&timestamp=1665164396", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/07/270covers2_copy_5.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/intgm-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/pixie-polite.jpg?itok=b_xKp1TB&timestamp=1665157336", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/youtuber-charlie-mcdonnell-comes-out-as-transgender.jpg?itok=UpSXXIhy&timestamp=1665165744", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/the-white-lotus-hbo-max-season-2-trailer.jpg?itok=w-BYU-BE&timestamp=1665165473"], "top_img": "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/07/out_100_2017_covers_reflect_750x563.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.out.com/out100-2017/2017/11/08/out100-2017-covers-revealed", "title": "OUT100 2017 Covers Revealed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Out", "fb": {"app_id": 705953026218815, "page_id": 19799718480, "pages": 19799718480}, "description": "Lena Waithe, Jonathan Groff, Chelsea Manning & Shayne Oliver.", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.out.com/out100-2017/2017/11/08/out100-2017-covers-revealed", "title": "OUT100 2017 Covers Revealed", "updated_time": "2019-11-26T20:36:38-05:00", "image": "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2017/11/07/out_100_2017_covers_reflect_750x563.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "outmagazine", "id": 21692297}, "title": "OUT100 2017 Covers Revealed", "description": "Lena Waithe, Jonathan Groff, Chelsea Manning & Shayne Oliver."}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-08T06:53:31-05:00", "modified_time": "2019-11-26T20:36:38-05:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510142011.0, "source": "https://www.out.com", "summary": ""}
