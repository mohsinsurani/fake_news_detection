Just when you think John Legend and Chrissy Teigen, aka the cutest celebrity couple, couldn\u2019t be any more vomit-cute, they surprise us. Because yesterday, Chrissy posted a family photo of little John to Instagram with the caption, \u201cBaby John = baby Luna.\u201d And she\u2019s completely spot on.\n\nWe already knew Luna was adorable. And we\u2019ve seen in past photos how much she looks like mom Chrissy, but the resemblance between Luna and her daddy in this old photo is insane. John as a baby looks exactly like the littlest Legend from her lips to her hair. Cue the cute overload.\n\nFor comparison, here\u2019s the picture Chrissy Teigen posted of baby John.\n\nAnd here\u2019s a picture of little Luna Legend.\n\nCan we talk about how precious the family photo itself is? John\u2019s wearing what appears to be a mini jacket with a bow that matches his older sibling and parents. Clearly Chrissy isn\u2019t the only parent Luna will inherit fashion sense from. Also, we love his mom\u2019s hair!\n\nJohn shared the same photo on Instagram, along with a few other throwback pictures, while on tour in Europe. The more baby pics the better! They could come in handy for future John/Chrissy comparisons with baby 2.\n\nWe sense a lot more #twinning in this family\u2019s future. Given how awesome Chrissy and John turned out, that\u2019s a pretty good thing.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/07/chrissy-teigen-john-legend1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/07/chrissy-teigen-john-legend1.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/07/chrissy-teigen-john-legend1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/chrissy-teigen-luna-john-baby-pic/", "title": "Chrissy Teigen just proved that her daughter Luna is pretty much identical to a baby John Legend, and it is too freakin' cute - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Chrissy Teigen's throwback photo of her husband John Legend just proved that their daughter, Luna, is basically his doppelganger.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chrissy Teigen just proved that her daughter Luna is pretty much identical to a baby John Legend, and it is too freakin' cute - HelloGiggles", "description": "Chrissy Teigen's throwback photo of her husband John Legend just proved that their daughter, Luna, is basically his doppelganger.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/chrissy-teigen-luna-john-baby-pic/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/07/chrissy-teigen-john-legend1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1000, "height": 762, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-07T21:40:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T22:12:41+00:00"}, "author": "mandyvelez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "mandyvelez", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507412449.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
