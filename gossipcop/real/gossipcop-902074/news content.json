Am I pissing off fandoms by questioning this...? Oh well, I'm gonna say it: I am very shocked Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have lasted this long. The so-gorgeous-it-actually-defies-science couple have been serious for a while now, with both of them having met each other's families and gone on lots of vacations together. Next step: spending Christmas with each other's fams. The photos of Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik on Christmas Eve will, if you're a skeptic like me, make you believe their relationship is very much the real deal.\n\nThe couple of two years have actually spent Christmas Eve together in the past, so now it's pretty much a tradition. They spent this year making gingerbread houses and hanging out with family. Malik's sister, Safaa, was there, and they all posed for an adorable selfie on her Instagram story. The whole chill night was documented on her story, actually, and I'm sure it's that #goodcontent Gigi and Zayn stans ate right up. The photos consisted of lots of selfies in Christmas PJs (bless), the aforementioned gingerbread houses, and lots of holiday filters.\n\nThis selfie of Gigi, Zayn, and Safaa is adorable AF and shows just how much Gigi is part of the Malik fam.\n\nInstagram/Gigi Hadid\n\nShe also posted this ~angelic~ selfie of her and her boo.\n\nInstagram/Gigi Hadid\n\nUh, Gigi, the wings are blocking your face!\n\n*Beyonc\u00e9 voice* We built gingerbread housesssssss.\n\nInstagram/Gigi Hadid\n\nMama Hadid also built one!\n\nInstagram/Gigi Hadid\n\nSafaa Malik also posted this ~festive~ selfie on her Instagram story on Christmas Eve.\n\nInstagram/Safaa Malik\n\nAnd the other selfie on Christmas!\n\nGigi and Bella Hadid's brother, Anwar, was also in attendance at this blessed gathering, but he couldn't hang and fell asleep.\n\nInstagram/Gigi Hadid\n\nIf you don't know who Anwar Hadid is, he's also a model. So that tracks. Unfortunately, there was no sign of Bella Hadid, but that doesn't mean she wasn't there! She might've just been off watching a basketball game on TV in another part of the house. We all know how much Bella Hadid loves basketball. And sneakers.\n\nAnyway, back to Gigi and Zayn! The couple celebrated their two-year anniversary in November. Unsurprisingly, Hadid posted on her Instagram story to commemorate the occasion.\n\nShe posted a selfie of her and Malik kissing, saying, \"2 yrs w my favorite human.\"\n\nInstagram/Gigi Hadid\n\nWhile Malik rarely posts/talks about his relationship with Hadid in interviews, he did open up about their relationship being \"normal\" to them in a June interview with Evening Standard. He told the outlet, \"I can understand how it can look, that you\u2019ve got these two people in a \u2018power couple.\u2019 That\u2019s not something I want to be a part of. I\u2019m with her because I like her and I hope she\u2019s with me because she likes me.\" He added, \"When we come home, we don\u2019t really talk about that s\u2014. We just spend time together as a normal couple, cook food, watch TV, have a laugh.\"\n\nIn case you need more proof that these two are great together, Malik says Hadid helps him keep track of his busy life. Malik told Billboard, \"It\u2019s actually not that hard for us [to line up schedules]. It helps that she\u2019s really organized. Thank God! Because I\u2019m really not, so she helps organize my schedule around seeing her!\" He revealed she spends a lot of time with him when he's recording music. He said, \"She\u2019s in the studio quite a lot. She likes to cook for me and stuff \u2014 when I\u2019m here late, she\u2019ll come down and bring me food. She\u2019s cool.\" Yeah, she's cool. I totally know 'cause we're totally friends. I'm actually the one taking all of the photos on Hadid's Insta story, so.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/8420f1b5-5d73-4e28-9459-14a91f390347-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-12646-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/ebd5c6cf-8b90-44d7-817a-4ca0580a8130-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-15720-pm.png?w=414&h=729&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/28/b0f43f37-1fd9-4607-9040-390f9b68c1e7-f7819749-01e9-4a30-8d29-0d948716e7b7-getty-1418888016.jpeg?w=138&h=138&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/2c34b573-c0d6-46c5-a910-2326d299f932-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-12646-pm.png?w=414&h=250&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/3/733517e3-b4b9-4aa9-91ac-d93f796fa84c-ciw_unit_12862_r.JPG?w=138&h=138&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4707&fp-y=0.294", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15353773&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/26/0cde0f65-d906-437b-a1e5-34b2a793473b-1426672682.jpg?w=138&h=138&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.3827&fp-y=0.2114", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/95c43e5d-3be0-4913-8c44-d06afc411b5c-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-15954-pm.png?w=414&h=478&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/5232eb14-4c21-421a-b39c-4a99dbb23b43-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-20322-pm.png?w=414&h=365&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/8420f1b5-5d73-4e28-9459-14a91f390347-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-12646-pm.png?w=374&h=226&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/e6a30345-34f4-4b26-8444-b6745297b3d6-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-15857-pm.png?w=414&h=734&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/cf8930b7-8b1e-41e8-8f19-f2e21a96c194-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-20013-pm.png?w=414&h=685&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/8e8d1eab-23df-4d05-a02d-3719b2e4c07d-gigizayn.jpeg?w=414&h=736&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2017/12/26/8420f1b5-5d73-4e28-9459-14a91f390347-screen-shot-2017-12-26-at-12646-pm.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elitedaily.com/p/photos-of-gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-on-christmas-eve-will-make-you-believe-in-love-7690726", "title": "Gigi Hadid & Zayn Malik Spent Christmas Together With Their Families & I'm Sobbing", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@elitedaily", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@kellixboyle"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/EliteDaily"}, "og": {"site_name": "Elite Daily", "url": "https://www.elitedaily.com/p/photos-of-gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-on-christmas-eve-will-make-you-believe-in-love-7690726", "type": "article", "title": "Gigi Hadid & Zayn Malik Spent Christmas Together With Their Families & I'm Sobbing", "description": "Is anyone else shocked that Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have lasted this long...?
