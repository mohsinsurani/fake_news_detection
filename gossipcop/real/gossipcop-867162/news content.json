This year has been pretty great to Jenelle Evans \u2014 so far in 2017, she\u2019s given birth to her baby girl Ensley Jolie, got engaged to her fianc\u00e9 David Eason, and now she\u2019s getting married! Shortly after she announced her wedding date, the Teen Mom 2 star tackled the next big step in the planning process \u2014 finding her perfect wedding dress!\n\nThe 25-year-old shared adorable snaps from her day spent wedding dress shopping in NYC for her September 23 nuptials. Jenelle wore an off-the-shoulder white dress with lace detail to symbolize that she\u2019s the bride, and she stopped to pose in front of rows and rows of racks filled with gorgeous wedding dresses. \u201cIt\u2019s finally happening!\u201d she wrote, and she later revealed that she chose a dress.\n\nNext, she shared a photo of her wedding dress shopping squad, posing with two unidentified brunettes. She said she brought her pals along to help, but many fans pointed out that Jenelle\u2019s mom, Barbara Evans, was noticeably absent from such a special occasion.\n\n\u201cWhere is your mom? Your mother needs to be there,\u201d one fan wrote, and another commented, \u201cLet me guess? You didn\u2019t invite your mom to come with. So sad to not share these moments with people who have been there for you from the beginning.\u201d\n\nThe mother-daughter duo is notorious for having a very tumultuous relationship, and their issues intensified back in 2011, shortly after Jenelle signed over custody of her son Jace to her mom. But since then, Jenelle has been awarded more visitation with Jace, and back in July, she gave fans an update on the state of her relationship with her mom.\n\n\u201cWe are in the same situation,\u201d the reality star told E! News. \u201cWe went to court about Jace and I got a visitation schedule set, but she\u2019s still kind of bent out of shape because I still have resentment towards her for still keeping my son and we still butt heads.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think our relationship\u2019s lost,\u201d she continued. \u201cI don\u2019t ever think there\u2019s really coming back at any point in time.\u201d\n\nLove Teen Mom?
