Online, the \u201cno social media\u201d policy was implemented in 2015 but isn\u2019t taken as seriously two years later. Sources told the publication that when the policy was first introduced it was \u201csolely to do with guests\u2019 security and enjoyment of the event,\u201d not to prohibit them from documenting the annual night.\n\nHalle Berry and Nick Jonas, for example, kept fans up to date on their night by posting Instagram stories, while Jackson shared a Snapchat photo of herself in the bathroom with Bella Hadid, Lara Stone and Ruby Rose.\n\nIn 2015, Kendall Jenner took a bathroom selfie which featured the likes of Emily Ratajkowski, Zoe Kravitz and Cara Delevingne.\n\nSee Photos: 2017 Met Gala: Best and Worst Dressed\n\nNew York City\u2019s famed Metropolitan Museum of Art hosts an annual fundraiser for its Costume Institute.
