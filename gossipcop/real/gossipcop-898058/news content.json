As Affleck told Boston Magazine, the two initially got ahead of themselves when it came to their salaries from the script sell, saying, \"I remember it was printed in Daily Variety that we were going to get $600,000 on it. We had no credit, so we went to rent this house that was $3,000 a month, and we used a copy of the Daily Variety to get the place. I was like, 'I don't have credit, but this is who we are.' And the landlord was like, 'All right, sure.' We thought $600,000 would take care of us for 20 years, so we rented nicer apartments and each bought Jeep Cherokees. And we were completely broke in a year.\"\n\nIt took several years for the film to finally reach a production stage due to rewrites and a crucial studio shift from Castle Rock to Miramax, during which time they even relocated back to Boston. But once their acting careers started taking flight \u2014 with Damon starring in the title role of The Rainmaker\u2014 and Robin Williams signed on for the film, the movie finally got into motion, and the two were finally on their way to the big time.", "images": ["https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-untold-truth-of-matt-damon-and-ben-afflecks-friendship/intro-1510856780.jpg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-untold-truth-of-matt-damon-and-ben-afflecks-friendship/intro-1510856780.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amanda Bell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/96293/untold-truth-matt-damon-ben-afflecks-friendship/", "title": "The Untold Truth Of Matt Damon And Ben Affleck's Friendship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-untold-truth-of-matt-damon-and-ben-afflecks-friendship/intro-1510856780.jpg", "title": "The Untold Truth Of Matt Damon And Ben Affleck's Friendship - Nicki Swift", "description": "Let's take a look at how Ben Affleck and Matt Damon became such a power couple in Hollywood.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nickiswift.com/96293/untold-truth-matt-damon-ben-afflecks-friendship/", "site_name": "NickiSwift.com"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-untold-truth-of-matt-damon-and-ben-afflecks-friendship/intro-1510856780.jpg", "twitter": {"title": "The Untold Truth Of Matt Damon And Ben Affleck's Friendship - Nicki Swift", "description": "Let's take a look at how Ben Affleck and Matt Damon became such a power couple in Hollywood.", "site": "@NickiSwiftCeleb", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/the-untold-truth-of-matt-damon-and-ben-afflecks-friendship/intro-1510856780.jpg"}, "title": "The Untold Truth Of Matt Damon And Ben Affleck's Friendship - Nicki Swift", "description": "Let's take a look at how Ben Affleck and Matt Damon became such a power couple in Hollywood.", "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-16T13:33:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-04-09T15:26:24+00:00", "author": "Amanda Bell"}, "fb": {"pages": 915319058545299, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "enable=true ad_density=default"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f7a286f935bd433580c2d31f5d66fea9"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510839204.0, "source": "https://www.nickiswift.com", "summary": ""}
