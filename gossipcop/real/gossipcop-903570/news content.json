We're sure her one-year-old daughter, Luna, would agree! The model and cookbook author is a total ace when it comes to picking out Halloween costumes; she's an expert with kiddie hairstyles; and her mommy-and-me looks are decked in avocados.\n\nAnd, Teigen's inventive sense of style stays strong when she has a bun in the oven. As we saw when she was pregnant with little Luna, Teigen is an expert at turning up the glam factor on maternity style. For her first pregnancy, the witty star wore glamorous gowns, cute shift dresses, and soft, flowing fabrics like silk and cotton.\n\nNow that she has another little one on the way, Teigen is keeping things chic and relaxed, and adding bohemian touches to her perfectly pulled together outfits. And, she's embracing pink big-time! (She's our \u2014 and Kameron Westcott's \u2014 kind of girl.)\n\nLet's take a look back at some of her other chic-and-easy looks from the past couple of months.\n\nNovember 7, 2017: New York City Street Style\n\nTeigen didn't officially announce her pregnancy until November 21, but it's traditional to wait at least 12 weeks before making the news public.\n\nThat said: it's likely that the style star already had a bun in the oven for this trip to NYC. She kept her style relaxed but sleek with leather pants and lace-up boots from The Row, paired with a button-down top and a Bevza jacket. Note the hoop earrings: They've been a favorite accessory as of late.\n\nNovember 7, 2017: Forevermark NYC Event\n\nFor the glitzy event, Tiegen opted for a sheer, off-the-shoulder style by Massachi. Off-the-shoulder silhouettes have been a theme for this pregnancy, so keep your eyes peeled for the next instance.\n\nNovember 8, 2017: New York City Street Style\n\nThe next day, Teigen stuck to her street-style formula of sleek, fitted black pants and a slouchy top that could have been borrowed from the boys. Hello again, hoop earrings!\n\nNovember 11, 2017: Baby2Baby Gala\n\nAn off-the-shoulder silhouette and a flowing, voluminous skirt gave a relaxed vibe to Teigen's look at the Los Angeles event. She worked with her stylist Monica Rose to select the cherry-red frock by Christos Costarellos.\n\nNovember 21, 2017: A New Hairstyle\n\nNew baby, new look! In late November, John Legend's love showed off a new set of bangs and honey-blonde highlights from her BFF stylist, Jen Atkin. Priscilla Valles handled the expert extensions.\n\nNovember 29, 2017: Smithsonian Magazine's 2017 American Ingenuity Awards\n\nTeigen showed off those bangs at her next red-carpet appearance. She wore a Lanvin gown with mixed prints and a tasseled belt, and topped off the bohemian style gold hoop earrings and an assortment of rings.\n\nDecember 3, 2017: Vacation Style\n\n\ud83d\udd0e spot the difference A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Dec 3, 2017 at 4:00pm PST\n\nThe expert cook relaxed on a kitchen counter while on vacation in Hawaii. In a white bikini with a flower tucked behind her ear, Teigen was the picture of relaxation \u2014 and her glowing tan and growing baby bump were her best accessories.\n\nDecember 7, 2017: The 2017 GQ Men Of The Year Party\n\nPink may be Teigen's pregnancy power color. (Such a thing exists, right?) There was that time she pulled off tropical hues at a black-tie event in Norway; there was also the pink floral dress she wore for her mom's birthday party in New York.\n\nThen, she wore a bubblegum-pink velvet gown by Rhea Costa for GQ's December dinner. She also stuck with the off-the-shoulder silhouette and wore several rings. Strappy, resort-ready sandals by DSquared2 showed off Teigen's pale-pink pedicure.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-01.jpg?itok=R3Em70N1", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/style-living-ig-sc-shep-rose-charleston-comments.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/08/style-living-ig-rhoc-heather-dubrow-twins-college-packing-1_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/05/style-living-ig-rhom-nicole-martin-most-used-room.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/12/lookbook-chrissy-teigan-oslo-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/style-living-ig-vpr-katie-maloney-home-decor.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/style-living-rhobh-kyle-richards-halloween-decor.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-05.jpg?itok=DaeFSINO", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/06/style-living-ig-rhobh-erika-jayne-house-tour.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-02.jpg?itok=RciSOzXn", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/faux_player__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/11/385/WWHL_633_Interview_John_Chrissy_783_mezzn.jpg?itok=GS_wXp9X", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/madison_lecroy_promote_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/08/rhodubai-season-1-reunion-fashion-new.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/nbcubravotv/files/styles/large/public/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-03.jpg?itok=dXZENK2d", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/crystal_kung-minkoff_promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-04.jpg?itok=G34ESfu8", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/12/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/917/650/RHOA_14_BONUS_CLOSET_TOUR_MARLO_TUNE_IN.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-06.jpg?itok=q25aHlox", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/12/dish-120417-chrissy-teigen.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embed/public/field_blog_image/2016/03/chrissy-teigen-maternity-style-promote.jpg?itok=RrexkoRo"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/12/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/lookbook/chrissy-teigen-second-pregnancy-style", "title": "Chrissy Teigen's Second Pregnancy Style: See Bump Photos", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1131085, "parsely-section": "Style & Living Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Chrissy Teigen's Second Pregnancy Style Is So Relaxed\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"Style & Living\"},\"field_microsite\":\"Style & Living\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1156285\",\"site_section\":\"Style & Living\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/12\\/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-promote.jpg?itok=anIMzHL7\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/12\\/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-promote.jpg?itok=g9UffzjB\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/12\\/lookbook-chrissy-teigen-pregnancy-style-promote.jpg?itok=G6kzJnqi\"}}", "description": "Let's just put this out there: Chrissy Teigen is mom #goals.
