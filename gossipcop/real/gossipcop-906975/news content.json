THANK YOU @TylerBaltierra I LOVE YOU SO MUCH!!!!! You are my light!! And nova you are my sunshine #KeepTalkingMH \u2014 Catelynn Baltierra (@CatelynnLowell) January 17, 2018\n\nWhen a fan tweeted and asked Lowell about what \u201ctrauma\u201d she was referring to, she responded with, \u201cMy childhood trauma!!!\u201d\n\nLowell, who shares 3-year-old daughter Novalee with husband Tyler Baltierra, entered a six-week treatment program in November after having suicidal thoughts. She returned home on December 30. \u201cSo excited for the future and seeing my family!! Six weeks of treatment and I feel good! Gotta work it when I get home thanks for all your support,\u201d she tweeted on her way home.\n\nBefore entering treatment in November, Lowell exclusively spoke to Us Weekly about her journey to recovery.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the time I need right now to take good care of myself,\u201d she said. \u201cOn November 17th I thought of every way possible to commit suicide \u2026 from wrapping a belt around my neck to just running my car into an electric pole. Thank God I have a support system and a HUSBAND and a DAUGHTER. Thank God I am self aware I\u2019m seeking treatment and I WILL get better. Anyone feeling alone you ARE NOT ALONE! This world needs all of us! We are all here for a reason.\u201d\n\nThe Conquering Chaos author has been vocal for years on Teen Mom OG and on social media about her battle with postpartum depression in 2016. She also spent time getting treatment then as well.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/catelynn-lowell-heads-back-to-rehab.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/catelynn-lowell-heads-back-to-rehab.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/catelynn-lowell-heads-back-to-treatment-third-times-a-charm/", "title": "Catelynn Lowell Heads Back to Treatment: \u2018Third Time\u2019s a Charm\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "teen mom og", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "'Teen Mom OG' star Catelynn Lowell just revealed she is heading back to treatment, only two weeks after returning home -- read her statement", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Catelynn Lowell Heads Back to Treatment: 'Third Time\u2019s a Charm'", "description": "'Teen Mom OG' star Catelynn Lowell just revealed she is heading back to treatment, only two weeks after returning home -- read her statement", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/catelynn-lowell-heads-back-to-treatment-third-times-a-charm/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-17T20:53:17+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/catelynn-lowell-heads-back-to-rehab.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/catelynn-lowell-heads-back-to-rehab.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-17T20:53:17+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Longeretta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Catelynn Lowell Heads Back to Treatment: 'Third Time\u2019s a Charm'", "description": "'Teen Mom OG' star Catelynn Lowell just revealed she is heading back to treatment, only two weeks after returning home -- read her statement", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/catelynn-lowell-heads-back-to-rehab.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516222397.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
