USA TODAY Sports\n\nSerena Williams announced Thursday she won\u2019t defend her Australian Open title.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam winner said on Snapchat she is \u201csuper close\u201d to returning to her championship form five months after she gave birth to her first child.\n\nHer post read in part:\n\n\u201cMy coach and team always said \u2018only go to tournaments when you are prepared to go all the way\u2019. I can compete \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time. With that being said, and even though I am disappointed about it, I\u2019ve decided not to compete in the Australian Open this year.\n\n\n\n\u201cThe memory of last year\u2019s Open is one that I will carry with me, and Olympia and I look forward to coming back again. I appreciate the support and understanding of my fans and everyone at the Australian Open.\u201d\n\nThe Australian Open begins Jan. 15. Williams\u2019s victory last year was her seventh in Melbourne and her last Grand Slam victory before the birth of her daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr.\n\nThe Australian Open tweeted best wishes shortly after her announcement, saying in part: \"Good luck for the rest of 2018, Serena! We'll miss you\"\n\nUnfortunately @serenawilliams has withdrawn from the #AusOpen.\n\n\n\n\"I can compete \u2013 but I don\u2019t want to just compete, I want to do far better than that and to do so, I will need a little more time.\"\n\n\n\nGood luck for the rest of 2018, Serena!

And Novak Djokovic, who has won in Melbourne six times, is undecided on whether he'll play.\n\nFollow Perez on Twitter @byajperez\n\nPHOTOS: SERENA WILLIAMS' GRAND SLAM TITLES", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "http://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/e42b3e3f9e6d0d26d33e41de814611a623f0c95d/c=0-269-2639-1760&r=1280x720/local/-/media/2017/12/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636498934117329254-USATSI-10386833.jpg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bda66f5f7f4f802e2b4d64931fd13d3873740205/c=934-264-4565-2315/local/-/media/2018/01/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636506918103294631-2018-01-04-Serena-Williams.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bda66f5f7f4f802e2b4d64931fd13d3873740205/c=934-264-4565-2315/local/-/media/2018/01/04/USATODAY/USATODAY/636506918103294631-2018-01-04-Serena-Williams.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["A.J.
