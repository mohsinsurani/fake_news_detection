Once again, franchise leading lady Paulson played a famous survivor, only this time she turned down an offer to be interviewed by the first famous survivor she played in the Ryan Murphy franchise \u2014 AHS\u2018 version of Barbara Walters, Lana Winter. Paulson played Lana in season two, Asylum, and came out of retirement to reprise her Briarcliff journalist last season in Roanoke. The finale stunt was AHS\u2018 most high-profile season crossover to date, solidifying how all of the seasons exist in one big, twisted universe. Though Cult also resurrected AHS villain Twisty the Clown (John Carroll Lynch) this season, callbacks to the larger AHS universe were slight.\n\nAhead of Roanoke, co-creator and showrunner Murphy confirmed what AHS viewers had long suspected, that all seasons of the franchise are, in fact, connected. When speaking to The Hollywood Reporter last year, Murphy promised of the tie-ins, \u201cYou\u2019ll see it this season, and then you\u2019ll really see it after this season. We lay a lot of pipe, and you\u2019ll see it explode in seasons seven and eight.\u201d\n\nRoanoke doubled down on Murphy\u2019s promise with its AHS mythology nods, but now that the finale of Cult has come and gone: Did the election throw a wrench into Murphy\u2019s plans for the larger universe?\n\n\u201cThe writers have their finger on the pulse of what\u2019s going on,\u201d star Evan Peters tells THR about Cult delivering a provocative and timely ending, instead of a thematic one. \u201cThe writers were ahead of the curve with the riots in Charlottesville [Va.], something Ryan has talked about. And when filming the ending, at the time it did feel relevant. Now, it\u2019s horrible what\u2019s happening, but it\u2019s a good thing that women are getting their power back.\u201d\n\nThis season documented Kai Anderson\u2019s (Peters) rise from a basement-dwelling Trump supporter to a small-town cult leader to a candidate for Michigan\u2019s open Senate seat. In order to accomplish that, Peters morphed into five real-life cult leaders \u2014 Charles Manson, Jim Jones, David Koresh, Marshall Applewhite and Andy Warhol \u2014 to hammer home Murphy\u2019s point of how a man, like Donald Trump, can rise within a disenfranchised community.\n\nThe finale, titled \u201cGreat Again,\u201d also came full circle as the women of the cult came out successful \u2014 unlike Trump vs. Clinton \u2014 in their resistance. The finale revealed a layered plan enacted by Ally, who was working with the FBI to arrest Kai. Ultimately, the two swapped roles. Kai was sentenced to prison and Ally was now running for the Senate seat he had so desired. Her campaign platform echoed Hillary Clinton\u2019s run for president and rings even more true in the wake of the country\u2019s current climate where women are taking back power and speaking out about stories of sexual harassment and assault.\n\n\u201cAll my life I have been told to smile. Stay quiet. Look pretty. Not to stand out from the crowd,\u201d Ally said in a campaign ad. When her approval ratings revealed a distrust from Americans that she could get the job done in a stark Clinton parallel, she noted that the results were code for fear: \u201cThey\u2019re scared. Isn\u2019t it sad when a strong woman scares people more than clowns?\u201d\n\nCult then depicted a new kind of post-election America, one different than the world it had created thus far. Though the setting was now two years after the 2016 presidential election, Ally\u2019s first televised debate mimicked moments when Clinton would outwit Trump (\u201cI am tired of being mansplained to,\u201d Ally said to her male opponent). Cult then took the analogy even further when Kai managed to manipulate his way into a well-planned prison escape, and threaten Ally\u2019s life on the debate stage \u2014 creating a much larger foe for the aspiring candidate. But the former phobia-ridden Ally was now fearless as she got to Kai\u2019s guard first. After realizing he was duped and left holding an unloaded gun, Beverly shot and killed Kai \u2014 illustrating a shocking moment of a woman taking back her power for all other women.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know what the ending means, was it that Hillary should have won?\u201d Peters tells tells The Hollywood Reporter about Cult\u2018s parallels to the election. \u201cI thought it was a great ending. Kai should definitely be killed. Everything that he says represents evil and fear and negativity and he should definitely be stopped.\u201d\n\nBefore Kai was killed, he told Ally, \u201cYou symbolize the hope that women will one day win an argument with their husbands. That they won\u2019t be catcalled when they walk down the streets. That their bosses won\u2019t talk about their tits anymore. That they\u2019ll make just as much money as men make. That the fight is winnable\u2026. Women can\u2019t lead.\u201d But Ally brought the season full circle when she recalled Kai\u2019s earlier statement about a humiliated man: \u201cThere is something more dangerous in this world than a humiliated man: A nasty woman.\u201d\n\nAlly emerged triumphant. A self-proclaimed Nasty Woman going on to win the Senate seat, reopen a now-thriving restaurant and happily reclaim this new life with her son. But, then, Murphy asks: at what cost?\n\nIn the final moment, it is implied that Ally has begun her own female cult in place of Kai\u2019s all-male regime. After telling her son that she plans to meet with powerful friends to lead, \u201cshow them the way, take them to a better place \u2014 a better world,\u201d she dons the green velvet cloak previously seen on Bebe Babbitt (Frances Conroy), the ex-girlfriend of Valerie Solanas (Lena Dunham) and the surviving member of Valerie\u2019s SCUM Manifesto (\u201cSociety for Cutting Up Men\u201d), in which women were instructed to kill men in order to rise to power.\n\nThe ending, an unleashing of female rage, circles back to Murphy\u2019s promise that the season, at its core, is about identity politics and the cult of personality. Before the first episode, when the election theme was the season headline, the showrunner promised: \u201cIt\u2019s not about Trump or Clinton. It really is about the cult of personality that can rise in a divisive society \u2014 and I hope that people can figure that out.\u201d (Though Donna Brazile, former DNC chairwoman, did recently describe Clinton\u2019s campaign as a \u201ccult.\u201d)\n\nThe darkness in the end is something Peters can put into perspective when analyzing Ally\u2019s shift in wake of Kai\u2019s demise. \u201cWhat does that mean, now that she\u2019s a leader of the feminist cult?\u201d he asks. \u201cIf you have to do that darkness in order to get what you need? To get fairness, maybe you have to get dark. Is that the lesson? Is that what we\u2019re supposed to take from that? Is that a good thing? I don\u2019t know. Maybe you have to get angry sometimes in order to make it all come to fruition, but I don\u2019t know if a cult is the answer. To me, the takeaway from the whole show is that cults are bad. (Laughs.)\u201d\n\nAnd with that, Murphy \u2014 who had promised the season wasn\u2019t only for his liberal viewers \u2014 gives his AHS audience much to think about.\n\nWhat did you think of the finale of American Horror Story: Cult?
