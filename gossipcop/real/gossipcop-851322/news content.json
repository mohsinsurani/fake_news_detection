(Sunday, 7 ET live/PT delayed).\n\nThe musical spectacular, airing from Warner Bros. Studios in Burbank, Calif., is this holiday season's only live TV adaptation, this time of a 2012 Broadway musical based on a classic 1983 film that\u2019s set in 1940s Indiana. (NBC canceled plans for Bye, Bye, Birdie, while ABC dropped The Little Mermaid over cost issues).\n\n\u201cThis show is a nice respite. I\u2019ll take any good cheer I can get these days. It\u2019s sweet to think about childhood dreams and family,\u201d says Maya Rudolph, who plays Mother Parker to 9-year-old Ralphie (newcomer Andy Walken).\n\nThe cast also features Chris Diamantopoulos, Jane Krakowski, Ana Gasteyer, David Alan Grier and Ken Jeong. Matthew Broderick plays the on-screen narrator, an adult version of Ralphie.\n\nSweetness aside, the task of staging a sprawling live musical seems formidable even for Rudolph, a veteran of the tightrope, quick turnaround world of Saturday Night Live.\n\n\u201cI cut my teeth on Saturday Night Live in terms of a live show every week. This is just harder, probably because we\u2019re doing a hybrid genre. It\u2019s not a regular musical, not stage, not plain-old TV. And we're doing it live,\u201d she says.\n\nThat doesn't even take into account the smoky air and ashes that the cast and crew had to endure during rehearsals last week as fires raged in parts of Los Angeles.\n\nAll three versions of Christmas Story focus on Ralphie\u2019s obsession with his hoped-for Christmas gift, a Red Ryder BB gun, and feature now-classic scenes with the leg lamp; Ralphie's friend Flick (JJ Batteast) getting his tongue stuck to a frozen schoolyard flagpole; and dogs throwing a wrench into the holiday meal.\n\nWalken, an 11-year-old from Seattle, understands Ralphie\u2019s yearning for a particular gift.\n\n\u201cI can relate to Ralphie because we can both drop hints to our parents about what we want and we both have very big imaginations,\u201d he says. (Hint to Santa Claus: He\u2019d really like a Cozmo robot this Christmas.)\n\nExecutive producer Marc Platt (Grease: Live) says Walken has handled the responsibility of a lead role with grace. \"He's been fantastic. He's the hardest working kid I know and he's having a wonderful time.\"\n\nTheater veteran Broderick agrees with Rudolph\u2019s assessment of the project's challenges.\n\n\u201cIt's a very complex undertaking. There\u2019s the organizing of (14) cameras and cables and actors and children and dogs. There\u2019s musical numbers, there\u2019s dancers. It's quite a lot going on,\u201d he says\n\nChristmas Story includes songs from the Broadway musical by Oscar-winning Benj Pasek and Justin Paul (La La Land), who wrote additional songs for the TV adaptation.\n\n\"It is A Christmas Story through and through,\" Platt says, explaining the production's connection to the film. \"The music just enhances it. It serves the humor and underlying warmth of the film.\"\n\nCast and producers say they're approaching the complex production with a mix of excitement and nervousness. \"You prepare for the unknown. That's what makes live TV exciting. There are certain things that happen that you can't anticipate,\" Platt says.\n\nBroderick takes comfort in a friendly barb from Martin Short, who appeared in NBC\u2019s Hairspray Live! last year, about forgetting dialogue.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636487248051465301-ACSL-REHEARSALS-0079-f.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/wx-82_8x8.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636487242874037737-ACSL-REHEARSALS-0068-f.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/997c023d-a3e1-4217-b5ac-b1c97a464eab/997c023d-a3e1-4217-b5ac-b1c97a464eab_16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/akam/13/pixel_7edc9402?a=dD1iOTE3Y2UxNGZhODdmNTNlNzQ4Y2Y5NDVlYTQ1MzY3NjQyZTMwOWU2JmpzPW9mZg==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-now/behold-the-leg-lamp-foxs-a-christmas-story-offers-live-musical-take-on-holiday-classic/465-6838ebe4-e3ac-4dac-b82f-86f65aa8d35b", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5658133520001_5658118853001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636487245537164950-ACS-KA-Rd2-V2sm-hires2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/13395f0f-41e7-4e64-b100-0446208dea83/13395f0f-41e7-4e64-b100-0446208dea83_16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.gannett-cdn.com/media/2017/12/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636487249299177295-ACSL-REHEARSALS-0087-f.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/assets/shared-images/logos/king.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/assets/shared-images/backgrounds/blank.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/wx-82_32x32.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://media.king5.com/assets/KING/images/a45b40fc-3bca-4a7f-97c6-edc1d3ab5279/a45b40fc-3bca-4a7f-97c6-edc1d3ab5279_16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://www.king5.com/images/header/arrow.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5658133520001_5658118853001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855/https://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-now/behold-the-leg-lamp-foxs-a-christmas-story-offers-live-musical-take-on-holiday-classic/465-6838ebe4-e3ac-4dac-b82f-86f65aa8d35b", "title": "Behold the leg lamp: Fox's 'A Christmas Story' offers live-musical take on holiday classic", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#045ea8", "category": "news", "og": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855/https://www.king5.com/article/news/nation-now/behold-the-leg-lamp-foxs-a-christmas-story-offers-live-musical-take-on-holiday-classic/465-6838ebe4-e3ac-4dac-b82f-86f65aa8d35b", "title": "Behold the leg lamp: Fox's 'A Christmas Story' offers live-musical take on holiday classic", "description": "'A Christmas Story Live!' is new take on a classic", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5658133520001_5658118853001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "site_name": "king5.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "king5,news,nation-now"}, "twitter": {"title": "Behold the leg lamp: Fox's 'A Christmas Story' offers live-musical take on holiday classic", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855im_/https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5658133520001_5658118853001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "KING5Seattle", "description": "'A Christmas Story Live!' is new take on a classic", "domain": "www.king5.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "king5.com", "description": "'A Christmas Story Live!' is new take on a classic", "fb": {"app_id": 156537084972880}}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220819141855if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/zPCb_eD2tws?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
