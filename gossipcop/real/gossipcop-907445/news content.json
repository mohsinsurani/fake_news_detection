To be honest I didn\u2019t even want to take a before picture, because I was already thinking of me not sticking with it & then having the evidence of failure to look back on. But DAYYUMM dude!\u201d he wrote.\n\n\u201cThis got me feeling some type of way right now! Left picture was almost 5 weeks ago & Right picture was today,\u201d he continued. \u201cEating healthier just feels better & obviously looks better hahaha lol BOOM! #LifestyleChanges #Goals.\u201d\n\nBaltierra\u2019s wife, Catelynn Lowell, is on her own path to better herself.
