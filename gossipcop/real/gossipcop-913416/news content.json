Wanna know why?\u201d\n\nWhen the little girl looks over at dad Baltierra, 26, he makes a funny face and shrugs his shoulders.\n\n\u201cMommy has a baby in her belly,\u201d Lowell reveals. \u201cAnd tomorrow, the party is \u2018cause we\u2019re gonna find out if it\u2019s gonna be a little girl or a little boy. Would you want a little brother or a little sister?\u201d\n\nWithout hesitation, Nova responds, \u201cA little sister,\u201d to which her mom asks, \u201cWhat if it\u2019s a boy?
