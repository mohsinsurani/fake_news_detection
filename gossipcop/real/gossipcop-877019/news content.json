The hotel is located near the entrance of the park in the suburbs of Paris, France.\n\nMcLean-Glass, who is from Devon, England, wrote that she decided to book the experience for Noah as early Christmas gift.\n\n\u201cI knew that there would be NOTHING he'd love more than to get to wear a pretty dress, put make up on like Mummy does and have his photo taken being one of his beloved Disney Princesses,\u201d she wrote.\n\nDisneyland Paris' description of the service on its website reads: \"Grant every little girl's wish with a real Princess's make-up and hair-styling session; a fairytale transformation they'll treasure forever.\"\n\nNoah McLean-Glass, three, stands next to his mother, Hayley McLean-Glass. NBC News\n\nThe mother said she was devastated when she received an email reply back saying \"at this time it is not possible to book princess for a day for a boy,\" NBC News' British partner, ITV News reported.\n\n\u201cI was so angry, I literally couldn\u2019t stop shaking for half an hour afterwards \u2014 I was just so shocked,\u201d she told ITV. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m his mother and if I\u2019m OK with him doing it, who are Disney to tell me that he can\u2019t do that?\u201d\n\nDisneyland Paris said they \u201csincerely apologized\u201d to Noah and his mother in a statement to ITV News and that it was an \u201cisolated incident.\u201d\n\n\u201cAn isolated incident, the cast member\u2019s response is not reflective of any policy or belief held here at Disneyland Paris,\u201d read the statement \u2014 Disneyland calls all of their employees \"cast members.\"\n\nFILE: Visitors walk toward the Sleeping Beauty's Castle, background, at Disneyland Paris in Chessy, France, east of Paris, May 12, 2015. Michel Euler / AP\n\nIt continued, \u201cWe are going to ensure this does not happen again.\"\n\n\u201cOf course, both boys and girls are welcome to enjoy The Princess For a Day experience in addition to all our other special activities,\u201d the statement added.\n\nMcLean-Glass said she felt her son had been discriminated against because of his gender.\n\n\"The way I look at it, if a little girl went to Disneyland and wanted to do a pirate experience or a 'Spider-Man' experience, there would be no way that they would stop a girl from doing that because there would be an uproar,\" she said. \"So why is it different for a boy?\"", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_29/2934766/190619-daniella-silva-byline2558.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201708/f_disneyboy_170830.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_35/2138391/170830-noah-disney-ac-619p.JPG", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_35/2138631/ap_729263379051.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_35/2138391/170830-noah-disney-ac-619p.JPG"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_35/2138391/170830-noah-disney-ac-619p.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms", "Daniella Silva", "Daniella Silva Is A Reporter For Nbc News", "Focusing On Education", "How Laws", "Policies", "Practices Affect Students", "Teachers.
