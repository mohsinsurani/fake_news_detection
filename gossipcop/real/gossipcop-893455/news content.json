(The ring, designed by Chmerkovskiy and Jacob Arabo, features a rectangular cushion-cut diamond with a diamond halo and a pav\u00e9 diamond band.)\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Adam Rippon Introduces Us to His Mom & Sister Backstage!\n\nSpeaking not long after some news of his own \u2014 that he\u2019ll be returning to the DWTS franchise, this time as a judge on this fall\u2019s Dancing with the Stars: Juniors \u2014 Rippon doesn\u2019t have many details to share about Johnson\u2019s impending nuptials, though he\u2019s seen photos of a few possible venues. He also has no clue about his bridesman outfit.\n\nBut he\u2019s sure that the wedding is \u201cgoing to be quite the extravaganza\u201d and \u201cvery beautiful.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a treat, too, to get to spend more time with both Johnson, 24, and Chmerkovskiy, 32, having become fast friends with her while competing on (and winning) the most recent season of DWTS.\n\nNow about halfway through filming Juniors as a judge, Rippon has grown close to Chmerkovskiy as well. Chmerkovskiy and Johnson have even double-dated with Rippon and his boyfriend, Jussi-Pekka Kajaala.\n\nRippon says, \u201cI feel very in the family.\u201d\n\nDancing with the Stars: Juniors premieres Oct. 7, and the new season of the original Dancing with the Stars premieres Sept. 24, both on ABC.", "images":
