Selena Gomez had a fun night out with her friends after she completed treatment for her mental health.\n\nGomez, 26, was spotted at Firefly bar in the Studio City neighborhood of Los Angeles on Thursday, December 20, to celebrate celebrity hairstylist Marissa Marino\u2018s birthday. The \u201cBack to You\u201d singer arrived around 8 p.m. along with a few friends. \u201cThey walked in through the front kind of in a huddle with Selena in the middle,\u201d a source tells Us Weekly exclusively. \u201cThey looked serious when they walked in, but they were escorted to a table on the side of the restaurant, kind of closed off but still discreet.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelena looked happy throughout dinner, which lasted a little under two hours,\u201d says the source. \u201cShe was laughing and smiling and looked like she was in a healthy state of mind. No one bothered her, but her presence was definitely known. She seemed to have a nice and normal night out.\u201d\n\nThe source adds: \u201cA few members of the party ordered drinks,\u201d but the Disney Channel alum was not seen drinking herself.\n\nThe former Wizards of Waverly Place star stepped out in L.A. again on Friday, December 21. She looked casual in black leggings, white sneakers and an oversized jean jacket with her hair slicked back.\n\nThe 13 Reasons Why producer was spotted on Tuesday, December 18, for the first time since she checked into treatment for her mental health. The actress appeared to be in good spirits as she went snow tubing with her friends in Big Bear Lake, California.\n\nThe \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me\u201d crooner previously sought treatment in 2014, 2016 and last January. \u201cShe\u2019s dealt with depression before and is still dealing with it,\u201d and insider close to Gomez revealed to Us in October. \u201cShe wants to better herself every day. That\u2019s her priority.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Selena-Gomez2.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1683px%2C884px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Selena-Gomez2.jpg?crop=0px%2C46px%2C1683px%2C952px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Selena-Gomez2.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1683px%2C884px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kaitlin Cubria"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-parties-with-friends-after-completing-treatment/", "title": "Selena Gomez Parties With Friends After Completing Treatment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Selena Gomez partied with friends to celebrate hairstylist Marissa Marino's birthday at Firefly bar in Studio City, CA on Thursday, December 20 - details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Selena 'Looked Happy' Hanging Out With Pals After Mental Health Treatment", "description": "Selena Gomez partied with friends to celebrate hairstylist Marissa Marino's birthday at Firefly bar in Studio City, CA on Thursday, December 20 - details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/selena-gomez-parties-with-friends-after-completing-treatment/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T13:50:56+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Selena-Gomez2.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1683px%2C884px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Selena-Gomez2.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1683px%2C884px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-12-22T15:29:13+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T13:50:56+00:00"}, "author": "Kaitlin Cubria", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Selena 'Looked Happy' Hanging Out With Pals After Mental Health Treatment", "description": "Selena Gomez partied with friends to celebrate hairstylist Marissa Marino's birthday at Firefly bar in Studio City, CA on Thursday, December 20 - details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Selena-Gomez2.jpg?crop=0px%2C44px%2C1683px%2C884px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@KCubes", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1545492553.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
