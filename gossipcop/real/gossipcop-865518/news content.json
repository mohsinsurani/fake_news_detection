{"url": "https://people.com/music/lorde-not-in-taylor-swift-squad/", "text": "It may no longer be a green light to consider Lorde a member of Taylor Swift\u2019s squad.\n\nThe 20-year-old New Zealand pop star revealed to Australian Yahoo affiliate Sunrise that, for her, the allure of a celebrity friend circle doesn\u2019t fit her social life.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t hang out with these people at all,\u201d she said, referring to the influx of famous friends she came in contact with after the success of her debut album Pure Heroine at age 16.\n\nWhen the interviewer suggested that she was a member of Swift\u2019s so-called \u201csquad,\u201d Lorde jokingly rolled her eyes. \u201cYou know, you make friends in different places, but I think for the most part I\u2019m not, like, calling my idols for advice necessarily.\u201d\n\nLorde, who reached No. 1 on the Billboard 200 chart with her latest album Melodrama, said the best way for her to mentally process meeting her musical heroes like Beyonc\u00e9 and Swift is to pretend it\u2019s another world.\n\n\u201cThe second you think too hard about it, you\u2019ll just go insane, so it\u2019s best to be like, \u2018We\u2019re in wonderland and it\u2019s just what happens around here,'\u201d she said.\n\nShe and the 1989 songstress seem to have a close bond. In March, Swift broke her social media silence to promote Lorde\u2019s new single, and in November, threw her a star-studded 20th birthday bash at Carbone in New York City.\n\nFROM COINAGE: If You Had To Google For \u2018Ibiza\u2019 After The Grammys, You\u2019re Not Alone\n\nFellow celebs who turned out included Aziz Ansari, Lena Dunham,Tavi Gevinson, Jack Antonoff, Mae Whitman, and model Karlie Kloss.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BMioGS4FKwr/\n\nLorde received backlash last month when she compared her friendship with Swift to a disease during an interview with the Guardian, trying to express the challenges of staying close with someone so famous.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like having a friend with very specific allergies. There are certain places you can\u2019t go together; certain things you can\u2019t do,\u201d she said. \u201cThere are these different sets of considerations within the friendship \u2014 it\u2019s like having a friend with an autoimmune disease.\u201d\n\nLorde eventually apologized for the comment on Twitter, writing that she \u201cf\u2014\u2013 up & it was really insensitive.\u201d\n\nAttention to Swift\u2019s so-called \u201csquad\u201d mostly began in 2015 after the release of her star-studded \u201cBad Blood\u201d music video, which featured Selena Gomez, Zendaya, Lena Dunham and Gigi Hadid, among others.", "images":
