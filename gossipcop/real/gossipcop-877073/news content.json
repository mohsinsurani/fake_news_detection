Frankie made it to the finale, ultimately finishing in third place with pro dance partner Witney Carson, while Fisher took home the Mirrorball trophy alongside partner Lindsay Arnold.\n\nNow they two are returning to the ballroom to co-host the pint-sized version of the competition when Dancing with the Stars: Juniors debuts on Sunday, October 7.\n\n\"The opening number of the premiere episode on Sunday, I think people are going to fall in love,\" Muniz told reporters on the red carpet after Dancing with the Stars last Monday. \"They're going to go, 'Oh, this is for real. They can dance.' I think it's a lot of fun.\"\n\nIn addition to the age difference -- the 12 celebrity kids range from 9 to 14 years old -- the other variation is that Juniors was pre-taped over the summer, so the kids were out of school and so that many of our favorite pro dancers could serve as mentors, among them Cheryl Burke, Witney Carson, Sasha Farber, Lindsay Arnold, and Artem Chigvintsev. The judging panel also has fresh faces and is comprised of Mandy Moore, Val Chmerkovskiy, and Adam Rippon.\n\n\"It is a true black hole of love, warmth and genuinely rooting for each other,\" Fisher says of the DTWS family. \"They\u2019ve built this community unlike anything that I've ever seen and have all remained in each other\u2019s lives. As an extension of that, we naturally want to see the kids do well. You naturally want to root for them, especially when they are passionately working their butts off for it.\"\n\nhttps://parade.com/704050/debrawallace/photos-meet-the-adorable-and-talented-kids-competing-on-dwts-juniors/\n\nWhat was it like to be back in the ballroom?\n\nJordan Fisher: I love it. We literally spent the last year doing season 25, and we did the tour together for four or five months, so this has really been our family for a year. But what's really cool is being on this side of it where you go, \"Hey, we can\u2019t get eliminated, we\u2019re safe, we\u2019re safe.\"\n\nFrankie Muniz: Well, maybe you know next season they might say, \"Frankie you're out,\" but at least I'll be home.\n\nThe person who won deserved it, but were you surprised in anyway because there were a couple of competitors?\n\nJordan Fisher: There came a point in time in this season where Frankie and I would look at each other and we\u2019d go, \"It could be any of them.\"\n\nFrankie Muniz: Any of them could be in the finale and could win. I think what\u2019s really cool about the show is it is hard to tell who\u2019s going to win. There isn\u2019t a frontrunner. Everyone\u2019s good in their own way, and even the development from week one to the end, it's insanity how much they improve in such a short time. I think people will like seeing that.\n\nHow did the kids do with the critiques from the judges?\n\nJordan Fisher: That was one of the things that really concerned me going into it, especially since I used to teach dance myself. I've had kids in my life my whole life, I've got a massive family, and there's a way you have to approach it, right? From a sense of honesty, love and nurture, we have, hopefully, helped foster a conducive environment for them where they can grow and feel like they\u2019ve actually gained something rather than just been beaten down.\n\nI feel like it's a little bit different with the adults. You can be more straightforward, you can be a little more New York and say exactly how you feel. With the kids, I was so grateful that we had the judges that we did. Adam, Mandy, and Val did an unbelievable job at getting across some points they needed to get across, but from a place of nurture and of love and of expecting to see growth on the other end. It was really beautifully done.\n\nWhat do you think about it being pre-taped?\n\nJordan Fisher: It's hard to say. I think season one, it was probably the safer way to go. There are a lot of things that you don\u2019t know what to expect, right, so you want to be able to cushion yourself with a little bit of a backend so you can adjust and make sure that everything happened the safest way possible. I think moving forward, it would be awesome to see it live because I think these kids can handle it.\n\nFrankie Muniz: I do hope that we can get the audience at home involved more with it going into the future, if we get to go again, but that all depends on if people tune in, so please tune in so we can do it again.\n\nWhen this season of DWTS ends, are you going to miss being the reigning champ?\n\nJordan Fisher: Every great thing has to come to an end at some point. It's the way that it goes. I've got the trophy, I'm very grateful for my experience, and I'm so, so excited to see DeMarcus Ware with Lindsay. She's doing an incredible job with him.\n\nIt's funny, I don\u2019t know if he\u2019s talked to you about this, but the way that he processes and learns is with numbers, He's great with numbers. He's a football player and that\u2019s what he does. So, Lindsay would get to five, six, seven, eight and go back to one, and he\u2019s like, \"No, 9, 10, 11, 12, keep it going because I know that 20 is there and 40 is here and 65 is back there.\" It's an incredible thing for her to be able to adapt in that way. It's just a testament to how wonderful of a teacher she is.\n\nWhere do you have your Mirrorball trophy?\n\nJordan Fisher: It's in my bathroom right now. I'm doing renovations on my house at the moment, so it is somewhere. It's wherever the builders have put it, and I'm hoping that it's in a safe place. Yikes. I'm literally home for only 48 hours because I'm in New York working on a project right now, and I'm not at my home, I'm in a hotel here, which is kind of odd, and I'm just hoping that it survives.\n\nDancing with the Stars: Juniors debuts Sunday, Oct. 7 at 8 p.m. ET/PT on ABC.", "images": ["https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODY0ODQwNDM4NTIzMTAx/stranger-things-quotes.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODY4MDM1MzU3MzIwOTEy/blue-bloods-hp-season-13-tom-selleck-118869_0248b.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTcxNTYzNzI5MDM2NDY0/goodnight-mommy.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODQzMTg3ODk3NzcxNzI4/ncis-la-daniela-ruah-117949_2215b2c.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc4NjkxMTA3NzI3MjI4/maxresdefault-1.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc4NjkxMTA3NzI3MjI4/maxresdefault-1.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc1OTIzMjUzMTU5MDM3/halle.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/MTg5NTUwNzMyMjcyMjE1NjM2/parade-logo-hamburger.svg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkwNTc1OTIzMjUzMTU5MDM3/halle.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/MTg5NzMxMjY4MjY5NzEyNjEw/parade-logo-nav-140w.svg", "https://parade.com/.image/t_share/MTkwNTc4MTE4NTE2NjgwNTcy/dancing-with-the-stars-juniors.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODcwMTM1MDU5NDU3NzQ0/jumanji-the-next-level-uk-film-premiere---red-carpet-arrivals.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODQ1NDEwMDA2NDc2NDk2/white-lotus-season-2-hbo.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Ch_60%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_600/MTg5NTQ5Njk0NzY5MTc4MjA5/parade-logo-footer-275x60.svg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODY3MDUwMTk5MTk2ODkz/agt-judges-nup_198270_03706.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTcxNTYzNzI5MDM2NDY0/goodnight-mommy.jpg", "https://parade.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODY5MjAzMzE5OTg5OTY4/mindy-kaling.jpg"], "top_img": "https://parade.com/.image/t_share/MTkwNTc4MTE4NTE2NjgwNTcy/dancing-with-the-stars-juniors.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paulette Cohn"], "canonical_link": "https://parade.com/706667/paulettecohn/frankie-muniz-and-jordan-fisher-on-returning-to-the-ballroom-for-dancing-with-the-stars-juniors/", "title": "Frankie Muniz and Jordan Fisher on Returning to the Ballroom for Dancing with the Stars: Juniors", "meta_data": {"author": "Paulette Cohn", "description": "Frankie Muniz and Jordan Fisher were competitors on season 25 of Dancing with the Stars.
