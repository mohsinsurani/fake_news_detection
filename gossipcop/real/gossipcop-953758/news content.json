Some people -- including some of her famous pals -- praised the star for her svelte physique, while others called her out and questioned why she felt the need to share the skin-baring snap.\n\n\"Same,\" Amy Schumer commented. \"This body is giving us life!!\" her best friend, Simon Huck, posted. \"That's hot,\" Paris Hilton said.\n\nOthers weren't as friendly.\n\n\"This is ridiculous,\" one user wrote. \"This lady really loves attention. This is not normal.\"\n\nSee the photo in the gallery below:\n\n\n\n\"I don't [really] do this, but this time I feel like I must. What point really, showing off a body that is not made of anything but plastic,\" someone else sounded off. \"And for what for strangers to look at? Save it for your man instead. It's really sad and that's a call for desperate need of attention. You have three beautiful kids and a man that loves you. Be aware of your choices. You should be ashamed.\"\n\nSomeone else noted that it was \"time to unfollow Kim.\"\n\nOf course, Kardashian has made a career out of exhibiting polarizing behavior, especially on social media where she tends to share her most boundary-pushing content. Judging from her past habits, she likely won't react to the criticism that she received for the photo that she posted on Friday -- she can't be bothered!\n\nSee more photos of Kim Kardashian in
