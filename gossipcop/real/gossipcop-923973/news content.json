I\u2019m totally down,\u201d Diaz said. \u201cI\u2019m semi-retired, too, and I am actually retired, so I would love to see you ladies.\u201d\n\nDiaz last appeared in the 2014 remake of \u201cAnnie,\u201d and her status in the industry was buzzed about in early March after Blair\u2019s interview with Metro News UK.\n\nIn it the \u201cCruel Intentions\u201d star talked about having a recent lunch with Diaz.\n\n\u201cWe were reminiscing about the film,\u201d Blair said. \u201cI would have liked to do a sequel but Cameron\u2019s retired from acting. She\u2019s like \u2018I\u2019m done.\u2019 \u201c\n\nBlair later sought to clarify her comments on Twitter after they went viral.\n\n\u201cGuys please, I was making a joke in an interview.
