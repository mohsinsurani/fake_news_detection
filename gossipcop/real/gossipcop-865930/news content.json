Who wouldn\u2019t be upset at being written off one of the most popular shows on TV? Back in Season 5, actor Ian McElhinney was vocally annoyed when his character, Ser Barristan Selmy, was killed off long before the book version kicked the bucket. Now it\u2019s a Dornishman\u2019s turn. Actor Alexander Siddig\u2014beloved by many for his years on Star Trek: Deep Space Nine\u2014abruptly met his end at the start of Season 6. But, according to Sidding, that wasn\u2019t always the plan.\n\nSpeaking with StarTrek.com, Siddig admitted that originally being cast on the show as Prince Doran Martell was a thrill to him. \u201cIt was such a huge thing, and there was so much publicity money,\u201d he recalls. \u201cThat\u2019s what I remember, everything was so huge. And actors praying they weren\u2019t going to be killed.\u201d\n\nBut no amount of praying could save Siddig from Season 6, Episode 1, in which his character took a dagger to the chest and bled out on the exquisite flagstones of Dorne. The abrupt murder\u2014accompanied by the even swifter deaths of Areoh Hotah and Prince Trystane\u2014came as a shock to viewers but, perhaps, not an unpleasant one. That triple homicide essentially cut Dorne out of the Season 6 plot, and, given how unpopular that location was the year before, that may have been the point.\n\nShow-runners Weiss and Benioff called the actor during the off-season and, as Siddig recalls, said, \u201cSo we were going to kill you off at the end of last season [5], but we decided that we\u2019re going to have to kill you off at the beginning of next season [6].\u201d Siddig calls that explanation \u201cwrong\u201d: the actor says he had been contracted for four episodes of Season 6, not one. \u201cIf they were going to kill me off at the end of the last season, why would they contract me for those four episodes? Because it costs them money whether I do them or not, so it\u2019s not great business sense to do it just in case.\u201d\n\nWere Dorne and its prince originally meant to play a much bigger role in the narrative going forward? That\u2019s certainly the case in the books, where Doran is still alive and well and plotting against the Lannisters. If Game of Thrones were looking to get rid of the least popular elements of its Dorne plot, though, Doran, Trystane, and Hotah weren\u2019t exactly the first candidates that come to mind. Siddig, for his part, has no end of suggestions about what might have motivated his earlier exit:\n\nSomething happened; I have no idea what. There was an enormous amount of fan excitement when I got named to be on the show, and everyone was like, \u201cOh my god, yes, Doran Martell. He\u2019s going to be great as Doran Martell.\u201d That might have been the kiss of death. Maybe they didn\u2019t want quite that much attention on that character. Maybe they thought, \u201cWell, let\u2019s prove that we\u2019re going to stray from the books. We\u2019re going to do something else, and he will be our first example of that.\u201d Or maybe I just screwed up. Maybe I said the wrong thing to the wrong person.\n\nCould that wrong thing have been a leaked spoiler? Siddig gives no indication that this is the case, though he admits he struggled with the heightened security around Game of Thrones, particularly heading into the Jon Snow resurrection season. \u201cGame of Thrones is kind of the king of secrecy and spin and mystery and intrigue, as far as fans are concerned,\u201d Siddig explains. \u201cBecause there is such an appetite for gossip, everybody was asking me, \u2018Is Jon Snow dead?\u2019 Last season when I did it, I knew Jon Snow was dying because I got the scripts. I couldn\u2019t even tell my wife, so it was infuriating. I don\u2019t like walking around with secrets. I can\u2019t stand it. You just make a deal with the devil.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57335d9676585bd84561cba4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/george-rr-martin-dorne-chapter.jpeg",
