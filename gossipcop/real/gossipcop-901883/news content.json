Buzz60\n\nThis week a certain royal's fashion choice made headlines for all the wrong reasons \u2014 and now she's apologizing for it.\n\nPrincess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle, Prince Harry's fianc\u00e9, during a Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace Wednesday.\n\nMany deemed the brooch, which depicts an African woman, as racially insensitive as it dates back to a now criticized 18th-century art style that fetishizes slavery and people of color.\n\nIn a statement to People and The Daily Mail Friday, a representative for the royal said, \u201cThe brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.\u201d\n\nMarkle, who is set to join the royal family when she marries Harry on May 19, 2018, is of mixed race. Her mother is African-American and her father is Caucasian.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b4579eae006e8af8dc4e54bf4514a796cea1f87/c=1756-429-3674-1513/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495518638126875-EPA-BRITAIN-ROYALTY.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5689722004001_5689722199001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b4579eae006e8af8dc4e54bf4514a796cea1f87/c=1756-429-3674-1513/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495518638126875-EPA-BRITAIN-ROYALTY.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/22/princess-michael-kent-apologizes-wearing-racist-brooch-front-meghan-markle/977796001/", "title": "Princess Michael of Kent apologizes for wearing 'racist' brooch in front of Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/12/22/princess-michael-kent-apologizes-wearing-racist-brooch-front-meghan-markle/977796001/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Princess Michael of Kent apologizes for wearing 'racist' brooch in front of Meghan Markle", "description": "Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a\\u00a0blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/4b4579eae006e8af8dc4e54bf4514a796cea1f87/c=1756-429-3674-1513/local/-/media/2017/12/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636495518638126875-EPA-BRITAIN-ROYALTY.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Princess Michael of Kent, who is married to the queen's first cousin, was criticized for wearing a\\u00a0blackamoor brooch in front of Meghan Markle.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513900800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
