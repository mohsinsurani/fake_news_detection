So it was a particularly strange turn of events that Czuchry\u2019s first post-Good Wife role would be\u2026 Gilmore Girls: A Year in the Life, Netflix\u2019s forthcoming four-part revival.\n\n\u201cThe universe is a crazy thing,\u201d Czuchry tells The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cIn terms of that timing of putting one character down and picking another up, it couldn\u2019t be more special. I love the character of Logan, I love the character of Cary so to bridge that gap between them both was incredibly unique and couldn\u2019t have been more perfect timing.\u201d\n\nCzuchry reprises his role as Logan, Rory\u2019s college boyfriend, in the limited series, which hits Netflix on Friday. Like the long-lasting legacy of Gilmore Girls, The Good Wife has continued to endure despite going off the air in May after seven seasons.\n\nCzuchry\u2019s co-stars on the legal drama, Christine Baranski and Cush Jumbo, will reprise their roles as Diane Lockhart and Lucca Quinn, respectively, for a spinoff titled The Good Fight. Like the flagship drama, The Good Fight hails from co-creators and showrunners Robert and Michelle King and will be produced by CBS Studios. Unlike The Good Wife, The Good Fight will air on CBS All Access, with the exception of the first episode, which will premiere on CBS.\n\nIn addition to Baranski and Jumbo, Sarah Steele and Gary Cole will reprise their roles from the original series. However, it sounds unlikely Czuchry will follow suit. \u201cNo, there hasn\u2019t been any talks on either side about that,\u201d he says about a possible appearance.\n\nCary Agos might be a harder piece to fit back into the puzzle, given how things ended for him. Having grown hardened and bitter from years of infighting at the firm, Cary quit Lockhart, Agos and Lee in the fourth-to-last episode. In the finale, he appeared in a brief scene with Alicia (Julianna Margulies) and Jason (Jeffrey Dean Morgan) that showed he had segued into teaching law rather than practicing it.\n\n\u201cI felt like the closure was actually the episode where he quit the firm and left,\u201d Czuchry says. \u201cSo for me, that was his last episode.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about his thoughts on the finale, and particularly that now famous slap between Diane and Alicia, Czuchry is mum \u2013 but with good reason.\n\n\u201cI never saw the last episode,\u201d he says. \u201cOf course I read it, but that was an episode where it was all about, for me personally, being with the crew and the cast and saying goodbye. So I had watched all the episodes up until that point for research; that one I wanted to leave as just something special on set.\u201d\n\nIt sounds like Czuchry has no intention of changing that anytime soon, saying, \u201cI have no plans to watch it.\u201d\n\nIn contrast, it sounds like he will be tuning in for The Good Fight when it premieres in February. \u201cI\u2019ve emailed with Christine and Cush, and I\u2019m excited for them,\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re both great, so I\u2019m excited for both of them and want to see what it\u2019s going to be like.\u201d\n\nGilmore Girls: A Year in the Life premieres Nov. 25 on Netflix.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624401058-h_2016.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624401058-h_2016.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624401058-h_2016.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Stanhope"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/matt-czuchry-his-gilmore-girls-return-good-wife-finale-949939/", "title": "Matt Czuchry on His \u2018Gilmore Girls\u2019 Return and Why He Never Watched \u2018The Good Wife\u2019 Finale", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The actor reprises his role as Logan in the forthcoming Netflix revival.", "news_keywords": "Gilmore Girls, Matt Czuchry, The Good Wife", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Kate Stanhope", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 949939, "title": "Matt Czuchry on His 'Gilmore Girls' Return and Why He Never Watched 'The Good Wife' Finale", "published_at": "2016-11-22 08:45:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-624401058-h_2016.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The Good Wife", "topics": "TV News", "body": "When Matt Czuchry signed on for The Good Wife pilot in 2009, his biggest TV role to date was his breakout role of Logan Huntzberger on Gilmore Girls.
