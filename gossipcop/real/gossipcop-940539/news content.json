Sign us up for an Aidy Bryant-style honeymoon complete with poolside views, amazing weather, and\u2026a trip to a cheese factory. After marrying her comedy writer beau, Conner O\u2019Malley, in April, Bryant trekked overseas for their honeymoon. The newlyweds just toured a cheese factory, and we now know what our ideal future honeymoon looks like.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live star posted pictorial proof of their cheesy excursion to her Instagram Story Thursday, May 31st. She and O\u2019Malley donned \u201ccondom\u201d-like garb to dive into the world of dairy and see how that good, good cheddar (or maybe parmesan? Gouda? Pecorino?) is made.\n\nBryant and O\u2019Malley wed almost exactly one year after Bryant announced their engagement on April 27th, 2017, and about 10 years after they started dating. The two began their relationship in 2008 after meeting at the Annoyance Theatre in Chicago where they both were performers.\n\nNow, the newly-formed Bryant-O\u2019Malley family is starting out married life in the best way possible \u2014 clad in blue ponchos and hairnets, surrounded by wheels on wheels of cheese. From a hilarious duo like these two, we\u2019d honestly expect nothing less.\n\n\"When you love cheese but you have to wear a condom to learn about it,\" Bryant captioned one of the photos in her Insta Story.\n\nWe agree \u2014 the whole body condom thing was so worth it. Just look at that gold mine!\n\nDon\u2019t worry \u2014 Bryant and O\u2019Malley aren\u2019t ~just~ hitting the cheese factory on their honeymoon (even though we wouldn\u2019t have a problem with a cheese factory tour-only vacation). They\u2019ve also been indulging in some of the more luxurious aspects of their destination vacay.\n\nHere\u2019s the couple hanging out on what looks like a rooftop pool overlooking lush mountains and a perfect blue sky.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BjSbOyZnMRN\n\nTBH, we\u2019re more jealous of the cheese than the pool, but that\u2019s just us. We hope Bryant and O\u2019Malley continue to live their best and cheesiest lives during the remainder of their honeymoon.\n\nCongrats, guys!", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/06/01/aidy-bryant-honeymoon-one.png", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='286'%20height='517'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='293'%20height='521'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/06/01/aidy-bryant-honeymoon-cheese-e1527865065860.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/06/01/aidy-bryant-honeymoon-two.png", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/06/01/aidy-bryant-honeymoon-cheese-e1527865065860.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/06/01/aidy-bryant-honeymoon-cheese-e1527865065860.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Olivia Harvey"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/aidy-bryant-honeymoon-pics/", "title": "Aidy Bryant's Honeymoon Pics Will Make You So Jealous", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Aidy Bryant and her new husband Conner O'Malley have gone on a honeymoon excursion to an unexpected place \u2014 and we're incredibly jealous..
