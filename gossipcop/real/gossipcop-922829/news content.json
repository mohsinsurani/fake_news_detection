The WWE star hosted for the second consecutive year.\n\nAlso Read: John Cena on Why He Looks Up to Dwayne Johnson: 'He's an Anomaly'\n\nOne star Cena was excited to see was \u201cMagic Mike\u201d actor Channing Tatum \u2014 but not because of his acting skills. \u201cThis year, I am going to do my best to kind of dance a little bit more,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen Channing\u2019s moves when he dances \u2026 and they\u2019re good, but not necessarily for kids. Maybe we can have a late show for the parents.\u201d\n\nWith R-rated comedy \u201cBlockers\u201d hitting theaters April 5 and WrestleMania in New Orleans on April 8, it\u2019s surprising Cena has time for a side gig \u2014 but he said he would\u2019t miss \u201cKCA\u201d for the world.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Nickelodeon as a brand. They embrace what it means to be a kid and I think that\u2019s very special,\u201d he told TheWrap. \u201cIt is the same energy you get from a WWE event.\n\n\u201cThe hilarity of the show doesn\u2019t rely on the host but it rests on the host\u2019s ability to play along. A lot of it is with the set, a lot of it is with the audience \u2014 every year, they keep doing better and better,\u201d Cena explained.\n\n\u201cThe show is a vehicle to do so many moments at once. We have musical performances, we have a bunch of stars, we have awards to give out for the kids \u2014 as the host, it\u2019s not my job to make it the \u2018John Cena Show.\u2019 It\u2019s to make it the \u2018Kids\u2019 Choice Awards,\u2019 so I have to be the vehicle to keep the show moving.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Watch Jimmy Fallon and John Cena Dance to Bruno Mars' 'Finesse'\n\nHere\u2019s who got slimed \u2014 and 13 other moments not seen on TV.\n\nDance off\n\nCena stayed true to his word and came out dancing with a stage full of kids dressed in neon. One special dancer was Katy Perry\u2019s Backpack Kid, who also wowed guests at the after-party.\n\nMarch for Our Lives\n\nCena opened the night by giving a shout out to all the kids who took part in March for Our Lives rallies on Saturday, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s so important when kids take charge.\u201d His words definitely got the audience fired up, and Millie Bobby Brown mentioned it as well, saying she hopes her voice can help influence change. When she turned around to show the back of her shirt, it had the names of all the people killed in the Parkland, Florida, shooting.\n\nBlimp-worthy\n\nGiant orange blimps hovered over the crowd giving an aerial view of everyone in the seats.\n\nAlso Read: NFL Star Rob Gronkowski on How Nickelodeon's 'Crashletes' Is 'Like Everything We Did Growing Up' (Video)\n\nSnowball fight\n\nIt was 70 degrees in L.A but that didn\u2019t stop a snow scene on stage. One section of the audience had fuzzy snowball hats under their seats that they were meant to save for a special moment, but no one could resist putting them on immediately. And then it began to snow \u2026 so Channing Tatum naturally started a snow ball fight.\n\nOBJ\n\nNew York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. made his presence known with a bright orange hoodie and his flash of blonde hair.\n\nSlippery stage\n\nGuests in high heels had a precarious walk through a crowd of kids, up steps and across a slime-covered stage to collect their awards.\n\nNoise alert\n\nWord of warning: don\u2019t come to this show if you have a headache \u2014 it\u2019s LOUD! The young audience was encouraged to make a lot of noise and they did.\n\nAlso Read: Russell Wilson Set to Host Nickelodeon's 'Kids' Choice Sports' Awards for Second Time\n\nAmerica\u2019s Got Slime\n\nHeidi Klum and Mel B came in very glamorous sparkly dresses \u2026 and left covered in green slime. The \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent\u201d hosts proved they were game for anything by getting on the swings above a huge slime pool, but as they precariously swung back and forth, spurts of green slime erupted from below.\n\nVery Important Pet\n\nThe crew was very, very careful carrying out one special winner as Jiff the Pom won best Instagram pet. The VIP came in royally, on a bed fit for a king.\n\nCleaning crew\n\nThe cleaners were kept busy as a slew of people armed with towels dove onto the stage during every carefully timed commercial break to clear it of sticky slime.\n\n\u7c98\u6db2\n\nAt one point, Cena was asked what slime is in Chinese \u2014 and then he recited the answer perfectly. It\u2019s a little known fact that he\u2019s fluent in Mandarin, which he learned because WWE is so big in China.\n\nRock-less\n\nCena teased The Rock\u2019s big appearance by wearing an \u201cI \u2764 Dwayne Johnson\u201d tee-shirt. But sadly the \u201cRampage\u201d star was tied up on set and the audience had to make do with a video message from him.\n\nCena is drowned\n\nCena survived to the end of the show without getting slimed and then he got bombarded with it. He turned into a walking green hulk and couldn\u2019t stop laughing through the mess.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kids-Choice-Awards.jpg",
