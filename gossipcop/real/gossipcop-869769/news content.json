(Picture: GAMR / BACKGRID)\n\nThe #blessed paparazzi who was run over by Justin Bieber this week has shared a video update on his recovery, and he\u2019s surprisingly chill about the whole thing.\n\nLiving basically every fan girl\u2019s dream, Maurice Lamont was ploughed down by the singer\u2019s giant truck on Wednesday, with Biebs behind the wheel driving very slowly at the time.\n\nKaty Perry gets in the spirit of spooky season with cute pumpkin patch visit with daughter\n\nThe photographer took to Instagram on Thursday to share his progress with the world, and while he\u2019s been resting up since getting knocked to the ground, he\u2019s calmly insisted that \u2018accidents happen\u2019.\n\nJustin was quick to hop out and check in with the photographer after knocking him down. (Picture: GAMR/Backgrid)\n\nLamont was standing in the wrong place at the wrong time (y\u2019know, like in front of a moving car), when Justin attempted to leave his Hillsong religious meeting in LA.\n\nA day later and the unlucky paparazzi filmed himself being wheeled around on a hospital bed, explaining: \u2018Hours before my birthday hits, I get ran over by Justin Bieber. Isn\u2019t that something?\u2019\n\nResponding calmly with zero mention of lawsuits, Lamont said: \u2018He\u2019s a good kid though. I think the truck is a little big for him. \u2018Cause there is no way he could see over the front.\u2019\n\nFollowing the accident, Biebs was quick to hop out of the car to check that he hadn\u2019t done any damage, which the photographer went on to credit him for.\n\n\u2018He got out, he was compassionate, he was a good kid. Accidents happen,\u2019 he told the camera, before adding that he was on his way for precautionary x-rays.\n\nIt seems as though Bieber might be going through a rough patch in his personal life at the moment.\n\nHe left fans devastated this week when it was announced that he\u2019d be cancelling the rest of his Purpose World Tour at short notice due to \u2018unforseen circumstances\u2019.\n\nA source told E! News that the star\u2019s spirituality might also have played a part in him stepping back, claiming: \u2018Justin\u2019s definitely done some soul searching lately but it was his own decision to cancel the tour. It\u2019s been hectic and that \u2018rock star\u2019 life doesn\u2019t mix anymore with the life he wants to live.\u2019\n\nHaving constantly performed at over 150 shows since March 2016, we\u2019d say it\u2019s probably time to give Biebs a break.\n\nMORE : Justin Bieber says sorry for cancelling his Purpose world tour and hints it was due to exhaustion\n\nMORE : Justin Bieber banned from performing in China due to previous \u2018bad behaviours\u2019", "images": ["https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/ipso-logo.jpg", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Metro-56e2.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C429", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michaels-Bar-6a30.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BHM-0569.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png"], "top_img": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucy Wood"], "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/28/accidents-happen-paparazzi-run-over-by-justin-bieber-speaks-out-and-calls-the-star-a-good-kid-6812089/", "title": "'Accidents happen': Pap run over by Justin Bieber shares his recovery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1"}, "title": "Man run over by Justin Bieber's giant car says 'accidents happen'", "description": "He's chill about the whole thing.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160}, "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "description": "The paparazzi who was run down by Justin Bieber earlier this week has said that the whole thing was an accident in a recovery update video.", "news_keywords": "justin bieber, paparazzi, photographer, run over, run down, car, hit, update, recovery, injuries,", "msvalidate.01": "11110DC8D42E74E13F24B3A18E7CFB8A", "pocket-site-verification": "8aec208948f7b2f9092ac4ce91dac7", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/28/accidents-happen-paparazzi-run-over-by-justin-bieber-speaks-out-and-calls-the-star-a-good-kid-6812089/?ia_markup=1"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 117118184990145, "app_id": 176908729004638}, "theme-color": "#000000", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Metro", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-28 09:58:30", "sailthru.title": "\u2018Accidents happen\u2019: Paparazzo run over by Justin Bieber speaks out and calls the star a \u2018good kid\u2019", "sailthru.tags": "justin bieber", "sailthru.description": "He's chill about the whole thing.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=150&h=150&crop=1", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=50&h=150&crop=1", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "title": "Man run over by Justin Bieber's giant car says 'accidents happen'", "type": "article", "url": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/07/28/accidents-happen-paparazzi-run-over-by-justin-bieber-speaks-out-and-calls-the-star-a-good-kid-6812089/", "description": "He's chill about the whole thing.", "site_name": "Metro", "image": {"identifier": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "secure_url": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/pri_47835157.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1200&h=630&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MetroUK", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Justin Bieber", "published_time": "2017-07-28T09:58:30+0000", "modified_time": "2019-12-12T12:27:03+0000"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/cropped-m-icon-black-9693.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501196400.0, "source": "https://metro.co.uk", "summary": ""}
