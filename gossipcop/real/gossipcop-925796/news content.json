Brutal,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cI gave it all I got. Truly did. I\u2019m beyond proud of myself!! Fought to save til the last second. Oh well. Life goes on. Bye lol.\u201d\n\nIn April, after almost nine years of marriage and two kids, the former Playboy model, 33, filed for divorce from the former football player, citing irreconcilable differences. She listed their separation date as Jan. 1.\n\nThe reality star requested joint legal and physical custody of their two children \u2014 son Hank IV, 8, and daughter Alijah Mary, 4 \u2014 and sought the restoration of her maiden name.\n\nThe same day as Wilkinson\u2019s filing, Baskett, 36, filed his response, also citing irreconcilable differences. Mirroring Wilkinson\u2019s filing, Baskett also listed their date of separation as Jan. 1, 2018, and requested joint legal and physical custody of their two children.\n\nAccording to the documents, Baskett requested \u201creserve for future determination the issue of support payable to\u201d both parties.\n\nThe divorce filing came hours after Wilkinson confirmed in an Instagram post that the couple had chosen to split.\n\n\u201cToday is the last day of my marriage to this beautiful man. I will forever love Hank and be open but for now we have chosen to go our own ways,\u201d she captioned a photo of herself and Baskett. \u201cI\u2019m beyond sad and heartbroken because I did believe in forever, that\u2019s why I said yes but unfortunately too much fear has gotten in the way. We are both amazing parents and our kids will be happy n never know the difference other than seeing mama smile.\u201d\n\nAri Perilstein/Getty\n\nIn the five months since, Wilkinson has been open about how she\u2019s processing her grief over the breakup, admitting last month on social media that \u201c#divorcesucks.\u201d\n\nWilkinson has been entering the dating world again and is \u201ccasually\u201d spending time with someone new: marketing manager Frankie Conti, a source told PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just hanging casually,\u201d the source said about the pair, who went on a recent date to D\u2019Amores Pizza in L.A. on National Pizza Day. \u201cThey met earlier in the summer and Kendra thought he was cute.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kendra Wilkinson Files for Divorce

together.\u201d\n\nBut according to a second source, Wilkinson is \u201cplaying the field.\u201d\n\n\u201cKendra\u2019s been talking to a bunch of different guys and having fun after her split,\u201d that source told PEOPLE about the Kendra On Top star.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s playing the field and enjoying the dating scene again after everything she and Hank went through,\u201d the source shared.",
