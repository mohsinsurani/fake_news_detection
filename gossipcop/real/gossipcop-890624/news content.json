Yet, it\u2019s such a simple step \u2013 nestling neatly between your toner and moisturiser, these potent formulas do so much more than a regular moisturiser.\n\nGiven the strength and density of the crucial ingredients in their make-up, they can perform skin-saving miracles \u2013 targeting fine lines, wrinkles, hyperpigmentation, dark spots and dullness \u2013 to ultimately achieve a more youthful look.\n\nYou\u2019ll want to look for serums with ingredients rich in vitamins, minerals and antioxidants. Serums with these tend to offer a more natural attempt at plumping, firming, and stimulating collagen production. It\u2019s also worth looking out for green tea, berries and marine-inspired skincare.\n\nWe also recommend using products that contain hyaluronic acid and retinol. The former not only hydrates the skin but simultaneously adds a smoothing and plumping effect, while the latter is considered the best anti-ageing ingredient around.\n\nRead more:\n\nRetinol gets to work on the surface of the skin, focusing on skintone and texture, as well as going deeper and stimulating cell renewal. However, exercise caution as those with sensitive or dry skin might find this causes irritation or flakiness.\n\nYou should also pay close attention to the texture of your serum. The lighter and faster to absorb it is, the easier it will be to add into your skincare routine. Plus, for those who have sensitive or oily skin, having a lighter-weight serum will definitely be a bonus as you\u2019ll want to minimise the feeling of the products you\u2019re piling on your face.\n\nStill, with so many brands putting their best foot forward, it\u2019s hard to know which is the best. So, we\u2019ve narrowed it down to the top 14, taking into account the different skincare anti-ageing concerns that each serum addressed.\n\nThe best anti-ageing serums of 2022 are:\n\nBest overall \u2013 Elemis pro-collagen super serum elixir: \u00a353, Elemis.com\n\n\u2013 Elemis pro-collagen super serum elixir: \u00a353, Elemis.com Best for improving texture \u2013 Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte\u2019s magic serum crystal elixir: \u00a360, Charlottetilbury.com\n\n\u2013 Charlotte Tilbury Charlotte\u2019s magic serum crystal elixir: \u00a360, Charlottetilbury.com Best vitamin C serum \u2013 Kiehl\u2019s powerful-strength line-reducing concentrate: \u00a354, Selfridges.com\n\n\u2013 Kiehl\u2019s powerful-strength line-reducing concentrate: \u00a354, Selfridges.com Best retinol serum \u2013 TempleSpa trufflelixir anti-ageing retinol serum: \u00a380, Templespa.com\n\n\u2013 TempleSpa trufflelixir anti-ageing retinol serum: \u00a380, Templespa.com Best for those in their 50s \u2013 Est\u00e9e Lauder advanced night repair: \u00a382, Boots.com\n\n\u2013 Est\u00e9e Lauder advanced night repair: \u00a382, Boots.com Best for sensitive skin \u2013 Dr. Levy Switzerland booster serum: \u00a3266.50, Facethefuture.co.uk\n\n\u2013 Dr. Levy Switzerland booster serum: \u00a3266.50, Facethefuture.co.uk Best for fine lines \u2013 Skin Generics retinol anti-aging serum: \u00a327.99, Amazon.co.uk\n\n\u2013 Skin Generics retinol anti-aging serum: \u00a327.99, Amazon.co.uk Best for pigmentation \u2013 Osmosis MD rescue epidermal repair serum: \u00a3109, Shop.dermoi.com\n\n\u2013 Osmosis MD rescue epidermal repair serum: \u00a3109, Shop.dermoi.com Best for mature skin \u2013 Comfort Zone sublime skin serum: \u00a380, Lookfantastic.com\n\n\u2013 Comfort Zone sublime skin serum: \u00a380, Lookfantastic.com Best for plumping \u2013 R\u00e9Vive intensit\u00e9 complete anti-ageing serum: \u00a3380, Harrods.com\n\n\u2013 R\u00e9Vive intensit\u00e9 complete anti-ageing serum: \u00a3380, Harrods.com Best for dull skin \u2013 Skin Woof premium vitamin C radiance serum: \u00a323.95, Skinwoof.com\n\n\u2013 Skin Woof premium vitamin C radiance serum: \u00a323.95, Skinwoof.com Best gentle serum \u2013 Verso super facial serum: \u00a388, Thegroomingclinic.com\n\n\u2013 Verso super facial serum: \u00a388, Thegroomingclinic.com Best for inflammation \u2013 Goldfaden MD needle-less line smoothing concentrate: \u00a3100, Spacenk.com\n\n\u2013 Goldfaden MD needle-less line smoothing concentrate: \u00a3100, Spacenk.com Best value for money \u2013 Sienna X the retinol serum: \u00a333.00, Beyondbeautiful.com\n\n\u2013 Sienna X the retinol serum: \u00a333.00, Beyondbeautiful.com Best for wrinkles \u2013 Elemis ultra smart pro-collagen complex 12 serum: \u00a3131.95, Allbeauty.com\n\nElemis pro-collagen super serum elixir, 15ml Best: Overall As a serum with a silk-like texture, this felt so hydrating from the moment it was applied. With hyaluronic acid locking in a level of nourishment, it also helps reduce the visibility of fine lines and wrinkles. Initially it felt a little oilier than some of the other serums, however, it was fast-absorbing and left no stickiness on our skin. It\u2019s also a serum with a gorgeous scent and we felt so relaxed during this part of the skincare regimen. Key ingredients in this super serum include a high percentage of padina pavonica and red seaweed, as well as tri-peptides and African birch bark. It\u2019s good value for how much this serum packs in, however, it must be noted it is at least half the size of some of the other serums we tested. But a little goes a long way and this potent blend is definitely small but mighty.

The addition of a pipette ensures the solution is clean, easy and efficient to apply while the product itself is silky, lightweight and not at all oily. It also smells divine and immediately relaxed us while feeling refreshing. Plus, in the hours after applying, our skin felt amazing \u2013 practically soft to the touch. This serum contains polyglutamic acid (a hydrating hero), as well as replexium, which is Charlotte Tilbury\u2019s peptide duo for laser-focus wrinkle targeting. It has been created to completely rejuvenate your face, offering visibly younger skin with daily use. The serum also contains sqisandryl \u2013 an antioxidant berry that improves the vitality of the skin. Our skin was left glowing, and it also showed a significant improvement in texture.

Creamy in texture, it melted in effortlessly and left skin visibly brighter, reduced the size of our pores and helping create an overall more even skin tone. That effect stayed for hours and even held up under make-up. However, a word of caution \u2013 this serum contains 12.5 per cent of vitamin C and we found that our skin tingled slightly upon application. That sensation didn\u2019t last for long, mind, but as it\u2019s not something that agrees with all skin types we recommend building up your usage. Plus, while we\u2019d always recommend following up with a decent SPF cream, it\u2019s all the more important here. Once you get your dosage right though we promise you\u2019ll be left with beautifully moisturised and hydrated skin.

Soft and light in texture with a beautiful scent, this high-performance formula promotes both long and short-term results. The brand maintains that this serum treats the skin at a cellular and epidermal level to brighten it. Plus, it aims to reduce the signs of ageing by smoothing, firming and plumping all in one go. We also noted that when we didn\u2019t apply make-up afterwards, our skin stayed silky smooth for hours. It is a little pricier than some of the brand\u2019s other products \u2013 its \u201cbe firm\u201d serum is more than \u00a330 cheaper (\u00a340, Templespa.com) \u2013 but we\u2019re still won over.

As well as its translucency, we noticed that it didn\u2019t have a fragrance, and it was quite a bit stickier to touch. That said, upon regular use, our skin definitely felt more hydrated and was visibly plumper. It aims to blur the skin, making it look smoother in appearance, and address fine lines and wrinkles. We definitely think it delivers and thought our skin looked much clearer and healthy-looking. An added benefit of the advanced night repair is that the serum formula is also designed to act as an anti-pollutant, with the brand claiming it protects from environmental damages as well as blue light from our screens. It may be pricey, but as it addresses additional skin woes we hadn\u2019t considered, we don\u2019t mind splashing the cash.

It was one of the lightest in texture serums we tested. It features a plant-derived stem-cell extract which is said to work to stimulate skin\u2019s collagen production. It takes around 6 to 8 weeks for results to show, but we also immediately noticed how radiant our skin became after just one use. Although the price tag might be offputting to some, we found it went above and beyond the call of duty. So if your budget stretches to it, we\u2019d recommend this in a heartbeat, especially to those with sensitive skin.

It promotes the synthesis of collagen, hyaluronic acid and elastin to reduce wrinkles and fine lines. It also contains retinol as an active ingredient \u2013 with 2 per cent of a vitamin A derivative, along with ingredients such as vitamin C and Hawaiian algae. We didn\u2019t find this to be as lightweight in texture as some of the other serums, but it did absorb quickly nonetheless. While an excellent price, those with sensitive skin should exercise caution as the mixture of vitamin C and retinol did cause our skin a little irritation. It didn\u2019t last long, however, and we just made sure to use a more nourishing and lightweight moisturiser on top. This serum is currently out of stock, but we hope to see more of it soon.

We noticed a change after the first application. It went on so easily, making skin feel silky smooth from the start, and it absorbed quickly. We immediately noticed a difference in the size of our pores and could see a significant amount of brightening. In addition to focusing on smoothing skin texture and fixing pigmentation, it\u2019s also a great option for those of you suffering from sensitivity or other skin concerns such as rosacea and acne. The one downside to this product was, unlike other anti-ageing serums which either smelled amazing or were fragrance-free, this one had a slightly clinical or chlorine-like scent. However, the results were very promising for this serum.

However, it must be noted that this serum wasn\u2019t as fast-absorbing as others we tested and our skin didn\u2019t feel as immediately hydrated. This was a surprise, given the blend of micro and macro hyaluronic acid, however this can be easily resolved by using a particularly nourishing moisturiser. We\u2019d perhaps recommend this serum for those with more mature skin, as it did a wondrous job of making our face feel noticeably firmer and tightened upon each use. Our skin also did look and feel plumper.

Its cellular filling complex is what helps re-establish shape and elasticity, visibly plumping and re-contouring skin. We found it to be an excellent product, making our skin feel instantly smooth. We did notice an improvement in finer lines and our skin felt noticeably more hydrated which, in turn, positively affected its appearance. The drawback with this product is its price as, as fantastic as it was, it is rather expensive \u2013 particularly if you were to implement it into your daily skincare routine. We must admit that it is hard to assess whether this serum delivered particularly better results than those at a third of the price.

We certainly noticed a bright and healthy glow to our skin and we also quite liked its gel base. Light in fragrance and texture, we found it easily absorbed into our skin. The cheapest of the anti-ageing serums we tested, this brand proves you can achieve more youthful-looking skin without spending the earth. This particular serum is great for reducing the appearance of acne scars and pigmentation too, in addition to minimising pores. And if were to try this serum and fall in love, Skin Woof offers a subscription option, making it even more affordable.

Verso\u2019s Super Facial Serum uses retinyl retinoate (which is said to be stronger than retinol), meaning its power to work magic and make your skin appear more youthful-looking is stronger. It is also said to cause less irritation to the skin and we found it to also be a gentler version of the beloved vitamin A product. We found no stinging as we applied this serum and our skin wasn\u2019t left feeling at all dry. However, the texture of the product overall was a little thick for our liking. We must say, however, we weren\u2019t particularly impressed by any changes to the texture of our skin, gaining the sense that the visible effects of this anti-ageing serum aren\u2019t efficient as some of the other products we tried and tested. A great serum product to add between your toner and moisturiser each day and night, however it showed us limited results which would lead us to question its higher end price point.

Upon initial application, there was a warm, burning sensation, but we weren\u2019t too concerned due to the product\u2019s proclaimed \u201cneed-less\u201d concept. There was no visible irritation to our skin at all, but if tingling concerns you, this is not the right product. We\u2019d also recommend those with sensitive skin steer clear, as it might make you nervous upon each application. That being said, ingredients such as seaweed ensured the serum was packed full of vitamins and minerals, as well as hyaluronic acid to help the skin retain moisture and stay supple. We also liked the fact that there is red tea extract in the serum, as this ingredient is said to act as an anti-inflammatory agent, assist with brightening and aid the reduction of fine lines and wrinkles. Buy now \u00a3100 Spacenk.com {{#hasItems}} Price comparison {{#items}} {{ merchant }} \u00a3{{ price }} Buy now {{/items}}\n\nSienna X the retinol serum, 20ml Best: Value for money Sienna X\u2019s serum features 0.3 per cent pure retinol, making this a great product if topical vitamin A is what you\u2019re looking for. We were really looking forward to trying it because of its potent formula, however, as effective an ingredient as retinol is, it is not advisable if you have sensitive skin. This meant there was slight irritation and redness to our skin upon application. It didn\u2019t go away as quickly and seamlessly as the slight tingling with other serums we tried. However, this serum is very good value for money given the high concentration of its ingredients and, should you not suffer from skin sensitivity, it could be the one for you.
