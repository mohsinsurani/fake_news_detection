I can say the last eight months have been better than when we first started dating. But yeah, it\u2019s never good to watch this again. My main concern is that Brittany\u2019s okay and making sure she\u2019s getting through this. It sucks. You can run me through the dirt, but I just don\u2019t want her to be hurt.\u201d\n\nCharles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU Photo Bank/Getty\n\nTaylor revealed that he\u2019s been seeing a life coach in Hollywood to work through his issues.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking the steps that are needed, and it\u2019s one of those things where I failed, but I keep trying again,\u201d he said. \u201cAs long as I\u2019m trying and I\u2019m trying to better myself, that\u2019s all that matters to me. As long as Brittany sees that I\u2019m doing better and I want to move forward and I want to be serious about us, that\u2019s all she cares about. And at the end of the day, this is between Brittany and I. I mean, yes, my life\u2019s on TV, but at the end of the day, she makes the final decision. So people can say what they want.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Jax Taylor Admits He\u2019s Seeing a Life Coach\n\nAs for whether he still plans on getting down on one knee for Cartwright, 28?\n\n\u201cAbsolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cProbably sooner than later. I\u2019m just kind of figuring out how I want to do things. I want to make it really special and romantic for her.\u201d\n\nTaylor also said Cartwright has also been a major source of support while his dad undergoes a second round of treatment for cancer.\n\n\u201cIt sucks. Cancer just really sucks,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s rough, because my father is kind of like my rock \u2014 he\u2019s my best friend, and seeing him go through this is just awful.\u201d\n\nBut \u201cBrittany has been nothing short of amazing with this,\u201d he said. \u201cShe\u2019s been there for me.\u201d\n\nWATCH: Jax Taylor Talks Regrets & Life in the Public Eye\n\nAnd while going through hardship in the public eye hasn\u2019t been easy, Taylor doesn\u2019t regret his decision to put his life on TV.\n\n\u201cI regret the decisions I make. At the end of the day, I make my own decisions, I\u2019m the one that chose to do all these things, but do I regret doing the show? Absolutely not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s been a blessing. Lisa Vanderpump\u2018s been nothing but amazing to all of us.\u201d\n\n\u201cI put my life out there,\u201d he added. \u201cI signed up for a reality show. I don\u2019t pick and choose what I want to talk about, it\u2019s all out there, whether you like it or you don\u2019t. But it\u2019s real, and that\u2019s what it is.\u201d\n\nVanderpump Rules airs Mondays (9 p.m. ET) on Bravo.", "images":
