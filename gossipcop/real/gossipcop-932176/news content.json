Aside from her amazing vocal range and her memorable bops, Grande also has an uncanny knack for impressions. It seems like the \u201cNo Tears Left To Cry\u201d singer can mimic just about anyone, from Britney Spears to her own fianc\u00e9, Pete Davidson.\n\nGrande appeared on the August 16th episode of The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon to talk about her new album, Sweetener. The singer gave fans a sneak peek of the album\u2019s tracks, including one called \u201cPete Davidson.\u201d She also reminisced about the time Davidson first met her grandmother over FaceTime.\n\n\u201cThe first time they FaceTimed, she called him David. And she was like, \u2018Oh, David, you\u2019re a nice Italian boy, huh?\u2019\u201d Grande continued: \u201cAnd he was like, \u2018Well, I\u2019m only 20%, but I can be more if you want.\u201d\n\nThe singer\u2019s flawless imitation of Davidson\u2019s mannerisms immediately got a chuckle from the audience. She even lowered her voice as much as possible. Head to the 6-minute mark to see it for yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7Wu-UMKSATc?feature=oembed\n\nLet\u2019s look back on some of Grande\u2019s other incredible impressions.\n\n1That time she became Jennifer Coolidge in Legally Blonde.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9h9UrBQpYqE?feature=oembed\n\nDuring another appearance on The Tonight Show back in May, Grande perfectly embodied Coolidge\u2019s iconic character, Paulette. The singer nailed Paulette\u2019s most memorable line, \u201cI\u2019m taking the dog, dumbass,\u201d to wild cheers from the audience.\n\n2When she pretended to be Jennifer Lawrence in a Saturday Night Live sketch.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMOKevIBwDs?feature=oembed\n\nIn a 2016 installment of \u201cCelebrity Family Feud,\u201d Grande was a dead-wringer for J-Law.\n\n\"I\u2019m just like a snack-a-holic, I mean, I love Pringles,\" Grande-as-Lawrence said when asked to give a bad habit she just couldn't quit. \"If no one\u2019s looking, I\u2019ll eat, like a whole can. Like, every day is my cheat day, you know what I mean?\"\n\n3When she wowed us with her Celine Dion impression.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=05dKQsVOZXY?feature=oembed\n\nIn one of her very first appearances on The Tonight Show, Grande stunned the world when she sang \u201cBeauty and the Beast\u201d in the style of \u201990s Dion. She also revived the impression during a recent \u201cCarpool Karaoke\u201d segment.\n\n4When she played Judy Garland on Saturday Night Live.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7E5QXkkF5-U?feature=oembed\n\nIn a 2016 Saturday Night Live sketch that was cut for time, Grande was unbelievably convincing as Judy Garland trying to reboot her career with a musical space movie. Grande crooned \u201cGet Happy\u201d and even gave us a little \u201cChoo Cha Booch.\u201d\n\n5And the time Grande showed off just how versatile she was.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ss9ygQqqL2Q?feature=oembed\n\nDuring a 2015 round of \u201cThe Wheel of Musical Impressions\u201d on The Tonight Show, Grande left Jimmy Fallon speechless with her imitations of Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.\n\nIs there anyone Grande can\u2019t imitate? We can\u2019t wait to see the other impressions she has up her sleeve.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/08/17/ariana-grande-impressions-e1534515208770.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/08/17/ariana-grande-impressions-e1534515208770.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/08/17/ariana-grande-impressions-e1534515208770.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/ariana-grande-celebrity-impressions/", "title": "Watch All Of Ariana Grande's Best Celebrity Impressions", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "On the August 16th episode of \"The Tonight Show,\" Ariana Grande treated fans to a hilarious impression of her fianc\u00e9, Pete Davidson.
