Congrats on passing your driver's test @KaiaGerber!\" she captioned a photo on Instagram of the teenager.\n\nGerber also marked the occasion by sharing a picture of herself on Instagram Stories from outside the Department of Motor Vehicles.\n\n\"We've got a liscensed driver on our hands (STAY OFF THE ROAD),\" she jokingly captioned the snapshot.\n\nGerber turned 16 years old on Sunday, Sept. 3. E! News reported the model celebrated by having dinner with her parents at Delilah in West Hollywood, and by attending the Malibu Chili Cook-off and Carnival with friends.\n\n\"Happy 16th birthday @KaiaGerber!\" Crawford wrote in a post on Gerber's birthday. \"Hope all your wishes come true -- love you always!\"\n\nBaby driver. Congrats on passing your driver's test @KaiaGerber! A post shared by Cindy Crawford (@cindycrawford) on Sep 5, 2017 at 9:41am PDT\n\nGerber signed her first major contract with IMG Models at age 13 in 2015. She shared her parents' advice for keeping true to herself and dealing with success in an interview with Teen Vogue published in August.\n\n\"My parents have always taught me to be myself and to follow my instincts,\" the star said. \"They also say that you should never let what other people do affect what you want to do. It changes everything when you accept who you are and don't try to change yourself.\"", "images":
