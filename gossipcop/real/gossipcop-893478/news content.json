Amy Adams pursued dancing as well as musical theater and auditioned for TV and film roles until she landed several that launched her into fame. Adams has since starred in such popular films as Junebug, Enchanted, Doubt, Julie & Julia and Man of Steel, among many others. She has received several Academy Award nominations and earned Golden Globes for her performances in American Hustle, Big Eyes and the miniseries Sharp Objects. Early Life Actress Amy Lou Adams was born on August 20, 1974, in Vicenza, Italy. She was the fourth of seven children born to Americans Kathryn and Richard Kent Adams, with her father stationed at Caserma Ederle military base at the time of her birth. The Adams family, which were members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, relocated from one base to another until they settled in Castle Rock, Colorado when Adams was about eight years old. Adams sang in the Douglas County High School choir and, aspiring to become a ballerina, trained as an apprentice at a local dance company. Later, she decided the rigidity of ballet training was ill-suited for her, and she began to pursue a career in musical theater instead.\n\nMovies and TV Roles\n\nIn the mid-1990s, Adams worked as a dancer at a number of different theaters and playhouses in Colorado and Minnesota. By the end of the decade, she landed her first film role in the comedy Drop Dead Gorgeous. Shortly thereafter, encouraged by co-star Kirstie Alley, Adams relocated to Los Angeles and auditioned for more roles. She landed one on a television series, but it was later canceled. Adams went on to appear in several small films and guest star on TV series. She was also chosen to appear in Steven Spielberg's Catch Me If You Can (2002) as Brenda Strong \u2014 a role that, according to Spielberg, should have launched Adams's career. But it wasn't until she starred in the 2005 film Junebug that Adams made her breakthrough: She received an Academy Award nomination for Best Supporting Actress as well as a Special Jury Prize for her performance after Junebug premiered at the 2005 Sundance Film Festival. 'Enchanted' and 'Julie & Julia' In 2007, Adams landed the lead in the fantasy musical Enchanted, portraying a Disney cartoon songstress who enters the three-dimensional world. The following year she received another Supporting Actress Oscar nomination for her role as a nun in 2008's Doubt, co-starring Meryl Streep. Then in 2009, she starred as a young, aspiring cook in Julie & Julia, the popular culinary comedy about famed chef Julia Child. Adams once again starred alongside Streep, with the project directed by late filmmaker Nora Ephron and receiving wide acclaim, earning nearly $130 million at the global box office.

So, for me, I don't think like that. I don't associate that with myself at this time. I've been working, which is so grounding and you don't sort of get a sense of the outside world when you're working.\"", "images": ["https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgwMTM3NTQ4MjgxMDI5NzU0/gettyimages-1191495915.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyNjEyMDExODE5OTM1MjY4/gettyimages-1082526236.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTY3MzE1MjAxMDc0MzU3/gettyimages-1404884042.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTgwNjE2NzYzODIwNDgzOTQ0/gettyimages-154687013-copy.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5ODc4NTEyMDkyNTIxNTk0/gettyimages-847099786.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTUzNTU1NjYzNjMxNDI3MzEz/adam-rippon-stands-on-the-medal-podium-for-the-ceremony-for-the-championship-mens-during-the-2018-prudential-us-figure-skating-championships-at-the-sap-center-on-january-6-2018-in-san-jose-california-.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTIwNjA4NjM0MTU1NDAyNzY0/amy-adams-20883223-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTM0MTQ5NzA3NDQxNzE5/navbarwhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE1ODA0OTcxNDg4MjgyMTI1/adam-lambert-440214-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cg_face%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_300/MTIwNjA4NjM0MTU1NDAyNzY0/amy-adams-20883223-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NTU2MzE2NDAzODI4MjM1/mae-west-9528264-1-402.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMzQwNjU0MTc1NTYwODAz/adam-sandler-gettyimages-481511486.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyMTcwNjUwMjQzMTc5Njk2/gettyimages-1146332483.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTc5OTczNzUxMzgxNjk3ODgw/gettyimages-1200618132.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fit%2Ccs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_458/MTQ1NTMzOTkyNDA0MjY0NTAz/sitelogowhite.png", "https://www.biography.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1280/MTY4Mjc5OTY4NzQ3ODg5ODI5/black-background.jpg", "https://www.biography.com/.image/ar_8:10%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTE5NDg0MDU1MjY4MjYzNDM5/ming-na-17184282-1-402.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTIwNjA4NjM0MTU1NDAyNzY0/amy-adams-20883223-1-402.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Biography.Com Editors"], "canonical_link": "https://www.biography.com/actor/amy-adams", "title": "Amy Adams", "meta_data": {"author": "Biography.com Editors", "description": "American actress Amy Adams is best known for starring in films such as 'Julie & Julia,' 'Enchanted,' 'American Hustle' and 'Arrival.'", "section": "Actors", "pagetype": "person", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "item-id": "ci01a87e1d8167860f", "published": "2014-04-02T22:04:56Z", "modified": "2020-06-10T19:05:09Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "Biography and the Biography logo are registered trademarks of A&E Television Networks, LLC.", "dcterms.dateCopyrighted": 2022, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@bio", "url": "https://www.biography.com/actor/amy-adams", "image": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTIwNjA4NjM0MTU1NDAyNzY0/amy-adams-20883223-1-402.jpg", "description": "American actress Amy Adams is best known for starring in films such as 'Julie & Julia,' 'Enchanted,' 'American Hustle' and 'Arrival.'", "domain": "www.biography.com"}, "og": {"type": "website", "url": "https://www.biography.com/actor/amy-adams", "title": "Amy Adams", "description": "American actress Amy Adams is best known for starring in films such as 'Julie & Julia,' 'Enchanted,' 'American Hustle' and 'Arrival.'", "image": "https://www.biography.com/.image/t_share/MTIwNjA4NjM0MTU1NDAyNzY0/amy-adams-20883223-1-402.jpg", "site_name": "Biography"}, "fb": {"pages": 123492867697144, "app_id": 104784826244596}, "pinterest-rich-pin": "true", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Biography", "parsely-title": "Amy Adams -
