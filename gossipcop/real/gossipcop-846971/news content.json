She was only 6. A lengthy ransom note was found first and her father found her dead in the basement 8 hours after they had reported her missing. She had a broken skull and had been strangled. Her death is officially classified as a homicide, and while both her parents were suspects, the case still remains unsolved.\n\nHowever, theorists have a different theory: JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey was not killed that night; instead she was kidnapped (apparently as a part of some sort of Illuminati conspiracy?), her parents staged her death, and she later resurfaced as Katy Perry in 2008 with the hit song \u201cI Kissed a Girl\u201d.\n\nTheir evidence includes the resemblance of Katy Perry and JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey as well as the \u201cresemblance\u201d of both their sets of parents. One youtuber theorist went to great lengths to prove that the similarities of their eyebrows, which must mean that they\u2019re the same person.\n\nA different youtuber points out one of the lines in Katy Perry\u2019s memoir (Katy Perry apparently has a memoir???), she wrote in reference to writing songs at an early age, \u201cNot that I was one of those stage kids. There was no JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey inside of me waiting to burst out.\u201d Now if she was really JonBen\u00e9t why would she even make that reference? Well according to the youtuber, \u201cThe Illuminati always puts out clues hidden in plain sight.\u201d Sure.\n\nHow it started: The theory seems to have begun from a Youtube video entitled \u201c\u2018JoBen\u00e9t Ramsey\u2019 is singer \u2018Katy Perry\u2019\u201d posted in December 2014 (it has since been taken down). The theory gained traction from there, with several youtubers like the ones I mentioned above making their own \u201cevidence\u201d videos. The story eventually gained enough traction for Entertainment News sites to start covering it in February 2016 and Katy Perry even referenced it at the VMAs this year.\n\nReal or fake: FAKE. Honestly, this might be the worst conspiracy theory I\u2019ve ever seen. There is no real evidence other than \u201cwhite people look alike\u201d and it takes a quick google search to see that Katy Perry would\u2019ve already been 12 when JonBen\u00e9t was murdered.\n\nThere\u2019s also Perry\u2019s Christian pop album Katy Hudson (her real name), which was released in 2001 (Perry was 17, JonBen\u00e9t would\u2019ve only been 11) and records of her being picked up and dropped by big-name labels Island and Columbia between 2001 and 2008, which undermines the whole \u201cKaty Perry appearing out of nowhere\u201d idea.\n\nPlus, the motivation for turning JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey into Perry is shodding-ly filled in and is just hand waved as \u201cIlluminati stuff.\u201d Do you really think the Illuminati would take their time and resources to fake the death of a child pageant winner and turn her into a pop star? The theory just comes across as the first thing the original conspiracy theorist could think of.\n\nIf after reading this, you still think Katy Perry is JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey, then I don\u2019t what to tell you\u2026except if you pay me 10 bucks, you can meet my talking dog.", "images": ["https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/176/176/1*TUuCO2GDk9qM7jVx-nhYtQ@2x.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/270/1*Crl55Tm6yDNMoucPo1tvDg.png", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/64/64/1*1PGfzd9NvflrYVXHy-qN3Q.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/fit/c/96/96/1*TUuCO2GDk9qM7jVx-nhYtQ@2x.jpeg", "https://miro.medium.com/max/270/1*W_RAPQ62h0em559zluJLdQ.png", "https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*83XD-cNieE53tFjE8Vzxdg.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*83XD-cNieE53tFjE8Vzxdg.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ali Golub"], "canonical_link": "https://nyulocal.com/new-world-university-katy-perry-is-jonben%C3%A9t-ramsey-764addd94b36", "title": "New World University: Katy Perry is JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1", "theme-color": "#000000", "twitter": {"app": {"name": {"iphone": "Medium"}, "id": {"iphone": 828256236}, "url": {"iphone": "medium://p/764addd94b36"}}, "title": "New World University: Katy Perry is JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey", "site": "@nyulocal", "description": "This week follows the world\u2019s least convincing conspiracy\u2026", "image": {"src": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*83XD-cNieE53tFjE8Vzxdg.jpeg"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Reading time", "data1": "3 min read", "tile": {"template": {"testing": 2}, "image": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*83XD-cNieE53tFjE8Vzxdg.jpeg", "info1": {"text": "Ali Golub", "icon": "User"}, "info2": {"text": "2017-11-10T15:06:59.439Z", "icon": "Calendar"}}, "cta": "Read on Medium"}, "al": {"ios": {"app_name": "Medium", "app_store_id": 828256236, "url": "medium://p/764addd94b36"}, "android": {"package": "com.medium.reader", "url": "medium://p/764addd94b36", "app_name": "Medium"}, "web": {"url": "https://nyulocal.com/new-world-university-katy-perry-is-jonben%C3%A9t-ramsey-764addd94b36"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 542599432471018}, "og": {"site_name": "Medium", "type": "article", "title": "New World University: Katy Perry is JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey", "description": "This week follows the world\u2019s least convincing conspiracy\u2026", "url": "https://nyulocal.com/new-world-university-katy-perry-is-jonben%C3%A9t-ramsey-764addd94b36", "image": "https://miro.medium.com/max/1024/1*83XD-cNieE53tFjE8Vzxdg.jpeg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-10T15:06:59.439Z", "author": "https://medium.com/@ali_golub"}, "title": "New World University: Katy Perry is JonBen\u00e9t Ramsey | by Ali Golub | NYU Local", "description": "Each week Local will present New World University, a column that breaks down and discusses popular conspiracy theories.
