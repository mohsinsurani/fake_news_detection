She began her stint in the Victorville Federal Correctional Institution in California last July \u2014 and spoke out in a Dance Moms: Abby Tells All special airing just beforehand, worrying that she \"probably won't survive\" her time behind bars.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nBut it's OK, she did! Despite many a salacious tabloid rumor otherwise, Miller is said to have bonded with her fellow inmates, took real estate classes, and earned a \"personal finance class diploma,\" which seems in particular like a good idea given, you know, that whole faked bankruptcy. Entertainment Tonight reported back in January that she'd been \"feeling great,\" and had lost 100 pounds (Miller also underwent a gastric bypass procedure prior to her jail stint).\n\nAnd TMZ reports now that Miller has now pirouetted her way out of prison and into a Residential Reentry Center halfway house \u2014 \"a safe, structured and supervised environment where she'll be given employment counseling, job placement and financial management assistance.\" She will finish out the final few months of her sentence there, ahead of what is believed to her early release set for mid-May.\n\nAnd while her social media accounts were \u2014 at times bizarrely \u2014 updated regularly while she was in prison, Miller appears to celebrating her newly-found (sort of) freedom already on Twitter, with a good ol' Kermit meme:\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.
