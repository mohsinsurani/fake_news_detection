For a few glorious hours, fluorescent lights pulsed, flickered, and reflected off the night\u2019s most jeweled and shimmering fashion.\n\nIt\u2019s a testament to the gala\u2019s tech-tinged theme that each guest seemed to come alive inside the lighted space. Siblings Jaden and Willow Smith performed an impromptu dance-off. L\u00e9a Seydoux followed with a leggy number so good, it compelled Willow to say to the French actress: \u201cI just want to tell you that you\u2019re beautiful, and I love you.\u201d And Madonna, dressed in a Givenchy bodysuit, clung to the walls and slithered to the ground as Riccardo Tisci applauded from the sidelines. \u201cThat was your cardio!\u201d Tisci cheered. The Balmain army\u2014Cindy Crawford, Joan Smalls, Jourdan Dunn, Doutzen Kroes, and Alessandra Ambrosio\u2014assembled in rhinestone frocks and put on their best faces. \u201cMy daughter is going to be so embarrassed by that,\u201d Crawford quipped on her way out.\n\nEven the most reserved guests took to twirling, laughing, and sashaying for the camera. Elle Fanning whipped her hair back and forth so enthusiastically, she had to run to the loo to fix her ponytail. But sometimes less is more. Just take a look at Vogue\u2019s Editor in Chief, Anna Wintour, who mesmerized while remaining perfectly still.", "images": ["https://cnid.condenastdigital.com/client/assets/img/spinner.gif", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/newsletter-0616-update.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/logo_vogue_white.svg", "https://condenast.112.2o7.net/b/ss/conde-voguecom/1/H.15.1--NS/0", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/index.html", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/logo_vogue.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/taylor-swift1.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/KT_Arrivals_2706.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5fc65f6d1066b359e5ff8016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-vogue-met-gala-olsentwins.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/beyonce1.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience/met-gala-bathroom-cass-bird-141.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5fc65f6d1066b359e5ff8016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-vogue-met-gala-olsentwins.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience", "title": "Met Gala 2016 Instagram Video Portraits", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Fluorescent lights pulsed, flickered, and reflected off the night\u2019s most sparkly fashion.", "id": "5fbd44ec1066b359e5ff7c53", "keywords": "special projects,vogue original content,met gala 2022", "news_keywords": "special projects,vogue original content,met gala 2022", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5fbd44ec1066b359e5ff7c53", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Fluorescent lights pulsed, flickered, and reflected off the night\u2019s most sparkly fashion.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5fbd44fddad9ba0c310e4636/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/met-gala-2016-video-holding.gif\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5fbd44fddad9ba0c310e4636/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/met-gala-2016-video-holding.gif\"}", "og": {"description": "Fluorescent lights pulsed, flickered, and reflected off the night\u2019s most sparkly fashion.", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5fc65f6d1066b359e5ff8016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-vogue-met-gala-olsentwins.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Met Gala 2016 Instagram Video Portraits", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/projects/13433750/met-gala-2016-manus-x-machina-experience"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2016-05-05T14:37:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2016-05-05T14:37:00.000Z", "author": "Jessie Heyman"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "description": "Fluorescent lights pulsed, flickered, and reflected off the night\u2019s most sparkly fashion.", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5fc65f6d1066b359e5ff8016/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/13-vogue-met-gala-olsentwins.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Met Gala 2016 Instagram Video Portraits"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1462459020.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
