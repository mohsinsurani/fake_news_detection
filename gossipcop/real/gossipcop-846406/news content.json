Lindsey Morgan teases SpaceKru\u2019s post-Praimfaya journey\n\nBecause, as Morgan explains in an exclusive interview with Hypable, Raven feels like she is responsible for stranding them in space, and she had practically made it her life mission to get them back to the ground.\n\nFrom Raven\u2019s perspective, \u201cThey wouldn\u2019t be in space and threatened this way if it wasn\u2019t for Raven\u2019s indecision about the bunker,\u201d says Morgan.\n\n\u201cRaven screwed up the plan, and made them come get her, and ruined everyone\u2019s chance of safety. So them being in space is completely Raven\u2019s fault, and leaving Clarke, and ultimately killing Clarke is completely Raven\u2019s fault, and she knows that.\u201d\n\nSo when the opportunity presented itself in The 100 5\u00d703 \u201cSleeping Giants,\u201d she did not hesitate to sacrifice herself for her friends.\n\nArticle Continues Below\n\nShe lied to Bellamy, telling him there was an escape pod, knowing that this false assurance would give him peace of mind to leave Raven behind and go find his sister.\n\n\u201cRaven is trying to hide her desperation to Bellamy because she doesn\u2019t want him to get suspicious about it,\u201d says Morgan. \u201cBecause if he knew the truth, he wouldn\u2019t let her go. But she has to sacrifice herself to get them home safe, otherwise she wouldn\u2019t be able to live with herself.\u201d\n\nAlthough it was a tough scene to watch and film, Morgan counts \u201cSleeping Giants\u201d among her favorite episodes for Raven.\n\n\u201cI love that she got to make that decision. In a weird way, it gave her peace,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was such an amazing way for Raven to pay homage to Clarke. And show gratitude to her friends.\u201d\n\nOf course we know that this is not the end of Raven\u2019s story. How she and Murphy eventually get to the ground, and what happens when they do, are still mysteries.\n\nBut despite not yet being on the ground, Raven and Murphy got to be the second and third person to reunite with Clarke, over the radio, in an extremely emotional scene in 5\u00d704 \u201cPandora\u2019s Box.\u201d\n\nMorgan describes this scene as \u201cvery special, very moving, and just such a shock\u201d for Raven.\n\n\u201cI remember filming that scene, and I just\u2026 I was stunned,\u201d Morgan remembers. \u201cIt was such an interesting emotion to play, because it was almost like hearing an angel speak, you know? Not to be dramatic! But that\u2019s what it felt like.\u201d\n\nMorgan describes Raven finding out Clarke is alive as \u201ca literal miracle. I don\u2019t think Raven has ever gotten that lucky before.\u201d\n\nClarke and Raven\u2019s relationship has always been a cornerstone of The 100, although sadly, the pair don\u2019t often get to cross storylines.\n\nRegardless, \u201cClarke means so much to Raven,\u201d Morgan says. \u201cClarke and Raven are connected in ways that others aren\u2019t. They have such a special and complex relationship, after everything they\u2019ve been through. There\u2019s so much respect and love at the core of it.\u201d\n\nBecause of their connection, and because of Raven\u2019s guilt surrounding Clarke\u2019s death, Morgan says that \u201cit was hard for Raven to imagine her life without [Clarke]. She was just so important to her.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo have her be gone, and to reconcile with that, and knowing it was her fault\u2026 and then to find out she was alive? It really was a miracle.\u201d\n\nWe will have to wait and see what happens when/if Raven and Clarke reunite on the ground. For now, it is great to see Raven let go of some of her guilt (even as new trouble is brewing), and to be reminded of how much these two women still mean to each other, after all this time.\n\nThis was the second part of our big The 100 season 5 interview with Lindsey Morgan.
