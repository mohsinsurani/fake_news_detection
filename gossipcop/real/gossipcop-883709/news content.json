Brooklyn Decker and Andy Roddick, have welcomed their second child together, a baby girl, Us Weekly can confirm.\n\nThe couple welcomed their baby girl, Stevie, in Austin, Texas in late November. Decker, 30, revealed the news in an Instagram post on Wednesday, January 3. \u201cA newborn, a toddler, a dog in a cone, a dog with a tumor but I\u2019m having a good hair day so it\u2019s fine we\u2019re fine I\u2019m fine,\u201d the model wrote alongside a photo of herself cradling the infant.\n\nThe 35-year-old former tennis pro announced that the couple were expecting their second bundle of joy while being inducted into the International Tennis Hall of Fame in Newport, Rhode Island, in July. During the athlete\u2019s heartwarming speech, the star acknowledged his mother, Blanche, his late father, Jerry, his wife, Decker, their 2-year-old son, Hank, and to the surprise of many: their baby-to-be.\n\n\u201cBrook, I don\u2019t know how you juggle it all,\u201d Roddick said. \u201cYou hear a lot of guys find it very tough to walk away from professional sports, but you are the reason my personal transition into a quasi-everyday life has been gratifying and full. Hank will someday realize how lucky he is, and our daughter that\u2019s coming will also realize she has the best mother on Earth.\u201d\n\nThe 30-year-old Grace and Frankie alum has not been shy about showing off her pregnancy on Instagram.\n\n\u201cToday he turns 35! 1 and a half babies, and 10 years later- each day gets better and better. It really does. Happy Birthday, Husband. (He doesn\u2019t have instagram so he\u2019ll never see this- but isn\u2019t it a cute picture?)\u201d Decker captioned the cute moment.\n\nThe What to Expect When You\u2019re Expecting actress went on to poke fun at her changing body by sharing a pic of her swollen foot in a black high heel shoe.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t even know where the leg ends and the foot begins anymore,\u201d she wrote in jest.\n\nShortly before giving birth, Decker opened up about her second pregnancy and admitted she was \u201cshocked\u201d when Roddick revealed the news. \u201cI don\u2019t know that he knew he was [ going to announce their pregnancy]. He just got so overwhelmed by the moment that he just sort of blurted out that we were pregnant and having a daughter,\u201d she exclusively told Us Weekly in October. \u201cI feel like physically, it has been a little bit more taxing, but I think that\u2019s mostly because I\u2019m chasing around a toddler. When you want to nap, you can\u2019t just drop everything and nap like you can the first go around, but it\u2019s been relatively smooth and easy pregnancy.\u201d\n\nDecker also told Us at the time that she and Roddick had chosen a \u201cfamily name\u201d for the newest addition to their brood.\n\nThe Friends With Better Lives alum, who revealed her pregnancy cravings included \u201cice\u201d and \u201cjunk food,\u201d said her son is excited to become a big brother. \u201cHe is crazy about the idea of a little sister, but again I don\u2019t think he understands certain realities of what that actually looks like when a new baby comes into the house.\u201d\n\nDecker and Roddick began dating in 2007 and tied the knot in Austin, Texas, in April 2009.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/624325342_andy-roddick-brooklyn-decker-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/624325342_andy-roddick-brooklyn-decker-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/brooklyn-decker-gives-birth-to-second-child-with-andy-roddick-first-pic/", "title": "Brooklyn Decker Gives Birth to Second Child With Andy Roddick: First Pic!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Brooklyn Decker and her husband, Andy Roddick, have welcomed their second child together, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Brooklyn Decker, Andy Roddick Welcome Baby No. 2: Find Out Her Name!", "description": "Brooklyn Decker and her husband, Andy Roddick, have welcomed their second child together, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/brooklyn-decker-gives-birth-to-second-child-with-andy-roddick-first-pic/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:06:12+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/624325342_andy-roddick-brooklyn-decker-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/624325342_andy-roddick-brooklyn-decker-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/marc.lupo.9", "published_time": "2018-01-03T17:33:33+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:06:12+00:00"}, "author": "Marc Lupo", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Brooklyn Decker, Andy Roddick Welcome Baby No. 2: Find Out Her Name!", "description": "Brooklyn Decker and her husband, Andy Roddick, have welcomed their second child together, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/624325342_andy-roddick-brooklyn-decker-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "creator": "@Marcandrewlupo", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515000813.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
