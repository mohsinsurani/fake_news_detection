In the text, Legend attempts to talk some sense into Ye after the rapper broke the internet with this \u201cMAGA\u201d-Donald Trump lovefest on Wednesday afternoon, reminding Kanye of the importance of his platform and the effect that aligning with Trump would have on his friends and fans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cSo many people who love you feel so betrayed right now becaues they know the harm that Trump\u2019s policies cause, especially to people of color. Don\u2019t let this be part of your legacy,\u201d Legend pleaded.\n\nIn response, Kanye wrote: \u201cI love you John and I appreciate your thoughts. You bringing up my fans or my legacy is a tactic based on fear used to manipulate my free thought.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if the conversation went on longer than that, but Ye clearly felt it appropriate to then share the exchange with the world.\n\nAbout a half hour later, Kanye offered some clarification on why he decided to post the exchange (it\u2019s also unclear on whether he gave Legend a heads-up before posting either tweet).\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI tweeted the John text to show that there are people around me that disagree with me and voice their opinion,\u201d West wrote, perhaps alluding to allegations that he\u2019s surrounded himself with \u201cyes men.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cI respect everyone\u2019s opinion but I stand my ground,\u201d he wrote.\n\nInterestingly, minutes before Kanye posted his explanation, Legend\u2019s wife, the undefeated Chrissy Teigen, also weighed in on Kanye for the first time since the whole \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d debacle.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cEveryone keeps asking me to comment on shit. Comment on psycho Tami Lasagna, whom I refuse to give the joy to, say something about RHOA, speak about Kanye. When it comes to people we know, we DO speak up. To THEM. Not on Twitter. And sometimes, I guess it makes it to Twitter,\u201d Teigen wrote.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSo there we have it. Yes, people have tried to talk to Kanye about the ramifications of his actions. And while he says he loves them and respects them, he prefers not to really listen to them, opting to \u201cstand [his] ground\u201d in the name of his free\u2014if convoluted, nonsensical and, frankly, rather dull\u2014thoughts.\n\nPerhaps, if he read, Kanye would know the deeper implications of a phrase like \u201cstand my ground\u201d\u2014but that would mean Kanye\u2019s free thoughts involved actual thinking.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFor what it\u2019s worth, Yeezy also dropped this free-thought gem earlier: \u201cPeople usually don\u2019t agree with people who don\u2019t agree with them.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI suppose this is the new wave: Next time you want attention for a controversial and provocative opinion but don\u2019t care for any scrutiny of or responsibility for the effects of said opinion (a line I\u2019m paraphrasing from T.D. Williams\u2019 incisive article on Kanye West), just call it a free thought.\n\nIn case there was any doubt it was all love\u2014or whatever game is being played here\u2014Legend also had a friendly request for Ye, since the latter was in a sharing mood.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAnd since you\u2019re posting texts, let me add that I have new single out,\u201d Legend plugged\u2014which Kanye happily obliged.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png",
