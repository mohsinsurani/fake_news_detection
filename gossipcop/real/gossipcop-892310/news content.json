It is a sequel to the 2012 film Pitch Perfect and the second installment in the Pitch Perfect film series. The film centers on the fictional Barden University Bellas, an all-female a cappella singing group, who try to beat out a competing German musical group in a world singing championship. The film features Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, Brittany Snow, Skylar Astin, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp, Ben Platt, Hana Mae Lee, Alexis Knapp, Ester Dean, Kelly Jakle, Shelley Regner, John Michael Higgins, and Banks all reprising their roles from the previous film, now joined by Hailee Steinfeld, Katey Segal, Birgitte Hjort S\u00f8rensen, and Flula Borg.\n\nIt was released in the United States on May 15, 2015 by Universal Pictures. The film received generally positive reviews from critics and grossed over $287 million worldwide. It surpassed the total gross of the original film ($115.4 million) in five days, and also became the highest-grossing music comedy film of all-time, overtaking School of Rock ($131.3 million).[5] A sequel, Pitch Perfect 3, was released on December 22, 2017.[6][7]\n\nPlot [ edit ]\n\nIn 2015, three years after winning their first championship, the Barden Bellas are now led by senior Beca Mitchell and three-time super senior Chloe Beale. The Bellas have been the ICCA National champions for three consecutive years. However, a national scandal (dubbed \"Muffgate\") erupts when Patricia \"Fat Amy\" Hobart accidentally rips her pants in front of U.S. President Barack Obama during his birthday performance at the Kennedy Center, exposing her genitalia due to her lack of underwear. The incident leads to the Bellas' suspension from the ICCAs.\n\nHowever, they are not stripped of their competitive titles, leading Beca to make a deal that they can be reinstated should they win the A Cappella World Championship. Freshman Emily Junk begins her college career, hoping to follow in the footsteps of her mother, Katherine, by becoming a Bella. At orientation, she watches an A Cappella performance by the Treblemakers, now led by Beca's boyfriend Jesse Swanson. Jesse' best friend, Benjamin \"Benji\" Applebaum, develops a crush on Emily at first sight. The Bellas learn that Das Sound Machine (DSM), a German powerhouse group, has replaced them on their victory tour and is the favorite to win the Worlds. Additionally, Beca has started an internship at recording studio Residual Heat, something only Jesse knows (and Fat Amy later discovers).\n\nAs the Bellas' suspension means they cannot hold auditions, Emily goes directly to their sorority house. She sings her unfinished song \"Flashlight,\" impressing them; they decide she can join, as since she came of her own accord, they technically aren't breaking any rules. The Bellas meet DSM when the latter performs at a car show; the group, led by intimidating duo Pieter Kr\u00e4mer and Kommissar, takes delight in mocking the Bellas. Later, both groups are invited to an exclusive riff-off; also in attendance are the Treblemakers, the Tone Hangers (a group composed of former Treblemakers, including previous leader Bumper Allen, with whom Amy is in a no-strings-attached relationship), and the Green Bay Packers.\n\nThe Bellas make it to the final two, but lose to DSM when Emily panics and sings \"Flashlight\", violating the tradition of singing non-original songs. Bumper surprises Amy with a traditional date and asks her to officially be his girlfriend; she refuses, leaving him devastated. At a practice performance for the Worlds, the Bellas' planned set ends in disaster when their incorporation of pyrotechnics sets Cynthia Rose's hair on fire. In order to rediscover their roots and synchronicity, Chloe takes them to a retreat led by former Bella Aubrey Posen. The truth about Beca's internship comes out, and she starts a heated debate with Chloe over her obsession with the group and accuses the other Bellas of not thinking about their futures. She angrily storms off, only to step into one of the camp's hidden bear traps. In a panic, she apologizes for her harsh words, before being saved by Lilly. Later, the Bellas accept that they must go their separate ways after graduation, and regain harmony by singing \"When I'm Gone\", the song Beca used to audition for the group.\n\nAmy realizes she regrets ending things with Bumper, and the two reconcile the next day. Meanwhile, Beca's boss at her internship has been unimpressed with everything she has presented to him so far, so Beca offers to help Emily produce \"Flashlight\" at the studio to demonstrate her true abilities. When they show him the demo, he expresses envy for their talent and says he looks forward to working with them. The senior Bellas graduate, and the group heads to Copenhagen for the World Finals. Before their performance, Emily and Benji share a kiss. The Bellas deliver a stellar stripped-down performance, ending in a harmonized version of \"Flashlight\" with Aubrey, Katherine, and other past Bellas joining in. They win the championship, repairing their damaged legacy. As the senior Bellas leave Barden, they give Emily a belated initiation ceremony, with Amy demonstrating the last tradition: christening the house by sliding down the staircase.\n\nCast [ edit ]\n\nAdditionally, Keegan-Michael Key appears as Sammy, Beca's boss at Residual Heat, a rude but successful producer, Shawn Carter Peterson appears as Dax, an intern at Residual Heat, David Cross (credited as Sir Willups Brightlysmore) appears as the Riff-Off host, Pentatonix members Scott Hoying, Kirstie Maldonado, Mitch Grassi, Avi Kaplan, and Kevin Olusola appear as Team Canada, Penn Masala appears as Team India, the Naan Stops, and Filharmonic appears as Team Philippines\n\nGreen Bay Packers players Clay Matthews, David Bakhtiari, Don Barclay, Josh Sitton and T.

Travers welcomed the addition of Steinfeld, praised Wilson for her continued scene stealing, and said the scenes with Keegan-Michael Key were gold. He reserved his highest praise for Banks, for both her acting and her feature debut as director, praising her for \"bringing fizz to the tiredest clich\u00e9s and reveling in a screen full of musical girl power.\"[65]\n\nRichard Roeper of the Chicago Sun-Times gave it a mixed review, saying \"Pitch Perfect 2 strains to find some plot conflicts while balancing the line between satire and rousing musical numbers.\"[66] Michael Phillips of the Chicago Tribune called it \"a two-hour lesson in how to act like a frenemy to your alleged friends. And it's not funny enough.\"[67] David Edelstein of New York Magazine gave the film a negative review and, despite having reviewed the first film positively, thought the sequel was \"A Ca-Terrible\". Edelstein was critical of the script, \"There are good ideas that needed another pass\", and Kendrick's performance \"I've never seen her so flat-out bad \u2014 distracted, depressed, conviction-less\" although he does concede that the climactic number was excellent.[68]\n\nRodrigo Perez at IndieWire wrote \"The movie's off-color humor also doesn't connect like it once did either. The casual racism, homophobia and sexism might be tolerable if any of it was remotely funny, but none of it is.\"[69] Kevin Fallon of The Daily Beast liked the film but was critical of the \"tone-deaf racial jokes\", particularly the casual racism in the subplot about Flo, a senior Bella singer from Guatemala. He also did not find the racially charged jokes from the commentators funny.[70][71][72]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nBillboard Music Awards\n\nTeen Choice Awards\n\nPeople's Choice Awards\n\nKids Choice Awards\n\nFavorite Movie (lost to Star Wars: The Force Awakens )\n\n) Favorite Movie Actress (Anna Kendrick, Rebel Wilson, lost to Jennifer Lawrence)\n\nMTV Movie Awards\n\nGolden Raspberry Awards\n\nSequel [ edit ]\n\nOn April 11, 2015, a month before the release of Pitch Perfect 2, it was announced that Rebel Wilson would return for a third film, although she stated that she did not know if Anna Kendrick or any of the other cast members would also be reprising their roles. She added that she would be \"up for a Fat Amy spin-off,\" although nothing had yet been confirmed.[76] Director, star, and producer Elizabeth Banks acknowledged the possibility of a third film, saying, \"I will say, it would be disingenuous to say that no one's talking about a Pitch Perfect 3; the possibility of it. We are really focused on getting as many butts in seats for this one. If fans embrace it, we are going to seriously think about what the continuing journey would look like, but we don't know what that is yet\".[77]\n\nOn June 10, 2015, a third film was officially confirmed, with Kay Cannon returning to write the script.[78] Several days later it was announced both Kendrick and Wilson would reprise their roles, and later Brittany Snow was also confirmed to return.[6] Banks returned to produce, but in June 2016 it was announced she would not be directing the film.[79]\n\nThe film was originally slated for a July 21, 2017 release, and was later pushed back to August 4, 2017 before moving back to the July 21 slot.[7] In May 2016 it was moved again, this time being pushed back to December 22, 2017.[80]", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Pitch_Perfect_2_poster.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fa/Wikiquote-logo.svg/34px-Wikiquote-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/99/Question_book-new.svg/50px-Question_book-new.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Pitch_Perfect_2_poster.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pitch_Perfect_2", "title": "Pitch Perfect 2", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/3/3f/Pitch_Perfect_2_poster.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 1012}, "title": "Pitch Perfect 2 - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
