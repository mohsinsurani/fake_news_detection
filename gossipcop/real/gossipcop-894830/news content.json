The TV exclusive aired on \"Today\" Wednesday. \"I saw that more than once,\" he added.\n\nNBC News is withholding the man's name because he still works in Hollywood and fears retaliation.\n\nSuzie Hardy, a former stylist at the cable channel E!, had accused Seacrest, 43, of sexual misconduct last year but finally went public with her claims on Monday.\n\nSeacrest, a longtime TV personality, is a co-host of ABC's daytime talk show \"Live with Kelly & Ryan\" and is set to host E!'s Oscars show on Sunday and \"American Idol\" when it returns to ABC next month.\n\nA source close to Seacrest dismissed the former co-worker as a friend of Hardy\u2019s and a disgruntled former E! employee, adding that there are other witnesses who dispute Hardy\u2019s accounts.\n\nAnother source connected to Seacrest provided a video to NBC News as a rebuttal to the claim that Seacrest would shove Hardy\u2019s face into his crotch. In it, Hardy is seen tying Seacrest's shoe and him laughing and responding, \"She's actually tying my shoe.\"\n\nThe former co-worker said just before an Oscars red carpet special in 2008, Hardy had helped Seacrest get ready at the Hollywood Roosevelt Hotel in Los Angeles.\n\nHe said at one point, the doors to the bedroom opened and Seacrest was holding Hardy in a bear hug from behind.\n\nRyan Seacrest.

(NBCUniversal is also NBC News' parent company.)\n\nSeacrest's attorney, Andrew Baum, described Hardy's allegations as \"untrue\" and said the stylist had sought $15 million. Hardy's attorney denied asking Seacrest, E!, or NBCUniversal for money.\n\nSeacrest said in a statement in part, \"This person who has accused me of horrible things offered, on multiple occasions, to withdraw her claims if I paid her millions of dollars. I refused.\"\n\nHe added that he \"worked extremely hard to achieve my success\" and \"I don't want to accuse anyone of not telling the truth but in this case, I have no choice but to again deny the claims against me, remind people that I was recused of any wrongdoing, and put the matter to rest.\"\n\nSeacrest's lawyer told NBC News that the former co-worker's claims are \"lies.\"\n\n\"These claims are not new and were considered by the investigator hired by E!, who found no evidence of wrongdoing,\" the lawyer said.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2344421/180228-ryan-seacrest-mc-1157.JPG", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2343016/180227-ryan-seacrest-mc1011.JPG", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201802/tdy_news_snow_seacrest_180228_1920x1080.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2344421/180228-ryan-seacrest-mc-1157.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erik Ortiz"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/ex-stylist-ryan-seacrest-endured-sexual-misconduct-former-co-worker-n851871", "title": "Ex-stylist of Ryan Seacrest endured sexual misconduct, former co-worker says", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/storyline/sexual-misconduct/ex-stylist-ryan-seacrest-endured-sexual-misconduct-former-co-worker-n851871", "title": "Ex-stylist of Ryan Seacrest endured sexual misconduct, former co-worker says", "description": "Personal stylist Suzie Hardy had accused Seacrest, 43, of sexual misconduct last year but finally went public with her claims on Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2344421/180228-ryan-seacrest-mc-1157.JPG", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2344421/180228-ryan-seacrest-mc-1157.JPG", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2344421/180228-ryan-seacrest-mc-1157.JPG", "title": "Ex-stylist of Ryan Seacrest endured sexual misconduct, former co-worker says", "description": "Personal stylist Suzie Hardy had accused Seacrest, 43, of sexual misconduct last year but finally went public with her claims on Monday.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Personal stylist Suzie Hardy had accused Seacrest, 43, of sexual misconduct last year but finally went public with her claims on Monday.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "Ex-stylist of Ryan Seacrest endured sexual misconduct, former co-worker says", "description": "Personal stylist Suzie Hardy had accused Seacrest, 43, of sexual misconduct last year but finally went public with her claims on Monday.", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2344421/180228-ryan-seacrest-mc-1157.JPG", "type": "article", "unibrow": "#MeToo Reckoning", "authorName1": "Erik Ortiz"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Wed Feb 28 2018 13:18:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Tue Mar 06 2018 08:35:30 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/2344421/180228-ryan-seacrest-mc-1157.JPG", "next-head-count": 97}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519823880.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
