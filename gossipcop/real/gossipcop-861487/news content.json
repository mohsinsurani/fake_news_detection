Daily Mail has reported that the mother of two decided to go braless under the skimpy top.\n\nNorth West, the birthday girl looked cute in her vintage Snoop Dogg tank and fluffy leopard shoes. Little Nori as North West is lovingly called probably had opened the gifts inside the restaurant since she left the place with quite a haul, which included a bicycle.\n\nEarlier in the day, the family had rented out Chuck E Cheese\u2019s for North and her friends to ring on her birthday.\n\nRecalling Nori\u2019s first birthday party bash\n\nKim Kardashian and Kanye West were newlyweds during their daughter\u2019s first birthday party.
