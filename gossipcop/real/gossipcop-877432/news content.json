Among guests were artists Chuck Close, Ed Ruscha, Brice Marden and Frank Stella, gallerists Barbara Gladstone and Arne Glimcher, arts patrons Brooke Garber Neidich, Beth Rudin DeWoody and Anne Bass, museum director Adam Weinberg, and Ronald and Jo Carole Lauder.\n\nBenton, who\u2019s divorced from Axel Capital Management founder Anna Nikolayevsky, bought a 730 Park Ave. duplex in 2012 with his then-wife for $39 million. Harvard MBA whiz Benton launched Andor in 2001 after he was Wall Street\u2019s fourth-highest earner in 2000 \u2014 making $100 million, behind Steve Cohen, who was No. 2 with $137 million, according to Forbes. Andor holds stakes in Tesla, Facebook, Alphabet, Netflix and Amazon.\n\nIn comparison, Flay\u2019s reported net worth is a meager $20 million. He and March finalized their divorce last summer after their 10-year marriage ended, and they were reportedly battling over a prenup that would pay March just $5,000 per month.\n\nMarch said in an interview last October, around the time she began dating Benton, \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a year,\u201d and she wanted to \u201c[hug] everyone I love 1,000 times over . . . Life is short.\u201d Friends, we hear, are very happy for the new couple. Reps didn\u2019t comment.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/63595522011911625010351607_51_whitney_20160405_pm_105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/63595522011911625010351607_51_whitney_20160405_pm_105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/04/63595522011911625010351607_51_whitney_20160405_pm_105.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2016/04/06/stephanie-marchs-new-beau-is-a-lot-richer-than-bobby-flay/", "title": "Stephanie March\u2019s new beau is a lot richer than Bobby Flay", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
