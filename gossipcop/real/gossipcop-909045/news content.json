The family had left Kenya in 1980 for a period because of political repression and unrest; Peter's brother, Charles Nyong'o, disappeared after he was thrown off a ferry in 1980.[9]\n\nNyong'o holds dual Kenyan and Mexican citizenship and identifies as \"Kenyan-Mexican\".[10][11] She is of Luo descent on both sides of her family, and is the second of six children.[12] It is a tradition of the Luo people to name a child after the events of the day, so her parents gave her a Spanish name, Lupita (a diminutive of Guadalupe).[13] Her father was once a Minister for Medical Services in the Kenyan government and later became the Governor of the city of Kisumu, Kenya.[14] At the time of her birth, he was a visiting lecturer in political science at El Colegio de M\u00e9xico in Mexico City.[12][15]\n\nThe family returned to their native Kenya when Nyong'o was less than one year old,[13][16] after her father was appointed as a professor at the University of Nairobi.[12] She grew up primarily in Nairobi, in an artistic family, and describes her upbringing as \"middle class, suburban.\"[15] Family get-togethers often included performances by the children, and trips to see plays.[17] She attended Rusinga International School in Kenya and acted in school plays.[7]\n\nAt age 14, Nyong'o made her professional acting debut as Juliet in Romeo and Juliet[7] in a production by the Nairobi-based repertory company Phoenix Players.[15][17] While a member of the Phoenix Players, Nyong'o also performed in the plays On The Razzle and There Goes The Bride.[18] Nyong'o credits the performances of Whoopi Goldberg and Oprah Winfrey in The Color Purple with inspiring her to pursue a professional acting career.[19][20]\n\nWhen she was 16, her parents sent her to Mexico for seven months to learn Spanish.[13][21] During those seven months, Nyong'o lived in Taxco, Guerrero, and took classes at the Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico's Learning Centre for Foreigners.[21] Nyong'o later attended St. Mary's School in Nairobi, where she received an IB Diploma in 2001 and received the mean grade of 6 out of 7 and came second in her class.[22] She went to the United States for college, graduating from Hampshire College with a degree in film and theatre studies.[23][24]\n\nIn 2013, her father was elected to represent Kisumu County in the Kenyan Senate and by 2017, he became Governor.[13][25] Nyong'o's mother is the managing director of the Africa Cancer Foundation and her own communications company.[17][18] Other family members include Tavia Nyong'o, a scholar and professor at New York University; Omondi Nyong'o, a paediatric ophthalmologist in Palo Alto, California, US; Kwame Nyong'o, one of Kenya's leading animators and leading technology expert; and Isis Nyong'o, a media and technology leader who was named one of Africa's most powerful young women by Forbes magazine.[26][27]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\n2005\u20132015: Early Work and breakthrough [ edit ]\n\nNyong'o began her career working as part of the production crew for several films, including Fernando Meirelles's The Constant Gardener (2005), Mira Nair's The Namesake (2006), and Salvatore Stabile's Where God Left His Shoes (2007).[28] She cites Ralph Fiennes, the British star of The Constant Gardener, as someone who inspired her to pursue a professional acting career.[15] In 2008, Nyong'o starred in the short film East River, directed by Marc Grey and shot in Brooklyn.[29] She returned to Kenya that same year and appeared in the Kenyan television series Shuga, an MTV Base Africa/UNICEF drama about HIV/AIDS prevention.[28] In 2009, she wrote, directed, and produced the documentary In My Genes, about the discriminatory treatment of Kenya's albino population.[12] It played at several film festivals and won first prize at the 2008 Five College Film Festival.[28] Nyong'o also directed the music video \"The Little Things You Do\" by Wahu, featuring Bobi Wine,[28] which was nominated for the Best Video Award at the MTV Africa Music Awards 2009.[28]\n\nNyong'o enrolled in a master's degree program in acting at the Yale School of Drama. At Yale, she appeared in many stage productions, including Gertrude Stein's Doctor Faustus Lights the Lights, Chekhov's Uncle Vanya, and William Shakespeare's The Taming of the Shrew and The Winter's Tale.

Nyong'o portrayed Patsey, a slave who works alongside Northup at a Louisiana cotton plantation; her performance garnered rave reviews.[31] Empire reviewer Ian Freer wrote that she \"gives one of the most committed big-screen debuts imaginable,\" and Peter Travers of Rolling Stone called her \"a spectacular young actress who imbues Patsey with grit and radiant grace\".[32][33] She was nominated for several awards for 12 Years a Slave, including a Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress, a BAFTA Award for Best Actress in a Supporting Role, and two Screen Actors Guild Awards, including Best Supporting Actress, which she won.[34] She also won the Academy Award for Best Supporting Actress, becoming the sixth black actress to win the award.[35] The blue Prada dress she wore to the awards garnered substantial media attention and acclaim, being considered one of the classic red carpet gowns in Hollywood history.[36][37] She is the second African actress to win the award,[35] the first Kenyan actress to win an Oscar, and the first Mexican to win the award.[38][39] She is also the fifteenth actress to win an Oscar for a film debut performance.[40]\n\nFollowing a supporting role in the action-thriller Non-Stop (2014),[41] Nyong'o co-starred in Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015) as Force-sensitive space pirate Maz Kanata, a CGI character created using motion capture technology.[42][43] She had wanted to play a role where her appearance was not relevant, and the acting provided a different challenge from her role as Patsey.[44] Scott Mendelson of Forbes described Nyong'o's role as \"the center of the film's best sequence,\" and Stephanie Zacharek of Time magazine called her a \"delightful minor character\".[45][46] She was nominated for Best Supporting Actress at the 42nd Saturn Awards and Best Virtual Performance at the 2016 MTV Movie Awards for her role.[47][48]\n\nIn 2015, Nyong'o returned to the stage with a starring role as an unnamed girl in the play Eclipsed, written by Danai Gurira.[49] The play takes place during the chaos of the Second Liberian Civil War, where the captive wives of a rebel officer band together to form a community, until the balance of their lives are upset by the arrival of a new girl (played by Nyong'o). Eclipsed became the Public Theater's fastest-selling new production in recent history[50] and won Nyong'o an Obie Award for Outstanding Performance.[51] The play premiered on Broadway at the John Golden Theatre the following year.[52] It was the first play to premiere on Broadway with an all-black and female creative cast and crew.[53][54] Nyong'o had understudied the play at Yale in 2009 and was terrified to play the character onstage.[55] She turned down film roles in favour of the production.[56] Her performance garnered critical acclaim; Charles Isherwood of The New York Times hailed Nyong'o as \"one of the most radiant young actors to be seen on Broadway in recent seasons,\" and added that she \"shines with a compassion that makes us see beyond the suffering to the indomitable humanity of its characters.\"[57] Her performance in Eclipsed earned her a Theatre World Award for Outstanding Broadway or Off-Broadway Debut Performance and a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Actress in a Play.[58] In addition, she was nominated for Outstanding Actress in a Play at the Outer Critics Circle Award and a Distinguished Performance Award at the Drama League Award.[59][60][61][62]\n\n2016\u20132020: Motion capture roles, Black Panther, and Us [ edit ]\n\nNyong'o co-starred in Jon Favreau's The Jungle Book (2016), a live-action/CGI adaptation of its 1967 animated original, voicing Raksha, a mother wolf who adopts Mowgli (played by Neel Sethi).[63] Robbie Collin of The Telegraph wrote in his review that Nyong'o brought a \"gentle dignity\" to her role.[64] She later co-starred in Mira Nair's Queen of Katwe (2016), a biopic based on the true story about the rise of a young Ugandan chess prodigy,[65] Phiona Mutesi (played by Madina Nalwanga), who becomes a Woman Candidate Master after her performances at World Chess Olympiads. Nyong'o played Phiona's protective mother, Nakku Harriet.[66] Brian Tallerico of RogerEbert.com said, \"Nyong'o is phenomenal. She has an incredible ability to convey backstory.\"[67] Geoff Berkshire of Variety wrote, \"Simply radiant in her first live action role since winning an Oscar for 12 Years a Slave [...] [Nyong'o] imbues what could have been a stock mother figure with such inner fire that Harriet feels worthy of a movie all her own.\"[68]\n\nNyong'o reprised her role as Maz Kanata in Rian Johnson's Star Wars: The Last Jedi (2017), as well as in the animated series Star Wars Forces of Destiny.[69] The following year, she starred as spy Nakia, a former member of Dora Milaje, a team of women who serve as special forces of Wakanda and personal bodyguards to T'Challa / Black Panther (Chadwick Boseman), in Ryan Coogler's superhero film Black Panther (2018), which marked the eighteenth film in the Marvel Cinematic Universe.[70] In preparation for the role, Nyong'o learned to speak Xhosa and undertook judo, jujitsu, silat, and Filipino martial arts training.[71][72] David Betancourt of The Washington Post wrote that the film \"takes superhero cinema where it's never gone before by not being afraid to embrace its blackness\" and particularly praised Nyong'o for avoiding stereotypical depictions of a black leading lady, stating that she \"throws punches, shoots guns and steals hearts in a role she seems born for.\"[73] Black Panther grossed over $1.34 billion worldwide to emerge as the eleventh highest-grossing film of all time.[74] Nyong'o received a Saturn Award for Best Actress nomination for the role.[75]\n\nFollowing the success of Black Panther, Nyong'o starred as a kindergarten teacher dealing with a zombie apocalypse in the comedy horror film Little Monsters (2019).

It tells the story of a family who are confronted by their doppelg\u00e4ngers.[77][78] Emily Yoshida of Vulture labelled Nyong'o's dual role \"astounding\" and found her performance as the doppelg\u00e4nger \"an achievement on another level; a physical, vocal, and emotional performance so surgical in its uncanniness that it almost feels like it could not be the work of a flesh-and-blood human.\"[79] Us grossed over $255 million worldwide against its $20 million budget.[80] At Universal Studios Hollywood's Halloween Horror Nights, Nyong'o attended a maze inspired by the film and appeared inside the attraction dressed as her character Red.[81] Nyong'o earned a Screen Actors Guild nomination for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Leading Role and won an NAACP Image Award for Best Actress.[82]\n\nAlso in 2019, Nyong'o narrated the Discovery Channel documentary series Serengeti, about wildlife in the Serengeti ecosystem.[83][84] Nyong'o spoke on the lack of African women narrating nature documentaries and how the Serengeti team encouraged her to use her native Kenyan accent on the series.
