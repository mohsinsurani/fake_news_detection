Kylie Jenner has a roommate, but it\u2019s not her boyfriend and daughter\u2019s father, Travis Scott.\n\nWhile filming a makeup tutorial for Vogue, the Kylie Cosmetics creator revealed that she\u2019s playing house with best friend Jordyn Woods, who she loves trying out her new products on.\n\n\u201cI test out most of my stuff on Jordyn because we live together, So I\u2019m like, \u2018Jordyn, I need you.\u2019 Everyone that comes in my house has tinted red arms from swatches and shadows,\u201d Jenner teased on Wednesday, June 27.\n\nAlthough Jenner is not currently shacking up with her rapper beau, 26, a source previously told Us Weekly that the duo are thriving as parents to Stormi Webster. \u201cIt\u2019s amazing how much Stormi has brought them together and brought the entire family together with Kylie and Travis,\u201d the insider raved exclusively to Us in May. \u201cKylie is loving being a mother. Stormi is the light of her life. Travis is a great dad \u2014 he\u2019s doting on her and loves holding her. He\u2019s been really supportive, wants to be there for all the milestones. He\u2019s been moving work commitments to spend as much time as he can around Stormi.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGoosebumps\u201d rapper and the Life of Kylie star love hanging with Woods too. Earlier this month, the threesome jetted off to Cannes, France, together to support Scott\u2019s performance at the Spotify beach party. In fact, Woods spends so much time around the couple that she teased on Twitter in April she\u2019s \u201ccoming down with some form of [baby] fever.\u201d\n\nJenner showed her appreciation for the model back in March when she flaunted a ring with the initials \u201cJW\u201d to honor both Woods and Scott, whose real name is Jacques Webster.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kylie-jenner12.jpg?crop=207px%2C8px%2C1752px%2C920px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kylie-jenner12.jpg?crop=182px%2C14px%2C1693px%2C957px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kylie-jenner12.jpg?crop=207px%2C8px%2C1752px%2C920px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/kylie-jenner-reveals-she-lives-with-bff-jordyn-woods/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Reveals She Lives With BFF Jordyn Woods", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kylie Jenner subtly revealed that she lives with her best friend, Jordyn Woods, while shooting a makeup tutorial on Wednesday, June 27 \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Wait, What?
