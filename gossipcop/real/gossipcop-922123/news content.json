It is unclear how many people bought tickets for the show, but the venue can hold up to 19,500 people, NJ.com reports.\n\n\u201cSad to announce that we need to reschedule the show tonight in Newark due to the extreme weather conditions,\u201d Lovato tweeted.\n\nThe show, part of the singer\u2019s \u201cTell Me You Love Me\u201d tour with DJ Khaled, has been rescheduled for April 2.\n\nTimberlake later tweeted that his Madison Square Garden show Wednesday night has been postponed to an unknown date. He still expects to perform at his Thursday show.\n\n\u201cHey y\u2019all, so sorry so announce the show tonight at the Garden has been postponed due to the weather, as you can see,\u201d Timberlake said in a video tweet, showing snow piling up on the ground around him. \u201cMan, I\u2019m bummed.\u201d\n\nThe singer ended with a rhetorical question, noting it\u2019s not even winter anymore: \u201cHappy spring, everybody?\u201d\n\nThe Garden holds about 20,000 people. It is not clear how many were purchased for Wednesday\u2019s show.\n\nTimberlake\u2019s tour kicked off this month and supports his new album, \u201cMan of the Woods,\u201d released days before he headlined this year\u2019s Super Bowl halftime show.\n\nWednesday\u2019s storm could dump more than a foot of snow across the region. Multiple crashes have been reported, including a fatal wreck on Long Island, and commuters have faced delays on public transit.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/gettyimages-801510124-1.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-172595869.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2016/06/gettyimages-55885330.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/lovato-timberlake.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1200", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-464332459.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=18314522&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/http://s2.wp.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/post-flair/sharing/images/loading.gif?m=1315610318h", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-914318838.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/selfie1.png?w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/dywt9vux4aagwtu.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/snow.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/promo344574415.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2016/10/gettyimages-162641583.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-914304122.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/am-nam-total-snowfall.png?w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/kb-toys-toys-r-us-toy-stores-brands-chains.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-874575348.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2016/04/300x250_newsalerts.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2017/01/gettyimages-462346110.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/01/gettyimages-901184642.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2016/03/untitled-design-27.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://s0.wp.com/wp-content/themes/vip/localtv-2/img/wpix/logo-gray.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2017/11/school-bus.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/gettyimages-464332459.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/02/gettyimages-624329236.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=370&h=204&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/mta-worker-hit-by-train.jpeg?quality=85&strip=all&w=109&h=60&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203im_/https://tribwpix.files.wordpress.com/2018/03/lovato-timberlake.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Soley-Cerro"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180321203203/http://pix11.com/2018/03/21/noreaster-forces-justin-timberlake-demi-lovato-to-postpone-nyc-newark-concerts/", "title": "Nor\u2019easter forces Justin Timberlake, Demi Lovato to postpone NYC, Newark concerts", "meta_data": {"apple-itunes-app": "app-id=587593522", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "description": "NEW YORK \u2014 A nor'easter storm slamming the tri-state Wednesday has caused crashes, closures and now the postponement of at least two major concerts in the area.
