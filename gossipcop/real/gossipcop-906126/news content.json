I mean, we\u2019ve all operated with a certain amount of tone deafness, and I like the culpability, and we have to have restorative justice.\u201d\n\nJudd continued, adding the importance of men and women coming together.\n\n\"This is about men and women being all together and having a more equitable and just workplace, home life, social spaces. I mean, we know that when women are empowered in the workplace and are in decision-making positions that workplaces have better financial outcomes and there's less harassment when there is more diversity. And it takes that kind of individual accountability to collectively make the change on a large scale.\"\n\nFranco addressed the allegations against him during an interview with Stephen Colbert on The Late Show Tuesday.\n\n\"I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I\u2019ve done,\" Franco said. \"The things I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn\u2019t have a voice for so long. So, I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way. It's, I think, a good thing, and I support it.\"\n\nThe following day, the Los Angeles Times published a bombshell report in which five women accused him of sexually exploitative behavior.\n\nThe full interview with Judd airs on BBC World News on Sunday at 6:30 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/67dd58e32d559281f74cfbbc6e7832db12f05bd4/c=0-354-3247-2795/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366818819056423-GTY-822373658.jpg?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/248d15d167b48a740fba1160bc2ee7e8fe6831cd/c=0-802-3247-2636/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366818819056423-GTY-822373658.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/248d15d167b48a740fba1160bc2ee7e8fe6831cd/c=0-802-3247-2636/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366818819056423-GTY-822373658.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/13/ashley-judd-calls-james-francos-sexual-misconduct-allegation-response-terrific/1031261001/", "title": "Ashley Judd calls James Franco's sexual misconduct allegation response 'terrific'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/01/13/ashley-judd-calls-james-francos-sexual-misconduct-allegation-response-terrific/1031261001/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ashley Judd calls James Franco's sexual misconduct allegation response 'terrific'", "description": "In an\\u00a0interview clip with\\u00a0HARDtalk's Stephen Sackur Friday, the actress praised Franco for being accountable\\u00a0for his actions.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/248d15d167b48a740fba1160bc2ee7e8fe6831cd/c=0-802-3247-2636/local/-/media/2017/07/26/USATODAY/USATODAY/636366818819056423-GTY-822373658.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "In an\\u00a0interview clip with\\u00a0HARDtalk's Stephen Sackur Friday, the actress praised Franco for being accountable\\u00a0for his actions.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515801600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
