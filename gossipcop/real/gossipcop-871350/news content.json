We care for each other very much, hope you respect our privacy during this sad time!\u201d\n\nThough the former countess, 52, remained strong both before and during her seven months as Mrs. D\u2019Agostino (even forgiving her then-fianc\u00e9 for kissing a Playboy model at New York\u2019s Regency Hotel the day before their Palm Beach engagement party), the signs seemed clear watching the series that Tom wasn\u2019t looking to give up his bachelor status anytime soon, no matter what Luann said.\n\nJimi Celeste/Patrick McMullan/Getty\n\nAnd yet weeks after the wedding, Tom, 50, was caught in a hot mic moment calling himself a \u201cdog with a collar\u201d while chatting with an ex at a party.\n\nWednesday\u2019s season finale appears to provide even more proof. In a sneak peek clip released Wednesday, Tom reunites in conversation with his ex Missy \u2014 who previously appeared this season and revealed she was dating Tom when she learned he was engaged to Luann \u2014 at a party thrown by Tinsley Mortimer in honor of Sonja Morgan.\n\n\u201cThe last time I saw Missy \u2026,\u201d Tom can be heard saying at the event, as Missy encourages him to tell the story.\n\n\u201cI gotta unplug this thing,\u201d he adds, fumbling with this body microphone. \u201cDe-mic!\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Sonja Morgan Teases Luann\u2019s \u2018Sadness\u2019 on RHONY Season Finale\n\nSo was that the beginning of the end? Morgan sure thinks so.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see tonight in Luann\u2019s face that she\u2019s not so defensive any more about Tom,\u201d she told PEOPLE Now during an appearance on Monday. \u201cThere\u2019s sadness there. The wheels are moving, and it\u2019s starting to click for her, and then at the reunion there\u2019s some conversations that go on that really had me worried.\u201d\n\nLuann, meanwhile, continues to maintain that Tom remained faithful to her during their marriage. \u201cI do not think Tom cheated on me, definitely not,\u201d she told Page Six on Friday. \u201cGod knows he\u2019s got himself in some trouble in the past, but I don\u2019t believe that continued [while we were married].\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was impossible, we were having problems and we tried really hard to fix things, and we finally came to the conclusion it was just not going to work,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt was a tough decision and we are both very sad about it. But the truth is we just weren\u2019t getting along.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of New York City finale airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "images":
