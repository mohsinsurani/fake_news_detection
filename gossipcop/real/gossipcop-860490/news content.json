The show premiered at the Bank of America Theatre on December 19, 2012, after a week of previews.[14] The production was well received and closed on October 6, 2013.[15] Critics lauded Platt's performance, calling him a \"true revelation in this brand new Chicago production... He really leans into this part, throwing himself out there with the abandonment of youth\".[16] Platt later reprised his role as Elder Cunningham on Broadway at the Eugene O'Neill Theatre from January 7, 2014, to January 6, 2015.[17]\n\n2015\u20132017: Film work and Dear Evan Hansen [ edit ]\n\nIn 2012, Platt had a supporting role in the musical comedy Pitch Perfect, loosely based on the non-fiction book Pitch Perfect: The Quest for Collegiate A Cappella Glory. Platt played the magic-loving Benji Applebaum, alongside an ensemble cast comprising Anna Kendrick, Skylar Astin, Rebel Wilson, Adam DeVine, Anna Camp, and Brittany Snow. The film emerged as a major commercial success and received mostly positive reviews from critics. He was subsequently nominated for a Teen Choice Award in the category Choice Movie: Male Scene Stealer for his work.[18] In 2015, Platt reprised his role as Benji Applebaum in the sequel, Pitch Perfect 2, followed by appearances in the films Ricki and the Flash and Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\n\nPlatt became attached to Steven Levenson and Pasek and Paul's then Untitled P&P Project in 2014, participating in early read-throughs and workshops.[19] By 2015, the musical, titled Dear Evan Hansen, had begun production in Washington, D.C. at the Arena Stage with Platt originating the titular role. The show premiered on July 9, 2015, and closed August 23, 2015.[20] The overwhelming positive reception toward the production and Platt's performance resulted in the show being transferred to Off-Broadway.[21]\n\nIn 2016, Platt once again originated the role of Evan Hansen at Second Stage Theatre. Platt and the cast played a month of previews, beginning on March 26, 2016, before premiering on May 1, 2016.

The film premiered at the Santa Barbara International Film Festival on April 1, 2021, and was released in the United States on July 23, 2021.[34][35][36]\n\nIn January 2019, Platt announced that his debut studio album Sing to Me Instead was scheduled for release on March 29, 2019.

The project is set to be shot over the course of twenty years, with principal photography of the first sequence of the film having already been completed prior to the announcement.[41]\n\nPlatt currently stars as Payton Hobart on the Netflix comedy-drama series The Politician, which tells the story of a very driven teen convinced that he's destined to become President of the United States.[42] Platt's casting was announced in March 2018,[43] and the series premiered on September 27, 2019.[44] He received a Golden Globe Award nomination for Best Actor \u2013 Television Series Musical or Comedy for his performance in the series' first season.[45]\n\nPlatt released a new single, \"So Will I\", on May 8, 2020.[46] On May 20, 2020, Platt released Sing to Me Instead (Deluxe), which includes \"So Will I\", \"Rain\", and six songs recorded live at Radio City Music Hall, including cover versions of Brandi Carlile's \"The Joke\" and Elton John's \"Take Me to the Pilot\".[47] On June 8, 2020, Platt released \"Everything I Did to Get to You\", a new single written by David Davis, which he picked as the winner of his episode of NBC's songwriting competition show Songland.[48]\n\n2021: Reverie and other projects [ edit ]\n\nIn April 2021, Platt teased the chorus of his new single, \"Imagine\", on TikTok. The complete song was released on April 23, 2021, followed by a remix by Dutch electronic producer Ti\u00ebsto on May 28, 2021.[49][50] In July, he announced on Twitter that his second studio album, Reverie, for which \"Imagine\" was released as its first single, will be released on August 13, 2021. Its second single, \"Happy to Be Sad\", was released on July 16, 2021.[51] The \u201cReverie\u201d tour was announced on August 13, 2021, spanning 27 stops in North America beginning February 23, 2022 and concluding at the Hollywood Bowl on April 8, 2022.[52] The tour was later postponed due to the COVID pandemic and rescheduled to begin on September 3, 2022, in Seattle, Washington before concluding in Hollywood, Florida on October 7, 2022, for a total of 20 stops.[53]\n\nOn June 25, 2021, Platt released a cover version of the song \"Yo\u00fc and I\" by Lady Gaga, as part of the tenth anniversary of the Born This Way album.\n\nOn November 29, 2018, it was announced that Universal Pictures and Platt's father, Marc Platt, secured the film rights to Dear Evan Hansen.[54] On June 18, 2020, Platt confirmed that he was set to reprise his role as Evan Hansen in the film, which would be directed by Stephen Chbosky from a screenplay by Levenson. It premiered as the Opening Night Gala Presentation of the 2021 Toronto International Film Festival on September 9, 2021, followed by a release in theaters on September 24, 2021, in time for Platt's 28th birthday.[55][56][57] Upon the release of the film's first trailer on May 18, 2021, the casting of Platt as Evan Hansen and the appearance of the film's version of the character received substantial criticism, with viewers commenting that he, at age 27, was too old to play a high schooler. Platt, however, dismissed the response, comparing his age to those of actors who played high school students in the 1978 film Grease.[58] On August 8, 2021, the criticism against the casting went even further, with emerging claims that nepotism was involved in the decision. In an interview with Zach Sang on his YouTube talk show, Platt said \"I think the reaction is largely from people who don\u2019t understand the context of the piece \u2014 the fact that I created the role and workshopped it for three years ... Were I not to do the movie, it probably wouldn\u2019t get made. And so, I think, my defensive response is to want to go onto Twitter and be like, 'F you, guys. You don\u2019t even know that this wouldn\u2019t exist without me.' Of course, that's not true entirely and not my place to say. All I have to do is let the work speak for itself.\"[59] His on-screen performance, as well as the film itself, received a negative reception from critics upon release, leading him to a nomination for Worst Actor at the 42nd Golden Raspberry Awards in 2022.[60]\n\nOn March 2, 2021, it was announced that Platt was in talks to star in the film adaptation of Grant Ginder's novel The People We Hate at the Wedding. His casting was announced on July 8, 2021, along with Amazon Studios being confirmed to produce the film. The film began production in September 2021.[61][62]\n\nOn May 17, 2022, it was announced that Platt would play Leo Frank in New York City Center's production of Parade as the gala production of its 2022/2023 season after playing the role in a workshop conducted by Roundabout Theatre Company in 2018.[63][64]\n\nOn June 9, 2022, it was announced that Platt would star in the musical comedy film Theater Camp, inspired by the 2020 short film of the same name co-written with Noah Galvin, Molly Gordon, and Nick Lieberman.[65][66]\n\nOn August 31, 2022, prior to kicking off the Reverie Tour, Platt confirmed that he was working on new solo music and was a third of the way through completing his next album.[67]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nPlatt is gay. He told his family when he was thirteen years old, and publicly came out in 2019, before the release of his song \"Ease My Mind\".[68][69] On January 12, 2020, Platt began a relationship with Noah Galvin (who replaced him in the titular role in Dear Evan Hansen).[70][71]\n\nActing credits [ edit ]\n\nTheatre [ edit ]\n\nFilm [ edit ]\n\nTelevision [ edit ]\n\nDiscography [ edit ]\n\nStudio albums [ edit ]\n\nSoundtrack and cast albums [ edit ]\n\nSingles [ edit ]\n\nPromotional singles [ edit ]\n\nOther charted and certified songs [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ \"Rain\" was included on the deluxe edition of Sing to Me Instead ^ \"So Will I\" was included on the deluxe edition of Sing to Me Instead ^ Billboard Hot 100, but did peak at number 47 on the [96] \"So Will I\" did not enter theHot 100, but did peak at number 47 on the Digital Song Sales chart. ^ Billboard Hot 100, but did peak at number 34 on the [96] \"Everything I Did to Get to You\" did not enter theHot 100, but did peak at number 34 on the Digital Song Sales chart.\n\nTours [ edit ]\n\nAwards [ edit ]\n\nDear Evan Hansen cast member Platt and fellowcast member Rachel Bay Jones with their Tony Awards\n\nPlatt was nominated for an Outer Critics Circle Award, a Drama League Distinguished Performance Award, and won[99] the Obie Award[100] for Distinguished Performance by an Actor and Lucille Lortel Award for Outstanding Lead Actor in a Musical for Dear Evan Hansen's Off-Broadway run in 2016.[101]\n\nOn May 19, 2017, at the 83rd annual Drama League Awards, it was announced that Platt had won the organization's Distinguished Performance Award.
