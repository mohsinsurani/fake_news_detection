Around 10 p.m. the restaurant owner asked Kirsten Jennings, one of the brides, if a surprise guest could attend the reception.\n\n\"The owner came up to me, and he said, 'Hey, is it okay if Kristen Stewart and her girlfriend Stella [Maxwell] come and have a few drinks with you guys?' and I was like, 'Yeah, totally! Yeah, no problem. Um, who is that?'\" the bride told CBC News.\n\nWe\u2019re not 100 percent sure WHY Stewart and Maxwell wanted to attend the wedding, but we know that Stewart knew the restaurant owner from a recent event in Winnipeg. Stewart and Maxwell reportedly stayed from 10 p.m. to 1 a.m., you know, as you do.\n\nThe DJ even got footage of Stewart dancing with everyone.\n\nThe brides were incredibly accommodating, and added that Stewart and Maxwell, \u201clooked just like two normal girls. They look a little Hollywood, but if we didn\u2019t know who they were, I don\u2019t know if I would have known.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe said \u2018Hey, you know. Come on and meet your guests and, you know, don\u2019t segregate yourselves. Come and party,\u2019\u201d she continued.\n\nSo random. We\u2019re wondering if Stewart is acting in or directing a movie about crashing Canadian weddings and stopped by for \u201cresearch.\u201d\n\nRegardless, party on K. Stew.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/07/25/kirstenstella.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/07/25/kirstenstella.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/07/25/kirstenstella.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Vanderberg"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/kristen-stewart-stella-maxwell-crashed-a-wedding/", "title": "Kristen Stewart and her GF crashed a wedding, but the bride had no idea who they were - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kristen Stewart and Stella Maxwell crashed a wedding in Winnipeg, Canada.
