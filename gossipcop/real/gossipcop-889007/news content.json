He reportedly settled with five different women for a total of $13 million.\n\nBut according to a bombshell New York Times report published on Sunday, O\u2019Reilly settled a sexual harassment suit in January for $32 million \u2014 shortly before Fox News offered him a $100 million contract extension. (O\u2019Reilly has called the report \u201cfalse, defamatory\u201d and \u201canother smear article.\u201d)\n\n\u201cWe already knew that O\u2019Reilly had previously settled five sexual harassment claims,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cNow, it\u2019s come out that it\u2019s an even half-dozen, because it\u2019s being reported that back in January, O\u2019Reilly made another payout to a woman alleging sexual harassment, this one for a record $32 million \u2014 which is exactly the sort of thing you do when you\u2019re innocent.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Times, the multi-million dollar agreement settled sexual harassment allegations raised by former Fox News legal analyst Lis Wiehl, allegedly including \u201crepeated harassment, a nonconsensual sexual relationship and the sending of gay pornography and other sexually explicit material to her.\u201d\n\nO\u2019Reilly pointed out that, ironically, Wiehl was a regular guest on The O\u2019Reilly Factor\u2018s \u201cIs It Legal?\u201d segment.\n\n\u201cAnd the answer, for $32 million \u2014 survey says no, it is not,\u201d Colbert quipped. \u201cThanks for playing. Security will see you out.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Bill O\u2019Reilly Parts Ways with Fox News amid Sexual Harassment Allegations\n\nIn a statement, 21st Century Fox said it was not privy to the amount of the settlement and regarded O\u2019Reilly\u2019s January settlement as a \u201cpersonal issue\u201d between the two parties.\n\n\u201cFox defended keeping Uncle Touch-Too-Much on the payroll, saying they regarded the settlement as a personal issue,\u201d Colbert said.\n\n\u201cYes, whoever O\u2019Reilly harasses and then pays off in his personal time is his own business. It\u2019s a matter between one consenting adult \u2026\u201d he continued, trailing off and pointedly sipping his tea.\n\n\u201cFox News knew about the settlement in January, but then in February they gave him a four-year contract extension that paid $25 million a year,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cHe got a $25 million payout? What did Bill O\u2019Reilly do to Bill O\u2019Reilly?\u201d\n\nColbert went on to say that it was \u201cshocking\u201d that the network allegedly knew about O\u2019Reilly\u2019s settlements yet kept him employed for so long.\n\n\u201cMaybe they were just trying to protect their female employees,\u201d Colbert said. \u201cBecause if Bill\u2019s on camera, that\u2019s one hour a day they knew he\u2019s not groping somebody.\u201d", "images":
