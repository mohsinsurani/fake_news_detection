At eight months pregnant, the fit model has six-pack abs and doesn\u2019t appear to have gained an ounce.\n\nThe 33-year-old showed off her mind-blowing body in an Instagram posted on Tuesday, August 15. In the clip, Stage, who is due in October, performs squats, side-planks and other moves while her son, James Hunter, 2, plays nearby.\n\nBut the purpose of the video was to blast commenters for saying she shouldn\u2019t be working out.\n\n\u201cSince I\u2019ve announced my second pregnancy, I\u2019ve had certain \u2018Instagram medical experts\u2019 tell me what I should and shouldn\u2019t do,\u201d she wrote to her 2.3 million followers. \u201cWhile I find some of the comments hilarious, I choose to only listen to my OBGYN and of course I also listen to MY body. If something feels off, I don\u2019t do it! I always do what\u2019s best for my growing baby and put him first.\u201d\n\nThe stunning 5-foot-8 brunette went on to explain that the only reason she\u2019s working out is for the health benefits. \u201cThere are some people who assume that since I am exercising while pregnant, that I\u2019m obsessed with how I \u2018look,\u2019\u201d she shared. \u201cBut in fact I\u2019m obsessed with maintaining a healthy lifestyle that will give my baby and myself the best possible quality of life.\u201d\n\n?? Let\u2019s do this #thirdtrimester ! ??bikini: @hotmiamistyles #7monthspregnant A post shared by MY FITNESS E BOOK AVAIL NOW?? (@sarahstage) on Aug 3, 2017 at 10:11am PDT\n\nStage announced her pregnancy on June 16 with a picture that showcased her flat tummy. One month later, she broke the news to Us Weekly that she and her husband, Kris, are expecting another son. \u201cI\u2019ve heard two boys is easy,\u201d she told Us at the time. \u201cI\u2019m excited.\u201d\n\nThe L.A.-based mom has been chronicling her tiny bump on social media. Earlier this month, she Instagrammed a picture of herself at 7 months pregnant in a green bikini, leaving her fans baffled. \u201cWTH? Um, 7 months pregnant? I don\u2019t look like that even when I\u2019m NOT pregnant,\u201d wrote one person.
