On her new page on the British monarchy\u2019s official website \u2014 in pulled out quotes \u2014 the woman now known as the Duchess of Sussex says, \u201cI am proud to be a woman and a feminist,\u201d referencing a line from a 2015 speech she gave at a United Nations event.\n\nHer biography on the site emphasizes her early activism, including how, at age 11, she took on Procter & Gamble for a commercial claiming that \u201cwomen all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.\u201d After Meghan's intervention, the company changed the ad to \u201cpeople all over America.\u201d\n\n\u201cThese early experiences helped to shape her lifelong commitment to causes such as social justice and women\u2019s empowerment,\u201d the website says.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe website also notes her volunteer work at soup kitchens in Los Angeles, her home town, and Toronto, where she filmed \u201cSuits,\u201d as well as her work as a women\u2019s advocate for the United Nations and a global ambassador for World Vision Canada.\n\nMany campaigners here are looking to see whether Meghan dials back her activism upon joining the royal family. On the one hand, she now has a new, global platform. On the other, she will be expected to stay clear of party politics. She once called President Trump a \u201cmisogynist\u201d and posted an anti-Brexit picture on her (now-deleted) Instagram feed. These kinds of political interventions are now a no-no, but many are curious to see whether she will continue to speak out on feminism and racial issues.\n\nAs seen at the wedding ceremony, which included a passionate sermon by the Most Rev. Michael Curry (who seemed to blindside some royals with enthusiastic talk of love and emotion), a gospel choir, a black cellist and a black Church of England priest, Meghan is not downplaying her biracial heritage.\n\nBrixton is a South London neighborhood sometimes called \"the black capital of Europe.\" The Post asked people there what they thought of the royal wedding.

She is said to have thanked Harry and the royals for their kindness and generosity. According to the Daily Mail, Harry responded with a speech of his own, saying \u201cwe make such a great team\u201d and \u201cI can\u2019t wait to spend the rest of my life with you.\u201d (In what is probably another royal first, they reportedly handed out slippers to guests who wanted to swap out their high heels.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nOther royals have actively supported women\u2019s issues. Prince Charles\u2019s wife, Camilla, for instance, is president of the Women of the World Festival and has advocated against domestic violence and female genital mutilation.\n\nBut this is the first time a senior royal has loudly declared herself a feminist on the monarchy\u2019s official Web page.\n\nSome feminists said they hope this is just the beginning.\n\n\u201cI hope as a member of Royal family she still believes in feminism, and will work for women\u2019s equal rights,\u201d tweeted author and feminist Taslima Nasreen.\n\nCarole Easton, chief executive of the Young Women\u2019s Trust, said that it was \u201cfantastic\u201d that Meghan is \u201cso committed to championing women\u2019s rights. Now really is the time for action on this issue.\u201d\n\nRead more:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2018-05-21/Reuters/2018-05-21T120202Z_1325491826_RC16FE2D4560_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-ROYALS-MEGHAN-FEMINIST.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2018-05-21/Reuters/2018-05-21T120202Z_1325491826_RC16FE2D4560_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-ROYALS-MEGHAN-FEMINIST.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Adam"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/05/21/meghan-markle-declares-herself-a-feminist-on-british-monarchys-website/", "title": "Meghan Markle declares herself a feminist on the British monarchy\u2019s website", "meta_data": {"description": "It\u2019s the first time a senior royal has declared herself a feminist on the monarchy's official Web page.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/05/21/meghan-markle-declares-herself-a-feminist-on-british-monarchys-website/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_960w/2010-2019/Wires/Images/2018-05-21/Reuters/2018-05-21T120202Z_1325491826_RC16FE2D4560_RTRMADP_3_BRITAIN-ROYALS-MEGHAN-FEMINIST.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Meghan Markle declares herself a feminist on the British monarchy\u2019s website", "description": "It\u2019s the first time a senior royal has declared herself a feminist on the monarchy's official Web page."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meghan Markle declares herself a feminist on the British monarchy\u2019s website", "description": "It\u2019s the first time a senior royal has declared herself a feminist on the monarchy's official Web page."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-12-01T04:28:03.649Z", "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-21T12:43:45.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-12-01T04:28:03.649Z", "section": "World", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 70, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2018/05/21/meghan-markle-declares-herself-a-feminist-on-british-monarchys-website/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526857200.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
