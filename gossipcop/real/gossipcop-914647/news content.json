Oh, my God. Brandi, that\u2019s horrible,\u201d Manigault Newman said.\n\nHowever, the former White House aide appeared to hint that another person was having sexual relations with people in the White House.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s someone in the White House that\u2019s sleeping with everybody, but she is not me\u2026 I\u2019ve never had to do that,\u201d she replied.\n\nOMAROSA ON \u2018CELEBRITY BIG BROTHER\u2019: TRUMP TWEETS HAUNTED ME, HAD TO \u2018SERVE\u2019 MY COUNTRY\n\nGlanville said she asked her the question because she heard rumors some \u201cCelebrity Apprentice\u201d contestants had sexual relationships with Trump when he was the show\u2019s host.\n\nManigault Newman asked Glanville if she ever heard her name in the rumors.\n\n\u201cNo. He seemed to like you so much, I was just wondering,\u201d Glanville replied.\n\nManigault Newman snapped back, \u201cGod no, I\u2019m just ratings gold.\u201d\n\nSince the \u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d premiere, Manigault Newman has continued to dominate the headlines with her remarks about her time in the Trump White House. Earlier this month, she tearfully confessed to being \u201chaunted\u201d by Trump\u2019s tweets.\n\n\u201cI was haunted by tweets every single day,\u201d she told contestant Ross Matthews. \u201cWhat is he going to tweet next?\u201d\n\nIn a Feb.12 episode, she trashed Vice President Mike Pence, calling him \u201cscary.\u201d\n\n\u201cCan I just say this, as bad as you all think Trump is, you\u2019d be worried about Pence. Everybody that\u2019s wishing for impeachment might want to reconsider their lives,\u201d she said. \u201cYou would be begging for days of Trump back if Pence became president. He\u2019s extreme. I\u2019m Christian, I love Jesus. But he thinks Jesus tells him to say things, and I\u2019m like, \u2018Jesus didn\u2019t say that.\u2019 Scary.\u201d\n\nOn Dec. 13, the White House announced Manigault Newman\u2019s last day with the administration would be on Jan. 20, 2018 after she reportedly drew scrutiny from White House Chief of Staff John Kelly.\n\n\u201cCelebrity Big Brother\u201d airs on CBS.", "images":
