Edgar Ramirez will play Versace, while Darren Criss will play Cunanan. It is based in part on Maureen Orth\u2019s 1999 book \u201cVulgar Favors: Andrew Cunanan, Gianni Versace, and the Largest Failed Manhunt in US History.\u201d\n\nDuring the show\u2019s panel at the Television Critics Association winter press tour, executive producer Tom Rob Smith acknowledged that the writers had to fill in gaps in certain parts of the story, such as the events surrounding the deaths of Cunanan\u2019s other victims, but pushed back against the idea that the events of the series were exaggerated.\n\n\u201cWe have these tiny points of truth, and you try to connect the tissue between them, but I would never use the term \u2019embellish,\u2019\u201d Smith said.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2015/07/logo-variety.png?w=104", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/3_acs_1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/3_acs_1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/3_acs_1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson", "January"], "canonical_link": "http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/american-crime-story-assassination-of-gianni-versace-family-fx-1202657017/", "title": "Versace family: \u2018American Crime Story\u2019 is a \u2018work of fiction\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
