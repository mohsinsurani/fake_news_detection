None of them saw it coming and everyone was completely blindsided by the decision,\u201d a source close to production tells Daily Mail Online.\n\nThe cast was also taken aback because, as Loni Love stated in her video response, all five cast members had just completed a new photo shoot for images that were supposed to be used to promote their upcoming third season.\n\nThe group was also scheduled to fly to New Orleans together over the July 4th weekend for a rare off-season multi-day taping to occur at this year\u2019s Essence Festival, where they were scheduled to film episodes of their show and premiere them when they returned in September.\n\nBut an alleged flagrant Braxton error in judgement derailed that those plans. The show\u2019s executive producer is said to have cursed her out in earshot of other staffers on set a few weeks ago, after Braxton reportedly sulked over losing a game during the taping, the Daily Mail reports.\n\n\u201cIt was an ugly scene. Pinterest was sponsoring the segment and Tamar was genuinely upset she was losing the game.\n\n\u2018She really acted out during the taping in front of the studio audience and then exploded behind the scenes once the show was done.\n\nProducers had to heavily edit the segment to make it presentable to air on TV, but the sponsor was on set for the segment and witnessed it all,\u201d the source explains. (you can read it in its entirety here).\n\nAccording to production staff, the newspaper continues, Braxton\u2019s outbursts on set were frequent and she regularly blew up at the executive producer and oftentimes her husband, prolific producer Vincent Hubert and/or her co-hosts would have to work to put out the flames.\n\n\u201cLet\u2019s just say she was becoming unbearable to work with,\u201d the source said.\n\nBut the move to finally ax Braxton probably came when she took time off of \u201cThe Real\u201d to contend on \u201cDancing with the Stars\u201d that producers realized the show could survive without her.\n\nFirst off, there was peace on set and, most importantly, the ratings maintained and at times, went up depending on whom was guest co-hosting the show, the source explained.\n\nAfter Telepictures received a two-year renewal of \u2018The Real\u2019 on all Fox stations and on BET where it re-airs, execs reportedly wanted to see what they could do to make the show better for Seasons 3 and 4.\n\nHere came the focus groups.\n\nThe research from the focus group was also a major factor in the decision to fire Braxton. She did doesn\u2019t score well with educated women, The Daily Mail reports:\n\n\u2018The focus group research showed that most educated and working women did not identify with Tamar\u2019s show vernacular and her use of words known to be popular among drag queens and some gay men \u2013 phrases like \u201cget your life,\u201d \u201cwhere they do that at,\u201d \u201chave several seats.\u201d\n\n\u2018It was even said she seemed more suited to be a judge on RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race on Logo instead of a talk show host on The Real,\u2019 revealed the source.\n\n\u2018The research went on to say that most educated and working women found her to be \u2018ghetto\u2019 and that her aggressive eye-rolling, neck-rolling and the smacking of her mouth were indicative of \u2018stereotypical behavior that African American women have worked years to overcome,\u201d the source continued.\n\nThe Real\u2019s executive producer used the aforementioned reasons (the focus group findings, on-set insubordination and the sales team issues about advertisers not wanting Braxton in their segments) to convince Warner Bros. to give Braxton the boot!\n\nVince Herbert, Braxton\u2019s husband and manager, was kept in the dark about these decision to get rid of his wife.\n\n\u201cHe knew they were having problems with her and he shielded Tamar from a lot of what was being said and done, but in the end his producer credit on the show was more about vanity and less about control,\u201d the source revealed.\n\nFor the record, Warner Bros. wanted to work out an exit agreement with Braxton that wouldn\u2019t make viewers aware she was being fired but before they could hammer out a joint statement and an agreement that was good for both parties, Tamar had already posted that cryptic message on IG about betrayal and an unnamed person who she feels \u2018stabbed\u2019 her \u2018in the back.\u2019\n\n\u2018It\u2019s that type of impulsive behavior and lack of self control that is why she is off the show,\u2019 the source said.", "images": ["https://atlantadailyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/05/13320033_1055204587852374_641869300_n.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/b48259fd3b7c656eeb5914f48637ff3b?s=150&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://atlantadailyworld.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/5/2016/05/13320033_1055204587852374_641869300_n.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://atlantadailyworld.com/2016/05/27/3-real-reasons-why-tamar-braxton-was-fired-from-the-real/", "title": "3 \u2018real\u2019 reasons why Tamar Braxton was fired from \u2018The Real\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "3 'real' reasons why Tamar Braxton was fired from 'The Real' | Atlanta Daily World", "description": "Some disturbing, but not surprising, news is billowing out from the set of \u201cThe Real\u201d like smoke from an extinguished fire.
