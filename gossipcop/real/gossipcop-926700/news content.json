She wore a black strapless dress with a choker necklace.\n\nOther A-list guests included Cameron Diaz and her husband Benji Madden, Julia Roberts and her husband Danny Moder, Demi Moore, Reese Witherspoon, Steven Spielberg, Liv Tyler and Kate Hudson, who wore a ruffly yellow dress over her baby bump.\n\nPhotographer Group / Splash News\n\nGwyneth Paltrow\n\nPhotographer Group / Splash News\n\nDemi Moore\n\nPhotographer Group / Splash News\n\nCameron Diaz and Benji Madden\n\nPhotographer Group / Splash News\n\nJennifer Aniston\n\nPhotographer Group / Splash News\n\nKate Hudson\n\nPhotographer Group / Splash News\n\nLiv Tyler and Dave Gardner\n\nPhotographer Group / Splash News\n\nReese Witherspoon\n\nSome celebrities shared snaps on social media from the festivities. Jen Meyer posted a selfie with Sara Foster captioned, \u201cSaturday night and we\u2019re all off to celebrate our favorite couple,\u201d tagging Paltrow and Falchuk.\n\nChelsea Handler showed off her look for the celebration, a black long-sleeved dress with shoulder details, in a Boomerang on Instagram, while Jerry Seinfeld\u2019s wife Jessica used the event as an excuse to dress up in purple sequins.\n\nGiancarlo Giammetti of Valentino also sent well wishes to the couple from afar.\n\n\u201cThese two beauties inside and out get engaged tomorrow!!!\u201d he captioned a photo of the couple. \u201cAll my best wishes my dear @gwynethpaltrowand @bradfalchuk love you and miss not to be there with you!!!\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bhkt85ODaus/?taken-by=jimmypagezoso\n\nPage Six reports the black-tie party was thrown by Ryan Murphy, who has worked with Falchuk to create Glee, American Horror Story and Scream Queens. A fan also shared a photo of the Los Angeles Theatre\u2019s marquee reading \u201cBF LOVES GP\u201d to Instagram.\n\nThe Goop founder arrived in the Mexican beach hotspot earlier this week with a few of her closest girlfriends in tow for bachelorette festivities at the not-yet-open Four Seasons Costa Palmas resort. A source told PEOPLE they had a schedule packed with fun outings.\n\n\u201cGwyneth arrived in Cabo Wednesday with a group of girlfriends, including Stella McCartney, for her bachelorette party,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe looked ecstatic. They have many fun activities planned, including pool time, spa and fun dinners.\u201d\n\nPaltrow and Falchuk announced their engagement in January after three years of dating. The couple shared their happy news with a sweet shot on the cover of Goop Magazine\u2019s Sex & Love issue. The mother of two debuted her massive sapphire engagement ring that same month at the Producers Guild Awards.\n\nPaltrow previously opened up about her upcoming nuptials, saying she was excited to plan her wedding.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about everything!\u201d she told PEOPLE. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wedding before. [Paltrow and ex-husband Chris Martin eloped in 2003.] So even though I\u2019m 45, I sort of feel like a 21-year-old.\u201d", "images":
