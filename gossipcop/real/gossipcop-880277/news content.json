She was decked out in a plunging emerald silk gown with a thigh-high slit \u2013 and true to her style, the singer\u2019s sleeves featured some bling. Her long, blond locks were worn wavy and flowing.\n\nRapper Jay-Z appeared at her side in black-tie with a suit and bow tie. The couple\u2019s twins were born almost 13 weeks ago, and their daughter Blue Ivy is five years old.\n\nThe \u201cCrazy In Love\u201d singer also paused for a pic with Rihanna, who was decked out in a black gown with long sleeves and a high-low train, along with diamond accessories. The event was the third annual Clara Lionel Foundation\u2019s Diamond Ball. Rihanna founded the nonprofit organization in 2012, to benefit poor communities around the globe by providing healthcare and education.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 and Rihanna reunited at the #DiamondBall! pic.twitter.com/QwCVqR4E5h \u2014 Pop Crave (@PopCrave) September 15, 2017\n\nRihanna played the role of bartender at Thursday\u2019s ball. \u201cThe more you drink, the more inspired you\u2019ll be to donate money \u2026 and help kids around the world,\u201d she said.\n\nIt was a busy day for Queen Bey, who also attended Broadway show \u201cDear Evan Hanson\u201d before the ball. The show\u2019s star, Ben Platt, took to Twitter to share a pic of himself meeting the 36-year-old singer backstage. \u201cIt happened,\u201d he tweeted, along with the snap.\n\nAnother cast member from the play, Kristolyn Lloyd, posted a photo on Instagram of a group of cast members with the singer, captioned, \u201cHi I met her. K bye\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZC5rW2lT-2/\n\nBeyonce made her first public appearance after giving birth to the twins back in July, when she attended Jay-Z at an event honoring Roc Nation artist Vic Mensa in Los Angeles.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Beyonce-2.jpg?w=1200", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Beyonce-2-1.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Beyonce-2.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Beyonce-2.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Bennett"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/beyonce-makes-1st-appearance-since-giving-birth-see-her-dazzling-outfit.html/", "title": "Beyonce Makes 1st Appearance Since Giving Birth | See Her Dazzling Outfit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Beyonce attended Rihanna\u2019s charity Diamond Ball event Thursday with husband Jay-Z, for her first red carpet appearance since giving birth to twins.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Beyonce Makes 1st Appearance Since Giving Birth | See Her Dazzling Outfit", "description": "Beyonce attended Rihanna\u2019s charity Diamond Ball event Thursday with husband Jay-Z, for her first red carpet appearance since giving birth to twins.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/beyonce-makes-1st-appearance-since-giving-birth-see-her-dazzling-outfit.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Beyonce-2.jpg?w=1200"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "published_time": "2017-09-15T23:10:27+00:00"}, "author": "Karen Bennett", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cheatsheet", "site": "@cheatsheet", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Karen Bennett", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505517027.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
