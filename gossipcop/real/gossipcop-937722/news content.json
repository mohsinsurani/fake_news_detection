Literally the most interesting part of this season has been watching Cary Fetman ruin Becca\u2019s life one sequined evening gown at a time. But shit is about to get a whole lot juicier because this just in, people: there are reports that Becca thinks she might have picked the wrong guy. In other news, the sky is blue!\n\nThis information is shocking for a lot of reasons, but mostly because if you\u2019ll recall, at the start of this season Becca casually announced that she is in fact engaged and, like, soooo in love. Which, in hindsight, should have been a huge red fucking flag. Announcing your engagement before you\u2019ve even watched your fianc\u00e9 openly weep in front of cameras about not getting chosen for a date one week is like the equivalent of some girl posting an #MCM tribute on Instagram before finding out her boyfriend is best friends with his mom. Yeah, it was never going to last.\n\nSo, like, what went wrong? Here\u2019s what we know: A source told Life & Style that Becca is officially \u201cnot thinking about a wedding\u201d and \u201creally has regrets\u201d about the guy she chose. Apparently while we\u2019ve been watching the moving car crash that is this season of The Bachelorette, Becca has been sneaking around behind the scenes with her new man, only to find out that she actually doesn\u2019t know him at all. Considering the men she had to choose from were floor-shitting sex offenders, hateful meme likers, and just generally fame whores, color me SHOCKED that things aren\u2019t working out for her.\n\nSpeaking of the flaming piles of garbage masquerading as human men, after watching this season and finding out that ABC is worse at running a background check than I am at balancing a checkbook, Becca is reportedly starting to think her instincts were off when she chose to spend the rest of her life with one of these dudes. Imagine that!\n\nA source told Life&StyleMag.com that Becca \u201cthought was the right choice from what she knew of him during filming\u201d and that \u201che charmed her, she fell in love and she thought she could imagine forever with him.\u201d Which, like, makes sense if you think about who her frontrunners are right now.\n\nFirst, we have Garrett, who seems down-to-earth but who also likes homophobic, racist, women-hating memes in his downtime. We can\u2019t have it all, ladies! Then there\u2019s Colton, who I\u2019m starting to think is trying to auction off his virginity to any person with the most Instagram followers. Jason and Blake are definitely the least disgusting of the four, but Jason looks like a used car salesman and Blake is needier than me after I post a thirst-trap picture of myself to Instagram and my ex doesn\u2019t like it immediately. I mean, after breaking it down like that, I think I\u2019d rather spend the rest of my life drinking $10 rose while watching The Cutting Edge: Fire & Ice over and over again than then with any of these guys, but to each their own.\n\nThe source also said that Becca \u201cdoesn\u2019t think she had enough of an open mind with the other guys\u201d and spent too much time being obsessed with the winner. So what I\u2019m hearing here is BECCA YOU SHOULD HAVE PICKED WILLS YOU DUMB HOE. I\u2019m sorry that was uncalled for, but you should have picked Wills you dumb hoe fucked up, Becs. That\u2019s all I\u2019ll say.\n\nAnd this. I\u2019ll just leave this here.\n\nNext Monday is Hometowns, and I for one cannot wait to watch all the red flags Becca apparently missed as I drink cheap wine and mock her for putting herself out there from the safety of my own home. Should be a good time!\n\nImages: Giphy (2)", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=588217684700940&ev=PageView\n\t\t&noscript=1", "https://betches.com/app/uploads/2018/07/omg.gif", "https://betches.com/wp-content/themes/betches-2021/assets-img/gif-mascot-articles.gif", "https://betches.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif", "https://betches.s3.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2018/06/12143550/becca1.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ZqRuYBtPWtPaq.gif", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/0beaa8e61c5242c9769e754776fa4e7e?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://betches.com/app/uploads/2018/07/wills-bachelorette.gif"], "top_img": "https://betches.s3.amazonaws.com/app/uploads/2018/06/12143550/becca1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryanne Probst"], "canonical_link": "https://betches.com/major-bachelorette-spoiler-report-indicates-becca-may-pull-an-arie/", "title": "MAJOR 'BACHELORETTE' SPOILER: Report Indicates Becca May Pull An Arie", "meta_data": {"facebook-domain-verification": "6qqpx3gpczagbs3x011wbysboop762", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ahrefs-site-verification": "816d47663ea477d9bb41ce45e2525282b9b6373557042d1d775bf52d9714be81", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "MAJOR 'BACHELORETTE' SPOILER: Report Indicates Becca May Pull An Arie - Betches", "description": "If you\u2019ve been watching The Bachelorette this season, then you know it\u2019s been the most dramatic season ever lame AF.
