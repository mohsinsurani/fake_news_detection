In a new interview, the Suburbicon actor shared his thoughts about his BFF\u2019s massive back tattoo.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not one man\u2019s job to tell another man what he can do to his back,\u201d Damon, 47, said during an appearance on The Daily Show With Trevor Noah on Wednesday, March 21. \u201cYou know, I support him in all of his artistic expression.\u201d\n\nWith a laugh, host Trevor Noah replied, \u201cFair enough. That\u2019s a good friend answer, actually.\u201d\n\nThe Manchester by the Sea producer also joked during the interview that Affleck, 45, just can\u2019t get enough of him. \u201cUnfortunately, I can\u2019t seem to shake him,\u201d he quipped. \u201cI\u2019ve known him since I was 10, so it\u2019s [been] 37 years.\u201d\n\nThe movie stars grew up together as children in Massachusetts before they both landed their big break with the 1997 drama Good Will Hunting. They cowrote and starred in the Robin Williams-led movie, which was nominated for nine Oscars, including best picture. The duo won best screenplay for the film.\n\nThe Gone Girl actor first unveiled his tattoo of a colorful phoenix on the set of Live by Night in Los Angeles in December 2015. \u201cA phoenix rising from the ashes,\u201d his ex-wife, Jennifer Garner, later told Vanity Fair. \u201cAm I the ashes in this scenario? I take umbrage. I refuse to be the ashes.\u201d\n\nThough a source confirmed to Us Weekly at the time that Affleck\u2019s ink was real, he claimed to Extra in 2016 that it was actually \u201cfor a movie.\u201d However, the tattoo made headlines again when the actor put it on full display on Thursday, March 15, while going shirtless on a beach in Hawaii.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-damon-ben-affleck.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1367px%2C717px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-damon-ben-affleck.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1367px%2C717px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matt-damon-reacts-to-ben-afflecks-massive-back-tattoo/", "title": "Matt Damon Reacts to Ben Affleck\u2019s Massive Back Tattoo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Matt Damon shared his thoughts about his BFF Ben Affleck\u2019s massive back tattoo during an appearance on \u2018The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\u2019 \u2014 watch", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "This Is What Matt Damon Thinks About Ben Affleck\u2019s Massive Back Tattoo", "description": "Matt Damon shared his thoughts about his BFF Ben Affleck\u2019s massive back tattoo during an appearance on \u2018The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\u2019 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matt-damon-reacts-to-ben-afflecks-massive-back-tattoo/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-22T19:15:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-damon-ben-affleck.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1367px%2C717px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-damon-ben-affleck.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1367px%2C717px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-22T19:15:45+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "This Is What Matt Damon Thinks About Ben Affleck\u2019s Massive Back Tattoo", "description": "Matt Damon shared his thoughts about his BFF Ben Affleck\u2019s massive back tattoo during an appearance on \u2018The Daily Show With Trevor Noah\u2019 \u2014 watch", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/matt-damon-ben-affleck.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1367px%2C717px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521746145.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
