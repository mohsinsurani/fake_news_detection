The move contradicted President Donald Trump\u2019s old criticism of former First Lady Michelle Obama for making a similar decision.\n\nObama opted not to wear a headscarf in Saudi Arabia in 2015, but she wore a black veil and a black dress when she met Pope Benedict XVI at the Vatican in 2009.\n\nWhile the dress code for papal audiences has received a good deal of attention, it\u2019s possible Pope Francis has taken a more relaxed approach in recent years.\n\n\u201cThings have become more relaxed over the last few years. There are no hard and fast rules,\u201d a spokesperson for the Vatican told The Telegraph last month, after Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall, wore a champagne-colored dress and no veil while meeting the Pope at the Vatican.\n\nWrite to Katie Reilly at Katie.Reilly@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seth-rich.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ivanka-trump-melania-trump-vatican-veils.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/washington-politics-unity.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ivanka-trump-melania-trump-vatican-veils.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4792096/melania-ivanka-trump-veil-pope-francis-vatican/", "title": "Melania and Ivanka Trump Wore Veils to Meet the Pope", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Melania and Ivanka Trump wore veils to meet Pope Francis, following the traditional dress code for private papal audiences at the Vatican", "og": {"title": "Melania and Ivanka Trump Wore Veils to Meet the Pope", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4792096/melania-ivanka-trump-veil-pope-francis-vatican/", "description": "They followed the traditional Vatican dress code for private papal audiences", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ivanka-trump-melania-trump-vatican-veils.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4792096/melania-ivanka-trump-veil-pope-francis-vatican/", "description": "Melania and Ivanka Trump wore veils to meet Pope Francis, following the traditional dress code for private papal audiences at the Vatican", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ivanka-trump-melania-trump-vatican-veils.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4792096/melania-ivanka-trump-veil-pope-francis-vatican/", "title": "Melania and Ivanka Trump Wore Veils to Meet the Pope", "description": "They followed the traditional Vatican dress code for private papal audiences", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ivanka-trump-melania-trump-vatican-veils.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
