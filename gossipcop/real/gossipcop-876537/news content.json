Admitting in a new interview that being in charge of 2 humans is daunting, the new father revealed he\u2019s \u2018enjoying the ride\u2019 \u2014 aw!\n\nGeorge Clooney, 56, is still adjusting to becoming a father-of-two overnight, but as he admitted in a recent interview, so far so good! The actor\u2019s wife, Amal Clooney, 39, gave birth to twins Ella and Alexander Clooney on June 6, and since then, the couple\u2019s lives have changed drastically. \u201cSuddenly, you\u2019re responsible for other people, which is terrifying,\u201d George joked when speaking with The Associated Press. But luckily, the star has tons of help from his superstar wife, whom he gives major credit to. \u201cShe\u2019s like an Olympic athlete, she\u2019s doing so beautifully,\u201d he gushed.

It used to be my barf but now it\u2019s the twins\u2019 barf. So it all works out.\u201d LOL. Clearly he\u2019s embracing fatherhood in all its many forms! As HollywoodLife.com previously reported, George seems to have a way with his newborn son and daughter, and he loves caring for them. \u201c[George] is such a natural parent \u2014 it\u2019s amazing how he is with the twins,\u201d a source told us EXCLUSIVELY last month.\n\n\u201cAfter all the years he protested that he wasn\u2019t cut out for parenthood, it\u2019s mind blowing how good he is. George is so patient and calm around the babies, even when they\u2019ve been on an hour-long crying tear! When he picks the babies up they immediately calm down.\u201d SO precious!\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you think George and Amal will show their children to the world soon?", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/ariel-winter-workout-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F08%2F29%2Fgeorge-clooney-fatherhood-interview-babies-twins-kids-diapers-amal%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2762820&comment_count=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/george-clooney-amal-fatherhood-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/vs-fashion-show-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/george-clooney-amal-fatherhood-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/north-singing-ftr.jpg?w=143&crop=0,0,143px,80px"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/08/george-clooney-amal-fatherhood-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170829231712/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/08/29/george-clooney-fatherhood-interview-babies-twins-kids-diapers-amal/", "title": "George Clooney Confesses Fatherhood Is \u2018Terrifying\u2019: He Talks Changing Diapers & The Twins\u2019 \u2018Barf\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "George Clooney may find being a dad intimidating, but he's also completely loving it!
