You guys are awesome.\"\n\nAnd then, while still crying, she managed to earn a big laugh with the sweet message she directed to those fellow film kids: \"We should go and get ice cream after this!\"\n\nBefore and after the giggles that line caused, the A-list crowd in attendance mostly cheered and \"aww\"-ed throughout her heartfelt speech.\n\nBrooklynn shared her gratitude with everyone involved with the film, her family, the awards voters and even her higher power.\n\n\"God, I would like to thank you for this wonderful opportunity,\" she said as she held the crystal trophy close to her heart.\n\nBROOKLYNN WON BEST YOUNG ACTOR!!!!

Brooklynn took advantage of her moment in the spotlight to mention the people in the world who are struggling to make it, just like her on-screen character and the girl's mother, Halley (Bria Vinaite).\n\n\"I'd like to dedicate this award to all the Halleys and Moonees out there,\" she said. \"Guys, this is a real problem. You need to go out there and help.\"\n\nChristopher Polk / Getty Images\n\nAnd then, after one big sniffle, her voice jumped in pitch for an almost-squeaky delivery of her last words on stage: \"Thank you so much!\"\n\nCongratulations, Brooklynn! We can't wait to see you win again.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg",
