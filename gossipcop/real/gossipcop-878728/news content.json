They took that literally: The cover features the lifestyle site\u2019s founder and CEO, Gwyneth Paltrow, topless and slathered in mud from head to toe.\n\nThe 96-page magazine debut, which retails for a hefty price (like all things Goop) of $15, is the first iteration of a new quarterly publication. Just like the online brand, the book will feature wellness advice, clean beauty secrets, healthy recipes and more.\n\nThe Fall 2017 issue, specifically, covers a makeup-bag detox, deep-dives into crystals and mud masks, a do-anywhere workout from fitness guru Tracy Anderson, fall fashion, tips for a better orgasm and a candid conversation with Paltrow, 44, herself.\n\nIn one standout story, the actress talks about having bee venom injected into her C-section scar. \u201cThe doctor stings you [with a live bee] like it\u2019s an acupuncture needle,\u201d shared the mother of Apple, 13, and Moses, 11 (with ex Chris Martin). \u201cI had it done on my cesarean scar\u2026 I had some buckling in the scar, and it really evened it out.\u201d\n\nIn the issue\u2019s editor letter, Paltrow also recalls her first-ever cleanse: \u201cI remember standing in a hippie health-food store in Greenwich Village and I saw a little paperback book describing a \u2018master cleanse,\u2019 and I was like, \u2018What\u2019s that?\u2019 I remember the next day [after I finished the cleanse] I was like, \u2018Oh, wow, I just did this cleanse, and I feel so much better. I can have a beer and a cigarette now, right?'\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Talia Ergas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/gwyneth-paltrow-poses-topless-in-mud-for-goops-first-issue-w501980/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow Poses Topless in Mud for Goop's First Issue", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Celebrity Style", "post-cats": "Stylish", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow posed topless while covered in mud for Goop's first ever print issue \u2014 see the stunning photo", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "See Gwyneth Paltrow Pose Topless While Covered in Mud", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow posed topless while covered in mud for Goop's first ever print issue \u2014 see the stunning photo", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/gwyneth-paltrow-poses-topless-in-mud-for-goops-first-issue-w501980/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:15:00+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-09-08T19:21:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:15:00+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "See Gwyneth Paltrow Pose Topless While Covered in Mud", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow posed topless while covered in mud for Goop's first ever print issue \u2014 see the stunning photo", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/paltrow-9d280a81-a3de-4e9f-ae8e-d934aaa1d517.jpg?crop=0px%2C48px%2C2404px%2C1262px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504898478.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
