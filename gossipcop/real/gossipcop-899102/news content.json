She looks every bit her beautiful self with the new 'do, but she certainly emulates the equally alluring 23-year-old \"Titanic\" actor.\n\nBefore her big hair change, Hudson was known for her long, flowing blond locks. Pop singer Sia and Hudson's 6-year-old son, Bingham, helped her shave it all off. Bryan Bedder / Getty Images\n\nHudson took the bold leap of shaving her head for an upcoming film project directed by Sia, the singer and song-writer known for her wig-wearing ways.\n\nAccording to an interview with Jimmy Kimmel, Hudson\u2019s movie character is \u201cjust a shaved-head kind of girl,\u201d so the big buzz was inevitable.\n\nThe actress hasn\u2019t adopted Sia\u2019s wig aesthetic since she finished filming. Instead, she\u2019s embraced every uncombed moment of hair regrowth.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m starting to go through the first awkward stage of (it) growing out,\u201d Hudson told Ellen DeGeneres in October. \u201cI was thinking like, (of) bringing the mullet back.\u201d\n\nFor now, Hudson wears the \u201890s look well, but a flashback to a \u201870s mullet might be her next fashion pit stop.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201711/tdy_hudson_171102_3.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_42/1290187/kate-hudson-today-171019-tease-05.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_42/1290185/kate-hudson-today-171019-inline-02.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_42/1290187/kate-hudson-today-171019-tease-05.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Curley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/style/who-wore-it-best-kate-hudson-channels-leonardo-dicaprio-s-t119839", "title": "'Who wore it best?'
