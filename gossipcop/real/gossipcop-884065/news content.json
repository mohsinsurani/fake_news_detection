Likewise with Kylie Jenner and the rumoured baby she's made with boyfriend of five months, Travis Scott.\n\nBut the eagle eyes over at Bustle think they might just have spotted something significant over on Kim Kardashian's Instagram page. And it's this, my friends:\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nIn a cryptic photo posted back on September 3rd (about three weeks before speculation over Kylie being pregnant broke) Kim wrote the caption: \"The 3 of us...\" alongside a picture of herself, Kylie and Khlo\u00e9. Errrrr, if this is not a secret message hidden within then I don't know what is.\n\nBustle spotted the post, writing: \"It looks like the biggest clue may have been hiding in plain sight\". And we're with them on that.\n\n\"The Instagram... feels a little too spot-on to be merely a coincidence,\" the theory continues, adding: \"The Kardashians rarely do anything without intention, so it seems nearly improbable that Kim just so happened to post a snapshot of the three of them just weeks before all this baby news surfaced, and as the internet well knows, that ellipsis can speak volumes.\"\n\nI mean, I'm convinced. But I guess it still doesn't act as like, actual, definite confirmation. So I'll just have to go back to refreshing all their social media pages and watching the first episode of the new season of Keeping Up With The Kardashians this weekend like a hawk.\n\nFollow Cat on Twitter.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh&resize=640:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sites/cosmopolitan/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catriona Harvey-Jenner", "Features Editor", "Cat Is Cosmopolitan Uk'S Features Editor Covering Women'S Issues", "Health", "Current Affairs."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a12664469/kim-kardashian-cryptic-instagram-post-confirm-kylie-khloe-pregnant/", "title": "Did Kim just subtly confirm all three Kardashian pregnancies?", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Did Kim just subtly confirm all three Kardashian pregnancies?", "description": "OMG.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a12664469/kim-kardashian-cryptic-instagram-post-confirm-kylie-khloe-pregnant/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 211620818858710}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/cosmopolitanuk", "modified_time": "2022-07-29T01:33:40Z", "published_time": "2017-09-30T09:32:24Z", "section": "Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CosmopolitanUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Did Kim just subtly confirm all three Kardashian pregnancies?", "description": "OMG.", "keywords": "Kim Kardashian, Kylie Jenner, Khloe Kardashian, pregnant, Kylie Jenner pregnant, Khloe Kardashian pregnant, Kim Kardashian instagram, Kim Kardashian confirms pregnancies", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Entertainment,entertainment", "sailthru.date": "2017-09-30T09:32:24Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1.00xw:0.502xh;0,0.224xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/legacy-fre-image-placeholder-1655513735.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Did Kim just subtly confirm all three Kardashian pregnancies?", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506763944.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
