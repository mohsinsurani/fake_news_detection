The two hadn\u2019t spoken to each other prior to this interview, so we really didn\u2019t know what to expect.\n\nWhat we did know at the time was that filming halted earlier in Season 4 of Paradise, due to a potentially nonconsensual encounter between Olympios and Jackson. After thorough investigation, Warner Bros. deemed Jackson clear of any misconduct. Many cast members came out in support of both parties involved, but Olympios and Jackson both voiced their difficulties in moving on from the controversy.\n\nWe\u2019re happy to see that Olympios and Jackson seem to be helping each other get back to normal life, as the two have formed a new friendship. Unsurprisingly, their time spent together has sparked numerous rumors and backlash. Olympios wants to set the record straight on the details on their friendship and, most importantly, wants everyone to \u201cget over it.\u201d\n\nThey were photographed in Disneyland together\n\nThe rumors started when Olympios and Jackson were seen spending time together in Disneyland in September 2017. The two were holding hands and smiling while walking around the park, clearly trying to put their controversy behind them.\n\nThey had to have expected an outburst of attention, but Olympios wasn\u2019t too happy with some of the assumptions being made.\n\nThey aren\u2019t dating\n\nYou better believe that if you spread false information about Olympios, she\u2019ll have something to say about it. TMZ published a story about their time at Disneyland, claiming Olympios and Jackson were hooking up. Olympios quickly took to Instagram live to shut those rumors down.\n\nOlympios started off her venting session by noting, \u201cI have something to say about this TMZ story. To those photographers following me around Disney yesterday, you can go f*ck yourselves.\u201d She asserted, \u201cDeMario and I had a tough summer so leave us the f*ck alone. You guys are f*cking assh*les. We\u2019re friends, so get over it.\u201d\n\nShe also sat down with ET to officially set the record straight. Even though she and Jackson were seen holding hands, she stated, \u201cDeMario and I are close friends. We are not dating. We were hanging out with a group at Disneyland, and I have no problem holding hands with any of my friends.\u201d\n\nJackson has come out about their friendship, too\n\nJackson is clearly on the same page, as he\u2019s also been spreading the message that they\u2019re just friends.\n\nHe\u2019s had nothing but good things to say about Olympios, including, \u201cI have the utmost respect for her, nothing but love for her. She\u2019s back home right now and next week we\u2019re going out, we\u2019re having fun. She\u2019s my homie, straight-up homie.\u201d\n\nTheir friendship is real\n\nAnother rumor has been circulating around their friendship, indicating that it\u2019s all for show. Some just can\u2019t seem to deal with a controversy having a happy ending, so Jackson addressed those speculations while speaking to reporters at Amber Rose\u2019s third annual SlutWalk.\n\nJackson expressed, \u201cIt was one of those things that people want us not to be friends. They want to paint a particular narrative. Even now the narrative is they\u2019re friends now. It\u2019s like, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s fake.\u2019 It\u2019s always you\u2019re damned if you do, you\u2019re damned if you don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time they\u2019ve hung out as friends\n\nIt\u2019s no surprise that Olympios and Jackson have formed a tight bond. Even though they didn\u2019t speak to one another until their interview on Paradise, they went through this scandal together. On Aug. 31, 2017, only two days after their reconciliation aired, photographers captured them at at SBE\u2019s Nightingale Plaza in Los Angeles. They were all smiles, and Olympios even gave Jackson a friendly kiss on the cheek.\n\nAfter their first spotting, Olympios told ET, \u201cWe\u2019re friends. We\u2019re hanging out. He picked me up from the airport, we went to dinner. We\u2019re cool. Really cool.\u201d\n\nThey were seen again in Hollywood on Sept. 20, but this time for dinner at TAO. Outside of the restaurant, photographers asked if Olympios and Jackson were dating. Olympios\u2019 response? \u201cWe\u2019re friends.\u201d\n\nShe never blamed Jackson for the controversy\n\nEven during their initial reunion, Olympios claimed they \u201cnever had bad blood.\u201d This didn\u2019t necessarily seem true when Olympios released a statement during the time of the scandal, which stated, \u201cI am a victim.\u201d\n\nOlympios has since clarified her message, in that she was not a victim of Jackson, but rather a victim of the media. She stated, \u201cI strongly believe he had no bad intentions at all. It was all good. It was unfortunate that no one really knew how intoxicated I actually was at the time. I believe that nobody knew that. It was nobody\u2019s fault.\u201d\n\nOlympios apologized to Jackson\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ktSZ2xv3s1s\n\nOlympios and Jackson both expressed their hardships in dealing with this controversy. Prior to talking one-on-one with Jackson, Olympios sincerely apologized to Jackson during her Paradise interview.\n\n\u201cI would want to tell him, like listen, I respect you as a human,\u201d she claimed when asked what she would want to say to Jackson. \u201cI have nothing against you. I am so sorry you had to go through this. I know exactly what it feels like \u2026 and I wish you all the best and I\u2019m sorry.\u201d\n\nRachel Lindsay isn\u2019t happy about her Bachelor costars befriending Jackson\n\nThese Bachelor friendships are fickle and fleeting\u2026#loyalty \u2014 Rachel Lindsay (@TheRachLindsay) September 2, 2017\n\nThough a number of Bachelor cast members stood by Jackson, Rachel Lindsay clearly isn\u2019t too happy about people befriending him. Jackson was a contestant on Lindsay\u2019s season of The Bachelorette, but that all came to an end when it was revealed he was secretly in a relationship with another woman.\n\nLindsay tweeted, \u201cThese Bachelor friendships are fickle and fleeting\u2026#loyalty.\u201d She\u2019s seemingly referring to her fellow cast members from Nick Viall\u2019s season of The Bachelor, including Raven Gates, Kristina Schulman, and Whitney Fransway. Gates had posted a photo of the three friends on Instagram, tagging themselves at Avenue Los Angeles. Jackson posted a photo at the same bar with Paradise\u2019s Dean Unglert and Adam Gottschalk, so they were likely all hanging out together.\n\nJackson wrote in response, \u201cSomeone said, \u2018These bachelor friendships are fickle and fleeting\u2019 and I disagree. These bachelor friendships got me through a dark time and I\u2019m grateful for my brothers, sisters, and bachelor nation.\u201d\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/demario-jackson1.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/corinne-demario.jpg?w=825&h=580", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/demariojacksonlaughing.png?w=640&h=300", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/demariojacksonlaughing-640x300.png?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Corinne-O-posing-with-one-arm-on-her-hip.jpg?w=640&h=462", "https://media.giphy.com/media/3o84TPtbhMHMM9AeMU/giphy.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/demariojacksonlaughing-640x300.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Leary"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/bachelor-in-paradise-the-1-thing-corinne-olympios-wants-you-to-know-about-her-friendship-with-demario-jackson.html/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019: The 1 Thing Corinne Olympios Wants You to Know About Her Friendship With DeMario Jackson", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson have been spotted together after their scandal.
