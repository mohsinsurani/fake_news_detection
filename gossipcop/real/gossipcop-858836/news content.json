Go ahead and ask Jessica Alba and Jenna Devan-Tatum.\n\nJenna and her husband Channing Tatum are parents to their daughter Everly, aged four.\n\nIn addition to her acting career, Jenna has recently taken on a new role as the host of NBC\u2019s new series called World of Dance.\n\nJessica is the co-founder of the Honest Company, and she shares daughters Haven (aged five) and Honor (aged 8) with her husband, Cash Warren.\n\nThe two women discussed balancing work with family time at a beach party celebrating the launch of their new Havaianas Mommy & Me flip-flops collection which is sponsored by the Baby2baby charity.\n\nJessica stated that feeling like you are missing some critical moment will lead to some nasty conclusions such as the fact that a mother might not even realize that her kid\u2019s shoes are now too small for him or her.\n\n\u2018Some of those milestones or moments, you want to be there for every single one and it\u2019s not realistic when you\u2019re working, but for me, that\u2019s what gets me. Even the everyday little things like picking them up from school are a big deal, so I drop them off at school most mornings and try to get home for bedtime. But the weekends is really when I get to spend the time with them.\u2019\n\nJenna said that the most important thing is the balancing act and the process of learning the complete balance act.\n\nShe also stated that for her this is absorbing because of the fact that it will be really busy and then she will have a bit of time where it isn\u2019t quite as busy.\n\nShe said that it\u2019s pretty much like checks and balances kind of thing where you put in the good quality time, so you will feel a little bit better about working the next day.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThis whole thing is about finding that and about regularly not make yourself feel guilty. Instead, you have to work that out for yourself so that your family will get enough attention and quality time together. The conclusion was that The most important thing is the balancing act", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ti-bernice-and-tiny-pregnancy-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Gwen-Stefani-Wasnt-With-Blake-Shelton-At-The-CMT-Awards-Where-He-Might-Have-Met-His-Ex-Miranda-Lambert-300x204.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ryan-edwards-teen-mom-700x466.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Brad-Pitt-jennifer-aniston-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/T.I.-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-Bernice-Burgos-300x169.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jessica-Alba-And-Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Talk-About-The-Struggle-Of-Being-A-Working-Mother.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/alba-2-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/jessica-alba-inc-magazine_42479-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/T.I.-Floyd-Mayweather-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x232.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/mixedremixed-com-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jamie-Dornan-Will-Go-Completely-Naked-In-Fifty-Shades-Freed-Get-All-The-Juicy-Details-300x169.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Jessica-Alba-And-Jenna-Dewan-Tatum-Talk-About-The-Struggle-Of-Being-A-Working-Mother.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170608133042/http://celebrityinsider.org/jessica-alba-and-jenna-dewan-tatum-talk-about-the-struggle-of-being-a-working-mother-42305/", "title": "Jessica Alba And Jenna Dewan-Tatum Talk About The Struggle Of Being A Working Mother", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "Jenna Dewan-Tatum, jessica alba,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Jenna Dewan-Tatum, jessica alba,", "description": "Balancing both work and family can be quite a hard thing to do.
