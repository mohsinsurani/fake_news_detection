The fitness icon was hospitalized last week for indigestion.\n\nHe posted a message on his Facebook page saying:\n\n\u201cHope you\u2019re having a beautiful Sunday. I wanted to take a moment to send a big thank you to the wonderful doctors, nurses and staff at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center during my short stay there this week. They make you feel good even though you\u2019re in the hospital for feeling bad.\n\nAnother shout out goes to the wonderful men and women of the Los Angeles Police Dept. They were so helpful and kind as I returned home. Let\u2019s take a minute and all be thankful for medical professionals, police, firefighters and our brave military forces here and around the world. They risk so much every day to make us well and keep us protected. God Bless all of them.\u201d", "images": ["https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/shutterstock_9882880aa-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Simmons-in-2011.-By-Angela-George-CC.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/shutterstock_editorial_13330473du-1-324x400.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Simmons-in-2011.-By-Angela-George-CC-696x678.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/braddpitt-e1663225071870-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/JonathanBailey-scaled-e1663831379613-100x70.jpg", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/logo_transparent_background_small.png", "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/shutterstock_9470680q-scaled-e1663576722678-100x70.jpg"], "top_img": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Simmons-in-2011.-By-Angela-George-CC.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jovana A."], "canonical_link": "https://omgcheckitout.com/richard-simmons-gives-shout-hospital-staff-health-scare/", "title": "Richard Simmons Gives Shout Out to Hospital Staff After Health Scare", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://omgcheckitout.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Simmons-in-2011.-By-Angela-George-CC.jpg", "width": 854, "height": 832, "type": "image/jpeg"}, "locale": "en_US", "title": "Richard Simmons Gives Shout Out to Hospital Staff After Health Scare", "description": "Richard Simmons has shared a message regarding his health regarding his voluntary absence from public life since 2014.
