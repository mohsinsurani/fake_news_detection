HBO denounced the remark as \u201ccompletely inexcusable and tasteless,\u201d and said it would be edited out of future airings.\n\nShortly after 10 p.m. on Friday, Mr. Maher, the comedian and host of HBO\u2019s \u201cReal Time,\u201d was talking to Mr. Sasse on his program about the boundaries between adolescence and maturity, and how adults in California still dress up for Halloween.\n\nWhen Mr. Sasse said this did not happen in his state, Mr. Maher said, \u201cI\u2019ve got to get to Nebraska more.\u201d\n\nMr. Sasse replied: \u201cYou\u2019re welcome. We\u2019d love to have you work in the fields with us.\u201d\n\nMr. Maher said: \u201cWork in the fields? Senator, I\u2019m a house nigger. No, it\u2019s a joke.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/04/us/04maher-1/03maher_web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=39bf46b4427a771cdbca5a75e73f0d0c2c47af6967d1ef602fc9b17f85ffa476&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/04/us/04maher-1/03maher_web1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/04/us/04maher-1/03maher_web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=39bf46b4427a771cdbca5a75e73f0d0c2c47af6967d1ef602fc9b17f85ffa476&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Itzkoff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/arts/television/bill-maher-n-word.html", "title": "Bill Maher Apologizes for Use of Racial Slur on \u2018Real Time\u2019", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Mr. Maher and his guest, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, were swiftly criticized on social media after Mr. Maher\u2019s comments were broadcast.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/arts/television/bill-maher-n-word.html", "type": "article", "title": "Bill Maher Apologizes for Use of Racial Slur on \u2018Real Time\u2019 (Published 2017)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/04/us/04maher-1/03maher_web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=39bf46b4427a771cdbca5a75e73f0d0c2c47af6967d1ef602fc9b17f85ffa476&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Bill Maher, appearing on his HBO show Friday night with Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, used a racial epithet to describe himself after Mr. Sasse suggested that Mr. Maher \u201cwork in the fields with us.\u201d"}, "description": "Mr. Maher and his guest, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, were swiftly criticized on social media after Mr. Maher\u2019s comments were broadcast."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/arts/television/bill-maher-n-word.html", "title": "Bill Maher Apologizes for Use of Racial Slur on \u2018Real Time\u2019 (Published 2017)", "description": "Mr. Maher and his guest, Senator Ben Sasse, Republican of Nebraska, were swiftly criticized on social media after Mr. Maher\u2019s comments were broadcast.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/04/us/04maher-1/03maher_web1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg?year=2017&h=900&w=1600&s=09fc956fd48657f351bab09f352fa981cd4cbee226d9fb9ac44cb26b003d2900&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Bill Maher, appearing on his HBO show Friday night with Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, used a racial epithet to describe himself after Mr. Sasse suggested that Mr. Maher \u201cwork in the fields with us.\u201d"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/538cc84d-4341-591b-82de-931032a118c9"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-03T04:45:15.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-06-03T19:09:28.000Z", "section": "Arts", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/dave-itzkoff", "tag": "Blacks", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005143644, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/538cc84d-4341-591b-82de-931032a118c9", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/57a2642f298949f59208f4d7db823bdc", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/04/us/04maher-1/03maher_web1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=549&w=1050&s=39bf46b4427a771cdbca5a75e73f0d0c2c47af6967d1ef602fc9b17f85ffa476&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Dave Itzkoff", "news_keywords": "HBO,TV,Bill Maher,Benjamin Sasse,Discrimination,Race and Ethnicity,Black People;African-Americans;Black Culture and History", "pdate": 20170603, "CG": "arts", "SCG": "television", "CN": "race", "CT": "spotlight", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/arts/television/bill-maher-n-word.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/538cc84d-4341-591b-82de-931032a118c9", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/arts/television/bill-maher-n-word.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/03/arts/television/bill-maher-n-word.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496444400.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
