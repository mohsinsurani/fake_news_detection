More info\n\nKate Middleton, 36, has given birth to three children since marrying Prince William, 36, and becoming a member of the Royal Family. Being a normal girl from Berkshire, the former fashion and marketing professional had to adapt to royal life. When she did fall pregnant, Kate was not allowed to have one baby tradition other mothers in the UK will experience, a baby shower. Another royal baby is now on the way, with Meghan Markle having her first child with husband Prince Harry. With Meghan now pregnant, and hailing from the US where baby showers are the norm, will Meghan be allowed what Kate wasn\u2019t?\n\nKate Middleton: The pregnancy tradition Kate was not allowed to have - will Meghan be?\n\nBaby showers are a way for the expectant mother and those close to her to celebrate the pregnancy and upcoming birth. This happens by showering the mother-to-be with gifts, a pregnancy tradition. However, baby showers are reported to be frowned on in the Royal Family and not celebrated, as they appear to be tasteless. Speaking to People magazine, royal expert Victoria Arbiter revealed that a royal baby shower could come with \u201cadded pressure that they are clearly very wealthy.\u201d She stated: \u201cA lavish baby shower would be seen as highly inappropriate... there's nothing they can't go out and buy themselves\". It is believed that Kate hasn\u2019t had a baby shower for any of her three children.\n\nKate has been pregnant three times, and is believed to have never had a baby shower\n\nBack in 2013 when she was pregnant with Prince George, rumours circulated that her sister Pippa had thrown her a shower. However, these rumours were shot down by many royal experts, as the point of a shower is to receive gifts and that is something the Royal Family wouldn\u2019t do. According to Victoria, royal protocol exists around gift giving and any gifts given to expectant royal parents must be \u201crespectfully returned\u201d. This means it is highly unlikely that Meghan will be having a baby shower to celebrate the upcoming birth of her first child, despite it being a US tradition. While on their royal tour of Australia, Tonga and Fiji, Meghan and Harry did receive some gifts, including a stuffed toy kangaroo and a pair of tiny Ugg boots.\n\nMeghan and Harry baby news is 'wonderful' says Paul Burrell\n\nPippa was rumoured to have thrown pregnant Kate a shower, but the rumours were shot down\n\nMeghan is now expecting her first child, and baby showers are a US tradition\n\nIt is not known as to whether or not the Sussexes had to return the kangaroo and other gifts, but they were delighted at the gifts when presented with them in Sydney. While Kate wasn\u2019t allowed a baby shower due to her royal title, her sister Pippa might well have had one. Pippa gave birth to a baby boy last week, and following the birth a statement was released by Kensington Palace on behalf of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The statement read: \u201cThe Duke and Duchess of Cambridge are thrilled for Pippa and James.\u201d It was believed that Kate didn\u2019t visit Pippa in the hospital, as it would've caused too much of a media circus.", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/750x445/1036658.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/130/750x445/1036658.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Isabella Sullivan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/life-style/life/1036658/kate-middleton-news-latest-pregnancy-meghan-markle-pregnant-baby", "title": "Kate Middleton: The pregnancy tradition Kate was not allowed to have - will Meghan be?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "KATE MIDDLETON has been pregnant three times, giving birth to her third child earlier this year.
