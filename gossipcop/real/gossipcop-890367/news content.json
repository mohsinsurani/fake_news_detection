USA TODAY\n\nThe American Music Awards are nothing without stars' off-the-wall fashion choices. And Sunday night's ceremonies delivered, with a range of looks that were mostly fun, often questionable and sometimes disastrous \u2014 but never boring.\n\nTake a look at the evening's best and worst dressed stars below.\n\nBest dressed\n\nSelena Gomez\n\nThis Coach minidress-sized leather jacket of a garment Gomez is wearing is doing everything for us right now, especially paired with her messy new bleach-blonde hair.\n\nJenna Dewan Tatum\n\nBravo to Dewan Tatum for nailing this nude look from Julien MacDonald.\n\nDemi Lovato\n\nLovato's Ester Abner look is vaguely Morticia Addams and a little Elizabeth Taylor and completely and totally flattering on her.\n\nPink\n\nYes, Pink's Monique Lhullier gown is exceedingly pink. But fans don't often see the singer in overly girlish dresses, and these Disney princess vibes look nice on her.\n\nTracee Ellis Ross\n\nTracee Ellis Ross was tasked with hosting this year's AMAs, and she set a high bar on the red carpet in Stella McCartney.\n\nWorst dressed\n\nNick Cannon\n\nCannon normally looks like a bedazzled mess on the red carpet, and the AMAs were no exception.\n\nKehlani\n\nFrom far away, Kehlani looks like she's wearing a standard naked dress. Up close, she looks like she lost a battle with a colander of spaghetti.\n\nRachel Platten\n\nBetween the sheerness and the stripes and the odd strips of coverage, this jumpsuit is too strangely constructed for us to get on board with Platten's adventurous look.\n\nMachine Gun Kelly\n\nThe rapper's suit looks like a kids' bedroom carpet, complete with mini cars on his lapel. We didn't know the Ikea's children's section made bespoke garments.\n\nAlessia Cara\n\nCara is as loveable of a personality as they come in pop music. If only we loved this bodysuit/sweatpants/boots combination as much.\n\nJulia Michaels\n\nSame goes for Michaels, whose poofy red gown doesn't quite match Pink's fairytale princess interpretation of their similar look.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5652522534001_5652516579001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/330780bd56b1d7f0a8e12c94888c711a55ee58d1/c=0-195-3494-2169/local/-/media/2017/11/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636467327735833326-GTY-876451074-95465813.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/330780bd56b1d7f0a8e12c94888c711a55ee58d1/c=0-195-3494-2169/local/-/media/2017/11/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636467327735833326-GTY-876451074-95465813.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maeve Mcdermott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/11/20/american-music-awards-best-and-worst-dressed-stars-2017/879648001/", "title": "American Music Awards' best and worst-dressed stars: Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato shine", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/11/20/american-music-awards-best-and-worst-dressed-stars-2017/879648001/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "American Music Awards' best and worst-dressed stars: Selena Gomez and Demi Lovato shine", "description": "The American Music Awards are nothing without stars' off-the-wall fashion choices.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/330780bd56b1d7f0a8e12c94888c711a55ee58d1/c=0-195-3494-2169/local/-/media/2017/11/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636467327735833326-GTY-876451074-95465813.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "The American Music Awards are nothing without stars' off-the-wall fashion choices.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511136000.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
