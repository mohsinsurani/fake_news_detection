We can add Joe Manganiello, erstwhile star of True Blood and Magic Mike, to the ranks of hot nerds.\n\nFor reference, this is the Joe Manganiello that we know and love:\n\nOh, and this one:\n\nThis one, too. Always this one:\n\nBut, according to wife Sofia Vergara, this is also Joe Manganiello:\n\nOn the red carpet for the 2017 Emmy Awards, the Modern Family star\u2014who also brought her hot son as a date\u2014was asked by Guiliana Rancic to reveal a secret about Joe that audiences don't know. Sofia's response:\n\n\"He's a nerd.\"\n\n\"The highlight of his life is to play Dungeons and Dragons,\" she said with a laugh. \"He talks together with like eight friends... He has a dungeon room downstairs.\"\n\nNow, if I told you that Joe Manganiello and Sofia Vergara had a dungeon room in the basement of their house, what would you expect? Something like this probably:\n\nWell, you'd be wrong. Sofia reports that she's decorated Joe's gameplay room and that gameplay is definitely not a euphemism.\n\nGiuliana asked if Sofia had learned how to join the game. That's also a no.\n\n\"I organize the figurines and put the cheese out,\" she said.\n\nHonestly, I would think that all of this was double entendres if Joe hadn't talked publicly about his love of D&D (not a euphemism) before in an interview with the Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Emmys are just beginning and already the event is causing us to question everything we knew to be true.\n\nJust for reference, this guy's wife thinks he's a nerd:", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg",
