Sporting minimal make up and her signature messy bun, Meghan looked set for summer in a pretty floral frock teamed with a white fascinator, thought to be just \u00a329.50 from Marks and Spencer, and a small mirrored clutch bag.

While many thought the floral frock \u201cswamped\u201d the 36-year-old duchess.\n\nMeghan Markle narrowly avoided taking a tumble\n\nMeghan Markle was steadied by her husband Prince Harry\n\nMeghan Markle appeared to slip on the unsteady pathway\n\nThe new Duchess of Sussex had to be steadied by her doting husband Prince Harry\n\nBut Meghan Markle, 36, appeared relaxed and at ease as she mingled and greeted guests of the congregation including members of the Spencer family, Lady Kitty Spencer and Princess Diana\u2019s siblings Earl Spencer and Lady Jane Fellowes.
