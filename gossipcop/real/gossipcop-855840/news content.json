Enjoy the Welsh coast, guys.\u201d\n\nJames, 41, and Pippa, 33, actually fly off today for a week in a $A5,200-a-night resort on the French Polynesian isle Tetiaroa.\n\nAnother joke involved Pippa and her new husband\u2019s pet dog Rafa.\n\nThe best man said: \u201cNow, to the love of James\u2019s life. Beautiful, energetic, loyal, soft mouth, comes on command, great behind \u2014 that\u2019s enough about James\u2019 spaniel Rafa.\u201d\n\nHowever, the quip fell flat and the crowd at the Middleton\u2019s $A10.3 million mansion in Bucklebury, Berkshire, looked on in stony silence.\n\nOne source told The Sun: \u201cIt was a bit full-on for the crowd we had there. Thankfully, some of the older ones didn\u2019t know what he meant.\u201d\n\nThe best man, who has known James for ten years, also took the mickey out of his friend\u2019s dancing skills as he read out a message from the dance tutors who had trained him for the big day.\n\nIt said: \u201cWe really enjoyed seeing you and how you mastered interpretative dance.\n\n\u201cGood luck with the first dance. Don\u2019t forget the buttock-clenching on the star jump.\u201d\n\nThe reception began at 8pm, with most guests having to provide photos and passwords for security clearance before arrival.\n\nThey were herded through a village hall to be checked by security officers and to be handed a pass to the party.\n\nRoyal protection officers and armed police patrolled the estate perimeter and guarded entrances to the venue all night.\n\nMeanwhile, a Spitfire performed a spectacular fly-past.\n\nInside, tennis ace Roger Federer, 35, wowed the guests by joining in a Middletons vs. Matthews family ping-pong tournament.\n\nDinner came at around 9pm, with speeches two hours later. After the last one at midnight, Justin and James performed a choreographed interpretative dance with star jumps, replacing the traditional newlyweds\u2019 first dance.\n\nAnd their moves went down far better than some of Justin\u2019s jokes, drawing wolf-whistles, laughter and applause.\n\nRevellers then partied along to music and a live band until 4am.\n\nEarlier in the day, they had enjoyed a far more sedate champagne reception at nearby Englefield House.\n\nSpencer, 27, and Pippa\u2019s brother James Middleton, 30, gave speeches while guests dined on 20 different types of canape, including small portions of haggis, king prawns and steak and chips as a jazz band played.\n\nThe bride\u2019s dad Michael, 67, spoke of his pride as he bemoaned losing Pippa and sister Kate \u2014 but said they had gone to great husbands.\n\nYesterday morning, a tired-looking Spencer \u2014 barred from taking along TV star girlfriend Vogue Williams, 31 \u2014 was seen clutching a can of beer in the sun at his hotel before he set off home.\n\nHe said: \u201cFor now, we\u2019ll all just enjoy it. I made a speech yesterday. As far as I\u2019m aware it went fine.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun and has been republished here with permission.", "images":
