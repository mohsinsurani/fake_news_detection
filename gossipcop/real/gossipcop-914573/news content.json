Following the divorce from his ex-wife, Luann De Lesseps, the Real Housewives Of New York City alum has found himself at the front of headlines once again.\n\nIn a report from Page Six, the publication claims the police are investigating him after a confrontation inside of a restaurant in Palm Beach.\n\nHowever, another source stated neither Tom or his lawyers have spoken to police about such an inquiry. The source claimed, \u201cthere were a lot of people who saw what happened,\u201d and the man who got into a fight with him is known around the town.\n\nThe perpetrator allegedly put his hands on Tom\u2019s girlfriend, and after he got involved, there were drinks thrown at each other. The insider claims him, and his girlfriend left Cucina \u2013 the restaurant they were eating at \u2013 without problems or confrontations with the police.\n\nThe insider alleged that the reality star said he only regrets spilling his martini. It was a matter of protecting his girlfriend, so there\u2019s no remorse.\n\nAs most fans know, Palm Beach is a special place in the heart of Tom and Luann. It\u2019s the place where they got married during a New Years Eve party, an extravagant one at that.\n\nUnfortunately, Luann and Tom separated just seven months later, and since then, Lesseps has found herself in serious trouble with the law. Celebrity Insider reported last year that Luann fought the police during a drunken endeavor on Christmas Eve morning.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for their relationship, Tom said to E! News they \u201cfell in love,\u201d but it ended quickly, and he was \u201csad\u201d that two people who loved each other are not an item anymore. He stated the stories perpetrated by the media make for good headlines and wishes Lesseps a happy future filled with love.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/New-Photos-Suggest-John-David-Duggar-And-Abbie-Grace-Burnett-Have-Different-Courtship-Rules-Than-His-Sisters-300x210.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Tiny-Harris-Stop-Cheating-300x215.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/The-Police-Reportedly-Believes-Tekashi69-Was-Showing-Off-750k-Chain-20k-In-Cash-Before-The-Robbery-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Webp.net-resizeimage-15-300x257.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Moniece-Slaughter-Pinterest.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Tom-Cruise-Suri-Katie-Holmes-300x173.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/RHONY-Tinsley-Mortimer-Claims-She-Was-In-Shock-Over-LuAnn-De-Lesseps-Relapse-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/RHONY-LuAnn-De-Lesseps-Odd-Behavior-Suggested-She-Was-No-Longer-Sober-Weeks-Before-Her-Return-To-Rehab-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Toya-Wright-Shares-A-Throwback-Pic-Since-She-Was-Pregnant-I-Heard-It-Was-National-Bump-Day-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Kandi-Burruss-Pregnant-Todd-Tucker-300x232.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Reginae-Carter-Shows-Off-Her-Brown-Locks-And-Shes-Proud-Of-The-New-Look-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/RHONY-LuAnn-De-Lesseps-Begging-Judge-Not-To-Send-Her-To-Jail-From-Her-Second-Try-At-Rehab-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tom-And-Luann-iRealHousewives.com_-e1518897215104.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Tom-And-Luann-iRealHousewives.com_-e1518897215104.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180728113405/http://celebrityinsider.org/luann-de-lesseps-ex-husband-tom-dagostino-not-under-investigation-by-police-despite-reports-116385/", "title": "Luann De Lessep\u2019s Ex-Husband Tom D\u2019Agostino Not Under Investigation By Police Despite Reports", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "luann de lesseps, tom d'agostino,", "keywords": "celebrity news, luann de lesseps, tom d'agostino,", "description": "Tom D'Agostino isn't having a lot of luck when it comes to managing to get away from drama.
