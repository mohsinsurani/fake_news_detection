I've been honest and true. I've tried to stay pure. I've tried to not respond in a knee-jerk manner, and I've stayed very close to who I am. So it hurt, but I'm also proud of myself.\"\n\nThe 61-year-old had a tearful exit from the morning news show in 2012. After leaving, reports said it was because of her co-host Matt Lauer.\n\nLauer, 60, was fired from NBC in November for \"inappropriate sexual behavior,\" according to a statement from the network.\n\nIn an interview with \"CBS This Morning\" Wednesday, Curry said she was \"not surprised\" by the allegations against Lauer.\n\nSince leaving \"Today,\" Curry told People she tried not to dwell on the experience.\n\n\"I'm not going to say it wasn't hard,\" she said. \"But I had to let go. And I learned that when you not only let go but open your arms wide and learn the lessons that an experience \u2014 no matter how bad \u2014 can teach you, that's when you rise.\"\n\nRead People's cover story with Curry here.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories straight to your inbox.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://i.insider.com/5a5f69da55ac5623008b4645?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5a5f673c55ac561a008b4665?width=700", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b314ebe5e48ec1d008b45db?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5a5f69da55ac5623008b4645?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anjelica Oswald"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/ann-curry-on-leaving-today-2018-1", "title": "Ann Curry finally speaks out about her exit from 'Today': 'It hurt like hell'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Ann Curry finally speaks out about her exit from 'Today': 'It hurt like hell'", "datePublished": "2018-01-17T16:27:33Z", "dateModified": "2018-01-17T16:27:36Z", "news_keywords": "Ann Curry, Today Show, NBC, Matt Lauer, TV, Anjelica Oswald", "description": "The former NBC co-host spoke to People about leaving \"Today\" in 2012.", "author": "Anjelica Oswald", "article": {"publisher": "insider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Culture", "og": {"title": "Ann Curry finally speaks out about her exit from 'Today': 'It hurt like hell'", "description": "The former NBC co-host spoke to People about leaving \"Today\" in 2012.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.insider.com/ann-curry-on-leaving-today-2018-1", "image": "https://i.insider.com/5a5f69da55ac5623008b4645?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Ann Curry finally speaks out about her exit from 'Today': 'It hurt like hell'", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-17", "sailthru.tags": "Ann Curry, Today Show, NBC, Matt Lauer, TV, Anjelica Oswald", "sailthru.description": "The former NBC co-host spoke to People about leaving \"Today\" in 2012.", "sailthru.author": "Anjelica Oswald", "sailthru.verticals": "culture", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/5a5f69ca55ac561e008b465d?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/5a5f69ca55ac561e008b465d?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "Insider": "Snapchat", "Ann Curry finally speaks out about her exit from 'Today'": {" 'It hurt like hell'": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!"}, "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"bii-imgalt": "ann curry"}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 1413475698959824}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.insider.com/ann-curry-on-leaving-today-2018-1?fbia"}, "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"newsletter-email-input": "control"}, "viking-id": "5a5f663a55ac56ea008b4637", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2021-08", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516147200.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
