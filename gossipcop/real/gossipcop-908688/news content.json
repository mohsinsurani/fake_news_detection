But now, with the show\u2019s big post-Super Bowl LII episode looming, the father of three\u2019s cause of death was finally revealed during Tuesday\u2019s episode.\n\nThe episode followed Jack in what was, unbeknownst to him or his family, the final day of his life \u2014 Super Bowl Sunday. While he and wife Rebecca (Mandy Moore) plotted their future as empty nesters while watching, their kids all eschewed family time to hang out with their friends. And while Kate and Randall both had sweet moments of potential closure with their father, Kevin, who had gotten into a fight with his parents, planned to leave his apology for the morning. In the final moments of the episode, Jack cleaned up the kitchen and went to bed, but didn\u2019t unplug the faulty Crockpot, which sparked and lit the kitchen on fire.\n\nHere, creator Dan Fogelman speaks with The Hollywood Reporter about the lingering mystery surrounding Jack\u2019s death, what audiences haven\u2019t figured out (yet) and where NBC\u2019s time-twisting family drama goes next for Rebecca, Kevin (Justin Hartley), Kate (Chrissy Metz) and Randall (Sterling K. Brown) after the big Jack reveal.\n\nDid you always intend on having Jack\u2019s death be this big mystery people would rally around?\n\nNo, I knew it was going to be part of the conversation about this show. Part of what you have to realize when you\u2019re making a show \u2014 you don\u2019t realize at the beginning it\u2019s going to get as big as this has gotten. So I expected that there would be a conversation about how he died \u2014 when exactly, how exactly \u2014 but the scope of the conversation and the size of it I was not expecting.\n\nAre you annoyed that people clung on to that?\n\nIt doesn\u2019t annoy me at all, no. We\u2019ve been careful to moderate it and try to tease it along in a way where it\u2019s fulfilling for the audience without it overtaking the show, and I think we\u2019ve done a good job of it. [With season two] we were coming to a season where people are going to have to know how he dies. We gave a little clue at the beginning of the season, and that conversation has really gone away quite a bit this season until the last few episodes when we\u2019re heading toward it. I feel like we\u2019ve done a good job by giving people a little of what they want but also not dragging it out longer than it needs to go, because the show is about more than that. Certainly it would be more frustrating if Jack\u2019s death wasn\u2019t such a pinnacle moment for our family. Ultimately this is a family show, and the loss of this amazing patriarch of the family was a defining moment for this family. If everybody was just focused on some element that didn\u2019t really matter, then that would be more concerning.\n\nOnce the the big reveal happens, what\u2019s next? It felt like the show was building to this, so where do you go from here?\n\nIt goes to a lot of places. We\u2019re not even at our halfway mark with the series, and this was always the plan. There\u2019s a big plan for the series, and you\u2019ll see how that relates to Jack and this family in the Super Bowl episode. That all being said, I would argue that this season, outside of our first episode and these last two, we barely touched upon Jack\u2019s death. It\u2019s been almost entirely about the storyline with Kate\u2019s pregnancy, Kevin\u2019s alcohol addiction, Randall and Beth fostering a child, and Jack and Rebecca informing those stories in the past. Many of our best episodes had absolutely nothing to do with Jack\u2019s death, and that will continue to be the case. And then we\u2019re going to new places where people don\u2019t even know quite yet exactly where the show is going and what it\u2019s about, and that\u2019s going to start revealing itself as we move forward.\n\nWas the three-part episode something you plotted out from the beginning or was it also a helpful way to make sure Jack\u2019s death fell on the Super Bowl episode?\n\nNo, we always knew that. We didn\u2019t know how many episodes that would fold out on, but making Jack\u2019s reveal be [after the] Super Bowl \u2014 we were always going to reveal Jack\u2019s death around this point in the second season. It was going to be some kind of big [event] \u2014 it was maybe Christmas, it was maybe going to be Valentine\u2019s Day, some holiday that holds [significance] to this family. The second the show started getting successful in season one, I started pestering [NBC executives] Jen Salke and Bob Greenblatt a bit and saying, \u201cI understand you guys are going to have the Super Bowl next year.\u201d Because this was a football family and it would make so much sense, karmically, but I think in order to spread out for the schedule we would have shifted our schedule a little bit. We would have created extra episodes.\n\nHow does an episode that\u2019s going to show Jack\u2019s death vibe with post-Super Bowl programming?\n\nIt will remain to be seen. I\u2019m incredibly excited about the episode. I\u2019ve just completed it, all the final touches. It\u2019s very special, and one of if not our best. How people want to watch television after the Super Bowl, I don\u2019t know, but I suspect the way it starts, the opening six minutes of it, it\u2019s going to be hard for people to turn it off. Our director and actors did a tremendous job. It\u2019s pretty spectacular and you can\u2019t really breathe.\n\nThere\u2019s something to be said for the way This Is Us has brought back family drama. It makes you cry but it does make you feel good, too.\n\nThat\u2019s going to be one of our challenges in the Super Bowl episode \u2014 it\u2019s one of our biggest storylines if not our biggest storyline. By its inherent nature, it\u2019s very hard not to be sad. The show has gotten a lot of heat for making people cry all the time, but I don\u2019t think people are always just crying out of sadness \u2014 it may be melancholy, but our writers and actors are opening people up in a feel-good cry kind of way. Some of the cries next week are hard, sad cries. It\u2019s a different kind of cry, but I think for fans of the show and for people who are coming to the show fresh, they don\u2019t know everything yet. People think they know what\u2019s going to happen with the fire and Jack, but I think if you bear with the sad like we always try to do with the show, there\u2019s a great amount of surprise and uplift.\n\nWhat kind of entry point is there for nonviewers or people who aren\u2019t up to date?\n\nIt\u2019s a difficult one. We\u2019re on a network and it\u2019s the Super Bowl, so we have a limited amount of air time. You try to do a \u201cpreviously on\u201d to catch up new people to the show but it\u2019s hard to do in 30 seconds, so my recommendation is to, if this is a show that people have been looking forward to trying, to try to watch as fast as possible in the next two weeks. I think the episode can stand on its own because it\u2019s centered around this pinnacle event and every storyline in the present day feeds off of that, so as long as you have a general sense of who\u2019s who \u2026 I think that the performances are so strong and it\u2019s equal parts thrilling and heartbreaking and uplifting, that people, if it\u2019s their first time watching, will hopefully go with it.\n\nThe promo for the episode promised to answer everyone\u2019s questions, but what kind of questions will it answer?\n\nThe big question is everything involving and surrounding Jack\u2019s death: How did he die? When did he die? What was the cause of his death? How did it relate to Kate? Anything involving Jack\u2019s death, you get those answers in this episode.\n\nThe past season and a half has shown a lot about how Jack\u2019s death affected his kids, but it wasn\u2019t until the therapy scene in last week\u2019s episode that viewers saw how it affected Rebecca. Will there be more about how his death affects her?\n\nVery much. When you see Rebecca in the present day, the older version of Mandy, I\u2019ve always felt she\u2019s a lovely character, but there\u2019s a general sadness with which she carries herself that Mandy has brought to older Rebecca that younger Rebecca didn\u2019t quite have, and we start exploring that. Mandy is so extraordinary in these next two episodes, it\u2019s really tour de force, highest degree of difficulty stuff, and I\u2019m so incredibly proud of her and I can\u2019t wait. I think she\u2019s consistently underrated and overlooked in our show because the character is always holding down the fort, but the work she\u2019s doing as an actress in two different periods is so extraordinary, and it\u2019s a real showcase for her in the next couple of weeks.\n\nMaybe she\u2019ll get some award recognition too.\n\nWe\u2019re so thrilled that Milo and Chrissy and Sterling got nominations, but this year Justin is doing such incredible work and Mandy is just \u2014 I will kind of eat my hat if people don\u2019t stand up and take notice of this work.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nup_180616_0453_copy_-_embed_2018.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nup_181159_1160_copy_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nup_181159_0410_-_embed_2018.jpg?w=928"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nup_181159_1160_copy_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jean Bentley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/is-us-creator-everything-involving-jacks-death-will-be-answered-super-bowl-episode-1077863/", "title": "\u2018This Is Us\u2019 Creator: Everything Involving Jack\u2019s Death Will Be Answered in Super Bowl Episode", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Dan Fogelman talks with THR about Tuesday's big reveal and how he plans to make the NBC family drama accessible for a post-Super Bowl audience.", "news_keywords": "Dan Fogelman, This Is Us", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Jean Bentley", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1077863, "title": "'This Is Us' Creator: Everything Involving Jack's Death Will Be Answered in Super Bowl Episode", "published_at": "2018-01-24 10:39:48", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/nup_181159_1160_copy_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "This Is Us", "topics": "TV News", "body": "[This story contains spoilers from the Jan. 23 \"That'll Be the Day\" episode of NBC's This Is Us.]\r\nFrom the beginning, audiences have known that Milo Ventimiglia's family man Jack Pearson was not alive in the present day on This Is Us.
