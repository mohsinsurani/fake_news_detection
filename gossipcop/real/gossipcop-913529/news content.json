The former athlete has sported a lighter skin tone for years, but his most recent picture further confused netizens: Not only was Sosa\u2019s skin lighter, he was wearing a red cowboy hat and a country Western shirt.\n\nBarstool Sports podcast host Dan Katz was a fan of \u201ccowboy Sammy.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe craziest part about the Cowboy Sammy picture is that I just assumed it was an old picture because the \u2018weird Sammy Sosa picture\u2019 catalogue has gotten so big nothing new shocks me,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nKeep up with this story and more by subscribing now\n\nCowboy Sammy is such a God Damn G. #BringSammyBack pic.twitter.com/lhSLPGuIz8 \u2014 Big Cat (@BarstoolBigCat) February 11, 2018\n\nWhile Katz might be numb to Sosa\u2019s new look, not many Twitter users shared the same opinion. Plenty were still shocked to see the former Chicago Cubs star with lighter skin.\n\nSammy Sosa outchea looking like a peppermint in the bottom of my purse. https://t.co/PXWOB05PWK \u2014 April (@ReignOfApril) February 11, 2018\n\nSammy Sosa looking like Peter Griffin pic.twitter.com/MGgxetHeiK \u2014 Cameron Grant (@coolcam101) February 11, 2018\n\nI need a #30For30 documentary on the decline of Sammy Sosa mental health cuz this is ridiculous pic.twitter.com/ckyXR2axIp \u2014 Desmond James (@james_desmond) February 11, 2018\n\nSo why is Sosa in a cowboy getup? On Saturday, he went to a Western-themed party for wife Sonia\u2019s birthday. The Instagram account for the Univision show El Gordo y la Flaca showed more than a dozen pictures and videos of Sosa enjoying the party with his wife.\n\nBorn in the Dominican Republic, Sosa had darker skin when he first garnered fame in the MLB, hitting 609 homeruns in his career.\n\nIn 2009, Sosa addressed his complexion, saying he used skin bleaching cream.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a bleaching cream that I apply before going to bed and whitens my skin tone,\u201d Sosa told Univision\u2019s Primer Impacto show. \u201cIt\u2019s a cream that I have, that I use to soften [my skin], but has bleached me some. I\u2019m not a racist, I live my life happily.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened was that I had been using the cream for a long time and that, combined with the bright TV lights, made my face look whiter than it really is. I don\u2019t think I look like Michael Jackson,\u201d he added.\n\nSosa isn\u2019t the only celebrity to be accused of lightening his skin. Though they never addressed it, stars like Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Eva Longoria, Lil' Kim and Jennifer Lopez were suspected of altering their complexion to appear lighter.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180212002523im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2018/01/25/former-miami-marlins-hitting-coach-barry-bonds..jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180212002523im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/07/14/sama-sosa-shocked-fans-when-he-appeared-new-interview-incredible-lighter-appearance_0.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180212002523im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/02/11/sammy-sosa.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180212002523im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/thumbnail/public/2017/11/07/sammy-sosa-appears-looking-whiter-ever.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180212002523im_/http://s.newsweek.com/sites/www.newsweek.com/files/styles/full/public/2018/02/11/sammy-sosa.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180212002523/http://www.newsweek.com/cowboy-sammy-sosa-white-skin-light-what-happened-802819", "title": "What Happened To \u2018Cowboy\u2019 Sammy Sosa?
