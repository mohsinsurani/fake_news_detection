For other people with the same name, see Stephen Curry (disambiguation)\n\nWardell Stephen Curry II ( STEF-\u0259n; born March 14, 1988)[1] is an American professional basketball player for the Golden State Warriors of the National Basketball Association (NBA). Widely regarded as one of the greatest basketball players of all time, and as the greatest shooter in NBA history,[2] Curry is credited with revolutionizing the sport by inspiring teams and players to take more three-point shots.[3][4][5] An eight-time NBA All-Star and eight-time All-NBA selection, including four times on the first team, he has been named the NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP) twice, has won four NBA championships, and received an NBA Finals MVP Award and an NBA All-Star Game MVP Award.\n\nCurry is the son of former NBA player Dell Curry and the older brother of current NBA player Seth Curry. He played college basketball for the Davidson Wildcats, where he set career scoring records for Davidson and the Southern Conference, was twice named conference player of the year, and set the single-season NCAA record during his sophomore year for most three-pointers made. Curry was selected by the Warriors with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft.\n\nIn 2014\u201315, Curry won his first league MVP award and led the Warriors to their first championship since 1975. The following season, he became the first player to be elected MVP by a unanimous vote and lead the league in scoring while shooting above 50\u201340\u201390. That same year, the Warriors broke the record for the most wins in an NBA season en route to reaching the 2016 NBA Finals, which they lost to the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games. Curry helped the Warriors return to the NBA Finals in 2017, 2018, 2019, and 2022, winning back-to-back titles in 2017 and 2018, being defeated by the Toronto Raptors in 2019. After missing the playoffs in 2020 and 2021, Curry won a fourth championship with the Warriors against the Boston Celtics in 2022, and was named Finals MVP.\n\nDuring the 2012\u201313 season, Curry set the NBA record for three-pointers made in a regular season, with 272. He surpassed that record in 2015 with 286, and again in 2016 with 402. On December 14, 2021, Curry set the NBA record for career three-pointers, passing Ray Allen.[6] For their shooting abilities, Curry and teammate Klay Thompson have earned the nickname of the Splash Brothers; in 2013\u201314, they set the record for combined three-pointers made in an NBA season with 484, a record they broke the following season (525), and again in the 2015\u201316 season (678).\n\nEarly life\n\nCurry is the son of Sonya and Dell Curry. He was born in Akron, Ohio, at Summa Akron City Hospital, while his father was a member of the Cleveland Cavaliers.[7][8] He grew up in Charlotte, North Carolina, where his father spent most of his NBA career with the Charlotte Hornets.[9] Dell often took Curry and his younger brother Seth to his games, where they would shoot with the Hornets during warm-ups.[10] The family briefly moved to Toronto, where Dell finished out his career as a member of the Raptors.[9] During this time, Curry played for the Queensway Christian College boys' basketball team, leading them to an undefeated season.[11][12] He was also a member of Toronto 5\u20130, a club team that plays across Ontario,[13][14] pitting him against fellow future NBA players Cory Joseph and Kelly Olynyk.[14] Curry led the team to a 33\u20134 record, en route to winning the provincial championship.[15]\n\nAfter Dell's retirement, the family moved back to Charlotte and Curry enrolled at Charlotte Christian School, where he was named all-conference and all-state, and led his team to three conference titles and three state playoff appearances. Because of his father's storied career at Virginia Tech, Curry wanted to play college basketball for the Hokies, but was only offered a walk-on spot due in part to his slender 160-pound frame.[16] He ultimately chose to attend Davidson College, who had aggressively recruited him from the tenth grade.[17]\n\nCollege career\n\nFreshman season\n\nBefore Curry even played in his first game for the Wildcats, head coach Bob McKillop praised him at a Davidson alumni event, saying: \"Wait 'til you see Steph Curry. He is something special.\"[18] In his first collegiate game, against Eastern Michigan, Curry finished with 15 points but committed 13 turnovers. In the next game, against Michigan, he scored 32 points, dished out four assists, and grabbed nine rebounds. Curry finished the season leading the Southern Conference in scoring with 21.5 points per game. He was second in the nation among freshmen in scoring, behind only Kevin Durant of Texas. Curry's scoring helped the Wildcats to a 29\u20135 overall record and a Southern Conference regular-season title. On March 2, 2007, in the Southern Conference tournament semi-finals against Furman, Curry made his 113th three-point field goal of the year, breaking Keydren Clark's NCAA freshman season record for three-pointers.[19]\n\nCurry eclipsed the school freshman scoring record with his 502nd point against Chattanooga on February 6, 2007.[20] On March 15, 2007, Davidson marched into the NCAA tournament as a 13th seed set to play Maryland; despite Curry's game-high 30 points, Davidson lost 82\u201370.[21] At the end of his freshman season, Curry was named Southern Conference Freshman of the Year, SoCon Tournament MVP, and selected to the SoCon All-tournament team, All-freshman team, and first-team All-SoCon.[22] He was also honorable mention in Sports Illustrated's All-Mid-Major. After the season ended, he was selected for the USA team to appear at the 2007 FIBA U19 World Championships in which he averaged 9.4 points, 3.8 rebounds, and 2.2 assists in 19.4 minutes, helping Team USA to a silver medal finish.[23]\n\nSophomore season\n\nCurry at the 2008 NCAA tournament\n\nIn his sophomore season in 2007\u201308, Curry had grown to his adult height of 6 ft 3 in (1.91 m) and again led the Southern Conference in scoring, averaging 25.5 points per game while adding 4.7 rebounds per game and 2.8 assists per game. He led the Wildcats to a 26\u20136 regular-season record, and a 20\u20130 conference record. As a result of Curry's exceptional play, Davidson earned its third straight NCAA tournament bid.\n\nOn March 21, 2008, Davidson matched up with seventh-seeded Gonzaga. Gonzaga led by 11 points early in the second half but Curry went on to score 30 points in the half[24] to push Davidson to their first NCAA Tournament win since 1969, 82\u201376. Curry ended the game with 40 points while also going 8-for-10 from three-point range.[25] On March 23, Davidson played second-seeded Georgetown in the second round of the NCAA Tournament. Georgetown, ranked eighth nationally, entered the game as a heavy favorite after an appearance in the Final Four in 2007. Curry managed just five points in the first half of the game as Davidson trailed by as many as 17 points, but his 25 second-half points led Davidson to a 74\u201370 comeback victory.[24]\n\nOn March 28, 2008, Curry led Davidson to another win, against third-seeded Wisconsin. Curry scored 33 points as Davidson won 73\u201356 to advance to the Elite 8.[26] Curry joined Clyde Lovellette, Jerry Chambers, and Glenn Robinson as the only college players to score over 30 points in their first four career NCAA tournament games.[26] Curry also tied Darrin Fitzgerald of Butler for the single-season record for most three-pointers with 158.[27][28] On March 30, 2008, he set the record, against the top-seeded Kansas Jayhawks, with his 159th three-pointer of the season. Curry scored 25 points in the game but Davidson lost 57\u201359, and the Jayhawks went on to win the championship.[29]\n\nCurry finished the season averaging 25.9 points, 2.9 assists, and 2.1 steals per game. He was named to the Associated Press' All-America Second Team on March 31, 2008.[30] He also was named the Most Outstanding Player of the Midwest Region of the 2008 NCAA tournament, becoming the first player from a team not making the Final Four to do so since Juwan Howard of Michigan in 1994.[31] Curry was nominated for an ESPY in the Breakthrough Player of the Year category.[32]\n\nJunior season\n\nAfter Davidson's loss against Kansas in the NCAA Regional Finals, Curry announced that he would return for his junior year.[27] He stated that he wanted to develop as a point guard, his likely position in the NBA. On November 18, 2008, Curry scored a career-high 44 points in Davidson's 82\u201378 loss to Oklahoma.[33] He extended a career-long streak by scoring at least 25 points for the seventh straight game.[33] On November 21, Curry registered a career-high 13 assists, to go along with 30 points, in Davidson's 97\u201370 win over Winthrop.[34] On November 25, against Loyola, Curry was held scoreless as Loyola constantly double-teamed him. It was Curry's only scoreless collegiate game and just his second without double-digit points. He finished 0-for-3 from the field as Davidson won the game 78\u201348.[35] In Davidson's next game (11 days later), Curry matched his career high of 44 in a 72\u201367 win over North Carolina State.[36]\n\nCurry surpassed the 2000-point mark for his career on January 3, 2009, as he scored 21 points against Samford.[37] On February 14, 2009, Curry rolled his ankle in the second half of a win over Furman. The injury caused Curry to miss the February 18 game against The Citadel, the first and only game he missed in his college career.[38] On February 28, 2009, Curry became Davidson's all-time leading scorer with 34 points in a 99\u201356 win against Georgia Southern. That gave Curry 2,488 points for his career, surpassing previous school leader John Gerdy.[39] Davidson won the 2008\u201309 Southern Conference regular season championship for the south division, finishing 18\u20132 in the conference.[40][41]\n\nIn the 2009 Southern Conference Tournament, Davidson played Appalachian State in the quarterfinals and won 84\u201368. Curry scored 43 points, which is the third most points in Southern Conference tournament history.[42] In the semifinals, against the College of Charleston, Curry had 20 points but Davidson lost 52\u201359. Despite lobbying from Davidson head coach Bob McKillop and Charleston coach Bobby Cremins,[43] the Wildcats failed to get an NCAA tournament bid. Instead, they received the sixth seed in the 2009 NIT. Davidson played the third seed, South Carolina, on the road in the first round. Curry scored 32 points as the Wildcats beat the Gamecocks 70\u201363.[44][45] Davidson then fell 68\u201380 to the Saint Mary's Gaels in the second round. Curry registered 26 points, nine rebounds, and five assists in what was his final game for the Wildcats.[46]\n\nIn his final season at Davidson, Curry averaged 28.6 points, 5.6 assists, and 2.5 steals. He was the NCAA scoring leader and was named a consensus first team All-American.[47] Curry opted out of his senior year at Davidson, but he stated that he still planned to earn his degree.[48] He completed his bachelor\u2019s degree in sociology in May 2022.[49] Curry's completion of his degree qualified him for jersey or number retirement; Davidson reserves that honor for players who complete their degrees at the school. In a ceremony held on August 31, 2022, Curry became the first Davidson player to have his number retired (six others have jerseys retired, but their numbers remain in circulation). At the ceremony, he also entered Davidson's athletic hall of fame and physically received his Davidson diploma.[50][51]\n\nProfessional career\n\nGolden State Warriors (2009\u2013present)\n\nEarly years (2009\u20132012)\n\nOn June 25, 2009, Curry was selected with the seventh overall pick in the 2009 NBA draft by the Golden State Warriors.[52] He appeared in 80 games (77 starts) during the 2009\u201310 season, averaging 17.5 points, 4.5 rebounds, 5.9 assists and 1.90 steals in 36.2 minutes.[53] His second half of the season vaulted him into the rookie of the year race.[54] He was named Western Conference Rookie of the Month for January, March and April, finishing as the only Western Conference rookie to win the award three times.[53] He finished runner-up for the NBA Rookie of the Year Award behind Tyreke Evans[54] and was a unanimous NBA All-Rookie First Team selection, becoming the first Warriors player since Jason Richardson in 2001\u201302 to earn All-Rookie First Team honors.[53] He scored 30-plus points eight times, setting the most 30-point games by any rookie in 2009\u201310 and the most since LeBron James had 13 and Carmelo Anthony had 10 in 2003\u201304. Curry had five 30-point/10-assist games, which tied Michael Jordan for the second-most 30-point/10-assist games by a rookie (Oscar Robertson is first with 25). He became just the sixth rookie in NBA history to post a 35-point, 10-assist, 10-rebound game when he registered his first career triple-double with 36 points, 13 assists and 10 rebounds against the Los Angeles Clippers on February 10. In the Warriors' season finale against the Portland Trail Blazers on April 14, Curry recorded a then career-high 42 points, nine rebounds and eight assists, becoming the first rookie since Robertson in February 1961 to register at least those numbers in each category in the same game. Curry finished his rookie season with 166 three-pointers, which were the most ever by a rookie in NBA history.[53]\n\nCurry in March 2011\n\nIn 2010\u201311, Curry appeared in 74 games (all starts), averaging 18.6 points, 3.9 rebounds, 5.8 assists and 1.47 steals in 33.6 minutes per contest.[53] His free throw percentage of .934 (212\u2013227 FT) established a new Warriors single-season record, surpassing the previous mark of .924 set by Rick Barry in 1977\u201378. He also became the first Warriors player to lead the NBA in free throw percentage since Mark Price in 1996\u201397.[53] Curry registered 20-or-more points 35 times, including seven 30-plus performances. He posted a season-high 39 points and a then career-high 14 field goals (on 20 FGA) against the Oklahoma City Thunder on December 5. In February 2011, during All-Star Weekend, Curry won the Skills Challenge[55] and registered 13 points, eight assists and six rebounds in 28 minutes as a member of the Sophomore squad in the Rookie Challenge.[53] In May 2011, he was named the recipient of the NBA Sportsmanship Award,[56] and underwent surgery on his right ankle.[57]\n\nIn the lockout-shortened 2011\u201312 season, Curry appeared in 26 games (23 starts), averaging 14.7 points, 3.4 rebounds, 5.3 assists and 1.50 steals in 28.2 minutes per contest. He missed 40 games due to right ankle and foot injuries,[53] including the last 28 games with a sprained right ankle and subsequent surgery on the ankle, which was performed on April 25.[58]\n\nFirst All-Star and playoff appearances (2012\u20132014)\n\nPrior to the start of the 2012\u201313 season, Curry signed a four-year, $44 million contract extension with the Warriors.[59][60] At the time, many basketball writers considered the move risky for Golden State because of Curry's injury history.[61] Over the course of the year, Curry and backcourt teammate Klay Thompson gained a reputation for their perimeter scoring, earning them the nickname the \"Splash Brothers\".[62] In 2012\u201313, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 22.9 points (seventh in NBA) and 6.9 assists to go with 4.0 rebounds and 1.62 steals in 38.2 minutes.[53] He established a new NBA single-season three-point record with 272 three-pointers, eclipsing the previous mark set by Ray Allen (269 in 2005\u201306), doing so on 53 less attempts than Allen did with Seattle.[53]\n\nCurry earned Western Conference Player of the Month honors for the month of April, averaging 25.4 points, 8.1 assists, 3.9 rebounds and 2.13 steals in eight games in the final month of the season to become the third Warrior to ever win the award, joining Chris Mullin (November 1990 and January 1989) and Bernard King (January 1981). He tallied two of the NBA's top six scoring games with 54 points on February 27 at New York and 47 on April 12 at Los Angeles, becoming the first Warrior to score 45-plus at New York and Los Angeles in the same season since Rick Barry in 1966, joining Barry, Guy Rodgers, and Wilt Chamberlain as the only four Warriors to do so. Curry's 54 points against the Knicks included a career-best and franchise-record 11 three-pointers, becoming the first player in NBA history to score 50-plus points while hitting 10-plus three-pointers in a game. It was the most scored by a Warrior since Purvis Short tallied 59 points in 1984. In 2013, he appeared in the playoffs for the first time in his career, with the Warriors earning the sixth seed in the Western Conference. In 12 playoff games (all starts), he averaged 23.4 points, 8.1 assists and 3.8 rebounds. He set a new franchise record with 42 playoff three-pointers, eclipsing the Warriors' career playoff mark of 29 previously held by Jason Richardson, giving him a total of 314 three-pointers for the season to become the first player in NBA history to hit at least 300 threes in a single season.[53]\n\nCurry in April 2014\n\nIn 2013\u201314, Curry appeared in 78 games (all starts), averaging career highs of 24.0 points (seventh in the NBA) and 8.5 assists (fifth) to go with 4.3 rebounds and 1.63 steals, becoming the first player in Warriors history to average 24 points and eight assists in a single season (ninth player in NBA history). He led the league in three-pointers made for a second consecutive season with 261 (fourth-most ever in a single season), the first player since Ray Allen in 2001\u201302 and 2002\u201303 to lead the league in threes in back-to-back seasons. He was named Western Conference Player of the Month for April and earned All-NBA Second Team honors, becoming the first Warriors player named to the First or Second Team since 1993\u201394.[53] On December 7 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry eclipsed Jason Richardson (700) as the franchise's leader in career three-pointers.[63] In February, he made his first All-Star appearance,[64] becoming the Warriors' first All-Star starter since Latrell Sprewell in 1995.[53] He scored a season-high 47 points on April 13 against the Portland Trail Blazers for his third 40-point game of the year. He finished the regular season tied for second in the NBA in triple-doubles with four, the most by a Warrior in a single season since Chamberlain had five in 1963\u201364.[53] Seeded sixth for the second consecutive postseason, the Warriors were defeated in seven games by the Los Angeles Clippers.[65]\n\nNBA championship and MVP (2014\u20132015)\n\n[66] Curry about to pass while being guarded by John Wall and Nen\u00ea of the Washington Wizards . Curry averaged 7.7 assists per game during the 2014\u201315 regular season, good enough for sixth-best in the league.\n\nPrior to the start of the 2014\u201315 season, the Warriors hired former NBA player and general manager Steve Kerr as their new head coach.[67] Kerr implemented significant changes to Golden State's schemes, including playing at a faster pace and giving Curry more freedom to shoot, helping the team evolve into a title contender.[68] On February 4, Curry scored a season-high 51 points in a win over the Dallas Mavericks.[69] He was the leading vote-getter for the All-Star Game and won the Three-Point Contest on All-Star Saturday night.[70][71] On April 9, he broke his own league record for three-pointers made in a season during a game against the Portland Trail Blazers.[72] The Warriors finished the year with 67 wins and Curry was voted the NBA Most Valuable Player after posting averages of 23.8 points, 7.7 assists and 2 steals per game.[73] Over the course of the season, he sat out 17 fourth quarters due to Golden State's wide margins of victory.[74]\n\nIn Game 5 of the Conference Semifinals against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry became the first player in league history to register 6 three-pointers and six steals in a game.[75] In Game 6, he made a playoff career-high 8 three-pointers en route to a series-clinching victory.[76] In Game 3 of the Conference Finals against the Houston Rockets, he broke the NBA record for most three-pointers made in a single postseason.[77][78] The Warriors went on to defeat the Rockets to earn a Finals matchup with the Cleveland Cavaliers, where Curry struggled to start the series, converting on only 22 percent of his field goals in Game 2.[79] In Game 5, he scored 37 points,[80] and in Game 6, Golden State closed out the series to win their first championship in 40 years.[81] For the Finals, Curry averaged 26 points and 6.3 assists per game.[80] The Warrior's playoff run was the first in which an All-NBA first team selection eliminated all other first team selections in on the way to a championship.[82]\n\nUnanimous MVP and historic season (2015\u20132016)\n\nCurry in February 2016\n\nTo start the 2015\u201316 season, Curry became the first player since Michael Jordan in 1989\u201390 to score 118 points in his team's first three games,[83] including a season-high 53 points against the New Orleans Pelicans in the third game.[84] The Warriors made NBA history on November 24 when they became the first team ever to start 16\u20130 with a win over the Los Angeles Lakers,[85] before improving to 24\u20130 on December 11 with a double-overtime win over the Boston Celtics.[86] Their streak was broken the following day against the Milwaukee Bucks.[87] On December 28, Curry recorded his sixth career triple-double with 23 points, a career-high 14 rebounds and 10 assists in a 122\u2013103 win over the Sacramento Kings. During the game against the Kings, Curry was guarded by his brother Seth for the first time in their NBA careers.[88] On January 22, he recorded his second triple-double of the season with 39 points, 12 assists and 10 rebounds in a 122\u2013110 win over the Indiana Pacers. He made 8 three-pointers in the game to reach 200 for the season, becoming the first player in NBA history to make 200 three-pointers in four straight seasons.[89] On February 3, he made 11 three-pointers (including seven in the first quarter) and scored 51 points (including a career-high 36 points in the first half) to lead the Warriors past the Washington Wizards 134\u2013121. His 51 points tied Gilbert Arenas and Michael Jordan for the Verizon Center record.[90]\n\nDuring the 2016 NBA All-Star Weekend, Curry competed in his third straight All-Star game for the West, and competed in the Three-Point Contest, where he lost in the final round to teammate Klay Thompson. At 48\u20134, the Warriors entered the All-Star break with the best record through 52 games in NBA history, one win better than the 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls and 1966\u201367 Philadelphia 76ers.[91]\n\nOn February 25, Curry made 10 three-pointers and scored 51 points to lead the Warriors past the Orlando Magic 130\u2013114. Curry topped 50 points for the third time in 2015\u201316, the first player to do it that many times since LeBron James and Dwyane Wade did so in 2008\u201309. Curry also surpassed Kyle Korver's mark of 127 straight games with a three-pointer.[92] With only one made free throw, Curry set a record for fewest free throws in a 50+ game.[82] In the following game two days later, the Warriors defeated the Oklahoma City Thunder in overtime thanks to a Curry three-pointer with 0.6 seconds remaining; tying the NBA single-game record with Kobe Bryant and Donyell Marshall, Curry finished with 46 points as his winning shot was his 12th three-pointer.[93] He also broke his own NBA record for threes in a season, leaving the new mark at 288.[94] On March 7, in a win over the Magic, Curry scored 41 points and became the first player in NBA history to make 300 regular-season three-pointers.[95] On April 1, Curry missed a three-pointer to tie the game against the Celtics with 5.3 seconds left, as the Warriors suffered their first home defeat since January 27, 2015, snapping an NBA-record 54-game winning streak in the regular season at Oracle Arena.[96] On April 7, Curry scored 27 points to help the Warriors become the second team in NBA history to win 70 games in a season with a 112\u2013101 win over the San Antonio Spurs.[97] Three days later in a rematch against the Spurs, Stephen Curry scored 37 points in a 92\u201386 win, not only tying the 1996 Bulls, but snapping San Antonio's undefeated home streak and also end a long losing streak in AT&T Center.[98]\n\nIn the Warriors' regular-season finale on April 13 against the Memphis Grizzlies, Curry achieved another shooting milestone, becoming the first player to make 400 three-pointers in a season by knocking down 10 from long range on his way to 46 points and 402 total three-pointers. With a 125\u2013104 win over the Grizzlies, the Warriors became the first 73-win team in NBA history, surpassing the 1995\u201396 Chicago Bulls' 72\u201310 record to finish the 2015\u201316 season with just nine losses.[99] With the conclusion of the regular season, Curry became the seventh player in NBA history to join the 50\u201340\u201390 club, representing the shooting percentages from the field (.504), beyond the arc (.454), and the free-throw line (.908).[100] The league's leading scorer at 30.1 points per game, he posted the highest scoring average in the first 29 50\u201340\u201390 seasons.[82] Curry was named the league's first ever unanimous MVP, becoming the 11th player in NBA history to win the award in consecutive seasons and the first guard to do so since Steve Nash in 2004\u201305 and 2005\u201306.[101] His scoring average increase of 6.3 is the largest ever by a reigning MVP.[82]\n\nIn the 2016 playoffs, the Warriors defeated the Houston Rockets in the first round despite Curry only playing in the first half of Games 1 and 4 due to injury.[102][103][104] A right MCL injury kept him out of the first three games of the second round.[105] In Game 4 of the second-round series against the Portland Trail Blazers, Curry came off the bench to score 40 points in a 132\u2013125 overtime win;[106] 17 of those points came in the extra period, an NBA record for points scored by an individual in overtime.[107] Curry led the Warriors to a 4\u20131 victory over the Trail Blazers, as they moved on to the Western Conference Finals to face the Oklahoma City Thunder. After going down 3\u20131, he helped the Warriors rally to win the series 4\u20133 and advance to their second straight NBA Finals.[108]\n\nIn the Finals, Curry's play relative to his regular season performance remained inconsistent, as it had been since he returned from injury against Portland;[109] still, he broke Danny Green's record of 27 three-pointers made in a Finals.[110] Despite being up 3\u20131 in the series, the Warriors were defeated by the Cleveland Cavaliers in seven games and became the first team in NBA Finals history to lose a series after leading 3\u20131.

On October 30, 2019, against the Phoenix Suns in the fourth game of the season, Curry drove to the basket and collided with the Suns' Aron Baynes, who was trying to take a charge. Baynes fell on Curry's left hand, which required surgery to repair his broken second metacarpal. He was expected to be out at least three months.[179] On March 5, 2020, Curry returned against the Raptors and recorded 23 points, six rebounds and seven assists in a 121\u2013113 Warriors' loss.[180]\n\nOn December 27, 2020, Curry put up 36 points in a 129\u2013128 win over the Chicago Bulls.

Curry also had 78 three-pointers during that span, the most in NBA history over 11 regular season games.[192] His play rekindled talk of him being a candidate for his third MVP award.[192][193] He was named the Western Conference Player of the Month for April after averaging 37.3 points (the oldest player in NBA history to average more than 35 points per game in a single month) on 51.8% shooting and scoring 30 or more points in 13 of his 15 games.

He was named the NBA Finals MVP unanimously after averaging 31.2 points, 6.0 rebounds, 5.0 assists, and 2.0 steals per game.[215]\n\nNational team career\n\nCurry at the 2014 USA World Basketball Festival\n\nCurry's first experience with the United States national team came at the 2007 FIBA Under-19 World Championship, where he helped Team USA capture the silver medal.[216] In 2010, he was selected to the senior squad, playing limited minutes at the 2010 FIBA World Championship (known later as FIBA Basketball World Cup) as the United States won the gold medal in an undefeated tournament.[217] In 2014, he took on a larger role with the team, helping them to another undefeated tournament at the 2014 World Cup and scoring 10 points in the final game.[218] On June 6, 2016, Curry withdrew from consideration for the 2016 Olympics in Brazil, citing ankle and knee ailments as the major reason behind the decision.[219]\n\nPlayer profile\n\nListed at 6 feet 2 inches (1.88 m) and 190 pounds (86 kg), Curry plays almost exclusively at the point guard position and has career averages of 24.3 points, 6.5 assists, 4.6 rebounds, and 1.7 steals per game.[73][220] His career free throw percentage of 90.8% (through the end of the 2021\u201322 season) is the highest in NBA history.[221][220] Curry is the Warriors' all-time free-throw leader, and has led the NBA in free throw percentage four times.[222] He has been selected to eight All-NBA Teams and voted league MVP twice.[73] A leader within the Warriors organization,[223][224] he helped recruit former MVP Kevin Durant to the Warriors.[224][225]\n\nCurry led the league in steals in the 2015\u201316 season,[226] but has been criticized for his defense.[227][228] He is used more for his offense while his teammates, Klay Thompson and Draymond Green, take on more defensive assignments.[228] Some analysts, including Ethan Sherwood Strauss of ESPN, have complimented his defensive play or called is underrated.[227][229] Strauss said in 2015 that Curry became \"one of the NBA's most effective defenders \u2013 ranking fifth among point guards in defensive real plus-minus.\"[229]\n\nCurry scores a lot from underneath the rim all the way to near half-court.[230] Using an unorthodox jump shot, he is gets the ball from his hands in under half a second by releasing it on the way up, adding extra arc to his shot and making it difficult to block.[231] The shooting proficiency earned him the nickname \"Baby-Faced Assassin\" during his pre-NBA years,[232] and \"Chef Curry\" while in the NBA.[233] He is also known for his ball handling and playmaking,[234] and for putting pressure on defenses with his long range, leading the NBA in field goals made from beyond 28 feet in 2016.[235] A clutch scorer, he often shoots at his best in high-pressure moments, and takes game-winning shots.[236][237]\n\nCurry ranks 12th in NBA history in career three-point field goal percentage and holds four of the top five seasons in terms of total three-pointers made.[238][239][240] He is also the fastest player in league history to make 2,000 career three-pointers, doing so in 227 fewer games than the previous record-holder, Ray Allen.[130] Additionally, Curry is the fastest player to make 100 three-pointers in a season, doing so in just 19 games, breaking his own previous record of 20 games.[241]\n\nNBA analysts say that Curry's scoring creates a \"gravity\" effect, forcing opposing defenders to double-team him even when he does not have the ball, which creates mismatches that his teammates exploit.[242][243] With Curry, the Warriors average 10.8 isolations per game; without Curry, they average 15.3 isolations per game. His absence slows the Warriors offense and leads to less passing and ball movement. With Curry, the Warriors average 1.05 points every shot that comes after an off-ball screen; without Curry, it drops to 0.95 points per game. His absence makes it much easier for defenders to switch on screens. Of Curry's success with or without other elite teammates, Tom Haberstroh of NBC Sports said, \"You can pluck All-Star after All-Star off the court like flower petals, and the Steph-led Warriors will still dominate like a champion. He's that transcendent of a player.\"[244]\n\nLegacy\n\nCurry in 2011\n\nCurry is widely considered to be the greatest shooter in NBA history.[2][245][246] He is credited with revolutionizing the game of basketball by inspiring teams, from high school to the NBA, to regularly use the three-point shot.[3][4][5] Analysts have referred to him as \"the Michael Jordan of the three-point era\", saying that he did for the three-point shot what Jordan did for the slam dunk.[247][248][249] The Guardian's Robert O'Connell cites Curry's February 27, 2013, game against the New York Knicks, in which he made 11 of 13 shots from behind the arc en route for a 54-point performance, as the start of the three-point era.[250] The era has been referred to as \"The Steph Effect\"[5] or \"the NBA's Three-Point Revolution\".[251]\n\nBefore Curry, shooting behind the three-point line was more of a novelty, an occasional way of scoring.[246][252] Catch and shoot players existed, but Curry's success inspired the league to abandon physical play around the basket and to embrace a pace and space and three-point shooting style.[252] The increase in three-point shooting is partly due to NBA teams incorporating it in their attempts to defeat the Warriors or copy the Warriors' style of play, and to young people wanting to imitate Curry's shooting range.[5][250] Although this has led to players becoming good at or improving their three-point shot, it has also set unrealistic standards because Curry's range is unique.[5] Curry regularly takes shots from between 30 and 35 feet.[246] He shoots 54 percent from this range, while the NBA makes 35 percent of its threes overall and under 22 percent from between 30 and 35 feet.[246] He can make the shots with elite ball handling, off the dribble, and often with an extremely quick release, from anywhere on the court and with one or more defenders on him.[252] Curry said that he is sure coaches tell their high school players that shooting the way he does takes work and time.[5] Jesse Dougherty of The Washington Post stated that \"coaches have to explain that while Curry's skill set is something to aspire to, his game is built on fundamentals\" and that \"while the Warriors have become the NBA's gold standard and make all those social-media-bound plays, the root of their success is ball movement.\"[5]\n\nKirk Goldsberry of ESPN opined that \"one of the keys to [Curry's] greatness is his range\" and that \"Curry isn't just the best 3-point shooter ever, he's the best deep 3-point shooter ever.\"[246] Sally Jenkins of The Washington Post stated that he \"moves around behind the three-point line in an ever-widening arc, sinking long distance shots so cleanly that the net seems to snap like fresh laundry in a breeze\" and that a highlight is the \"sheer preposterousness of his shots, and the rate at which he is sinking the most far-fetched of them.\" She said that \"in one stretch he hit a mind-expanding 67 percent between 28 and 50 feet.\"[234] Warriors Coach Steve Kerr stated that Curry's hand-eye coordination \"is as great as anyone I've ever seen.\"[234] Jeff Austin of Octagon concluded that Curry \"had to develop tremendous strength in his wrists to shoot and maintain that form from 40 and 50 feet.\"[234] Goldsberry stated that \"no player in the history of the NBA has combined range, volume and efficiency from downtown as well as Curry\" and that \"Curry's jumper is so lethal that he has become the most efficient volume scorer on the planet.\"[246] His range and efficiency drove the developers of the NBA 2K video game series, in which Curry is featured, to worry that his abilities could not be replicated on screen.[252]\n\nWhere Curry ranks as one of the greatest NBA players has been more subject to debate.[253] Former NBA player Steve Nash, who is also among the NBA's all-time efficient shooters, said Curry is \"already an all-time great\" and that people question his greatness \"because he doesn't dominate the game physically. He dances. He pays a tax for that. He pays a tax for his great teammates.\"[253] Scottie Pippen, who won six NBA titles with the Chicago Bulls, said that Curry's \"willingness to sacrifice\" for Kevin Durant is \"one of the great stories in history\" because Curry welcomed Durant, who is also a top player, to the Warriors without ego. Crediting Curry with being \"one of the greatest guards the game has ever seen\", he said: \"If you have a mind for the game, you know that it takes sacrifice to be great. All the greats have to sacrifice something. Otherwise you can't win.\"[253] CBS Sports ranked Curry at No. 19 in their list of \"50 greatest NBA players of all time\".[254] Sports Illustrated ranked him at No. 3, behind Durant and LeBron James, on their \"Top 100 NBA Players of 2019\" list.[255] Sports Illustrated stated that \"Curry and the Warriors are a great match of player and system\" and that \"the entire ecosystem is predicated on the idea that a player doesn't need to dominate the ball to dominate a game. Curry took that noble idea and elevated it beyond any reasonable expectation.\"[255]\n\nIn 2020, an ESPN feature ranked Curry as the 13th-greatest basketball player of all time, the second-highest active player on the list. Nick Friedell of ESPN said \"The greatest shooter of all time. Curry's ability to hit shots from all over the floor changed the way the game is played. He has led the Warriors to three NBA championships and earned two MVP awards, becoming the first unanimous MVP in league history in 2015\u201316. Curry's influence on the game is seen on every level of basketball as younger generations shoot more than ever while trying to replicate his game.\"[256] In October 2021, Curry was honored as one of the league's greatest players of all time by being named to the NBA 75th Anniversary Team.[257]\n\nAwards and honors\n\nCurry during his first MVP season in 2014\u201315\n\nNBA\n\n[260]\n\nCollege\n\nNCAA records\n\nDavidson College records\n\nAll-time leading scorer in history (2,635) [261]\n\nAll-time leader in 3-point field-goals made (414) [262]\n\nAll-time leader in 30-point games (30) [263]\n\nAll-time leader in 40-point games (6) [263]\n\nSingle-season points (974, 2008\u201309) [264]\n\nSingle-season steals (86, 2008\u201309) [265]\n\nSingle-season freshman points (730, 2006\u201307)[264]\n\nOther\n\nCareer statistics\n\nLegend GP Games played GS Games started MPG Minutes per game FG% Field goal percentage 3P% 3-point field goal percentage FT% Free throw percentage RPG Rebounds per game APG Assists per game SPG Steals per game BPG Blocks per game PPG Points per game Bold Career high \u2020 Won an NBA championship * Led the league NBA record\n\nNBA\n\nRegular season\n\nPlayoffs\n\nCollege\n\nYear Team GP GS MPG FG% 3P% FT% RPG APG SPG BPG PPG 2006\u201307 Davidson 34 33 30.9 .463 .408 .855 4.6 2.8 1.8 .2 21.5 2007\u201308 Davidson 36 36 33.1 .483 .439 .894 4.6 2.9 2.0 .4 25.9 2008\u201309 Davidson 34 34 33.7 .454 .387 .876 4.4 5.6 2.5 .2 28.6* Career 104 103 32.6 .467 .412 .876 4.5 3.7 2.1 .3 25.3\n\nOff the court\n\nPersonal life\n\nFormer President Barack Obama with Curry during a visit to the White House in 2015 to launch the president's initiative on malaria\n\nOn July 30, 2011, Curry married longtime girlfriend and Toronto-area native Ayesha Alexander in Charlotte.[12][13][276] Together, they have two daughters who were born in 2012 and 2015,[277][278] and a son who was born in 2018.[279] In July 2019, Curry paid $31 million for a home in Atherton, California.[280] Curry's younger brother, Seth, is also a professional basketball player,[281] and his younger sister, Sydel, played volleyball at Elon University.[282]\n\nCurry has been outspoken about his Christian faith.[283][284] He spoke about his faith during his MVP speech by saying: \"People should know who I represent and why I am who I am, and that's because of my Lord and Savior.\" He also said the reason that he pounds his chest and points up is that he has a \"heart for God\" and as a reminder that he plays for God.[285] On some of his \"Curry One\" basketball shoes, there is a lace loop scripted \"4:13\". It is a reference to the Bible verse Philippians 4:13, which reads: \"I can do all things through Christ who strengthens me.\"[286][287] Curry has a tattoo of First Corinthians 13:8 in Hebrew on his wrist (\"Love never fails...\").[288] Curry is also an investor in Active Faith, a Christian sports apparel brand.[289][290]\n\nDuring the 1992 NBA All-Star Game weekend, Curry's father entrusted him to Biserka Petrovi\u0107, mother of future Hall of Fame player Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107, while Dell competed in the Three-Point Contest. Following the 2015 NBA Finals, Curry gave Biserka one of his Finals-worn jerseys, which will reportedly be added to the collection of the Dra\u017een Petrovi\u0107 Memorial Center, a museum to the late player in the Croatian capital of Zagreb.[291]\n\nCurry suffers from keratoconus and wears contact lenses to correct his vision.[292] Curry is also an avid golfer; he started playing golf at the age of 10, played golf in high school, and frequently plays golf with teammate Andre Iguodala.[293][294][295] A 5-handicap golfer, Curry participates in celebrity golf tournaments and has played golf alongside Barack Obama.[296][297][298] In August 2017, Curry competed in the Ellie Mae Classic on an unrestricted sponsor exemption.[299] Although he missed the first cut, he scored 4-over-74 for both days he participated, surpassing most expectations for an amateur competing in the pro event.[300] In August 2019, Curry and Howard University, a historically black institution in Washington, D.C., jointly announced that the school would add NCAA Division I teams in men's and women's golf starting in the 2020\u201321 school year, with Curry guaranteeing full funding of both teams for six years.[301] Curry is also a fan of English soccer club Chelsea F.C.[302][303]\n\nPublic image\n\n\"No NBA athlete has a larger contingent of fans at every arena, lining up 20- and 30-deep hoping for a glimpse, if not an autograph. This crazy popularity is why his jersey sales consistently rank No. 1, why he was voted to be the captain of the [2018] Western Conference All-Star team and why 9-year-old girls feel comfortable enough to write letters asking for his help \u2013 and actually get it.\" \u2014Monte Poole of NBC Sports on Curry's popularity[304]\n\nCurry is one of the most successful players in the NBA, and he has also become an international celebrity, on par with four-time MVP LeBron James.[305][306] Like James, he has been considered the face of the NBA, but has said that he is not motivated by that and is not looking \"to take LeBron's throne or whatever. You know, I'm trying to chase rings, and that's all I'm about. So that's where the conversation stops for me.\"[307] His flashy play and penchant for coming up big in the clutch have made him a fan favorite, and his smaller physique is said to have made his success seem more attainable for younger fans of the NBA.[308][309] Curry's jersey was the top seller in the NBA for the 2015\u201316 and 2016\u201317 NBA seasons.[310]\n\nESPN has ranked Curry among the most famous international athletes, while Forbes has ranked him among the world's highest-paid celebrities for his endorsements.[311][312] ESPN's Kirk Goldsberry reasoned that one reason for Curry's popularity is that while most people are not tall enough to dunk, everyone can attempt a shot, which is something Curry inspires.[246] Owen Davis of Sky Sports echoed this sentiment, stating: \"After all, not everyone is blessed with supreme height and athleticism, but everyone can learn to pass, dribble and shoot. Curry is proof that if you work hard enough, you can still find ways to dominate, no matter your size.\"[252]\n\nMonte Poole of NBC Sports found Curry to be \"the most human of superstars,\" with a childlike aura to him when he plays with success. His fanbase ranges from very young children to the elderly, and casual or committed fans enjoy his style of play. Poole stated that \"the joy factor exponentially increases\" when Curry is on the court and that \"the sight of this relatively ordinary specimen sending much bigger players into silent surrender is an intoxicant for the Warriors and their fans.\"[304]\n\nBusiness interests\n\nCurry is widely known for his partnership with Under Armour, where he is considered to be the \"face of their footwear line.\"[313] Originally signed to Nike, Curry joined with Under Armour in the 2013 offseason.[314] As Curry became MVP and one of the most popular athletes in the world, sales of his shoes have become a major factor for the brand, with stock prices rising and falling based on the success of the Curry shoe line.[315][316]\n\nIn September 2017, it was announced that Curry had signed an exclusive autograph contract with Steiner Sports Memorabilia. The full product line will include hand-signed official basketballs and jerseys, autographed photographs of epic moments, flashy framed signs and wall-art, game-used memorabilia, and limited-edition pieces.[317]\n\nIn October 2018, Curry announced his involvement with the relaunch of Palm, a mobile companion device that pairs with a primary smartphone.[318] Curry is an investor and the leading brand ambassador for Palm, a small startup based in San Francisco which licenses the Palm name from TCL Corporation. He is also involved with designing and testing accessories and even helped to name the device.[319]\n\nCharity\n\nIn 2012, Curry started donating three insecticide-treated mosquito nets for every three-pointer he made to the United Nations Foundation's Nothing But Nets campaign to combat malaria. He was first introduced to the malaria cause by Davidson teammate Bryant Barr when they were both in school. Curry visited the White House in 2015 and delivered a five-minute speech to dignitaries as part of President Barack Obama's launch of his President's Malaria Initiative strategy for 2015\u20132020.[320][321]\n\nIn 2015, Curry wore sneakers that had Deah Shaddy Barakat's name on them; he was one of the victims of the 2015 Chapel Hill shooting. According to his sister Suzanne, Deah Barakat was known for his \"love for basketball and anything Steph Curry.\"[322] Deah's number for his intramural basketball team at North Carolina State University was Curry's No. 30, and he posed for a photo that was similar to one that Curry did for GQ.[322] Curry said that Barakat's family \"did a great job of reaching out to me and making me aware of the details of his life and personality. ... It was really kind of a cool deal to be able to use the platform yesterday to honor Deah and his family. ... I'm going to send them the shoes I wore yesterday. And hopefully, they know that I've been thinking about them.\"[323][324][325] Also in 2015, after winning the MVP award following his impressive season, Curry donated his prize vehicle\u2014a 2016 Kia Sorento\u2014to the East Oakland Youth Development Center, a local non-profit organization located in the backyard of Oracle Arena.[326]\n\nIn December 2018, while on a podcast, Curry questioned whether the Apollo program's Moon landing actually happened, which received substantial media attention and criticism. NASA offered Curry a tour of the Johnson Space Center and to discuss the matter with him. Curry later said that he was joking about the Moon landing not having happened. He had Under Armour create some shoes inspired by the comment and subsequent discussion. After wearing them to a game, he signed and auctioned them off. The shoes sold for $58,100 on eBay after 113 bids, and the money was donated for STEM education initiatives.[327][328]\n\nIn July 2019, Curry and his wife launched the Eat. Learn. Play. Foundation in Oakland, California.[329] The foundation works to end childhood hunger, increase access to quality education, and provide safe spaces for children to stay active.[330]\n\nProduction company\n\nIn April 2018, Sony Pictures Entertainment announced a wide-ranging, multiyear multimedia deal with Curry's newly formed production company Unanimous Media (named for Curry becoming the first NBA player in history to be elected the league's MVP by a unanimous vote), located on the Sony Pictures studio lot in Culver City. The film and TV deal included electronics, gaming and virtual reality and will focus on faith and family-friendly content.[331] In October 2018, Curry signed on as executive producer of the film Breakthrough, scheduled for release in April 2019.[332] Curry was also executive producer of the film Emanuel, scheduled for US theatrical release in select theaters on June 17, 2019.[333] The film focuses on the responses of family members of victims of the 2015 Charleston church shooting. Curry said: \"In the face of adversity, in the face of tragedy, how can I get through it?\"[333]\n\nBeginning in 2019, Curry is both an executive producer and resident golf pro on the American sports reality competition television series Holey Moley.[334] On June 24, 2020, Curry released a trailer for his new show on his YouTube channel, which is called Ultimate Home Championships, a show featuring people such as DeAndre Jordan, Ronda Rousey, and Kristopher London where contestants compete in wacky at-home challenges using things at their home. In 2020, the company signed a deal with Amazon's Audible.[335] Curry is the executive producer of an animated revival of the 1970s sitcom Good Times with its original executive producer, Norman Lear, and Family Guy creator Seth MacFarlane. The animated series was greenlit by Netflix in 2020.[336] In 2021, he signed a deal with NBCUniversal.[337]\n\nPolitics\n\nCurry and his wife endorsed Joe Biden for President of the United States during the Democratic National Convention (DNC) in August 2020.[338]\n\nIn December 2021, Curry voiced his support for the For the People Act, an election reform bill with the intention of expanding voting rights.[339]\n\nSee also\n\nNotes\n\nReferences\n\nGeneral", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/b6/Stephen_Curry_shooting.jpg/170px-Stephen_Curry_shooting.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/4/4a/Commons-logo.svg/30px-Commons-logo.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/23px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/a/a4/Flag_of_the_United_States.svg/50px-Flag_of_the_United_States.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3a/20140814_World_Basketball_Festival_Stephen_Curry_%28cropped%29.JPG/200px-20140814_World_Basketball_Festival_Stephen_Curry_%28cropped%29.JPG", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/8/86/Stephen_Curry_%2816640524995%29.jpg/170px-Stephen_Curry_%2816640524995%29.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/cb/Stephen_Curry_Davidson_cropped.jpg/220px-Stephen_Curry_Davidson_cropped.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg/1200px-TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg/220px-TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/7a/Stephen_Curry_close_up.jpg/220px-Stephen_Curry_close_up.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/4c/John_Wall%2C_Stephen_Curry_%2816433225927%29.jpg/220px-John_Wall%2C_Stephen_Curry_%2816433225927%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/5/5c/TechCrunch_Disrupt_San_Francisco_2019_-_Day_1_%2848835097887%29_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-TechCrunch_Disrupt_San_Francisco_2019_-_Day_1_%2848835097887%29_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/1/1b/Semi-protection-shackle.svg/20px-Semi-protection-shackle.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/72/Basketball_Clipart.svg/28px-Basketball_Clipart.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c0/Stephen_Curry_defends_Allen_Iverson.jpg/220px-Stephen_Curry_defends_Allen_Iverson.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/40/Stephen_Curry_%2833140701266%29.jpg/275px-Stephen_Curry_%2833140701266%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/d5/Gold_medal_icon_%28G_initial%29.svg/16px-Gold_medal_icon_%28G_initial%29.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/f/f9/Double-dagger-14-plain.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/1a/Stephen_Curry_2.jpg/220px-Stephen_Curry_2.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/36/Stephen_Curry_dribbling_2016_%28cropped%29.jpg/220px-Stephen_Curry_dribbling_2016_%28cropped%29.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/17/Barack_Obama_and_Stephen_Curry.jpg/170px-Barack_Obama_and_Stephen_Curry.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9f/Golden_State_Warriors_Point_Guard_Stephen_Curry_01.jpg/220px-Golden_State_Warriors_Point_Guard_Stephen_Curry_01.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/7/73/Steph_Curry_%28cropped%29.jpg/170px-Steph_Curry_%28cropped%29.jpg"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg/1200px-TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stephen_Curry", "title": "Stephen Curry", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/a/aa/TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg/640px-TechCrunch_Disrupt_2019_%2848834853256%29_%281%29.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 853}, "title": "Stephen Curry - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
