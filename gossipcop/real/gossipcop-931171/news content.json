February 2021, Catherine recorded a video message about the importance of positive mental health during the pandemic.[294] She encouraged children and parents to share their thoughts and feelings.[294] She also highlighted the need for parents and carers to look after their own mental wellbeing.[294] The video has been watched by over 3.5 million people.[294] In May 2021, William and Catherine, with other prominent personalities, voiced 2021 Mental Health Minute, a one-minute record delivered by Radiocentre and Somethin' Else to mark 2021 Mental Health Awareness Week.[295] The record was broadcast across all radio stations in the UK and reached over 20 million listeners.[295] In the same week, Catherine posted a video on her YouTube channel with a message that there was \"no shame\" in talking about mental health as she chatted to a student about how the pandemic affecting young people.[296] To commemorate World Mental Health Day on 11 October, William and Catherine posted a message on Instagram, sharing several organisations that support those who are struggling with mental health.[297]\n\nIn February 2022, she made a surprise appearance in CBeebies Bedtime Stories where she read The Owl Who Was Afraid of the Dark by Jill Tomlinson as the conclusion of Children's Mental Health Week.[298] In May 2022, Catherine and her husband voiced the Mental Health Minute message, which was broadcast on every radio station in the UK on 13 May and asked people to help individuals around them that suffer from loneliness.[299]\n\nEarly years and childhood development\n\nCatherine initially became interested in how childhood affected conditions such as homelessness, mental health, and addiction during her early years of charity work.[300] In March 2018, she hosted a symposium with the Royal Society of Medicine, focusing on children's health, and launched the Early Years Intervention Support initiative.[301] In May 2018, she established the Early Years Steering Group.[302][303] In January 2020, Catherine launched \"5 Big Questions on the Under 5's\", a nationwide survey on development in early years.[304] The survey was conducted by Ipsos MORI and contains \"further qualitative and ethnographic research\" on the early years.[305] It received over 500,000 responses.[306] The results of the survey were released in November 2020.[307] The findings outlined five key topics surrounding early childhood, including parental mental health and wider community health and support.[308][309] In July 2020, she supported and assisted in the development of BBC's \"Tiny Happy People\" initiative, providing free digital resources to parents with young children.[310] In August 2020, she headed a donation drive to benefit baby banks nationwide, including Little Village, which spurred over 10,000 donations from Marks & Spencer, Tesco, John Lewis & Partners, and Sainsbury's.[311][312] In June 2021, Catherine launched the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood, which will conduct work, research, and campaigns with other organisations on issues surrounding the early years.[313] In October 2021, she visited University College London's Centre for Longitudinal Studies.[314] She met the group which launched The Children of the 2020s, a programme which will track the development of children from the age of nine months to five years across England.[314] In November 2021, Catherine visited Nower Hill High School in Harrow where she joined Year 8 students in science lesson, studying neuroscience and the importance of early childhood development.[315] The visit is a part of a research project run by the University of Oxford.[315]\n\nIn February 2022, Catherine visited Denmark on behalf of the Royal Foundation Centre for Early Childhood.[316] She visited University of Copenhagen and met officials from the Center for Early Intervention and Family Studies.[316] She visited Stenurten Forest School,[317] to learn about its approach to learning, which focuses on the students' social and emotional development rather than academic skills.[318] She also visited Lego Foundation PlayLab at University College Copenhagen.[173] In March 2022, she and Prince William visited Shortwood Teacher's College in Jamaica.[319] There, the couple met students who are trained to be early childhood education practitioners.[319] In June 2022, Catherine hosted her first roundtable discussion with politicians on early childhood development.[320]\n\nPublic image and style\n\nThe Princess, prominent for her fashion style, has been placed on numerous \"best dressed\" lists.[321][322] The Daily Telegraph selected her as the \"Most Promising Newcomer\" on its 2006 list of style winners and losers.[323] Tatler placed her at number eight on its yearly list of the top ten style icons in 2007.[324] People featured Middleton on its 2007 and 2010 best-dressed lists.[325] She was named one of Richard Blackwell's ten Fabulous Fashion Independents of 2007.[326] In June 2008, Style.com selected her as its monthly beauty icon.[327] In July 2008, Vanity Fair included her on its international best-dressed list.[328] In February 2011 the Global Language Monitor named her the Top Fashion buzzword of the 2011 season.[329] In May 2011, she was ranked ninth in FHM's top 10 list of the \"World's Most Beautiful Women\".[330][331] In 2011, the British publication The Beauty Magazine named her \"England's Best-dressed Personality\" and the \"Most Elegant Woman in the World\".[332][333] She was named the \"Most Beautiful Woman of the Year\" by The Beauty Magazine in 2011 and 2012.[332][333] In January 2012, the Headwear Association voted her \"Headwear Person of the Year\".[334] She was number one on Vanity Fair's annual best dressed lists in 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013; she also appeared as the cover star in 2012.[335] In 2011, 2012 and 2013, she was listed as one of Time magazine's 100 Most Influential People in the World.[336] In 2014, she was lauded as a British cultural icon, with young adults from abroad naming her among a group of people who they most associated with UK culture.[337][338] The then Duchess was named in the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in the same year.[339]\n\nIn June 2016, she took part in her first magazine shoot for British Vogue's centenary issue, appearing on the cover.[340] The shoot took place on the Sandringham Estate; Catherine was involved in selecting her wardrobe of \"off-duty jeans and shirts\" reflecting her love of the countryside.[341] The spread was dubbed as the \"most personal and natural royal portraits ever undertaken by Vogue\". The photoshoot was done in collaboration with her patronage, the National Portrait Gallery, where two pictures from the shoot were displayed.[342] In 2018, Tatler named her on its list of Britain's best dressed people, praising her for \"recycling her looks, rather than wearing them as one-offs\", as well as her use of \"both high street and high-end brands\".[343] She topped Tatler's Best Dressed List in 2022.[344]\n\nThe \"Kate Middleton effect\" is the trend that the Princess is reported to have had in sales of particular products and brands.[345][346] In 2018, Brand Finance's research cited Catherine as the \"Most Powerful Royal Fashion Influencer\", retaining that pieces in her wardrobe increase desirability among 38 percent of American shoppers.[346] The Princess has been credited for popularizing nude pumps and hosiery in the early years of her marriage.[347][348] During daytime engagements, she has been noted to favor coatdresses, tea dresses, waxed jackets, lavalli\u00e8re blouses, blazers, and skinny jeans.[349] While Catherine wears items from many new designers, she has also worn dresses by Catherine Walker, who designed many of Diana's favourite evening gowns and day suits.[350] She has worn outfits, hats and ensembles by many other fashion designers.[351][352] The brands she favours are noted in the media.[351][352] Catherine has worn Jenny Packham numerous times, most notably outside the Lindo Wing after giving birth to each of her children in 2013, 2015, and 2018 respectively.[353] Alexander McQueen has been referred to as Catherine's \"go-to\" brand since her wedding in 2011, and she has worn designs to several annual events including Trooping the Colour, Royal Ascot and the British Academy Film Awards, as well as state banquets and receptions.[354] She has worn several high-street brands during official engagements and projects, most frequently Topshop and Zara.[355][356] Believed to be influenced by the style and fashion choices of Diana, Princess of Wales,[357] Catherine has developed a \"caring wardrobe\" similar to that of her mother-in-law, with colourful fabrics, skirt suits, and bright hues suitable for visiting hospitals and schools.[358]\n\nCatherine, who attended the 71st British Academy Film Awards, did not participate in Time's Up movement calling for women to wear black on the red carpet.[359] Royal protocol forbids members of the royal family from taking part in political movements but she wore a black sash and carried a black handbag as a variation to the informal black dress code.[360][361] In March 2018, together with the Countess of Wessex, she hosted the Commonwealth Fashion Exchange reception at Buckingham Palace during 2018 London Fashion Week.[362] In 2021, it was reported that Catherine boosted the British fashion industry up to \u00a31 billion within a year.[363] She was also chosen as one of the 25 most influential women in the United Kingdom by British Vogue in August 2021.[364]\n\nPrivacy and the media\n\nThe death of Diana, Princess of Wales, in Paris while being chased by paparazzi in 1997,[365] influenced her son's attitude towards the media.[366] The Prince and Princess have asked that, when off-duty, their privacy should be respected.[366]\n\nAfter her graduation from university, Middleton was faced with widespread press attention and was often photographed by the paparazzi.[67][69] On 17 October 2005, she complained through her lawyer about harassment from the media, stating she had done nothing significant to warrant publicity and complained that photographers were permanently stationed outside her flat.[367][368] Former royal press secretary Dickie Arbiter stated that her treatment by the press drew parallels to the tumultuous experience of William's mother in the early years of her marriage.[369] From 2005 to 2006, Middleton's phone was hacked 155 times according to former News of the World royal editor Clive Goodman, who was involved in a phone hacking scandal by the newspaper that targeted the royal family.[370]\n\nMedia attention increased around the time of her 25th birthday in January 2007, where twenty photographers and five television crews photographed her leaving for work.[371][367] Warnings were issued by the then Prince of Wales, Prince William, and Middleton's lawyers, who threatened legal action. Two newspaper groups, News International, which publishes The Times and The Sun; and the Guardian Media Group, publishers of The Guardian, decided to refrain from publishing paparazzi pictures of her \"leaving nightclubs and going about her daily business\", but continued to use photographs of Middleton at public events.[372] In April 2007, Middleton reached a settlement with Daily Mirror regarding a harassment complaint over a close-up photograph, which was followed by a warning by the Press Complaints Commission (PCC) over press treatment of Middleton.[373] In July 2007, MPs on the Culture, Media and Sport Select Committee stated in a report on press regulation that Middleton was the victim of \"clear and persistent harassment\" by the paparazzi and criticised the lack of intervention by the PCC, who circulated a letter from Middleton's solicitors on the issue of press harassment but said they were not directly asked by her lawyers to act.[373][374]\n\nIn 2009, Middleton was awarded \u00a310,000 damages and an apology from the photographic press agency Rex Features Ltd. after she was photographed playing tennis on Christmas Eve while on holiday in Cornwall.[375] In 2010, she pursued an invasion of privacy claim against two agencies and photographer Niraj Tanna, who took photographs of her over Christmas 2009.[376] Middleton obtained a public apology, \u00a35,000 in damages, and legal costs.[377]\n\nIn September 2012, the French edition of Closer and the Italian gossip magazine Chi, published photographs of Catherine sun-bathing topless while on holiday at the Ch\u00e2teau d'Autet[366] (a private ch\u00e2teau on a 260-ha estate 71 km[378] north of Aix-en-Provence). Analysts from The Times believed the photographs were taken from the D22 (Vaucluse) road half a kilometre from the pool\u2014a distance that would require an 800-mm or a 1000-mm lens.[379] On 17 September 2012, William and Catherine filed a criminal complaint with the French prosecution department and launched a claim for civil damages at the Tribunal de Grande Instance de Nanterre.[380] The following day the courts granted an injunction against Closer, prohibiting further publication of the photographs and announced a criminal investigation would be initiated.[381] Under French law, punitive damages cannot be awarded[382] but intrusions of privacy are a criminal offence carrying a maximum jail sentence of one year and a fine of up to \u20ac45,000 for individuals and \u20ac225,000 for companies.[383][384] In September 2017, Closer was fined \u20ac100,000 and its editor Laurence Pieau and owner Ernesto Mauri were each fined \u20ac45,000.[385]\n\nIn December 2012, two Australian radio hosts, Michael Christian and Mel Greig, called King Edward VII's Hospital where Catherine was an in-patient for hyperemesis gravidarum. Pretending to be the Queen and the Prince of Wales, Greig and Christian spoke to a nurse on Catherine's ward, enquiring about her condition. Following a hospital inquiry and a public backlash against the hoax, Jacintha Saldanha, the nurse who put the call through to the ward, committed suicide.[386] The radio hosts subsequently apologised for their actions.[387]\n\nIn February 2013, Chi published the first photos of Catherine's exposed baby bump, taken during her vacation on the private island of Mustique. The British press refused to publish the paparazzi shots.[388] While Catherine was visiting the Blue Mountains in Sydney, a picture was taken of her bare bottom as her dress blew up. Many newspapers outside the UK published the picture.[389] In October 2014, Catherine and William sent a legal letter to a freelance photographer who had put their son George and his nanny \"under surveillance\", asking the individual to stop \"harassing and following\" them.[390] On 14 August 2015, Kensington Palace published a letter detailing what it stated were the \"dangerous\" and invasive efforts of the media to get paparazzi pictures of Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Jason Knauf, communications secretary to the Cambridges, wrote the letter to media standards organisations in various countries.[391]\n\nIn May 2020, Kensington Palace said that the cover story of Tatler magazine titled 'Catherine the Great' contained \"a swathe of inaccuracies and false misrepresentations\". Despite the palace's statement that most of the material was not given to them before publication, the magazine's editor-in-chief announced that he would stand behind the story as the palace had been aware of it for months.[392] In September 2020, after pressure from the couple's lawyers, the magazine removed remarks on Catherine's family and other similar claims from the online version of the story.[393]\n\nTitles, styles, honours, and arms\n\nTitles\n\nCatherine does not hold any titles herself, but is entitled to use the feminine versions of her husband's titles. Upon her marriage in 2011, she was therefore known as the Duchess of Cambridge outside Scotland, and the Countess of Strathearn within.[394][395] On her father-in-law's accession to the throne on 8 September 2022, Catherine became Duchess of Cornwall and Duchess of Rothesay.[396][397] On 9 September 2022, the King announced the appointment of William as Prince of Wales, with Catherine becoming the Princess of Wales.[398]\n\nStyles\n\nRoyal monogram\n\n9 January 1982 \u2013 29 April 2011: Miss Catherine Middleton [399]\n\n29 April 2011 \u2013 8 September 2022: Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge [400] in Scotland : Her Royal Highness The Countess of Strathearn [400]\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge 8 \u2013 9 September 2022: Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge [401] [b]\n\nThe Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge 9 September 2022 \u2013 present: Her Royal Highness The Princess of Wales [402] in Scotland : Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Rothesay [c]\n\nThe Princess of Wales\n\nHonours\n\nHonorary military appointments\n\nOther appointments\n\n9 April 2013 \u2013 present: Lady Sponsor of Royal Princess[410]\n\nHonorific eponym\n\nAwards\n\nArms\n\nAncestry\n\nFour successive generations of the Princess's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate , near Leeds\n\nThe Princess of Wales's father is Michael Middleton, son of Captain Peter Middleton, who, along with their forebears, were from Leeds, Yorkshire.[417] Robert Lacey describes Michael Middleton's family as having aristocratic ancestry with Baroness Airedale (1868\u20131942) being his distant ancestor.[418] Catherine's paternal great-grandmother Olive Middleton (n\u00e9e Lupton) and her cousin Baroness von Schunck (n\u00e9e Kate Lupton) were members of the Lupton family who are described as landed gentry and as such, were invited to the coronation of King George V and Queen Mary in 1911.[419][420] Four successive generations of Catherine's ancestors had lived at Potternewton Hall Estate, the family seat, including Catherine's great-grandmother Olive Middleton, her father, politician Francis Martineau Lupton, his mother, educator Frances Lupton and her father, epidemiologist and surgeon Thomas Michael Greenhow.[421][422][423]\n\nCatherine's maternal ancestors, the Harrisons, were working-class labourers and miners from Sunderland and County Durham.[424] Ancestors through her maternal line include Sir Thomas Conyers, 9th Baronet (1731\u20131810), who was a descendant of King Edward IV through his illegitimate daughter Elizabeth Plantagenet.[425] Other paternal ancestors are Sir Thomas Fairfax (1475\u20131520) and his wife Anne Gascoigne, who was a descendant of King Edward III.[426][427]\n\nBibliography\n\nBooks\n\nAuthored articles and letters\n\nNotes\n\n^ [60] Author Katie Nicholl suggests that the two met before going to St Andrews through mutual friends while Middleton was a student at Marlborough College. ^ As the eldest son of the new monarch, Prince William automatically inherited the title 'Duke of Cornwall' upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II, on 8 September 2022, making his wife 'Duchess of Cornwall'. While she continues to be Duchess of Cornwall and Cambridge, Catherine is generally addressed by her highest title, which is 'Princess of Wales'. ^ As the eldest son of the new monarch, Prince William automatically inherited the title 'Duke of Rothesay' upon the death of Queen Elizabeth II, on 8 September 2022, making Catherine 'Duchess of Rothesay'.\n\nReferences", "images":
