Gigi Hadid, who was confirmed to walk in this year\u2019s show, was also reportedly denied entry. Word spread that the event was turning into a \u201cmedia crisis,\u201d but Razek denied those rumors.\n\n\u201cThe news reports I\u2019ve been reading from the US here in Shanghai regarding this year\u2019s Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show are not an accurate reflection of what I\u2019m seeing and experiencing on site,\u201d he told People.\n\n\u201cThe Chinese have been wonderful and enthusiastic hosts and partners,\u201d he added. \u201cFrom granting more than 700 visas, collaborating with us on every detail and introducing us to local experts who have helped us elevate our event in this renowned fashion city. We appreciate their efforts and all they have done to make this event a success. We look forward to the live show Monday night and the international broadcast a week later.\u201d\n\nZhang performing with John Legend in 2015 Getty Images\n\nRazek also teased that this year\u2019s event will be Victoria\u2019s Secret\u2019s \u201cmost ambitious show by far.\u201d In addition to the four performers, 55 models (they most they\u2019ve ever had) from 17 countries will take the catwalk in Shanghai.\n\nStyles, Miguel, Odom, and Zhang follow 2016's VSFS performers\u2014Lady Gaga, Bruno Mars, and The Weeknd. Though their appearances were just confirmed, rumblings of their performances spread online weeks before today's announcement.\n\n\n\nStyles fans noticed that the singer's label, Columbia Records, appeared to announce on Monday he'd be performing his song \"Kiwi,\" off his new album at the VSFS. Fashionista notes that the singer's next tour performance isn't until November 23 (three days after the fashion show is filmed) in Singapore.\n\nR&B favorite Miguel also became a potential VSFS contender when rumors of his appearance surfaced on Twitter. The smooth crooner has a new album, War & Leisure, due out on December 1, which means he has plenty of new material to perform at the show.\n\nPerry was speculated to appear at the VSFS after a letter surfaced online, allegedly showing her agreement to perform, although that's no longer true. She was supposedly replacing Taylor Swift in the lineup\u2014the Reputation singer was previously expected to make an appearance. Naturally the rumors of Swift, Styles, and Perry's castings caused a stir, considering Swift's romantic history with Styles (they briefly dated for a few months from 2012-2013) and her ongoing frenemy feud with Perry. But it looks like we'll be missing out on the drama this year.\n\nThe artists and models film in Shanghai on Monday, but the Victoria's Secret Fashion Show officially airs on November 28 at 10 p.m./9 p.m. central, on CBS.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/5840603cbbddbd6ca4f48aca/thumb_1480613951.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/adriana-lima-walks-the-runway-during-the-2018-victorias-news-photo-1059397534-1543789585.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.337xh;0,0.167xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/latto-attends-2022-harpers-bazaar-icons-bloomingdales-150th-news-photo-1663595148.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0310xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-performances-vs-index-new-1511021297.jpg?crop=0.502xw:0.998xh;0.250xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-performances-vs-index-new-1511021297.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.998xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-father-daughter-songs-1547861102.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-harry-styles-855335300-1511021919.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-bella-vs-2016-629415624-1510863549.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.998xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz100122playlist-007-min-1664296732.png?crop=1xw:0.715439577508543xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chanel-index-1663771029.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/constance-wu-credit-caitlin-fisher-1664997136.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.714xh;0,0.0262xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1661796895.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0.129xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/cris0407-1663533496.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.125xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-656167891-1663795964.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.231xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-jane-zhang-492304574-1511022095.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blackpink-at-the-spotify-x-blackpink-born-pink-pop-up-experience-la-jpg-1663329637.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/mcdwoki-tr029-1664563555.jpg?crop=0.420xw:1.00xh;0.219xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/index-1664981781.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/halloween-books-index-1664384221.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.250xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-performances-vs-index-new-1511021297.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.998xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/art-books-music/a13645626/victoria-secret-fashion-show-performers-2017/", "title": "Victoria Secret Fashion Show 2017 Performers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Victoria Secret Fashion Show 2017 Performers -
