The \u201cTommy Boy\u201d star may have left us physically on December 18, 1997 \u2026 but his comedic legacy will always stay with us.\n\nIn honor of the legendary entertainer, we had to go back and remember some of his greatest moments, in no particular order.\n\n1. Tommy Boy\n\n\u201cTommy Boy\u201d brought us great lines like \u201cfat guy in a little coat,\u201d and one of Farley\u2019s most memorable bits about being in sales.\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1EyN9xTK94)\n\n2. Matt Foley: The Motivational Speaker\n\nIf you\u2019ve never heard of this famous Farley sketch, then there\u2019s a good chance you\u2019ll end up \u2026 LIVING IN A VAN DOWN BY THE RIVER!!!\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xv2VIEY9-A8)\n\nChippendales\n\nThe famous sketch with Patrick Swayze will go down as one of Saturday Night Live\u2019s best, although many friends of Farley have said since his death they felt the sketch was painful for him.\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jivzl54BfK4)\n\n4. Billy Madison\n\nThe angry bus driver was one of the funniest parts in \u201cBilly Madison.\u201d \u201cNo Yelling on the bus!!!\u201d\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Chhby5K95HE)\n\nGap Girls\n\nWatching Adam Sandler try to hold himself together when Farley belts out his infamous \u201cLay off me I\u2019m starving\u201d line is pure gold.\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TmtkNrufSwQ)\n\nBonus: Schmitts Gay\n\nI know we said five, but Chris Farley is so amazing that it could hardly be limited. We could keep going, but this classic SNL commercial should never be left off a list.\n\n!youtube-embed(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UDsF4GhJOuE)\n\nR.I.P Chris \u2014 we miss you.", "images": ["https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/MEGA785129_003-scaled-e1638993958110.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MEGA866556_044-e1663673382358.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/280434121_1395193687653173_8302715088599814958_n-scaled-e1657838748918.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MEGA834711_001-scaled-e1658838045196.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/61300398_341671993188134_7669920017703656447_n-2-scaled-e1661759955396.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/275172872_731745744454459_563055545823377915_n-1-e1646598162244.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/MEGA557708_002-scaled-e1649173231372.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Kanye-West-Lawyer-Steps-Down-Divorce-Kim-Kardashian-Court-scaled-e1653590798296.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/ad4b5a13ff80aa2fd7b16f727dcb9e71.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300&quality=75", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Blast_v06_Temptation-Island-Desktop2-05.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/118155612_315963603160995_9189865826367714689_n-scaled-e1663743440520.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/mega844473_096-scaled-e1652978858475.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/temptation-island-logo.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/MEGA732422_001-scaled-e1660255631663.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/MEGA202763_003-scaled-e1653064406791.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/khphotos778007-scaled-e1647979750318.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/mega463271_036-scaled-e1648318841884.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/wennphotosseven428487-scaled-e1645298552245.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180"], "top_img": "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/5-amazing-chris-farley-moments-well-never-forget-on-20th-anniversary-of-death/", "title": "5 Amazing Chris Farley Moments We\u2019ll Never Forget 20 Years After His Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "5 Amazing Chris Farley Moments We'll Never Forget 20 Years After His Death", "description": "Chris Farley has been gone for 20 years, yet his movies, skits, and characters are still talked about and recanted every single day.
