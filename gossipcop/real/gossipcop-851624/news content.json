People rejoiced. Twitter burbled with happy Andy Samberg GIFs.\n\nBut for fans of \"Timeless,\" NBC's time-traveling drama that just wrapped up its second season on a gigantic cliffhanger, the network may be more goat than great. NBC has yet to decide if \"Timeless\" is canceled or renewed, which is unusual at this point in the season. Most shows learn their fate at their network's upfront presentation.\n\nYet NBC declined to make a decision on \"Timeless,\" saying it was still weighing its options.\n\nThat may sound like reason for fans to celebrate \u2014 if the show wasn't canceled, then that surely means the network sees some value in keeping it around, right? A big uptick in DVR viewership for the finale or a successful #RenewTimeless campaign (yes, it's been trending all week) might sway NBC just like it saved \"Brooklyn,\" no? Perhaps not.\n\nUltimately, \"Timeless's\" fate may be sealed by something playing a bigger and bigger role in the network TV business these days: the show's producer.\n\n\"Brooklyn\" is produced by Universal Television, the sister studio to NBC. That means the network had a vested interest in seeing \"Brooklyn\" make it to another season. A sixth season equals more syndication money, more VOD money and a bigger library of content to monetize across platforms in the future.\n\n\"Timeless,\" on the other hand, is produced by Sony Pictures Television. NBC has no vested interest in that studio, and thus less reason to bring the show back.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180517005803im_/https://specials-images.forbesimg.com/dam/imageserve/954372830/960x0.jpg?fit=scale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180517005803im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fe131bd582e06c68c2548634779b238b?s=400&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180517005803im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F954372830%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180517005803im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F954372830%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toni Fitzgerald"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180517005803/https://www.forbes.com/sites/tonifitzgerald/2018/05/16/is-timeless-canceled-or-renewed-why-the-nbc-show-may-not-be-saved/", "title": "Is 'Timeless' Canceled Or Renewed?
