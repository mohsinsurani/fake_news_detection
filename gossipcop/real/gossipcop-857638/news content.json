Frankie, who cancelled his own concert in London following the 22 May tragedy, took to Twitter on Sunday to share a tribute to the victims and the families of all those affected by the bombing. The 34-year-old wrote: \"My prayers, thoughts, meditations & strength has been focused on those families and victims affected by the horrible tragedy in Manchester.\n\nCLICK TO VIEW GALLERY\n\nAriana Grande pictured with her brother Frankie Grande\n\nSTORY: Dad of three pens moving open letter to Ariana Grande\n\n\"I echo my sister's sentiment & say we can't allow hate to propagate hate & fear to propagate fear, but rather come together & spread a message of love, unity and empowerment. & so I say, as I have before, shine bright & when evil comes 2 drown out your light, & throw shade over your beautiful soul, shine brighter!\" Adding a link to a crowdfunding page to raise money for the families of victims, Frankie concluded: \"I love you all so very much and thank you for your strength during this incredibly difficult time.\"\n\nFollowing the terror attack, Ariana, 23, suspended the reminder of her tour and returned to her hometown of Boca Raton in Florida. On Friday, she posted a powerful message on Twitter as she offered her condolences to the victims and their loved ones. \"We will not quit or operate in fear,\" she wrote. \"We won't let this divide us. We won't let hate win.\"", "images": ["https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/1.gif", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/social/menu-2021/tiktok.svg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/himgs/css/hello/img/logo.png", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/hfm-logo-black.svg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/social/menu-2021/pinterest.svg", "https://pixel.33across.com/ps/?pid=1157&cgn=17916&seg=47780", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/social/menu-2021/facebook.svg?v2", "https://www.hola.com/imagenes/comunes/pixel-1x1.gif", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/0-208-346/ariana-grande-t.jpg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/social/menu-2021/twitter.svg?v2", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/social/menu-2021/snapchat.svg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/social/menu-2021/instagram.svg", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/comunes/social/menu-2021/youtube.svg?v2", "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/0-208-346/ariana-grande-t.jpg?tx=w_360", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035866&cs_ucfr=1&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/0-208-346/ariana-grande-t.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gemma Strong"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/", "title": "Ariana Grande's brother speaks out on Manchester terror attack", "meta_data": {"plantilla": "Plantilla de noticias (plantilla-noticias.html)", "title": "Ariana Grande's brother shares message in wake of terror attack", "description": "Ariana Grande's brother Frankie Grande shares new message on Twitter in wake of Manchester terror attack, honours victims and their families", "keywords": "ariana grande, ariana grande brother, frankie grande, frankie grande twitter, frankie grande ariana grande, frankie grande manchester terror attack, ariana grande manchester, ariana grande manchester terror attack", "dc.title": "Ariana Grande's brother shares message in wake of terror attack", "distribution": "global", "sailthru.tags": "ariana-grande", "sailthru.author": "Gemma Strong", "sailthru.affiliates": "true", "sailthru.date": "2017-05-29T11:16:21+01:00", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "news_keywords": "ariana grande, ariana grande brother, frankie grande, frankie grande twitter, frankie grande ariana grande, frankie grande manchester terror attack, ariana grande manchester, ariana grande manchester terror attack", "og": {"title": "Ariana Grande's brother speaks out on Manchester terror attack", "description": "Ariana Grande's brother Frankie Grande shares new message on Twitter in wake of Manchester terror attack, honours victims and their families", "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/0-208-346/ariana-grande-t.jpg", "updated_time": "2017-05-29T11:16:21+01:00", "url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/", "type": "article", "site_name": "HELLO!"}, "fb": {"admins": 89982930077}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-05-29T11:16:21+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-05-29T11:16:21+01:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@hellomag", "creator": "@hellomag", "url": "https://www.hellomagazine.com/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/", "title": "Ariana Grande's brother speaks out on Manchester terror attack", "description": "Ariana Grande's brother Frankie Grande shares new message on Twitter in wake of Manchester terror attack, honours victims and their families.", "image": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/0-208-346/ariana-grande-t.jpg"}, "hmn": "true", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://images.hellomagazine.com/imagenes/celebrities/2017052939318/frankie-grande-twitter-message-manchester-terror-attack-victims/0-208-346/ariana-grande-t.jpg", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "botify-site-verification": "rAorMmkbfzd6yOwJ3PITFmdyCjOzGLug"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496052981.0, "source": "https://www.hellomagazine.com", "summary": ""}
