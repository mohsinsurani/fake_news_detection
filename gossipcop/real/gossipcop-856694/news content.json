He posted a side-by-side photo where he is kicking it back to his old school days in the \u201990s when he rocked a turtleneck, baggy jeans and a fanny pack. Let\u2019s not overlook his gorgeous hair!\n\nThe split photo might inspire some chuckles, that\u2019s for sure! The feeling behind the Baywatch star\u2019s photos actually packs a punch.\n\nThe actor takes note of where he came from over twenty years ago, and he also highlights where he is today. That is \u2013 the highest paid actor in the whole world.\n\nThe Rock, whose net worth is somewhere around $190 million began his lengthy Instagram post by saying that \u201cWhen I took this iconic absurdity of a picture in 1996, I was one year removed from sleeping on a used mattress I took from a garbage dumpster in the back of an hourly sex motel. Couldn\u2019t afford to buy a bed so we do what we gotta do to get by.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou can imagine all the fun colorful bodily fluids I tried my best to clean off, \u201d he continued.\n\nThe 45-year-old also said that he is now, after 21 years, taking the same photo backstage as he is hosting Saturday Night Live for the fifth time.\n\nThe actor told the world that \u201cIf you\u2019re going thru your own tough times \u2018used mattress\u2019 stage, do your best to have faith things\u2019ll get better and always be willing to outwork your competition because you never know where life is gonna take you.\u201d\n\nHis post is both humorous and inspiring, and we congratulate him for this.\n\nHe also told his fans that they should always remember to put a soft tissue under their left elbow for protecting the fabric of the \u201ccheap ass swag\u201d turtleneck that makes you look like a \u201cbad ass buff lesbian.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe advises people to tuck the thumb in the fanny pack as it\u2019s a critical thig to do and this must not be forgotten under any circumstance. These are some sage words, Dwayne, and we totally agree! Keep up the good work, and keep on rocking your looks!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Amber-Heards-Beau-Elon-Musk-Is-The-Perfect-Gentleman-On-Their-Date-Night-300x225.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tamar-Braxton-Monica-Vincent-Herbert-300x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bernice-Burgos-And-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bernice-Burgos-T.I.-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x190.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Kevin-Hart-700x466.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dwayne-Johnson-Kicks-It-Back-To-The-90s-Rocking-A-Flattop-Turtleneck-And-Fanny-Packs.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dwayne-The-Rock-Johnson-Revealed-That-He-Is-Running-For-President-With-Tom-Hanks-In-2020-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Porsha-Williams-Phaedra-Parks-1-300x198.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Katy-Perry-Got-Racy-Onstage-During-BBC-Radio-1s-Big-Weekend-2017-Televised-Music-Festival-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/seacrest-ripa-live-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/zac-efron-and-alexandra-daddario-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Dwayne-Johnson-Kicks-It-Back-To-The-90s-Rocking-A-Flattop-Turtleneck-And-Fanny-Packs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170529120227/http://celebrityinsider.org/dwayne-johnson-kicks-it-back-to-the-90s-rocking-a-flattop-turtleneck-and-fanny-packs-40031/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson Kicks It Back To The \u201990s Rocking A Flattop, Turtleneck And Fanny Packs", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "Baywatch, dwayne johnson, The Rock,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Baywatch, dwayne johnson, The Rock,", "description": "The wrestler who became and actor who will possibly run for residency in 2020 posted on his Instagram account an amusing thing.
