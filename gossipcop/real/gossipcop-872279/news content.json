The pair became engaged in 2012 before calling off the engagement in 2013. After quietly resuming their relationship earlier this year, Cyrus raised a few eyebrows when she posted a photo to Instagram in which she\u2019s wearing her old engagement ring.\n\nGiven her history of provocative social media posts, no one could quite be sure if the return of the ring was an indication of their on-again engagement or if she just happened to think the accessory worked with her strawberry-inspired outfit of the day.\n\nA photo posted by Miley Cyrus (@mileycyrus) on Jan 18, 2016 at 7:07am PST\n\nHowever, during an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Thursday afternoon, an overall-wearing Cyrus confirmed to DeGeneres that the pair are once again engaged.\n\nThe talk-show host congratulated the 23-year-old, to which Cyrus replied, \u201cIt\u2019s very weird because this is, like, real jewelry, and most of my jewelry is made out of gummy bears and cotton candy.
