During Monday\u2019s show, Wendy Williams was just discussing the recent sexual harassment allegations against the former CBS This Morning co-host Charlie Rose. That was the moment when she remembered her own experience with an unnamed guest.\n\nI'm excited to see my friends @Mariobatali, @carlaphall, @clintonkellyoh, @chefsymon on @abcthechew today!\u200b Tune-in! A post shared by Wendy Williams (@wendyshow) on Nov 20, 2017 at 9:50am PST\n\n\u2018My worst guest? I\u2019m not going to name, but I can tell you this\u2014it had to do with some groping. You all saw it, but didn\u2019t say a word, and I felt it, and I didn\u2019t say a word,\u2019 Wendy recalled.\n\n\u2018My staff saw it, and that guest will never be here anymore. He\u2019s not relevant anyway.\u2019\n\nWendy confessed that the guest was a little comedian who appeared on the program in either her second or third season.\n\nWhile she assured her audience, she would \u2018feel very comfortable in pushing a man through my glass coffee table if anything gets seedy\u2019 today, back when she was still new on TV and did not know how to react at the moment.\n\nWendy stated that the guest hugged her upon entertain, but laid into her breasts inappropriately.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know what to do because I\u2019m brand new on TV,\u2019 she recalled about the moment. So, she forced a laugh.\n\n\u2018Then, after the hug, he looked up at me. He goes, \u2018Oh, you\u2019re not Oprah [Winfrey],\u2019 Williams imitated in a specific voice.\n\n\u2018I didn\u2019t know how to take that, and the whole interview was just weird, and I just would never have him here again, and I am two seconds away from saying his name, but it\u2019s not worth it.\u2019\n\nThe winter weather is quickly approaching! What\u2019s your favorite winter trend? \u2744\ufe0f #FauxFur #Fashion #Velvet A post shared by Wendy Williams (@wendyshow) on Nov 16, 2017 at 2:44pm PST\n\nWendy didn\u2019t identify the guest, but she provided enough clues for her fans.\n\nThanks to a pic circulating on social media, the Internet is speculating that she was referring to comedian Gilbert Gottfried, who appeared on the show back in 2011, and he seems to nestle into her chest.\n\nHowever, it has not been established that Williams was speaking about him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAccording to Inside Edition, the comedian \u2018didn\u2019t recall the Wendy show from so many years ago\u2019 when the outlet spoke to him. When he was questioned about whether he was banned from the show, he said, \u2018Not that I\u2019m aware of.\u2019", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Wendy-Williams-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Check-Out-Wendy-Williams-Worst-Talk-Show-Guest-Ever-Can-You-Guess-Who-He-Is.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Matt-Lauer-Is-Feeling-\u2018Ashamed\u2019-Over-Sexual-Misconduct-Allegations-He-Even-Claims-Some-Are-\u2018Untrue\u2019-Check-Out-His-First-Statement-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Selena-Gomez-Is-Proud-To-Be-A-Female-Artist-After-Receiving-The-Woman-Of-The-Year-Honor-At-Billboards-Women-In-Music-Award-2017-300x180.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tamar-Braxton-Sparks-Booty-Implant-Rumors-After-Vincent-Herbert-Divorce-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/wendy-williams-matt-lauer-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Tameka-Tiny-Harris-Boss-T.I.-Upscale-300x273.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Kandi-Burruss-Todd-Tucker-Xscape-300x243.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/alex_rodriguez_jennifer_lopez-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Matt-Lauer-Told-Sandra-Bullock-That-Her-Naked-Photo-Is-His-Screensaver-In-Disturbing-Interview-Watch-The-Video-300x157.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://1.gravatar.com/avatar/d16c8c4bf75241fbe649eff27ac77962?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Matt-Lauer-Reportedly-Wants-30-Million-Payout-After-Getting-Fired-for-Sexual-Harassment-He-Also-Deletes-All-His-Social-Media-Accounts-300x129.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171201140036im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Check-Out-Wendy-Williams-Worst-Talk-Show-Guest-Ever-Can-You-Guess-Who-He-Is.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch", "Sherry Page", "Alma J.
