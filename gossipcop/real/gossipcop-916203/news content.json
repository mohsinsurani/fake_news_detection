Clearly taped months ago\u2014Khlo\u00e9 can be seen with her baby bump, and Kylie is nowhere in sight\u2014TV\u2019s favorite family played by their own rules and put timeliness aside.\n\nEach pairing was of course accompanied by the show\u2019s host, Steve Harvey, as well as some backup. Also on the Jenner team was none other than Kris\u2019s mom and Kendall\u2019s grandma, Mary Jo Campbell, plus family friends Jonathan Cheban and Cici Bussey. Meanwhile, as if Kimye couldn\u2019t stand on their own, they were somehow joined by West\u2019s cousins Kim Wallace, Jalil Peraza, and Ricky Anderson. For a recap of what went down once they took to the stage, scroll down.\n\nKanye was all smiles.\n\nKim tweeted during a family viewing of the episode on Sunday night that \u201cKanye has a permanent smile on his face during this whole Family Feud episode.\u201d That much was apparent even in the episode\u2019s preview, with Kanye immediately responding to Harvey\u2019s question about why he\u2019s a good kisser with the simple answer, \u201clips.\u201d\n\nThe competition was real.\n\nBefore things kicked off, behind the scenes, Kim caught how her fam\u2019s team wouldn\u2019t let her in their \u201chuddle.\u201d Then, once onstage, things began to get heated between Kim and Khlo\u00e9, with the latter refusing to shake her sister\u2019s hand, and teasing Kim for her obvious lack of prior knowledge about the show. (Though even though their mom kicked things off by saying that appearing on the show was on the \u201centire family\u2019s bucket list.\u201d) When the Kardashian team also broke rules by convening for a hushed talk, Kim shouted, \u201cNo cheating over there!\u201d and West yelled, \u201cThat\u2019s an automatic disqualification!\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 and Kim Kardashian, along with Steve Harvey, on Family Feud. Courtesy of Giphy\n\nKendall snuck in some Donald Trump shade.\n\nWhen Harvey asked Kendall and Kim Wallace whom they\u2019d hate to see at a wild party where everyone was naked, Kendall lost out on responding first, but definitely won with her answer: \u201cDonald Trump.\u201d Kris, in full-on mom mode, yelled, \u201cGood one, Kendall!\u201d while Khlo\u00e9 cheered and even Kim, whose opinions apparently differ from those of her husband\u2019s, openly laughed.\n\nKris Jenner was in ultimate Mean Girls Mom mode.\n\nKris, in true supportive momager fashion, also stood by her opponent Kim when she somehow got docked points for responding \u201cmy butt\u201d to the question of what part of her body most often bumps into things, joining in those booing the decision and yelling, \u201cIt\u2019s all right!\u201d\n\nSomehow, Team Kimye lost.\n\nEven though they were of course convinced that they would win, team Kimye ended up falling short, In the end, though Kendall and Khlo\u00e9 still allowed them to play the \u201cFast Money\u201d portion of the show, since it would also benefit the Children\u2019s Hospital Los Angeles. (And, according to Harvey, \u201cIt\u2019s always been Yeezy\u2019s dream to play Fast Money.\u201d) In the end, they at least ended up winning that portion of the show, raising $25,000.\n\nRelated: Kris Jenner Is Already Embarrassing Her Granddaughter North West at School", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/06/11/5b1e7686dfea9b688514d327_kim-kardashian-family-feud.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/06/11/5b1e9087ca6b07756add218a_GettyImages-961869596.jpg?w=414&h=276&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/5/e443a60a-d597-4caf-9c3c-8e5147eb4add-getty-1430677010.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5093&fp-y=0.1824", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/3/4ded9e52-bef3-4455-9f56-26a48e270c73-eve-best-shani-smethurst.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/06/11/5b1e7686dfea9b688514d327_kim-kardashian-family-feud.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/kardashian-family-feud-recap-kim-kanye-west", "title": "A Recap of Everything That Went Down During the Kardashians\u2019 Family Feud Debut", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@stepheckardt"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/kardashian-family-feud-recap-kim-kanye-west", "type": "article", "title": "A Recap of the Kardashians' Drama-Filled Family Feud Episode", "description": "From Kendall Jenner's Donald Trump shade to Kanye West's nonstop smiling.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/06/11/5b1e7686dfea9b688514d327_kim-kardashian-family-feud.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "From Kendall Jenner's Donald Trump shade to Kanye West's nonstop smiling."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
