This month, the award-winning actress and best-selling author filmed a PSA for the Child Mind Institute's #MyYoungerSelf campaign, and in it, she talks about how she learned to live with her post-traumatic stress disorder.\n\n\"Hey guys, it's Gabrielle Union, and I'm here to tell you that I am a PTSD survivor, thriver, badass M.F.-er,\" she says in the video. \"I was diagnosed with PTSD at 19 after I was raped at gunpoint, and I didn't let it stop me. I didn't want it to define my whole life, and it doesn't have to. Asking for help, needing help, doesn't make you weak or less worthy of love or support or success. You can literally be anything you want to be.\"\n\n\"PTSD isn't a death sentence,\" Union continues. \"You don't have to be alone or feel isolated. There are so many of us out there who are dealing with exactly what you're dealing with and it doesn't make you weak. It doesn't make you anything but human. And we all have something, and you might even become a successful actress and best-selling author, and, I don't know, be dope, because that's what you deserve.\"", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/632895db8e9974d90fed1e4b/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6335ae3534fbac242ca9e777/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/631b5e6d4245f72a666a7ce0/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6331e236aede0318a7e07f0b/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Emily Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/gabrielle-union-ptsd-video-child-mind-institute", "title": "Gabrielle Union Opens Up About Being a PTSD Survivor in Inspiring Video", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Gabrielle Union talked about the PTSD she's experienced since she was 19 years old in a video for The Child Mind Institute's #MyYoungerSelf campaign.", "id": "5af5c844618fc612cd1c0869", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5af5c844618fc612cd1c0869", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Gabrielle Union talked about the PTSD she's experienced since she was 19 years old in a video for The Child Mind Institute's #MyYoungerSelf campaign.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She's reaching out to other survivors in an inspiring new video.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Gabrielle Union Opens Up About Not Letting PTSD Define Her Life", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/gabrielle-union-ptsd-video-child-mind-institute"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-11T18:10:05.683Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-11T18:10:05.683Z", "author": "Emily Wang"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "She's reaching out to other survivors in an inspiring new video.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5af5c844bf6159158812ea4f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-950716652.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Gabrielle Union Opens Up About Not Letting PTSD Define Her Life"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526062205.683, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
