While slower paced episodes are not necessarily problematic, per se, both episodes had their faults. The standout scenes from the two would definitely be the scenes between Megan and Terence. The chemistry between Christine Evangelista and Michael Vartan was off the charts, and I was sort of sad to everything resolved in one episode. It was this weirdly intoxicating game of cat and mouse, and I was on the edge of my seat the entire time. Besides their explosive interactions, there wasn\u2019t much else of note. Kyle continues to doubt himself as a director and shut Megan out, which is both predictable and frustrating. Would it kill him to open up to his fianc\u00e9e? Elsewhere, Deann\u2019s affair with Mason comes to a confusing end, leading to the introduction of Mason\u2019s son. As for where that storyline\u2019s going I have no idea. It was just one ineffective twist and turn after another. Viewers were also \u201ctreated\u201d to the reappearance of Hope, who may or may not be coming back. So without further ado, let\u2019s dive in.\n\n\n\n\n\ngood friend\n\nSo Megan and Terence\u2019s sessions didn\u2019t go exactly how I thought they would. At the beginning of \u201cThe Sessions\u201d the pair start their work together and things get off to an ambiguous start, only to be made more precarious when Terence wants to accelerate their work. Terence can tell Megan\u2019s bullshitting him, not buying her response about how she finds it difficult to get out of bed in the morning, just lying there and waiting to be judged. He believes there\u2019s something else at the core of her stress. He may be a douche, but he is right, as Megan tells Shaun she can\u2019t keep faking her way through their sessions; Terence is too sharp. In an attempt to go someplace Megan doesn\u2019t want to, the pair watch Megan\u2019s videoed answer to the \u201cthree imperatives\u201d from the pilot. While Megan thinks she\u2019s being glib, Terence believes someone\u2019s hiding real pain, something she\u2019s still hiding. Despite Megan supposedly working through her issues at the facility, Terence believes something is still triggering Megan. Megan may think the imperatives are bullshit \u2013 they\u2019re just about how people act and react \u2013 but Terence says they\u2019re only bullshit if Megan wants them to be. If Megan is open, those answers can be extremely powerful. He then asks Megan what her greatest fear is, and surprisingly, she tells him a version of the truth. While viewers could have guessed Megan\u2019s greatest fear was Terence, I never actually expected her to tell him to his face. I had just assumed the two would play this game of cat and mouse during their sessions, but I was completely taken aback by her revelation. The reasons Megan told Terence make sense: He controls every aspect of her, and if she disappoints him \u2013 like getting back in touch with Hope \u2013 everything she has goes away. Terence has already forced Megan to go the facility; what else is he truly capable of doing to her? And if Terence were to find out about Megan\u2019s plan to take down IHM, she could end up in a ditch somewhere, just like Kyle\u2019s weird in-home therapist from season one. On top of everything, Megan has no idea who Terence really is, besides being the puppet master who controls her entire life. So what does Terence do upon learning this? Well, he decides to rectify the situation by letting Megan get to know him better.So if anyone was expecting some sort of weird IHM seminar, they would be sorely mistaken as Terence takes Megan to a diner to talk. Yes, a diner. Not exactly the direction I thought he\u2019d go in, but OK. Just like viewers, Megan wants to know how this is all going to work. Terence says this is Megan\u2019s opportunity to get to know him, so she can ask him anything she wants. When asked what his greatest fear, Terence claims it\u2019s snakes. However, Megan sees right through that answer. When Megan pressed him, he looked terrified, as viewers saw him flashback to someone trying to kill him. While Terence claims he\u2019s worked very hard to harness his fear, Megan doesn\u2019t think so, as he never honestly answered her question. She keeps insisting, and he finally caves, making her promise not to tell anyone. He tells Megan someone tried to kill him last week, and, in that moment, he believed he was going to die. However, there\u2019s nothing Terence can do about it. Neither he nor the police will probably ever find that guy. That feeling of powerlessness is how Terence\u2019s mother made him feel. He reveals he used to eat fries with butter as a child. Despite his mother forbidding it, Terence would do it anyway. Apparently, he had issues with authority. No surprise there. After being caught though, Terence\u2019s mom would drag him into the kitchen and force him to eat a whole stick of butter. Where was his father during this whole ordeal, you ask? Well, Terence\u2019s father died when Terence was young. After divulging some much about his personal life, Terence wants to know why Megan is so fixated on his childhood. Megan says pretending a little boy is sitting across from her makes Terence a little less terrifying. He\u2019s just a person, like everyone else. Well, not exactly like anyone else, but the scenes at the diner did wonders to provide some much need backstory for Terence. With the show mainly following Kyle and Megan, viewers have had little opportunity to really get to know Terence as other than a villain. He\u2019s still a despicable human being, but for the first time, viewers got to see him a three-dimensional character. While none of his childhood trauma excuses his behavior, it does inform his actions. Megan and viewers now have a better idea of what makes Terence Terence, of why he is the way he is.Megan\u2019s takeaway from the diner was that Terence doesn\u2019t like to be vulnerable, and tells Shaun she\u2019s taking him out for drinks. Since he\u2019s exposed, Megan wants to take advantage of that. Even though Shaun has reservations, Megan doesn\u2019t. While no one should go through something like that, Terence isn\u2019t a good man. During drinks, Terence tells Megan there are certain things he\u2019s done and choices he has to live with, like maybe forcing Megan to the facility for instance. Megan feels that by opening up about her regrets, something she was forced to do at the facility, it freed her, but Terence wants to know why they\u2019re here. How is Megan collapsing at a public event freeing? Terence again wants to know why Megan is so interested in him, not believing her concern over wanting to help him. He then proposes Megan\u2019s fear of Terence is just a projection, a stand-in for the true enigma in her life: Her father. So if anyone else was confused about where that idea came from, you\u2019re not alone. One minute the pair are slow dancing, and then the next, Terence is like you\u2019re not scared of me; you\u2019re just projecting onto me about the man who abandoned you. While Megan tells Terence her father didn\u2019t abandon her, the truth is she doesn\u2019t know why. Terence then shares that his father abandoned him too, dropping dead of a heart attack at 40 and leaving him with his mother. Terence said that experience dictated every choice he has made since, believing Megan\u2019s father abandoning her has had the same impact. Terence says if Megan doesn\u2019t confront her anger, then it\u2019ll keep eating her up from the inside. How does he know? Well she\u2019s just like him. In an effort to have Megan confront that anger, Terence gives her a file on where her father is, telling her their work together is done, but now her real work begins. After such an intense turn of events, I wasn\u2019t expecting their sessions to end so abruptly. The chemistry between Christine Evangelista and Michael Vartan was off the charts that I was sort of sad to everything resolved in one episode. I feel like a few episodes of the pair sparing while playing their ever changing game of cat and mouse would have been phenomenal to watch. As much as I hate Terence, I would love to see him and Megan interact more after both actors proved how explosive they are together.Besides going through the ringer with Terence, Megan also has to deal with Kyle\u2019s overbearing nature. After the cast has their first table read, Deann and Kyle are both worried about Megan\u2019s performance. When Kyle asks for Terence\u2019s opinion about Megan, Terence says he thinks Megan was focused, maybe a little cold, but Kyle will get her there. However, Kyle wants to know how Terence\u2019s session with Megan went. With shooting only being three days away, Kyle doesn\u2019t want Terence to rattle her. And then during a lunch with Megan, Kyle, Xavier, and Xavier\u2019s girlfriend, Kyle openly suggests Megan draw from her real life experiences with her mother\u2019s death when they shoot the first scene. However, Megan feels like the way Kyle brought up the scene was some sort of test. Kyle just wants Megan to be ready, as she seems distracted, not that he blames her. With them planning a wedding and making a movie and Megan spending all her time with Terence, so of course, Megan would be distracted. Megan says she\u2019s spending time with Terence to try to figure some stuff out and feels like Kyle\u2019s projecting. Megan believes Kyle\u2019s concern over her performance is really just him projecting his fear onto her about how he\u2019s going to mess the film up. She\u2019ll be ready in two days and tells Kyle to deal with his own fears. This argument was particularly illuminating, as it showed just how much pressure Kyle is under. Like he tells Xavier, he can\u2019t afford to step on any landmines; this movie is too important. For his entire acting career, he has played a part, but this time, he can\u2019t hide behind a character. For Kyle, it\u2019s easier to blame Megan than actually deal with his own issues. How the movie turns out will mostly fall on his shoulders, so instead of dealing with his anxiety, he takes it out on Megan, who\u2019s already going through a lot with Terence. It\u2019s particularly annoying that he doesn\u2019t share his fears with Megan after they had they great conversation about Kyle\u2019s worries in \u201cSurface Tension.\u201d He really should have had more faith in Megan as she absolutely kills the hospital scene on the first take, despite a small hiccup in the beginning. He may no longer need to worry about Megan\u2019s performance, but near the end of \u201cThe Sessions,\u201d he finds out some bad news about\u2019s testing numbers.\u201cScene 23\u201d starts with Megan, Kyle, Terence and Deann on their way to the premiere of. Everyone wants to make sure Kyle is all right, asdidn\u2019t test well with audiences. On the red carpet, Kyle stresses he made the movie for the fans. While Megan tries to put a positive spin on the film, Terence says this is new territory, as Kyle has never had a film lose money before. Trying to make the best of the situation, or maybe ignoring reality, Kyle decides to do the whole talk show circuit to promote, believing if the film\u2019s promoted the right way, then maybe they can save the movie somehow. While Kyle tells Deann he\u2019ll figure out a way to make it all work that clearly isn\u2019t the case when he\u2019s onset the next day, blowing off both a crew member and Xavier who need his help. He was so focused on trying to salvagethat he risked the quality of. However, it seems like the film can\u2019t be saved as along with another batch of bad reviews, people are trashingonline. Megan wants to make sure Kyle is all right, but he brushes off her concerns once again. Megan tells Kyle he doesn\u2019t have to pretend with her, just wanting him to be real with her. She tells him they\u2019re getting married, which means supporting each other through the good and bad, ups and downs. Instead of comforting Kyle, Megan\u2019s words just make him angrier. It takes him like another twenty minutes until he can admit that Megan was right: The bad reviews and trash talk online were completely humiliating. And why didn\u2019t he just come out and say it? Well, Kyle said he has voices in his head telling him he\u2019s a failure, and now everyone knows, but mostly he\u2019s scared of Megan thinking he\u2019s a failure. So while it\u2019s great that Kyle finally opened up to Megan, he needed to have this conversation with her the morning after their fight on \u201cThe Sessions\u201d and not after a morethansex scene on set. At the end of the episode, Kyle says Megan was right: They should be sharing what they\u2019re going through. It\u2019s getting repetitive to keep watching this couple take one step forward, then two steps back. Like either start communicating or see a therapist.While Megan and Shaun have hit a roadblock in how to take down IHM \u2013 Shaun mentioned in \u201cThe Sessions\u201d she wasn\u2019t and won\u2019t be able to see what Megan saw at the facility \u2013 Megan has the crazy idea to reach out to Hope. As viewers will remember, Hope mentioned in season one knowing people who had been through hell at IHM. Sensibly, Shaun doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea; this is the same person who leaked nude pictures of Megan to the press after she wasn\u2019t the center of attention for one night after all. However, Megan just wants Hope to put her in touch with some people, believing this is her only option and reaching out to Hope despite Shaun\u2019s objections. When Megan and Hope finally reunite, the awkwardness between the two is palpable. Megan asks Hope if thelead can put her in contact with people who have had bad experiences with IHM. When Hope asks why, Megan doesn\u2019t elaborate, but eventually Hope agrees to reach out to her actor friend to see if said friend\u2019s boyfriend would be willing to talk. After getting a text from Hope confirming the meetup with Hope\u2019s friend\u2019s boyfriend, Megan goes to meet her former friend. While they wait, the two easily fall back into their former roles of best friends until Megan learns the guy isn\u2019t coming. Obviously, Megan\u2019s upset, but Hope said she just wanted a chance to patch things up with Megan. While wanting to make up with Megan is admirable, Hope shouldn\u2019t have lied to Megan yet again. Hope may have finally made it in Hollywood, but she\u2019s still her same old self. So after the failed meetup, I wasn\u2019t expecting anything else to happen, but the real shocker came at the end of \u201cScene 23\u201d when Zach, also known as Kyle\u2019s assistant, revealed he was the one who was supposed to meet Megan. Apparently Zach has some serious dirt on IHM, but he tells Megan they need to be careful as IHM and Terence are always listening. Upon learning this, however, Megan tells Zach she has no idea what he\u2019s talking about. Given everything that IHM and Terence has put Megan through, it wasn\u2019t really that surprising that she rebuffed Zach\u2019s efforts. For all she knows, this could be another trap set by Terence. As much as Megan and viewers learned about him in \u201cThe Sessions,\u201d he is still a very dangerous and powerful man, who wouldn\u2019t think twice about testing her loyalties, in the name of protecting Kyle.We all knew happily ever after couldn\u2019t last forever for Deann and Mason. While the lovers are out at dinner, Mason announces she has to go back to Napa. One of the vineyard\u2019s major buyers pulled out, but fixing the problem isn\u2019t as simple as slapping on it and flying back to Deann. Mason\u2019s says the time she\u2019s spent with Deann has been amazing, but she\u2019s been there for months and now her business is suffering. However, Deann doesn\u2019t believe Mason\u2019s reason for needing to rush back to Napa so abruptly. The pair are closer than they have been in decades, and in Deann\u2019s mind, Mason is running away. For Deann, Mason\u2019s is once again pushing her away, but Mason remembers things a little differently. According to Mason, Deann chose Terence and the lifestyle that came with him over Mason years ago. It\u2019s a she said she said situation, and while viewers may never know exactly what happened, both women are probably a little bit right. Mason may in fact be running, and Deann probably did choose Terence and that extravagant lifestyle over Mason. Despite leaving things unsettled, Deann decides she can\u2019t go back to just once a year. She leaves Mason a voicemail, telling Mason she\u2019ll come to Napa and then they\u2019ll figure it out together. I\u2019d say get the private jet ready, but things take a sharp 180-degree turn when Deann learns from Wes, Mason\u2019s son, that Mason has died. Was anyone else besides me just confused at the sudden death of Mason? Her death wasn\u2019t so much as shocking as just weird. I wasn\u2019t expecting the characters to ride off into the sunset together, but I didn\u2019t expect the writers to just kill Mason off. While the actress may have only been available for three episodes, it just seems like lazy writing to me. Viewers were introduced to this mysterious woman from Deann\u2019s past, but we hardly got to know, or care about her, before she was six feet under. Like I feel bad for Deann because she obviously cared about this woman, but Mason\u2019s sudden death packed no emotional punch. Wouldn\u2019t it have been more powerful if Mason died on screen, in the arms of Deann? That may seem a little, or a lot, clich\u00e9, but it would have been a more appropriate sendoff. What had started out as a promising story arc completely disintegrated in the span of ten seconds.As agrieving lover, Deann is understandably heartbroken, to the point where Megan finds her crying on the bathroom atpremiere. So naturally Deann attends Mason\u2019s funeral and tells Wes, played by\u2019s Jacob Artist, how sorry she is for his loss. While Deann is at a loss to express how much Mason meant to her, Wes has a pretty good idea, as there was a picture of Deann on their living room mantle. Knowing how much Mason loved Wes, a character who viewers previously learned has struggled with addiction, Deann takes it upon to look out for him. She gives him her card and tells him to reach out if he needs anything. Whether it was Deann\u2019s kind words or Wes\u2019s desire to meet Kyle West, he takes Deann up on her offer and spends a day on set of. While the movie set wasn\u2019t what he expected, it felt like a family, something he\u2019s been lacking since his mother died. So he then takes Deann\u2019s invitation to visit anytime as a cue to kiss his late mother\u2019s lover, which is completely inappropriate. Thankfully, Deann pushes him away, telling Wes this will never happen. I mean, how incestuous would a May-September affair with your late lover\u2019s son be? Despite the transgression, Deann let\u2019s Wes know it\u2019s all right; there\u2019s no script for how to deal with death, but kissing your late mother\u2019s lover should probably be a given. Instead of sending Wes back to Napa like a normal person, Deann gets Wes a job on, which will most likely end up blowing up in her face. I mean, what does Deann even really know about Wes? All we know is he has struggled with addiction in the past, and while that doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019ll relapse again, losing his mother isn\u2019t the best thing for someone\u2019s sobriety. Does giving him a job in a high-stress environment really help anyone?It\u2019s a dangerous line Deann is walking. Like I get that loosing Mason is hard for Deann, and she wants to be there for Mason\u2019s son, but it\u2019s not exactly the best idea to have him be a production assistant on the set of a film here you work.Some stray thoughts:- Both \u201cThe Sessions\u201d and \u201cScene 23\u201d mention Megan\u2019s dad. Who wants to start taking bets on when her father is going to first appear. My guess is before the end of the season.- Is anyone else getting the impression that Terence and Shaun may hookup in the near future? There were several moments over the past two episodes where I got a serious vibe from them that their relationship may be more than strictly platonic. If the show decides to go there, that would certainly be an interesting development what with Shaun working with Megan to bring down IHM and Terence and Deann trying to have a baby.- Speaking of having a baby, does Terence really think having a child with Deann will magically solve all their problems? I get that he wants to leave something behind, but his and Deann\u2019s relationship issues will still be there, even if she does get pregnant.- I really loved that Deann somewhat confided in Megan about what was going on. Viewers don\u2019t really get a chance to see them interact, but it\u2019s clear they care about each other. I love their relationship and would love to see more of it.- Shaun was completely right to tell Megan she needed to take a step back. By helping Megan, she is putting her job and ability to practice law on the line for Megan. While Megan feels like Shaun is choosing IHM and Terence over her, she should remember just how much Shaun has to lose. As horrible as IHM and Terence are, Shaun doesn\u2019t need to be collateral damage in Megan\u2019s revenge plan.So hit the comments below to let me know your thoughts. What were your thoughts on Megan and Terence\u2019s intense sessions? Why is Kyle incapable of letting Megan in? Have we seen the last of Hope? What do you think about the incestuous Deann/Mason/Wes love triangle?", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-c3WjFS05sEe9U.gif", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-vYwJ5TS0Fxw/Wsq3G2ojb4I/AAAAAAAAAoc/N68w0iz3OHA1oenAqKRxm2LOQKy0RACIQCLcBGAs/s320/megan%252Bterence3.jpg", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-Rg1LCPrFQRg/Wsq3cFA1-eI/AAAAAAAAAo0/wWaNFYyoS7sMbkwXTeu1I9hu9d-NYpucwCLcBGAs/s320/deann%252Bwes.jpg", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-fjDeW4HBh2o/Wsq3VyCLigI/AAAAAAAAAos/99QgAO3mBmk6Rhj3iN3sSyPMh1FGkSTYgCLcBGAs/s320/hope.jpg", "https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-jsIwSIvU_H0/Wsq3KAYMMbI/AAAAAAAAAog/xCoAPq9E7YEdpU5TFMS7PXKFpIFjhrY2wCLcBGAs/s320/megan%252Bterence.jpg", "https://files.spoilertv.com/icons/stvminilogo.png", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-yeTqeLs8-hU/Wsq3Ou0rbJI/AAAAAAAAAok/H_gDsXV6PYUsEmjAubcyK4xX41E33_TjgCLcBGAs/s320/megan%252Bkyle.jpg", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/ANbyha3QDmNcDEu6fC3wHMR8MGNSBr8s7WTLUHZs0JYBU1-1AuW-tzxIw7W_fxd-irwFZxKxTorhh6aZimnNR7h2Clw-DZD_QwJecsJ-hRrgmrByCiFyzQMTgYRgT5ddJKj2qA=s0-d", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-5EQVIgJJCQI/Wsq3Ywrm56I/AAAAAAAAAow/Sut43BOEpJ8UGeICiZZxzACuJ1Ax21DrgCLcBGAs/s320/deann.jpg", "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/ANbyha21WD4SnuvbzADjIQhFShIQ-UkUgunRFpSz37_Uh1sArs3sc8a5bLF69_qM7Goj__XCx-3eqNwq-36TQKf5RFj45g4dxzIXANu9KLc3Ims6WG9NIfZUuyvoA_ymdK7kq4FnJLk13vOxFV3zL5_sGNlrN-7QoLM=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "https://4.bp.blogspot.com/-DmZXyoRi45A/Wsq3EP1uBxI/AAAAAAAAAoY/AgQkNdIGtCksY9YP_KZEwHbHjkeorEqEgCLcBGAs/s320/megan%252Bterence2.jpg", "https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.spoilertv.com/images/headers/the-arrangement.jpg", "https://3.bp.blogspot.com/-Ga0kDLGYRgU/Wsq3SVcHqlI/AAAAAAAAAoo/XpXyKJl6LdIrEwj1iFpWA6oOkhuJBtCcwCLcBGAs/s320/megan%252Bkyle2.jpg"], "top_img": "https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/blogger_img_proxy/ANbyha21WD4SnuvbzADjIQhFShIQ-UkUgunRFpSz37_Uh1sArs3sc8a5bLF69_qM7Goj__XCx-3eqNwq-36TQKf5RFj45g4dxzIXANu9KLc3Ims6WG9NIfZUuyvoA_ymdK7kq4FnJLk13vOxFV3zL5_sGNlrN-7QoLM=w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Posted Gmail.Com"], "canonical_link": "https://www.spoilertv.com/2018/04/the-arrangement-sessions-scene-23.html", "title": "Double Review: \"The Truth Will Set You Free\"", "meta_data": {"generator": "blogger", "p": {"domain_verify": "7c876f6b0fe866261c628b503ff39358"}, "msvalidate.01": "FB96BC456EB5B8B7F212D44EAD06C37E", "fb": {"app_id": 177209699002423, "admins": 690495378}, "twitter": {"account_id": 1510093617, "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@SpoilerTV", "domain": "https://www.spoilertv.com", "title": "The Arrangement - The Sessions & Scene 23 - Double Review: \"The Truth Will Set You Free\"", "image": {"src": "https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.spoilertv.com/images/headers/the-arrangement.jpg"}, "description": "The Largest Collection of TV spoilers and show information for the most popular shows on TV", "url": "https://www.spoilertv.com/2018/04/the-arrangement-sessions-scene-23.html"}, "google-site-verification": "kDe-Nz7BtG55fUKTxevLAWxgFj2SIELluleFqFTIPBQ", "verify_w": "580ed07c99332d9ee4e03b926f09315b", "verify-v1": "IXXOEgqXvgU7xF8N+UAL3FQzzMOar4JTKUhYuPIWx7w=", "theme-color": "#2D90B6", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "The Arrangement - The Sessions & Scene 23 - Double Review: \"The Truth Will Set You Free\"", "viewport": "width=device-width", "og": {"url": "https://www.spoilertv.com/2018/04/the-arrangement-sessions-scene-23.html", "title": "The Arrangement - The Sessions & Scene 23 - Double Review: \"The Truth Will Set You Free\"", "image": "https://storage.googleapis.com/cdn.spoilertv.com/images/headers/the-arrangement.jpg", "site_name": "SpoilerTV", "type": "article"}, "google-adsense-platform-account": "ca-host-pub-1556223355139109", "google-adsense-platform-domain": "blogspot.com", "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-09T01:45:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-09T01:45:00+01:00", "author": "j.lerner1295@gmail.com", "tag": "The Arrangement"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523234700.0, "source": "https://www.spoilertv.com", "summary": ""}
