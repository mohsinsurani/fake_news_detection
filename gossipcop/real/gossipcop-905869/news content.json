Whether she\u2019s trying out trendy colors like Champagne pop blonde, playing with a smoky quartz shade, or going dark for a summer goth vibe, she\u2019s a total hair chameleon.\n\nBut her latest look has little to do with color and everything to do with a dramatic haircut. In fact, she\u2019s proving that blunt bangs might be the trend to watch in 2018.\n\nEmma was on hand at the 2018 Critics\u2019 Choice Awards to support her longtime partner Evan Peters, who was nominated for Best Actor for his role in American Horror Story: Cult. The couple walked the red carpet together, but we gotta say, Emma\u2019s blunt bangs stole the show.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bd1bUSalsgW\n\nEmma has been rocking a short blonde bob for a while now, but her blunt bangs are giving us so many vintage vibes. She looks like an old Hollywood movie star, especially in her cream satin strapless Giorgio Armani gown, which she paired with coordinating strappy sandals. She kept her jewelry and accessories simple and elegant, complimenting the look with a statement brow with pink lip. It all came together for the perfect hint-of-edge vibe.\n\nWe hope the couple had a fabulous night out, and we can\u2019t wait to see more of Emma\u2019s bangin\u2019 new locks (slash see what she does next).", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1476'%20height='2000'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/12/Emma-Roberts-bangs-e1515769607585.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/12/Emma-Roberts-bangs-e1515769607585.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/12/Emma-Roberts-2000.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/12/Emma-Roberts-bangs-e1515769607585.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Arielle Tschinkel"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/emma-roberts-blunt-bangs-2018-critics-choice-awards/", "title": "Emma Roberts debuted blunt, platinum bangs at the 2018 Critics\u2019 Choice Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Emma Roberts showed off her brand new blunt bangs on the red carpet at the 2018 Critics' Choice Awards \u2014 check out her fresh look here!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Emma Roberts debuted blunt, platinum bangs at the 2018 Critics' Choice Awards", "description": "Emma Roberts showed off her brand new blunt bangs on the red carpet at the 2018 Critics' Choice Awards \u2014 check out her fresh look here!", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/emma-roberts-blunt-bangs-2018-critics-choice-awards/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/12/Emma-Roberts-bangs-e1515769607585.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1000, "height": 667, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-12T12:08:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T15:21:15+00:00"}, "author": "Arielle Tschinkel", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Arielle Tschinkel", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515758928.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
