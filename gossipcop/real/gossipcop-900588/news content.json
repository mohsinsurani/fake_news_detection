According to People, the whole thing has caused fresh outrage about the chef online. In the newsletter, Batali wrote:\n\n\"As many of you know, this week there has been some news coverage about some of my past behavior. I have made many mistakes and I am so very sorry that I have disappointed my friends, my family, my fans and my team. My behavior was wrong and there are no excuses. I take full responsibility.\"\n\n\"Sharing the joys of Italian food, tradition and hospitality with all of you, each week, is an honor and privilege. Without the support of all of you \u2014 my fans \u2014 I would never have a forum in which to expound on this. I will work every day to regain your respect and trust.\"\n\nThere is then a post script that reads:\n\n\"In case you're searching for a holiday-inspired breakfast, these Pizza Dough Cinnamon Rolls are a fan favorite.\"\n\nThe newsletter concluded with a photo of the recipe and a link to the recipe on mariobatali.com. Twitter had immediate reactions to the newsletter:\n\nThe latest apology comes after multiple women accused Batali of sexual misconduct, in investigations published by Eater and The New York Times. He has since stepped down (or has been dramatically removed, in more than one case) from his various businesses including Eataly, and \"The Chew.\"\n\nFollow Delish on Instagram.\n\nDownload the Delish app.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/enchirito-taco-bell-1665164618.jpg?crop=0.526xw:1.00xh;0.0505xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-foodhats3-1665084745.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/cm/15/10/54f93f1f910af_-_icedtea_web.jpg?crop=0.772xw:0.966xh;0.0609xw,0.0341xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/50/4000x2000/landscape-1513023692-gettyimages-615123294.jpg?resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ap-hard-dew-i-dew-100522-0277-1665163300.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.769xh;0,0.0886xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fallfoods-1596750864.jpg?crop=0.875xw:0.875xh;0.0705xw,0.0593xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/halloween-pails-lifestyle-1665068130.png?crop=0.565xw:1.00xh;0.218xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/final-liquid-death-martha-mv-square-v4-1665076274.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pete-davidson-1665095314.jpeg?crop=0.564xw:1.00xh;0.0737xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-whiteelephant-1-1664992883.gif?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.216xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hidden-valley-ranch-couch-1665160829.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.804xh;0,0.119xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/delish-eggnog-spice-cake-still003-1574825973.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.delish.com/_assets/design-tokens/delish/static/images/logos/network-logo.921541b.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/22-del-howtotip-1664980462.gif?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.223xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/50/3200x3200/square-1513001512-gettyimages-861024920.jpg?resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/trader-joes-store-in-princeton-new-jersey-news-photo-1017468134-1545252542.jpg?crop=0.688xw:1.00xh;0.157xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/del.h-cdn.co/assets/17/50/4000x2000/landscape-1513023692-gettyimages-615123294.jpg?resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a57292/mario-batali-recipe-sexual-misconduct-apology/", "title": "Mario Batali Included A Cinnamon Roll Recipe In His Apology About Sexual Misconduct", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Mario Batali Included A Cinnamon Roll Recipe In His Apology About Sexual Misconduct", "description": "Wait.
