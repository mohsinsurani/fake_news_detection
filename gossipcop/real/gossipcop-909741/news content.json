Independent record stores are hugely important to me,\" Pearl Jam's Mike McCready said in a statement publicizing the peak-vinyl event. \"Support every independent record store that you can. They're really a good part of society. Know if you love music, this is the place to find it.\"\n\nWith a dozen GRAMMY nominations to date, Pearl Jam's sole win so far was at the 38th GRAMMY Awards for \"Spin The Black Circle\" for Best Hard Rock Performance.\n\nPearl Jam will be performing on March 3 in Tempe, Ariz. at the Innings festival, on June 15 in Florence, Italy at the Firenze Rocks Festival and at another festival in Barolo, Italy on June 17.
