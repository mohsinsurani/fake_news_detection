It begins, \u201cDustin Hoffman sexually harassed me when I was 17.\u201d Then I give the details: When I was a senior in high school in New York City, interning as a production assistant on the set of the Death of a Salesman TV film, he asked me to give him a foot massage my first day on set; I did. He was openly flirtatious, he grabbed my ass, he talked about sex to me and in front of me. One morning I went to his dressing room to take his breakfast order; he looked at me and grinned, taking his time. Then he said, \u201cI\u2019ll have a hard-boiled egg \u2026 and a soft-boiled clitoris.\u201d His entourage burst out laughing. I left, speechless. Then I went to the bathroom and cried.\n\nThe first several times I told this story, I left out the soft-boiled clitoris. When I finally started including it, my voice sometimes broke. But it got easier. When I spoke to a reporter recently and she told me she would have to track down people from the set to verify my account, I felt queasy. What would they say? I could only imagine them shaking their heads: \u201cShe didn\u2019t seem too bothered by it then. She sure laughed a lot.\u201d\n\nThere was so much I loved about being on set \u2014 taking John Malkovich\u2019s lunch orders and falling more deeply in love every time he spoke to me or said my name; bonding with the crew as we worked 16-hour days; hearing Arthur Miller say my first two names because they sounded like a word game, and that amused him; dancing the polka with Charles Durning, who made every room he entered a happier place. And yes, I loved the attention from Dustin Hoffman. Until I didn\u2019t.\n\nDuring my five weeks on set, I detailed my days and mailed dispatches to my sister in London after making copies for myself. Recently, I reread them for the first time in several years.\n\n*Some names have been changed\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWEEK ONE\n\nJanuary 21, 1985 During lunch I had to put some chairs in Dustin Hoffman\u2019s room. When I went in, he was with Elizabeth* [another production assistant], his daughter Jenna, his stand-in Cassandra (who was giving him a foot massage) and his assistant Frankie.\n\n\u201cWhy don\u2019t you join our little party?\u201d\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t finished my lunch.\u201d\n\n\u201cSo go get your lunch.\u201d\n\nSo I did. Cassandra was rubbing his feet and he said, \u201cAh, this goes right to my brain. You know, every time you touch your foot, it goes to a different part of your body. Right now, Cas is at my right kidney.\u201d\n\nJenna said, \u201cGood, press harder!\u201d\n\nWhen Cassandra had gone, he asked me to massage his foot. I said, \u201cI\u2019m only good at necks.\u201d\n\nHe said, \u201cSo pretend it\u2019s a neck.\u201d\n\nElizabeth and I were discussing why he is so nice to us. One reason is because he likes girls. Jenna is in eighth grade. Another is probably because he gets tired of all the kissy-assy people.\n\n[promo:1053463]\n\nJanuary 23, 1985 Today, Dustin entertained me, Elizabeth, John Malkovich, Stephen Lang and Arthur Miller with an enlightening discussion on breasts. Needless to say, I felt quite inadequate throughout the whole thing. He said, \u201cI don\u2019t like them when they\u2019re tan, because then they look like part of the body.\u201d Stephen said, \u201cWhich they\u2019re not.\u201d Dustin is a great storyteller.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWEEK TWO\n\nJanuary 28, 1985 Dustin said to me today, \u201cSo, did you have sex over the weekend like I told you?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat is this, celibate weekends?\u201d\n\n\u201cNext weekend, OK?\u201d\n\n\u201cNo, I\u2019m talking about last weekend. You sure you didn\u2019t?\u201d\n\n\u201cYes.\u201d I was cracking up.\n\n\u201cSmile if you\u2019re lying.\u201d\n\nJanuary 31, 1985 Today, I realized some things about this business that scare me. First of all, Dustin\u2019s a lech. I\u2019m completely disillusioned. After Tootsie, I thought I wanted to marry him.\n\nElizabeth asked him what he wanted for lunch and he said, \u201cYour left breast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re disgusting.\u201d\n\n\u201cOK, your right breast.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou pig.\u201d She walked away.\n\nPam* [office assistant] said, \u201cIf [producer] Bob Colesberry had heard that, she would have been gone in a second.\u201d I know Dustin would never let that happen, but it\u2019s still scary.\n\nToday, when I was walking Dustin to his limo, he felt my ass four times. I hit him each time, hard, and told him he was a dirty old man. He took off his hat and pointed to his head (shaved for the part) and said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m a dirty young man, I have a full head of hair.\u201d So would Bob have fired me if he\u2019d seen me hit Dustin?\n\nI\u2019ll go out in the snow at 10 a.m. to get Kate [Reid] an anchovy pizza, and I\u2019ll order lunch from three different places so she can entertain her friends with champagne and caviar, but I\u2019m not going to let Dustin have his hands all over me. And I think it sucks if Bob Colesberry expects me to.\n\nFebruary 4, 1985 Today this business got scarier. Or at least less appealing. This morning when I asked Dustin what he wanted for breakfast, he said something that beat even his lows. It was worse than anything anyone has ever said to me on the street. It was so gross I couldn\u2019t say anything. I just turned around and walked out.\n\nThen later I tried to get into a serious conversation with Frankie about why Dustin is like that. I don\u2019t know how Dustin knew what we were talking about, but he shouted, \u201cAnna! Are you badmouthing me? Anna! Get over here, Anna!\u201d The whole crew was cracking up, and I ducked behind a set.\n\nLater, I was delivering lunches when John, Stephen and Dustin came down the hall and he shouted, \u201cAnna! So you think I\u2019m a sexist pig, huh? Anna!\u201d The whole fucking studio heard him. So I told him that I didn\u2019t appreciate his wandering hands or his comments. He apologized and said he would stop.\n\nAfter that he was so nice to me I was shocked. We talked about Ironweed (always a good conversation starter \u2014 \u201cSo, have you read Ironweed?\u201d). Between takes he kept passing me bubble gum. Suddenly a piece would come flying out of nowhere, and then I\u2019d see him smiling. When I was walking up the stairs carrying a box of Cokes, he rushed up and grabbed it for me. I guess he felt really bad. He was like he is around his wife \u2014 Mr. Paternity.\n\nBut the bad news is Brenda* [my supervisor] said it\u2019s too bad it became an issue. Hell, I didn\u2019t make it an issue. He did. She said that for the sake of the production we have to sacrifice some of our values and just let it roll over our heads. She said we should try to have a sense of humor and just giggle and slap his hands or something. But that\u2019s when I feel the cheapest, like, \u201cOh, she really likes it.\u201d\n\nI laugh at most things because I don\u2019t want to appear hard-nosed, but sometimes I just can\u2019t. You know? Most of this deference is directly because of my sex. I find that hard to deal with. I hope it\u2019s over now. Who knows, maybe Dustin respects me because of what I said.\n\nFebruary 8, 1985 Warren Beatty came to the studio yesterday. I was standing in the best place possible [to watch filming]. So he and Bob Colesberry stood next to me for 45 minutes. He smiled and I introduced myself. He looked good, but a bit gray.\n\nDustin said to me afterward, \u201cSo Anna, I get Warren tonight, you get him Tuesday?\u201d Today he said, \u201cYou might as well have undressed yourself. You were saying, \u2018Fuck me, fuck me, Warren.\u2019 \u201c\n\n[promo:1053464]\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWEEK FOUR\n\nFebruary 14, 1985 Dustin gave all the girls in the studio a key ring with a little heart that says, \u201cLove, Willy.\u201d Of course, I\u2019ll flaunt it when I go to school.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nWEEK FIVE\n\nFebruary 20, 1985 No one is 100 percent good or bad. Dustin\u2019s a pig, but I like him a lot.\n\n\u2022\u2022\u2022\n\nI have so many reactions reading these letters and looking at photos from that time. The novel Ironweed as a conversation starter! God bless that glorious, pretentious kid.\n\nMostly though, my heart aches. It aches for the teenager who was so thrilled to join a movie star\u2019s party that she gave him a foot rub even though she didn\u2019t want to, even though she tried to protest she wasn\u2019t good at it. My heart aches for the awkward virgin with the bad hair who had only been kissed three times in her life, laughing as the man her father\u2019s age talked about breasts and sex. I want to weep that she found this charming.\n\nI want to hug her for having the guts to tell him to stop, even though her voice shook. Because she was so proud of herself. But I wonder what her reaction would have been if she\u2019d wanted to join the film business \u2014 if the internship hadn\u2019t been a fun way to get out of classes her last semester of high school? Would she have swallowed her humiliation and ditched her college plans to accept his offer of a job on Ishtar? As it was, this was a lark, and damn if she was going to let a few shitty encounters get in the way of the most exciting experience of her life. She was going to flaunt the keychain he gave her and take pictures with every actor she could get her hands on.\n\nLast, I wish I could tell her: That pressure you\u2019re always feeling to lighten up, laugh at things, not be hard-nosed? That\u2019s never going to go away. But one day, when you\u2019re in your 40s, you\u2019re going to realize just how good it feels to finally say \u201cFuck you\u201d to everyone who would have you dampen your anger. Your rage is going to fly, and it\u2019s going to feel good.\n\nThe rage does feel good, momentarily. But it\u2019s not the whole story, as I knew then. Yes, he was gross. But he could also be sweet and wanted me to like him. Which I did.\n\nWhenever I talk about this, I sense that my listeners want a victim and a villain. And I wish my feelings were as clear as theirs. I would be more comfortable if I felt nothing but revulsion for a man who had power over me and abused it.\n\nBut I still like watching him onscreen. I owned the VHS of Tootsie for a long time and watched it over and over in my 20s and 30s, even as I remembered telling him how disappointed I was, that I expected better of him after that movie. Not long ago I watched All the President\u2019s Men for the first time in years and then texted my sister: Is it weird that I find him kind of sexy in this after what he did?\n\nHe wasn\u2019t the first to make me think my physical presence was the best I had to offer. My freshman year in high school, there were a couple of older guys I liked who would sandwich me in the hallway between classes, running their hands over my hips and ass, saying, \u201cWe decided it was time to molest Anna.\u201d I would have rather been the girlfriend of one of them, but if it was a choice between being molested or being ignored, I chose their hands on me.\n\nWhen I was a sophomore, I wanted to take a writing class taught by Frank McCourt, who had not yet published Angela\u2019s Ashes but was a celebrity among the students. When I approached him, he put his arm around me and said, \u201cYou are good-looking. I can feast my tired eyes on you.\u201d I would have rather been my friend whose essay he liked so much he helped her get it published in The New York Times, but I was grateful to get into his class. By the time Dustin Hoffman asked me to give him a foot rub, I\u2019d learned to reconcile mild humiliation with desire for attention or access.\n\nA year and a half after Death of a Salesman, I would meet another, much older married actor who, like Dustin, alternately charmed and repelled me. Unlike Dustin, he was in it for the long game. It took him weeks to kiss the top of my head and eight months to invite me to his apartment to take a nap. People use the term grooming to describe what sexual predators do with children so they can reap the benefits, but what if they groom us so other men can reap the benefits? Did the older guys in high school pave the way for Dustin Hoffman who paved the way for the other actor who paved the way for all the other older men I\u2019ve known were bad news but whom I\u2019ve been drawn to anyway? At 49, I understand what Dustin Hoffman did as it fits into the larger pattern of what women experience in Hollywood and everywhere. He was a predator, I was a child, and this was sexual harassment. As to how it fits into my own pattern, I imagine I\u2019ll be figuring that out for years to come.\n\nEditor\u2019s Note: Contacted by The Hollywood Reporter, Hoffman responded, \u201cI have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.\u201d\n\nHunter is an L.A.-based writer.

When I went in, he was with Elizabeth* [another production assistant], his daughter Jenna, his stand-in Cassandra (who was giving him a foot massage) and his assistant Frankie.\r\n\"Why don't you join our little party?\"\r\n\"I haven't finished my lunch.\"\r\n\"So go get your lunch.\"\r\nSo I did.

My freshman year in high school, there were a couple of older guys I liked who would sandwich me in the hallway between classes, running their hands over my hips and ass, saying, \"We decided it was time to molest Anna.\" I would have rather been the girlfriend of one of them, but if it was a choice between being molested or being ignored, I chose their hands on me.\r\nWhen I was a sophomore, I wanted to take a writing class taught by Frank McCourt, who had not yet published Angela's Ashes but was a celebrity among the students. When I approached him, he put his arm around me and said, \"You are good-looking. I can feast my tired eyes on you.\" I would have rather been my friend whose essay he liked so much he helped her get it published in The New York Times, but I was grateful to get into his class. By the time Dustin Hoffman asked me to give him a foot rub, I'd learned to reconcile mild humiliation with desire for attention or access.\r\nA year and a half after Death of a Salesman, I would meet another, much older married actor who, like Dustin, alternately charmed and repelled me. Unlike Dustin, he was in it for the long game. It took him weeks to kiss the top of my head and eight months to invite me to his apartment to take a nap. People use the term grooming to describe what sexual predators do with children so they can reap the benefits, but what if they groom us so other men can reap the benefits? Did the older guys in high school pave the way for Dustin Hoffman who paved the way for the other actor who paved the way for all the other older men I've known were bad news but whom I've been drawn to anyway? At 49, I understand what Dustin Hoffman did as it fits into the larger pattern of what women experience in Hollywood and everywhere. He was a predator, I was a child, and this was sexual harassment. As to how it fits into my own pattern, I imagine I'll be figuring that out for years to come.\r\nEditor's Note: Contacted by The Hollywood Reporter, Hoffman responded, \"I have the utmost respect for women and feel terrible that anything I might have done could have put her in an uncomfortable situation. I am sorry. It is not reflective of who I am.\"\r\nHunter is an L.A.-based writer.
