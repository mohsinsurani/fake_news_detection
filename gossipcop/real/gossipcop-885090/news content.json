Both Willow and Jaden are way ahead of their time (or just straight-up aliens) and they inspire us with their eccentric style and spirit. Whether it\u2019s Willow jamming out about another dimension, or Jaden bringing his hair as his date to the Met Gala, the two always have something up their sleeves. And their latest venture may just be their most charitable yet.\n\nWillow and Jaden have both donated clothing to support hurricane relief efforts. Hosted by TheRealReal, the sale will benefit the Caribbean Disaster Emergency Management Agency. If you\u2019ve been dreaming about a new denim jacket or a letterman coat worn by your favorite celebrity siblings, then you\u2019re in for a treat.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just Jaden and Willow who are donating. Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith will also donate pieces to the event. Meaning whether you\u2019re looking for Gucci slides or a men\u2019s sports coat, you can\u2019t go wrong.\n\nWhile Jada\u2019s pieces are mostly designer, both Willow and Jaden have a thorough mix of pieces for anyone who loves athleisure and genderless clothing.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BYNp96jDPPv\n\nCan you imagine showing up to work wearing a varsity jacket with \u201cWillow\u201d embroidered on it and explaining that it *actually* belonged to Willow Smith? No matter what piece you choose, there\u2019s a great story that will come with it. Maybe some of the Smith family talent will even rub off on you.\n\nEither way, you can grab a new fall staple and know you did something good. You\u2019ll be feeling like a Smith in no time.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1024'%20height='966'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/06/willowjadensmith.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='362'%20height='478'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/06/willowjadensmith.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/06/denim-2000.jpeg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/06/gucci.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20width='1517'%20height='2000'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/06/real.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/06/am.jpg", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/06/willowjadensmith.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/willow-jaden-smith-clothes-hurricane-relief/", "title": "Willow and Jaden Smith sell clothes for hurricane relief, prove they're sibling goals - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Both Willow and Jaden Smith have donated clothing to support hurricane relief efforts.
