Though it\u2019s unclear how they identified, Gill\u2019s obituary stated that they preferred to be called \u201cMr. Gill\u201d and speculated that they had undergone sex reassignment surgery.\n\nTrans actresses Trace Lysette (Transparent) and Jamie Clayton (Sense8, The Neon Demon) protested Johansson\u2019s casting, arguing that trans actors have enough trouble getting work in Hollywood and should not be deprived of the opportunity to play a rare character of their identity.\n\nThe video, produced by the queer digital magazine INTO, parodies Johansson\u2019s casting by envisioning a situation where a transgender man (Schofield) is offered one of Johansson\u2019s roles but turns it down because \u201ccis women are actually really marginalized in Hollywood, you know?\u201d\n\nSchofield adds, \u201cI know that there are people who have lived this experience and would bring a lot of authenticity to it, and I feel a little weird taking that from them.
