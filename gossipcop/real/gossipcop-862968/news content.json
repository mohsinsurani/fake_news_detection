Solomon June 23, 2017\n\nAs President Trump and first lady Melania Trump hosted their first congressional picnic on Thursday, Ivanka Trump was seen at the event, too \u2013 frolicking with her daughter on the White House lawn.\n\nIn pictures from the event, the first daughter \u2013 married to Jared Kushner and the mother of three children \u2013 is seen having a touching moment with her own daughter, Arabella. In one picture, she swings her daughter by the arms. In another, she pats her on the head while holding her infant son Theodore.\n\nMuch has been made of Ivanka Trump\u2019s picture-perfect aesthetics \u2013 and apparently that extends to her kids, too.\n\nTrump and Kushner\u2019s brood was also singled out for their cute looks, when they appeared in public during the recent Jewish holiday of Shavuot. The dynamic is reminiscent of the Kennedy White House \u2013 when young Jack, Jr. and Caroline lived in the executive mansion.\n\nSome have questioned whether Ivanka is oversharing images of her children \u2014 and potentially exposing them to unwanted scrutiny.\n\nContact Daniel J.
