CHRIS WATTIE / Reuters\n\nRain or shine, when the little prince steps out in public, he sports a pair of adorable shorts, often paired with knee socks, a preppy striped belt and a tucked-in polo (yes, at age 4, young George is already more put together than most of us will ever be.)\n\nPrince William, Duchess Kate, Prince George and Princess Charlotte arrive in Victoria, Canada.

Harper\u2019s Bazaar UK did some investigating, and they found that dressing young boys in shorts is a long-standing tradition among the British royalty and aristocracy.\n\n33 photos Slideshow The life of Prince George From the steps of St. Mary's Hospital in London to posing with his little sister Charlotte, take a look at the royal baby's adventures.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a very English thing to dress a young boy in shorts,\u201d British etiquette expert William Hanson told Bazaar. \u201cTrousers are for older boys and men, whereas shorts on young boys is one of those silent class markers that we have in England. Although times are (slowly) changing, a pair of trousers on a young boy is considered quite middle class\u2013quite suburban. And no self-respecting aristo or royal would want to be considered suburban.\u201d\n\nMost boys graduate to full-length trousers at about 8 years old, Hanson explained. He said the shorts-only tradition may stem from the antiquated custom of \u201cbreeching,\u201d which dates back centuries in the U.K.\n\nTraditionally, he said, young British boys were dressed in gowns for the first few years of their lives, until being \u201cbreeched\u201d and graduating to short trousers.\n\nPrince George balances on a wooden swing at the family's Norfolk home in July 2016. MATT PORTEOUS / PA\n\nPrince George is following in his father\u2019s footsteps in the shorts department. The Duke of Cambridge sported a very similar look in his younger years:\n\nPrincess Diana taking Prince William for his first day of nursery school in September 1985.
