And hosts realize they can turn their star appeal and show business acumen into even more cash. So which active late night hosts carry the most coin? Let's see what's in their wallet.\n\n01 of 13 Conan O'Brien: $85 Million Rob Kim / Getty Images Conan O'Brien's quirky brand of late night TV has served him well in basic cable. His clever, fresh show and successful production company net him an estimated net worth of $85 million dollars. He makes $12 million a year on TBS.\n\n02 of 13 Stephen Colbert: $45 Million Frederick M. Brown/Getty Images While Stephen Colbert still holds the No. 2 spot with respect to net worth, Colbert took a pay cut when he moved from to on CBS. Back on Comedy Central, Colbert collected a cool $6. On CBS, he allegedly makes about $4.5 million. His net worth remains a nice $45 million. Why the pay cut? According to reports, it was the move from cable to network television, with the larger audience part of Colbert's overall benefits. We bet it won't be long before Colbert gets a bump in salary.\n\n03 of 13 Jimmy Kimmel: $35 Million Kevin Winter/Getty Images Late night talk show host Jimmy Kimmel's net worth climbs from $25 to $35 million. That's due in part to a pay rise. The host now makes about $10 million a year.\n\n04 of 13 Chelsea Handler: $35 Million Todd Williamson / Getty Images With her streaming shows on Netflix - which are kind of talk shows, we suppose - late night's Chelsea Handler comes in at No. 4. She also increases her net worth to $35 million. She makes a reported $10 million a year as part of her 7-year Netflix contract. Some reports suggested Handler made $12 million a year for her former late night talk show.\n\n05 of 13 Craig Ferguson: $30 Million Jerod Harris / Getty Images Scotland's own Craig Ferguson hits the $30 million net worth marker even after departing his late night show, The Late Late Show with Craig Ferguson. Today he hosts a game show and launched a niche talk show on the History Channel, Join or Die with Craig Ferguson. With some stand-up (including working with Netflix), some acting and some writing here and there, Ferguson brings in $8.5 million a year.\n\n06 of 13 Jimmy Fallon: $25 Million Theo Wargo/Getty Images for NBC Tonight Show host Jimmy Fallon is quickly becoming one of late night's greatest talk show hosts. And even though his popularity is surging as host of NBC's iconic late-night program, Jimmy is still in the back of the net worth pack. Still, he makes a leap from $16 million to $25 million since our last update. And his $5 million salary for Late Night has more than doubled to $11 million.\n\n07 of 13 Carson Daly: $15 Million Ray Tamarra/Getty Images Former MTV veejay and one of the more creative talk show hosts on late night, Carson Daly hugs the middle of the list with a $15 million net worth and a $40,000 an episode contract. Daly's net worth is sure to grow, as well. Besides his late-night program, Daly hosts the popular show The Voice and produces NBC's annual New Year's Eve special. He also dabbles in acting and producing.\n\n08 of 13 Seth Meyers: $10 Million Stephen Lovekin/Getty Images Late Night host Seth Meyers enters the list with a net worth of $10 million. As the former SNL host becomes more popular with late night viewers, you can expect that net worth to rise.\n\n09 of 13 James Corden: $10 Million GP Images/Getty Images Host James Corden is making waves in late night as the host everyone was nervous about, but now everyone loves. His Carpool Karaoke segments are an Internet sensation, ensuring new viewers all of the time. His show has a classic BBC flavor and is somewhat fresh and new for U.S. audience. And as an accomplished performer, too, you can expect his net worth to climb as well.\n\n10 of 13 Chris Hardwick: $10 Million Tim Mosenfelder / Getty Images It's the after-show that everyone watches, and The Talking Dead's host, Chris Hardwick, rounds out our Top 10. Hardwick's net worth clocks in at $10 million, a combination of his AMC talk show as well as a successful comedy game show, of sorts, on Comedy Central, called @midnight.\n\n11 of 13 Bonus Former Host: David Letterman: $400 Million Theo Wargo/Getty Images The king of late night, David Letterman, former host of the Late Show with David Letterman, still carries a net worth of $400 million, though his salary has dipped to $20 million a year. Letterman's cash comes from his production company, Worldwide Pants, and real estate investments.\n\n12 of 13 Bonus Former Host: Jay Leno: $350 Million John Lamparski/WireImage/Getty Images Former Tonight Show host Jay Leno has a net worth of $350 million and an annual salary of about $15 million. Leno collects his extra cash through an extensive line-up of stand-up shows across the country and a couple of new TV gigs.", "images":
