Strange said in a prepared statement. \u201cToday\u2019s lengthy sentence is a fitting punishment for his egregious crimes.\u201d\n\nU.S. District Judge G. Murray Snow also ordered Menaged to pay victims more than $33.5 million in restitution.\n\nThe investigation was conducted by the Department of Homeland Security, Homeland Security Investigations and Internal Revenue Service-Criminal Investigation.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\nBuyers beware: Tips from state securities regulator on how to avoid financial scams\n\nPolice: Scottsdale man fakes cancer, takes $30,000 from family, friends\n\nHow to avoid gifting cybercriminals your financial info this season", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/53f7e248e14933ad16e38bc5ce9f0f0be9f29ffa/c=117-0-814-524/local/-/media/2017/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/636441169922868674-menaged.jpg?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bdc8bed1130aa1172deceb4368a86f2149b2ff60/c=2-0-929-524/local/-/media/2017/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/636441169922868674-menaged.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/bdc8bed1130aa1172deceb4368a86f2149b2ff60/c=2-0-929-524/local/-/media/2017/10/20/Phoenix/Phoenix/636441169922868674-menaged.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brieanna J.
