It will also bring back the Shamrock Shake, its minty seasonal favorite.\n\nThe chain will ship 20 million packets of the spicy, salty sauce to stores, starting next week. It announced the release on a new website that also features a three-part podcast series on the public's obsession with the chicken tender companion.\n\nThe sauce has its own backstory - it was a limited-time promotional tie-in for the movie \"Mulan\" in 1998. The animated series \"Rick and Morty\" features a character who fawns over the condiment, which led to a petition for the Golden Arches to bring it back.\n\nNever one to miss a good promo, McDonald's brought it back for one day last year - but badly underestimated demand, which led to furious crowds that in some places required police intervention.\n\n\"We want to make this right,\" the chain tweeted on Oct. 8, promising to bring the sauce back in greater quantities soon.\n\nTo wash down the spice of Szechuan Sauce, McDonald's has re-released the Shamrock Shake, a minty milkshake that comes back every year around St. Patrick's Day. To promote the release, the company launched an app that lets users find the closest store selling the drink.", "images": ["https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/mcdonalds-adult-happy-meal.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/New_York_On_Dark@3x-5.png?fit=528%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=176&h=40", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/Angrum_Urban_Hawker_V2_1920x1080_2082251843788.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/GettyImages-1289255397.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/water-main-break-nutley.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NYC_aerial-1-1.png?fit=2060%2C847&quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=44&crop=1", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NYPD-generic-NCB-USABELE.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/chinatown-assault-e1664660331987.png?resize=100%2C56&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/stream_1920x1080_2082043459780.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NY_On_Light@3x-3.png?fit=552%2C120&quality=85&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnewyork.com/news/local/mcdonalds-szechuan-sauce-rick-morty-riots-shamrock-shake/1810279/", "title": "McDonald's Bringing Back Szechuan Sauce, Which Was So Popular It Caused Riots", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.8.5", "og": {"site_name": "NBC New York", "type": "article", "description": "McDonald\u2019s said Thursday it will bring back Szechuan Sauce, the dipping sauce that caused riots over its one-day availability last October.
