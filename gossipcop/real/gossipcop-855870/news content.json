In fact, the A-lister brought his notable sass to the Cannes Film Festival where he addressed an audience alongside longtime songwriting partner, Bernie Taupin.\n\nRelated: Elton & Countless Others Pay Tribute To Chris Cornell!\n\nDuring his first public appearance since recovering from his health problems, the Grammy winner talked about the music that came after his rise to fame \u2014 and let\u2019s just say he didn\u2019t have the nicest things to say. Specifically, the hitmaker noted:\n\n\u201cWe were before the MTV generation and I\u2019m glad we were because we were real artists\u2026 The MTV generation brought along a lot of people who were great but a lot of people who just made videos. So a lot of the artistry went out of the music.\u201d\n\nOuch. Although Elton didn\u2019t name any artists in particular, it\u2019s clear there are many people the 70-year-old disapproves of. We mean, we feel like we can guess ONE particular performer Mr. John doesn\u2019t respect musically *cough* Madonna *cough*. Yes, okay. Elton and the Material Girl supposedly settled their beef \u2014 but we have a feeling it could reignite at any time.\n\nLOLz! Nonetheless, the iconic songwriter doesn\u2019t hate everything about the rise of music videos. He added:\n\n\u201cVisuals\u251c\u00f3\u0393\u00e9\u00bc\u0393\u00c7\u00a5whether it is a painting, a drawing, a piece of film, a video\u251c\u00f3\u0393\u00e9\u00bc\u0393\u00c7\u00a5enhance music. You get to use your imagination; you get into it.\u201d\n\nWell, we\u2019re glad Elton doesn\u2019t hate music videos as he was at Cannes in order to speak on behalf of his YouTube competition where fans were asked to create music videos for hits like Rocket Man, Tiny Dancer, and Bennie and the Jets.\n\nWhat do YOU think?? Was Elton unnecessarily harsh to the \u201cMTV generation\u201d??\n\nSOUND OFF in the comments (below)!\n\n[Image via FayesVision/WENN.]", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%2099999%2099999%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/elton-john-shades-mtv-generation.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20150%20150%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20300%2049%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20430%20316%22%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns=%22http://www.w3.org/2000/svg%22%20viewBox=%220%200%20860%20505%22%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://perezhilton.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/elton-john-shades-mtv-generation.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://perezhilton.com/elton-john-throws-shade-at-mtv-generation-cannes-film-festival/", "title": "Elton John Has Some SERIOUSLY Shady Things To Say About The 'MTV Generation'...", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "fb": {"pages": 1028334267217239}, "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Elton John Has Some SERIOUSLY Shady Things To Say About The 'MTV Generation'... - Perez Hilton", "description": "So shady.
