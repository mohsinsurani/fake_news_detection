Perry hinted on social media that the show may be returning, and now it\u2019s officially been confirmed. The show will return in 2018.\n\nAccording to Deadline, OWN has given a 38-episode order for a new comedy series from Perry, The Paynes, a spinoff of his popular TBS sitcom House of Payne starring the original series\u2019 LaVan Davis and Cassi Davis. This is the second spinoff from the show following Meet the Browns, which also aired on TBS.\n\nHouse of Payne ran for 254 episodes before going off the air. Perry has created more hit television series, but fans have been longing for the Paynes to return. The spinoff will follow Curtis and Ella Payne trying to enjoy their retirement in Florida only to get roped into a real estate deal that will tumble their lives like clothes in a dryer. The series will reportedly star Emmy winner Jack\u00e9e Harry, Stephanie Charles, Markice Moore, JD McCrary and Sanai Victoria.\n\nIt also appears that members from the original cast will be returning for the spinoff in some capacity. Lance Gross and Tyler Perry both shared pictures of the former cast on set.\n\nThis is going to be epic! Who\u2019s excited for The Paynes?\n\nShare Your Thoughts", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946im_/https://thetoptea.com/wp-content/uploads/the-house-of-payne-20x11.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946im_/https://thetoptea.com/wp-content/uploads/tylerperryshouseofpaynecast5-200x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946im_/https://thetoptea.com/wp-content/uploads/The-Top-Tea-Logo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946im_/https://thetoptea.com/wp-content/uploads/Tyler-Perry-Racquel-Bailey-20x11.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3ae9196ef15659046011be677024812f?s=164&d=blank&r=pg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946im_/https://thetoptea.com/wp-content/uploads/MoNique-Tyler-Perry-20x11.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946im_/https://thetoptea.com/wp-content/uploads/tylerperryshouseofpaynecast5-200x200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryant Smith", "Bryant Lydell"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200815141946/https://thetoptea.com/house-of-payne/", "title": "Tyler Perry\u2019s House Of Payne Is Coming Back to TV in 2018", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://thetoptea.com/wp-content/uploads/cropped-The-Top-Tea-New-Logo-copy-2-270x270.png", "og": {"title": "Tyler Perry's House Of Payne Is Coming Back to TV in 2018", "description": "Tyler Perry's breakout television series House of Payne is returning to TV.
