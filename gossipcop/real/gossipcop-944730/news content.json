It\u2019s better than that,\u201d Davidson wrote alongside a black and white photo of Grande sitting in his lap as he lovingly placed his hands over hers.\n\nHours earlier, she shared a similarly sweet post on Twitter, writing, \u201cI cant believe my life rn tbh.

They both started talking about it this past weekend. It\u2019s nothing they\u2019ve been hiding.\u201d\n\nGrande, who has been wearing a $93,000 pear-shaped diamond on her left ring finger, appeared to have confirmed the news herself on social media, tweeting, \u201cI love u sm hi & thank u I love u bye,\u201d and even responding to fans who called her \u201cMrs. Davidson.\u201d\n\nThe couple began dating in May, shortly after Grande\u2019s breakup from rapper ex Mac Miller.\n\nDavidson also confirmed in mid-May that he had split from his longtime girlfriend Cazzie David, around the same time he wrapped his fourth season performing on SNL.\n\n\u201cEveryone around them is super supportive and happy that they\u2019ve found love,\u201d a source told PEOPLE of the newly engaged duo.", "images":
