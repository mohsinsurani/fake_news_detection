Now now, the Goop founder is celebrating her upcoming nuptials south of the border with her best (and famous) gal pals.\n\nAccording to Page Six, Cameron Diaz orchestrated the event, chartering a private jet for 12 friends to fly down to Mexico for the party celebrating Paltrow.\n\nInside sources told the publication that guests will definitely include a few famous faces, like Diaz and fashion designer Stella McCartney. Paltrow's close friends include Drew Barrymore, Reese Witherspoon and (pregnant) Kate Hudson, but it's unconfirmed whether they're in attendance.\n\nThe group has an exciting weekend ahead. \"They will be spending three days in Cabo before heading back to LA,\" a source told E! News. \"They plan to spend their days at the beach and the spa. They also will go off site for dinner.\"\n\nThe 45-year-old actress touched down on Wednesday in vacation-ready style, wearing a chic and comfy floral jumpsuit, accessorized with a structured white-and-black C\u00e9line Phantom luggage bag and large-frame cat-eye sunglasses.\n\n\n\nSplash News\n\nEarlier this year, Paltrow admitted that planning her wedding with Falchuk has made her \"feel like a 21-year-old\" again.\n\n\n\n\u201cI\u2019m excited about everything!\u201d Paltrow told People following her engagement announcement. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a wedding before. [Paltrow and ex-husband, Coldplay's Chris Martin, eloped in 2003.] So even though I\u2019m 45, I sort of feel like a 21-year-old.\u201d\n\nSplash News\n\nThe star and wellness entrepreneur also disclosed that all of her girlfriends are adorably invested in her wedding journey.\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of fun to talk about with my girlfriends,\u201d said Paltrow. \u201cThey send me pictures of dresses\u2014they\u2019re as excited about it as I am. It\u2019s pretty cute.\u201d\n\nWith a healthy amount of FOMO, we're sending well-wishes to Gwyneth and the girls celebrating in Mexico this weekend!", "images":
