I didn\u2019t know if you\u2019d heard of her, but she\u2019s a friend of mine.\u201d\n\nDeGeneres then pointed to the music video\u2019s success (it\u2019s been viewed more than 425 million times since it premiered during the MTV VMAs late last month), but noted that it \u201ccould have been better.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was in the original, because I\u2019m part of her squad,\u201d the comedian explained. \u201cApparently, she cut me out \u2026 I don\u2019t know.
