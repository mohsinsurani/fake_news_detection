Jack rarely spoke of the bespectacled Nicky, who was first seen as a young boy in the season 2 episode \u201cBrothers,\u201d and later when Jack looked a photo of himself with Nicky in Vietnam. Jack told his sons in the season 2 episode \u201cThe Car\u201d that Nicky died in the war.\n\nSeason 3 will delve into Jack\u2019s time in Vietnam, which opens the door for plenty of interaction between the brothers. The season 2 finale featured a flash-forward scene in which Kevin (Justin Hartley) was headed to Vietnam to find out more about his late father\u2019s time overseas. Hartley told EW that the revelations are \u201csuper-heartbreaking\u201d and \u201cshocking.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not what anyone is expecting,\u201d he said. \u201cNo one is going to see it coming.\u201d Ventimiglia said his first reaction to learning what was in store for Jack was: \u201cHoly s\u2014, holy s\u2014!\u201d\n\nAngarano\u2019s other TV credits include 24, The Knick, and Mom.\n\nDeadline Hollywood first reported the news of Angarano\u2019s casting, which was also announced on Monday night at a For Your Emmy Consideration panel in Los Angeles.\n\nThis Is Us kicks off season 3 on Sept. 25.\n\nFor more scoop on This Is Us from creator Dan Fogelman about the season 2 finale flash-forward cliffhanger, head over here.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/2332_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/this-is-us.jpg?w=2000", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/602b73f362605bc89706a277f90e2fb1?s=300&d=blank&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740im_/https://ew.com/img/sign-up-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/article-covers/2332_106821743_2017_04_07_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/this-is-us.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740im_/https://ewedit.files.wordpress.com/2018/08/this-is-us.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2700px%2C1417.5px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Snierson"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740/https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/13/this-is-us-jack-brother-michael-angarano/", "title": "This Is Us casts Will & Grace actor as Jack's brother", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Michael Angarano,This Is Us", "news_keywords": "Michael Angarano,This Is Us", "description": "'I'm Dying Up Here' star Michael Angarano will guest-star in multiple episodes during season 3.", "og": {"title": "'This Is Us' casts 'Will & Grace' actor as Jack's brother", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180814054740/https://ew.com/tv/2018/08/13/this-is-us-jack-brother-michael-angarano/", "description": "Jack's son is now Jack's brother.
