Plump Up With Moisturizer With age, skin becomes drier, making wrinkles stand out more. Bring that moisture back to fight the fine lines. Look for a moisturizer with hyaluronic acid, which pulls in water and plumps the skin, says Joshua Zeichner, MD. He is director of cosmetic and clinical research in dermatology at the Mount Sinai Medical Center in New York.\n\n2. Use Retinoids Retinoids spur your skin to make more collagen, which combats wrinkles. You can buy products made with retinol over the counter, or get prescription-strength retinoids through your doctor. Both \"have been well-studied for wrinkles, and work,\" Zeichner says. Use them as directed, and be patient. Most products take anywhere from 6 weeks to 3 months to work. Wear sunscreen, too. Retinoids can make your skin more sensitive to the sun. Wearing sunscreen every day can also help you prevent future wrinkles.\n\n3. Don't Overdo Anti-Aging Creams Take it easy. Try only one or two anti-aging products at a time.\n\nUsing too many tends to irritate the skin, which can make signs of aging more visible. It's best to start with one product and add another product after a month or so. Look for ingredients like vitamin C or descriptions including \"peptide technology\" or \"growth factor technology.\"\n\n4. Makeup: Start With a Silicone Primer After you moisturize, smooth on a primer before you put on your foundation. \"Applying primer as a makeup base is the key to softening wrinkles,\" says Jaclyn Peresetsky, a makeup artist and co-owner of Skin Perfect Clinic in Ohio. Choose one with a silicone base, which fills in uneven skin texture and fine lines.", "images": ["https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/woman_experiencing_chest_discomfort_other/1800x1200_woman_experiencing_chest_discomfort_other.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/vaccine_covid19_other/1800x1200_vaccine_7_other.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/slideshows/surprises_about_dogs_and_cats_slideshow/1800x1200_surprises_about_dogs_and_cats_slideshow.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/features/_2016/10_2016/diabetes_grocery_shopping_features/110x70_diabetes_grocery_shopping_features.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd_logo.svg", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/vitamins_alt11_other/110x70_vitamins_alt11_other.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/centerpieces/memory_loss_centerpiece/1800x1200_memory_loss_centerpiece_header.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://privacy-policy.truste.com/privacy-seal/seal?rid=07326333-3522-463d-81bf-f00fd7171fff", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/guide_raynauds_phenomenon_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_typing.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/pregnancy_snacks_slideshow/thinkstock_rf_apple_slices_and_peanut_butter.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://www.honcode.ch/HONcode/Seal/HONConduct298987_s1.gif", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/sitefronts/branding/radiance/radiance_logo.svg", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/rich_media_quiz/topic/rmq_benefits_of_walking/405rmq_thinkstock_woman_walking_sneakers.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/headache_types_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_migraine.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://sb/p?c1=2&c2=6035829&cv=3.6&cj=1", "https://choices.trustarc.com/get?name=admarker2.png", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/layout/shared/tag-registered.png?resize=*:60px"], "top_img": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd-logo-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/hide-wrinkles", "title": "Hiding Wrinkles: 8 Concealing Solutions", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Minimize wrinkles and lines without needles or surgeries.
