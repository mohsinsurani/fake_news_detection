It was something I wrote a year ago, and somebody didn\u2019t get a job coming to L.A., and they got pissed.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Steve Harvey Not Sorry for Staff Memo: 'I Just Didn't Want to Be in This Prison Anymore'\n\n\u201cI was OK until I saw it on CNN, and that\u2019s when I knew I was in a lot of trouble,\u201d the \u201cFamily Feud\u201d host continued. \u201cThe email was out there \u2014 it wasn\u2019t that big a deal to me. I\u2019m not really a mean-spirited guy at all \u2014 I\u2019m really a congenial guy.\u201d\n\nHe likened his sentiment to when \u201cyou go home every day, and all your kids is in the kitchen waiting on you \u2014 you just need a moment.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Steve Harvey to Flint Man: 'Enjoy Your Nice Brown Glass of Water'\n\n\u201cI thought it was cute \u2014 you all didn\u2019t,\u201d he added to reporters.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png",
