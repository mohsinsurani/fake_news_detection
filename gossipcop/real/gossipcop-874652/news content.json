I'd be doing the project an injustice to take this. I know what I can do, I know what I can't do. Plus, I'm having too much fun laying on the couch.\"\n\nIn 2012, the Modern Family cast sued 20th Century Fox in a salary dispute, but before then, the show's Jesse Tyler Ferguson called Matt for negotiating advice as the Friends cast had previously joined forces to negotiate their own higher pay deal.\n\nAnd Matt recalls telling the actor: \"You have to walk out, or they won't take you seriously. If you stick together, you have power.\"\n\nHowever, on the day the cast refused to show up for work as part of their dispute, Matt couldn't resist playing a text message prank on Jesse, who plays Mitchell Pritchett.\n\nThe Top Gear host admitted: \"I said, 'Hey, I killed it as Mitch today at the table read, thanks for the opportunity!'\"", "images": ["https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/loading.gif", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_175,q_70,w_280/ao17t5btlio70ea37mov", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/ewn-logo.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/dd8dxnjrs2slzr3i4eej", "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/iqhvwnhkhso7krfatta2", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/ewn-logo-sticky.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/qqargwm8ykfkin9c9wgo", "https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/ael2dmv9unm5ic852drl", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/v1538138159/rjmmxcnwfcznechkzz9p.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/wqkje8icy4nzwyf6klhq", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/android.jpg", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_436,w_700/iqhvwnhkhso7krfatta2", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/anvgdve5spryhhigjndy", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/racanyhlgp6lbskyylts", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/apple.jpg"], "top_img": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/iqhvwnhkhso7krfatta2", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bang Showbiz"], "canonical_link": "https://ewn.co.za/2017/08/21/matt-leblanc-turned-down-modern-family-role", "title": "Matt LeBlanc turned down 'Modern Family' role", "meta_data": {"shorturl": "https://ewn.co.za/rmebh", "description": "The 50-year-old actor revealed he was offered the part of real estate broker Phil Dunphy but didn't think he was the right person for the role, and was also enjoying time out.", "keywords": "Matt LeBlanc, Modern Family, Lifestyle", "news_keywords": "Matt LeBlanc, Modern Family, Lifestyle", "author": "BANG Showbiz", "ContentItemType": "Article", "articleid": 269228, "disqusidentifier": 0, "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/iqhvwnhkhso7krfatta2", "secure_url": "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/iqhvwnhkhso7krfatta2", "width": 700, "height": 437}, "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2017/08/21/matt-leblanc-turned-down-modern-family-role", "title": "Matt LeBlanc turned down 'Modern Family' role", "description": "The 50-year-old actor revealed he was offered the part of real estate broker Phil Dunphy but didn't think he was the right person for the role, and was also enjoying time out."}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/iqhvwnhkhso7krfatta2", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ewnreporter", "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2017/08/21/matt-leblanc-turned-down-modern-family-role", "site": "@ewnreporter", "title": "Matt LeBlanc turned down 'Modern Family' role", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Eyewitness News", "ipad": "Eyewitness News", "googleplay": "Eyewitness News"}, "id": {"iphone": 636459947, "ipad": 636459947, "googleplay": "com.eyewitnessnews"}}}, "fb": {"app_id": 259652954116494, "pages": 168892509821961}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=636459947", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.eyewitnessnews", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "p": {"domain_verify": "3acf0ffe30e8e741add34eeb0aa173dd"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503270000.0, "source": "https://ewn.co.za", "summary": ""}
