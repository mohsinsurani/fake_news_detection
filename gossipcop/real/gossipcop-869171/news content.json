Meanwhile, stars Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson have signed a first-look television deal with Comedy Central parent company Viacom, with three projects already in development for their soon-to-be former network. The first-look pact covers Glazer and Jacobson together as well as individually.\n\n\u201cBroad City has been our baby and first love for almost 10 years, since we started as a web series. It\u2019s been a phenomenal experience, and we\u2019ve put ourselves into it completely. Broad City\u2019s always had a spontaneous pace and feeling, and ending after season five honors that spirit. We are very excited to bring new voices and points of view to Comedy Central and continue our collaboration together in new ways,\u201d Glazer and Jacobson said Thursday in a joint statement.\n\nWhile none of the three comedies in development are written by or starring either Glazer or Jacobson, Comedy Central president Kent Alterman tells The Hollywood Reporter he\u2019s \u201ctaking it as it comes\u201d from the in-demand duo, who now both have film careers and are juggling other projects.\n\nIn development at the cable network are:\n\n\u2022 Mall Town USA, an animated comedy about a 13-year-old girl navigating puberty and society in American culture at the mall. The project is written and created by Gabe Liedman (Broad City), with Jacobson and Glazer executive producing.\n\n\u2022 Platinum Status, a live-action comedy written by Ilana Glazer\u2019s brother, Eliot Glazer. He stars as a gay man who hooks up with a woman after his boyfriend of 10 years dumps him. Eliot Glazer will write the script and exec produce alongside Ilana Glazer, Principato Young\u2019s Peter Principato and Brian Steinberg and Electric Avenue\u2019s Will Arnett and Marc Forman.\n\n\u2022 Young Professionals hails from David Litt, who at 24 became one of the youngest White House speechwriters in history. The comedy is inspired by Litt\u2019s coming of age in the nation\u2019s capital and follows five housemates growing up \u2014 personally, politically and professionally \u2014 in Washington. Litt will pen the script and exec produce alongside Jacobson and Glazer.\n\nIn a larger sense, UTA-repped Glazer and Jacobson\u2019s deal will allow them to develop projects across Viacom\u2019s television portfolio. Unlike similar Viacom pacts with Trevor Noah and Tyler Perry, it is not exclusive and does not include film. Still, the deal sends a message to the town that Comedy Central is willing to do its part to keep homegrown talent as more of its stars have moved on elsewhere.\n\nBelow, Alterman talks with The Hollywood Reporter about the decision to end the award-winning show, what to expect from the deal and the future of another tentpole series, Inside Amy Schumer.\n\nWhy end Broad City now?\n\nIt\u2019s more of a creative thing than anything. It\u2019s a show about two twenty-somethings in New York, and Abbi and Ilana are smart about not wanting to overstretch it beyond plausibility. They\u2019re telling a particular story about the post-college era in New York. It\u2019s an organic conclusion to the journey that they\u2019ve been on.\n\nWhose decision was it?\n\nUltimately it was their decision \u2014 where they want to resolve the characters\u2019 stories. We\u2019d never want them to overstay their welcome. It was really driven by creative storytelling and when is a natural life [of the show over]? We\u2019re thrilled with five seasons of a show like this. The last thing we\u2019d want is them to pretend they\u2019re younger than they are and contrive and force it. The thing that matters to us more than anything is the creative integrity of the storytelling.\n\nThe final season isn\u2019t returning until 2019, at which point it will have been off for more than a year. What\u2019s behind the delay?\n\nThere\u2019s no real delay. We\u2019ve had other breaks with Broad City as well. One thing we did last year that was effective was we had a writing period and then they went off and did other things and came back to have a mini punch-up writing season that really helped. They\u2019ll be doing the same thing this time. It\u2019s about how it lines up with their schedules and not wanting to shoot in the winter. It\u2019s just the way it naturally unfolded.\n\nYou\u2019re signing Glazer and Jacobson to a larger first-look deal across all of Viacom in pacts similar to those with Tyler Perry and Trevor Noah.\n\nThis is more of a traditional first-look deal, and we already have three projects in development as part of it.\n\nNone of the three shows they\u2019re developing for Comedy Central are either written by or star the duo. Is the expectation that they\u2019ll return to TV and topline a show of their own again at some point?\n\nI don\u2019t want to speak for them. They\u2019re unwinding a 10-year intense, deep dive into this show and these characters [counting the web series]. The first stuff coming at us is stuff that they\u2019re bringing from people they\u2019ve collaborated with and new ideas. We\u2019re taking it as it comes. We haven\u2019t even discussed that. But if they had something they wanted to do on-camera, we wouldn\u2019t refuse it. But it has to come organically.\n\nYou\u2019re leveraging the entire Viacom portfolio here. What kind of conversations have you or CEO Bob Bakish had with Glazer and Jacobson to do something broader for other Viacom networks?\n\nI haven\u2019t had that conversation with Bob. I don\u2019t want to put the cart before the horse. To me, it\u2019s like, what are the things that they naturally gravitate toward? When do they make sense for us or other Viacom brands? That\u2019s how we\u2019ll move forward.\n\nAs Netflix continues to poach prolific producers and talent, what\u2019s the sell to Glazer and Jacobson to stay within the Viacom fold?\n\nWe\u2019ve had a great collaboration with them and everyone is excited to continue.\n\nAs they came to you to end the show, what was the larger Viacom pitch to get them to stay? Ryan Murphy loved his time at 20th Century Fox but still signed with Netflix.\n\nIt was more of an organic, mutual conversation. There were no ulterior motives or coercion or anything like that. Like I said, we\u2019ve had this great collaboration and everyone has been motivated to continue it and find whatever ways that make sense for stuff to come down the pike. We\u2019re excited for more from them.\n\nAbbi Jacobson is co-writing and exec producing Amazon\u2019s A League of Their Own. Both have busy film careers. What level of exclusivity will you have here?\n\nIt\u2019s not exclusive. It\u2019s first-look.\n\nDoes that include film?\n\nThere is no specific film component. But if they come to us with ideas that make sense, we\u2019ll do it.\n\nHow much of this deal is a message to the town that you\u2019re going to fight and try to keep more of your homegrown talent after, most recently, losing The Daily Show\u2018s Hasan Minhaj and Michelle Wolf to Netflix?\n\nWe\u2019re definitely interested in continuing good, creative collaborations with the people that we\u2019re in business with. We\u2019re still bummed that Jon Stewart only gave us 16-plus years. But everyone has their path and we wish Hasan and Michelle well and continued success. With Hasan, we are continuing [our relationship] with him: We\u2019re doing a special with his sketch group and hopefully we\u2019ll have ongoing collaboration with him. Ultimately, we want to continue with people where it makes sense.\n\nHave you had any talks with Glazer and Jacobson about doing any sort of Broad City spinoff or movie to see where they are as they get into their 30s?\n\nWe\u2019re really driven by the creative integrity of the storytelling. The last thing we\u2019d do is start to contrive something for them. We\u2019ll take it as it comes.\n\nAs you look to the end of one of your tentpole shows, what\u2019s the latest on the previously announced fifth season of Inside Amy Schumer?\n\nWe\u2019re in the same situation we\u2019ve always been in: We\u2019re here if and when she wants to use that format for more storytelling.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thr_iiana_glazer__abbi_jacobson_thr_david_needleman_b_133-h_2016_copy.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thr_iiana_glazer__abbi_jacobson_thr_david_needleman_b_133-h_2016_copy.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thr_iiana_glazer__abbi_jacobson_thr_david_needleman_b_133-h_2016_copy.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/broad-city-end-season-5-as-ilana-glazer-abbi-jacobson-ink-viacom-pact-1102010/", "title": "\u2018Broad City\u2019 to End With Season 5 as Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson Ink Viacom Pact", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The previously announced fifth season will return in early 2019 as its stars have already put three projects in development at Comedy Central under their new first-look deal.", "news_keywords": "Broad City, Comedy Central", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1102010, "title": "'Broad City' to End With Season 5 as Ilana Glazer and Abbi Jacobson Ink Viacom Pact", "published_at": "2018-04-12 11:00:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/thr_iiana_glazer__abbi_jacobson_thr_david_needleman_b_133-h_2016_copy.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Comedy Central", "topics": "TV News", "body": "The end of Broad City is in sight.\r\nThe previously announced fifth season of the Comedy Central critical favorite \u2014 set to air in early 2019, more than a year after its fourth cycle ended \u2014 will be its last.
