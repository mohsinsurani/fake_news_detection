But now, over a decade after the show has ended, the former co-stars appear to be in a good place.\n\nHilton, 37, and Richie, 36, were photographed happily chatting at The Daily Front Row Fashion Awards in L.A. on Sunday, giving fans hope that a reboot of The Simple Life isn\u2019t totally out of the question.\n\nStefanie Keenan/Getty\n\nHilton, who showed off her gigantic 20-carat, $2 million engagement ring, went for full-on glam wearing a black, plunging Philipp Plein belted gown featuring a high slit, paired with jeweled pumps, while Richie opted for a natural makeup look and donned a pink floral dress featuring beautiful beading along with Jimmy Choo accessories.\n\nDavid Crotty/Patrick McMullan/Getty\n\nLooking for more style content?

Please please please please please please do a reboot @ParisHilton @nicolerichie.\u201d\n\nWhile the duo appears to be on good terms now, that wasn\u2019t always the case for The Simple Life co-stars.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: See Paris Hilton\u2019s $2 Million Engagement Ring from Every Angle\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Nicole Richie\u2019s Advice to Pregnant Women: \u201cDon\u2019t Let Everyone Touch Your Stomach\u201d\n\nThe best friends from childhood experienced an infamous falling out in 2005 when Hilton and Richie said they would never be friends again. \u201cIt\u2019s no big secret that Nicole and I are no longer friends,\u201d Hilton told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cNicole knows what she did, and that\u2019s all I\u2019m ever going to say about it.\u201d\n\nRay Mickshaw/WireImage\n\nWhen Richie was asked about the fight a few months later, she simply said, \u201cWe just grew apart.\u201d\n\nPhoto by 20th Century Fox Television/Kobal/REX/Shutterstock\n\nHowever, just one year later they were spotted enjoying dinner together in L.A. and have been working on repairing their friendship ever since. Although the former reality stars haven\u2019t been spotted out together publicly, Hilton\u2019s made an effort to wish Richie a Happy Birthday on Instagram the past few years.\n\nTodd Williamson/WireImage\n\n\u201cHappy Birthday @NicoleRichie \ud83c\udf88\ud83c\udf82\ud83c\udf88Looking thru all these photos brings back so many special & amazing memories! \u2764,\u201d Hilton wrote in a caption on Instagram for Richie\u2019s 36th birthday last fall. \u201cJust wanted to let you know that I am so happy for & proud of you.
