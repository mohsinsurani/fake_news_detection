The writing is now on the wall, as the two are said to be dividing up their treasure trove of assets.\n\nBroadimage/Shutterstock\n\n\"I never actually thought this argument would be the end of them, but it looks like it is,\" a source close to the duo told the New York Post's gossip section. \"I don't think there will be any coming back now. They both have lawyers and are looking at what a split will entail, who gets what and what the finances will be.\"\n\nA People magazine source said there's \"tension\" between the two and adds that Tom is \"trying to figure out what to do.\"\n\nThe supermodel and NFL stud share two children, Benjamin, 12, and Vivian, 9. Tom also shares 15-year-old son Jack with ex Bridget Moynahan.\n\nAlthough issues have seemingly been piling up for a while, rumors of a rift between the couple began after Tom un-retired from football, something that sources said irked Gisele. Their issues have gotten so bad that they two didn't hunker down together for Hurricane Ian despite being in the same city. The former Victoria's Secret model was also once a consistent presence at Tom's football games, but she's yet to watch the Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback play in person this season.\n\nShould they officially split, Gisele and Tom will have to divide a reported $26 million property portfolio, which includes homes in Florida, New York, Montana and Costa Rica.\n\nStephen Lovekin/BEI/Shutterstock\n\nAlthough the two have remained publicly mum about the state of their marriage, Gisele recently expressed concern over Tom's career and plainly stated that she wants her husband to be more of a family man.\n\n\"This is a very violent sport, and I have my children and I would like him to be more present,\" she told Elle. \"I have definitely had those conversations with him over and over again. But ultimately, I feel that everybody has to make a decision that works for [them]. He needs to follow his joy, too.\"\n\nInvision/AP/REX/Shutterstock\n\nIn that same interview, she said she has her own goals, almost implying that Tom's career is keeping her from fulfilling those desires.\n\n\"I feel very fulfilled in that way, as a mother and as a wife,\" she said. \"And now it's going to be my turn. It's not like I'm going to be in the valley forever.\"\n\nPage Six's source said, \"As with many marriages, it's not just one thing. Gisele has made it clear that she worried about Tom playing football and that they had had many talks about it. But they have had a series of blowups over the past few years, and this time it looks like there's no going back.\"\n\nThe People magazine source wasn't quite willing to put a fork in the marriage just yet.\n\n\"She was so happy when he announced his retirement, and she wasn't thrilled at all when he went back on that,\" the source said. \"They're hitting a rough patch, but I know they're trying, or at least he's trying, to figure it out and make it work. He wants to get through this and for things to get better.\"", "images": ["https://www.wonderwall.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/12/shutterstock_editorial_12642049bk.jpg?h=1000",
