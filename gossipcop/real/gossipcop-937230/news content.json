Though it was a royal affair, the bride and groom were adamant about adding personal touches throughout the wedding ceremony and during both of their receptions. Not only did the royal couple allow viewers across the globe to witness their nuptials, they also invited British citizens, their personal guests, celebrities, and everyone in between to bear witness to their love.\n\nDespite their openness, the couple did keep some things to themselves. Their evening reception was a private affair for their 200 hundred closest friends and family members. And with no cameras or phones allowed in the venue, we had to hear what the celebration was like through the grapevine.\n\nHowever, one royal insider did reveal that Markle wrote a breathtaking poem for her new husband and there wasn\u2019t a dry eye in the entire house when she read it. The Duchess of Sussex also praised this very important person in her speech (page 5).\n\nA perfect evening at Frogmore House\n\nEven royals love to play beer pong\n\nThough we\u2019ll probably never see any photos or video, Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s intimate wedding reception at Frogmore House and Gardens was a fairytale. Hosted by Prince Charles, the reception was housed in a glass marquee on the grounds and had everything from cotton candy and burgers, to beer pong and a dance floor.\n\nIt was said to have been the perfect blend of the duke and duchess\u2019 personalities.\n\nNext: Meghan Markle is determined to do her own thing.\n\nBreaking protocol\n\nTheir celebration was modern and inclusive\n\nIt\u2019s been evident since their engagement that Markle has no interest in being a traditional royal. The mix-raced, former actress is determined to forge her own unique path into the British royal family. It was clear from her wedding day that she was more than ready to do just that.\n\nThe Duchess of Sussex asked Bishop Michael Curry, the first African American leader of the Episcopal Church, to speak at her wedding. The bishop gave a rousing 14-minute long sermon on the power of love.\n\nMarkle also chose to speak at her wedding reception, something that is traditionally underheard of when it comes to British weddings and royal weddings in particular. However, she was determined to make her wedding an inclusive and modern celebration.\n\nNext: Here\u2019s what the beautiful bride had to say.\n\nAn unexpected speech\n\nThis may have been the most special part of the day\n\nThough the media speculated that Markle would speak at her wedding reception, guests at the Frogmore House were stunned when the newly minted duchess got to her feet to address the crowd. The speech went beyond the normal thanks and appreciation for her loved ones.\n\nA royal wedding guest told The Sun, \u201cMeghan totally stole the show. It was the most special part of the entire day and the most unexpected.\u201d\n\nNext: The perfect way to enter into a family.\n\nThanking her in-laws\n\nShe has received a warm welcome from the royals\n\nMarkle\u2019s entry into the royal family has been warm and welcoming, an almost unprecedented tone for the stuffy and traditional monarch. Prince Harry\u2019s family has been keen to welcome Markle into the fold, despite her biracial heritage, previous marriage, Hollywood career, and American citizenship. It seems that everyone remembered how unhappy Princess Diana was during her marriage to Prince Charles, and no one wants to repeat that.\n\nDuring her wedding speech, the Duchess of Sussex graciously thanked her in-laws, including Prince Charles who walked her down the aisle. A source informed Us Weekly, \u201cMeghan also gave a shout-out to her groom\u2019s father, Prince Charles, and stepmother, Duchess Camilla, for being amazing hosts and welcoming her and her mother into the family.\u201d\n\nNext: Meghan Markle\u2019s No. 1 champion\n\nPraise for her mother\n\nThe two have an unbreakable bond\n\nThroughout her entire journey to get to the altar, through her father\u2019s health scares, and her half-siblings ire towards her, Markle\u2019s mother, Doria Ragland, has been her rock. From the moment we caught glimpses of Markle and Ragland in the car coming towards St. George\u2019s Chapel, we could tell that the bond between this mother/daughter duo was unbreakable.\n\nThe duchess, of course, took time during her speech to thank her mother for everything she\u2019s done. A source told US Weekly, \u201cShe said, \u201cYou have always been there for me through everything.\u201d\n\nMarkle never mentioned her father, Thomas Markle, in her speech.\n\nNext: The moment that moved everyone to tears\n\nA poem for Harry\n\nTrue love is worth the wait\n\nMarkle put her acting, writing, and speaking skills to work for the portion of the speech that was about Prince Harry, whom she calls, \u201cThe One.\u201d An insider told The Sun, that the poem was epic.\n\nThey revealed, \u201cShe spoke about their first date and falling in love at first sight. Meghan said she knew she had met her prince from the off and how blessed and lucky she feels to have found such a profound love.\u201d\n\nMarkle also reportedly said finding love was worth the wait. Everyone in the crowd was moved, including Prince Harry who had to wipe away a tear.\n\nNext: Prince Harry\u2019s sweet words\n\nA smitten pair\n\nThe couple makes the perfect team\n\nMarkle wasn\u2019t the only one to make a speech. Her new husband, Prince Harry, also had some stunning words to say about his beautiful bride. During his BBC interview just after their engagement, Prince Harry revealed that he was smitten with Markle after their first date. He went even further about his feelings for her during the couple\u2019s lunchtime wedding reception.\n\nA source told Us Weekly that he said, \u201cMeghan has handled things with grace and dignity. [He said] that he can\u2019t wait for them to be a team.\u201d\n\nCheck out the Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-960057722.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-960051980.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-960192816.jpg?w=1200", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-960192816.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/PrinceHarrysuit.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Meghan-Markle-harry-wedding-look.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Meghan-and-her-mother-at-the-wedding.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Meghan-Markle-on-her-wedding-day.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-960192816.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aramide Tinubu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-wrote-a-love-poem-for-prince-harry-and-were-not-crying.html/", "title": "Meghan Markle Wrote A Love Poem For Prince Harry and We\u2019re Not Crying", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Meghan Markle read a beautiful love poem for Prince Harry at their evening wedding reception and honestly, we're in tears.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Wrote A Love Poem For Prince Harry and We\u2019re Not Crying", "description": "Meghan Markle read a beautiful love poem for Prince Harry at their evening wedding reception and honestly, we're in tears.", "url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/meghan-markle-wrote-a-love-poem-for-prince-harry-and-were-not-crying.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/GettyImages-960192816.jpg?w=1200"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "published_time": "2018-06-17T23:00:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-17T23:00:05+00:00"}, "author": "Aramide Tinubu", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@cheatsheet", "site": "@cheatsheet", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Aramide Tinubu", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "6 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529276400.0, "source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com", "summary": ""}
