While serving in the Army, Megan was romantically paired with Owen\u2019s best friend Nathan (Martin Henderson), and after learning he cheated on her, took off in a helicopter. She was presumed dead after the helicopter went missing. The season 13 finale revealed that Owen\u2019s sister is indeed alive.\n\nMegan\u2019s return sets the stage for an awkward love triangle in season 14, as Nathan and Meredith (Ellen Pompeo) finally took a major step forward in their burgeoning relationship.\n\nSpencer\u2019s casting comes as Grey\u2019s Anatomy is poised to further explore Owen\u2019s and Amelia\u2019s (Caterina Scorsone) dynamic, as the married couple spent the bulk of last season separated, as well as Owen\u2019s relationship with Megan.\n\nIn addition to Spencer, former Grey\u2019s Anatomy series regular Kim Raver is set to reprise her role as Dr. Teddy Altman, Owen\u2019s former Army buddy, in season 14.\n\nSpencer\u2019s credits include Rectify, Suits and Mad Men.
