Photo: Astrid Stawiarz/Getty Images for SiriusXM\n\nHilary Duff is the latest female celebrity to shame body-shamers via Instagram.\n\nIn a recent post to her account, the star uploaded a shot of herself holding her son, Luca, on vacation in Hawaii. In the photo, taken by a paparazzi photographer, Duff has her butt to the camera, and is wearing a black-and-white gingham bathing suit.\n\nSimilar photos from her Hawaii trip were posted across the web, but Duff proactively shared one of the less-flattering images.\n\n\u201cI am posting this on behalf of young girls, women, and mothers of all ages,\u201d she writes in the caption. \u201cSince websites and magazines love to share \u2018celeb flaws\u2019 \u2014 well I have them!\u201d\n\nDuff doesn\u2019t say in the post what she sees as her flaws. But she has said she was once \u201cobsessed\u201d with her weight, and too \u201cunhealthy,\u201d and \u201ctoo thin\u201d as a teenager. \u201cThat was not a healthy place for me,\u201d she told People in 2015. \u201cI was so unhappy. I remember my hands cramping because I wasn\u2019t getting enough nutrients.\u201d\n\nBut Duff appears to be feeling much better. In February, she posted a celebration of her legs on Instagram, writing: \u201cI didn\u2019t always love my legs, but as I\u2019ve grown, I\u2019ve learned to love and celebrate myself, just as I am.\u201d In her latest post, she writes: \u201cMy body has given me the greatest gift of my life: Luca, 5 years ago. I\u2019m turning 30 in September and my body is healthy and gets me where I need to go.\u201d\n\nShe also encourages her fans to stop wasting time obsessing over imperfections. She writes in the caption: \u201cLadies, let\u2019s be proud of what we\u2019ve got and stop wasting precious time in the day wishing we were different, better, and unflawed. You guys (you know who you are!) already know how to ruin a good time, and now you are body shamers as well, #kissmyass.\u201d", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f75/d3d/46e2d24cc6c306abd57bb80ef312e9869d-5-Duff.rvertical.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f75/d3d/46e2d24cc6c306abd57bb80ef312e9869d-5-Duff.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f75/d3d/46e2d24cc6c306abd57bb80ef312e9869d-5-Duff.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Van Syckle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/08/hilary-duff-tells-body-shamers-to-kiss-my-ass-on-instagram.html", "title": "Hilary Duff Tells Body-Shamers to \u2018Kiss My Ass\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "hilary duff, body-shaming, trolls, fame, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Hilary Duff Tells Body-Shamers to \u2018Kiss My Ass\u2019", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/08/hilary-duff-tells-body-shamers-to-kiss-my-ass-on-instagram.html", "description": "In an Instagram post showing off her butt.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f75/d3d/46e2d24cc6c306abd57bb80ef312e9869d-5-Duff.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Hilary Duff Tells Body-Shamers to \u2018Kiss My Ass\u2019", "description": "In an Instagram post showing off her butt.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f75/d3d/46e2d24cc6c306abd57bb80ef312e9869d-5-Duff.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katievansyckle", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-05T12:54:39.833-04:00", "tag": "hilary duff, body-shaming, trolls, fame", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/katie.syckle", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "\u201cYounger\u201d star Hilary Duff shows bathing-suit body and cellulite and flaws in Instagram post with son, Luca, and calls on women to be body positive.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "hilary duff, body-shaming, trolls, fame", "author": "Katie Van Syckle", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501952079.833, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
