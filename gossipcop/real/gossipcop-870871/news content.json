Take this one in The Hollywood Reporter, which notes that prior to becoming president of the United States, Donald Trump had signed on to play the president . . . in Sharknado 3: Oh Hell No. Somewhere out there, in a universe we\u2019ll never know, Trump\u2019s political aspirations peaked with a made-for-TV horror series, where he quickly got the POTUS bug out of his system after a few days on a film set where everyone called him \u201cMr. President.\u201d\n\nAlas, talks never materialized into a surefire contract, perhaps because Trump and his team handled the potential deal with their signature competence and finesse.\n\nAccording to David Latt, the co-founder of Sharknado production company The Asylum, Trump said yes to playing the president almost immediately after The Asylum made the offer. \u201cHe was thrilled to be asked,\u201d Latt tells T.H.R.\n\nFunnily enough, Trump wasn\u2019t even the first choice to play the lead politician. Producers initially had their hearts set on Sarah Palin, but negotiations fell apart. It was Ian Ziering, the Sharknado lead and former cast member on Celebrity Apprentice, who suggested Trump for the role.\n\nGerald Webb, the casting director, says talks got \u201cpretty far.\u201d The Sharknado team then sent a contract to Trump\u2019s lawyer, Michael D. Cohen\u2014whom you may be familiar with thanks to this viral interview, or headlines declaring him as yet another Trump-inner-circler who\u2019s been pulled into the Russia investigations.\n\nBut all the serious talks soon went quiet, with Cohen later revealing to Latt that Trump was seriously considering running for president\u2014and that now \u201cmight not be the best time\u201d to pop up in a Sharknado film, despite Trump\u2019s rich and varied history of schlocky cameos. Asylum eventually decided to give the role instead to billionaire Shark Tank judge Mark Cuban, who is also a noted Trump nemesis. The decision apparently infuriated Trump\u2019s team.\n\n\u201cWe immediately heard from Trump's lawyer,\u201d Latt tells T.H.R. \u201cHe basically said, \u2018How dare you? Donald wanted to do this. We\u2019re going to sue you! We\u2019re going to shut the entire show down!\u2019\u201d (For the record, Cohen tells T.H.R. he does not recall this particular exchange.) Despite the threat, Sharknado 3 premiered in July 2015 as planned\u2014just over a month after Trump announced his candidacy.\n\nHad Trump accepted the role, we would have been treated to such scenes as the current president of the United States shooting down flying sharks in the halls of the White House and shouting, \u201cThis is for America, baby!\u201d Instead, another universe is enjoying another timeline\u2014one in which Trump enjoyed his Sharknado presidency and moved on.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58939394b9ae9c605ed18a8e/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/donald-trump-vs-the-wind-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/606484055e531a46c84d7e57/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5981ed1fe1dc9029878d759f/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/donald-trump-sharknado-3-president%25202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7af0987db7065a9e93f4/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/A_Headshots_YohannaDesta_Revise.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/618c4898ee5359a0267590ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/597f991ff3c6f80e768c7fe6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/trump-themed-dancing-with-the-stars.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b6b19ad09c6963c8df70b3d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/599f4be10ba28d197bf76893/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62019b3641f168f94e9f9d86/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5981ed1fe1dc9029878d759f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/donald-trump-sharknado-3-president%202.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/589393949d7a7cd341e5b76f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/donald-trump-vs-the-wind-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/601c7a5f5b14f8a97cc232eb/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/VF1421-Oscar-Issue-Chadwick-Boseman-Cover-tout.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/609aa7326bef6598eaa186bc/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/VF-June-2021-Issa-Rae-001.JPG", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58b4a1b8bdd6845b753b3df7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/jimmy-kimmel-donald-trump.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/627ea8ca0a29d0182d5876f6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/620aa6301c2c6391c8300cb5/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/VF0322_Cover_KS_3x2.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58939394b9ae9c605ed18a8f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/donald-trump-vs-the-wind-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5965422496475a07efe99388/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/donald-t-jr-fredo.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633d9bec72fe11ef3849c3ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5f3166c4476de5b2fc5e5654/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5981ed1fe1dc9029878d759f/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/donald-trump-sharknado-3-president%202.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Yohana Desta", "May", "February"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2017/08/donald-trump-sharknado-president", "title": "Donald Trump Almost Played the President in Sharknado 3", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Seriously?
