On Friday, a request by Norma for a restraining order against Gibson was denied, according to The Blast.\n\nThe judge ruled that there was not an ongoing pattern of harassment by Gibson against Norma. Afterwards, the judge cleared the courtroom so the parties could discuss the pair's daughter, Shayla.\n\nIn October, Gibson was under investigation by the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services, but the case was clsoed without pressing any charges.", "images": ["https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"], "top_img": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/tyrese-gibson-joint-custody-ruling-win-daughter-shayla/", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls Joint Custody Ruling a 'Win' for His Daughter", "meta_data": {"description": "Following a court ruling awarding him joint custody of his 10-year-old daughter Shayla with [...]", "keywords": "Tyrese Gibson,Fast & Furious 6", "news_keywords": "Tyrese Gibson,Fast & Furious 6", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "PopCulture", "creator": "PopCulture", "title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls Joint Custody Ruling a 'Win' for His Daughter", "description": "Following a court ruling awarding him joint custody of his 10-year-old daughter Shayla with [...]", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"}, "og": {"title": "Tyrese Gibson Calls Joint Custody Ruling a 'Win' for His Daughter", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/tyrese-gibson-joint-custody-ruling-win-daughter-shayla/", "image": {"identifier": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "Following a court ruling awarding him joint custody of his 10-year-old daughter Shayla with [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#263240", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511049600.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
