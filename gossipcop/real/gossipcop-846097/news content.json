I am talking to you guys specifically, I'm talking to everybody. I miss her,\" he shared as her family wiped away tears. \"It is unfair she is not here. We are going to sing a little song. I am going to be singing every word to her in her honor. Thank you for being here. Christina, we love you.\"\n\nWithin moments, the final members of Team Adam took to the stage with their coach to sing \"Hey Jude\" by The Beatles.", "images": ["https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-6.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/10/san-bernardino-haunted-house-shutdown.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/10/NUP_198270_03706.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/10/WP-COVER-2022-10-06T144801.070.png?resize=100%2C56&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/10/GettyImages-1242565738.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/10/AP22281349654135.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/08/GettyImages-1291135403.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_aerial-1-1.png?fit=2060%2C847&quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=44&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_On_Light@3x.png?fit=132%2C120&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2022/10/GettyImages-1431097340.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/LA_On_Dark@3x-2.png?fit=132%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=44&h=40"], "top_img": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-6.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mike Vulpo"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/846097/adam-levine-delivers-emotional-tribute-to-christina-grimmie-on-the-voice", "title": "Adam Levine Delivers Emotional Tribute to Christina Grimmie on \u2018The Voice'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.8.5", "og": {"site_name": "NBC Los Angeles", "type": "article", "description": "During Tuesday\u2019s live episode of the \u201cThe Voice,\u201d host Carson Daly made a special announcement about the former contestant who died in June 2016 after being gunned down at a concert in Orlando, Florida.", "title": "Adam Levine Delivers Emotional Tribute to Christina Grimmie on \u2018The Voice'", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/levine-delivers-emotional-tribute-to-christina-grimmie-on-the-voice/2003592/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-6.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all"}, "google-site-verification": "sWoyPxGwXLtX91VCyKxKQiQ_kRCPHsj_VIIRq7VdZsw", "fb": {"app_id": 61690781361}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@nbcla", "creator": "@nbcla", "description": "During Tuesday\u2019s live episode of the \u201cThe Voice,\u201d host Carson Daly made a special announcement about the former contestant who died in June 2016 after being gunned down at a concert in Orlando, Florida.", "title": "Adam Levine Delivers Emotional Tribute to Christina Grimmie on \u2018The Voice'", "url": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/national-international/levine-delivers-emotional-tribute-to-christina-grimmie-on-the-voice/2003592/", "image": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-6.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "publisher": "http://www.facebook.com/NBCLA"}, "description": "During Tuesday\u2019s live episode of the \u201cThe Voice,\u201d host Carson Daly made a special announcement about the former contestant who died in June 2016 after...", "keywords": "Carson Daly, Christina Grimmie, Coach, The Voice", "sailthru.title": "Adam Levine Delivers Emotional Tribute to Christina Grimmie on \u2018The Voice'", "sailthru.description": "During Tuesday\u2019s live episode of the \u201cThe Voice,\u201d host Carson Daly made a special announcement about the former contestant who died in June 2016 after...", "sailthru.tags": "Carson Daly, Christina Grimmie, Coach, The Voice", "sailthru.type": "article", "sailthru.date": "2017-04-25T17:30:08+00:00", "taboola_lead": "video", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.nbclosangeles.com/2019/09/cropped-NBC_LA.png?fit=270%2C270&quality=85&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493141408.0, "source": "https://www.nbclosangeles.com", "summary": ""}
