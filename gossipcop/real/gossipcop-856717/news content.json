He not only has the number one song it the world right now, but he managed to rock the stage at the season 12 finale of the show.\n\nThe 39-year-old singer performed the fresh hit alongside Daddy Yankee and the show\u2019s contestant Mark Isaiah who carried out with grace Justin Bieber\u2019s verses and chorus.\n\nFonsi joined Bieber on stage during the Purpose Tour\u2019s show in Puerto Rico, and there they played the remix for the first time together, and it was unbelievable.\n\nBefore Fonsi hit the NBC stage, he admitted that he is honored to be there on that special night for him.\n\nThe preparation for his performance took some time to come out as great is it did.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s tough when it gets down to the finals. These final four voices, performers are amazing,\u201d he admitted being proud to be there.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a favorite. They\u2019re all very different,\u201d he stated.\n\n\u201cWe have a showman and dancers, a country star, we have a rock \u2018n\u2019 roller that\u2019s an amazing guitar player, and then we have a beautiful, young talent,\u201d he continued.\n\nIf you\u2019re one of his Instagram followers, then you might know by now that he has had some very busy weeks from performing at the BillBoard Latin Music Awards to heading to Europe for playing his concerts.\n\nSo where does he stand now after his amazing performance, and what are his plans?\n\nHe plans on having fun, of course, and we believe that it\u2019s only natural. \u201cI\u2019m going to party! I\u2019m going to enjoy this moment. You know, it\u2019s been an amazing five months,\u201d he admitted.\n\n\u201cSo after this tonight, we\u2019re going to enjoy it with the audience and then some friends,\u201d Fonsi plans.\n\n\u201cThen tomorrow I\u2019m flying back to Europe to keep touring, promo and getting ready for my tour that starts July 1.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe has also got some new music coming on our way pretty soon, and we can\u2019t wait to hear it. He said that he just wants people to get where his head is, musically speaking. His upcoming album is scheduled for release sometime before the end of this year.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Check-Out-What-Makes-Selena-Gomez-And-The-Weeknds-Relationship-Work-Perfectly-300x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/bill-cosby-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Younes-Bendjima-Shows-Lots-Of-Affection-To-Kourtney-Kardashian-And-Shes-Blown-Away-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Luis-Fonsi-Promises-To-Party-After-The-Performance-Of-Despacito-On-The-Voice-Finale.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Rob-Kardashian-and-Blac-Chyna-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bernice-Burgos-T.I.-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x190.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Check-Out-What-Makes-Selena-Gomez-And-The-Weeknds-Relationship-Work-Perfectly-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tamar-Braxton-Monica-Vincent-Herbert-300x240.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-Bernice-Burgos-T.I.-Love-Triangle-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ariana-Grande-and-Miley-Cyrus-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/teen-mom-jenelle-evans-child-abuse-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Luis-Fonsi-Promises-To-Party-After-The-Performance-Of-Despacito-On-The-Voice-Finale.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170601194715/http://celebrityinsider.org/luis-fonsi-promises-to-party-after-the-performance-of-despacito-on-the-voice-finale-40041/", "title": "Luis Fonsi Promises To Party After The Performance Of \u2018Despacito\u2019 On The Voice Finale", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "justin bieber, Luis Fonsi, the voice,", "keywords": "celebrity news, justin bieber, Luis Fonsi, the voice,", "description": "Luis Fonsi did it again as the well-known Despacito singer took the stage at The Voice.
