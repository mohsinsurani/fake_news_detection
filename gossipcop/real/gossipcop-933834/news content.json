Starz also revealed that the 13-episode fourth season of the time-traveling period soap will return in November. (A specific return date has yet to be announced.)\n\nAll told, the renewal is for 24 total episodes, with each season consisting of 12 episodes. That is Outlander\u2018s lowest per-season total after the freshman run consisted of 16 and seasons two and three were 13 apiece. From Sony Pictures Television and starring Caitriona Balfe and Sam Heughan, Outlander\u2018s seasons five and six will be based on material from the fifth and sixth books in Gabaldon\u2019s series, The Fiery Cross and A Breath of Snow and Ashes.\n\n\u201cFans can rest assured their beloved Claire and Jamie will be back facing new challenges, adversaries and adventures in seasons five and six as we delve into American history and continue the story of the Frasers as they settle in the New World,\u201d Starz CEO Chris Albrecht said in a statement.\n\nSeason four is currently in production in Scotland and will consist of 13 episodes following Drums of Autumn, Gabaldon\u2019s fourth of eight books in the Outlander series. Season three averaged 5.8 million total viewers cross multiple platforms and ranks as the second-most-watched premium scripted series among women \u2014 behind only HBO\u2019s Game of Thrones.\n\nIn addition to Sony TV, Outlander is produced by Tall Ship Productions, Story Mining & Supply Co. and Left Bank Pictures. The drama is executive produced by Moore, Maril Davis, Toni Graphia, Matthew B. Roberts and Andy Harries.\n\nOutlander joins a scripted roster at Starz that also includes Counterpart, Howard\u2019s End, The Rook, Vida, Sweetbitter and Power, among others.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/0e04c600-9262-4b01-8305-a3c6dbb316f8_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/0e04c600-9262-4b01-8305-a3c6dbb316f8_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/0e04c600-9262-4b01-8305-a3c6dbb316f8_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/outlander-renewed-seasons-5-6-at-starz-1110296/", "title": "\u2018Outlander\u2019 Renewed for Seasons 5 and 6 at Starz", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The premium cable network has also announced that season four will bow in November.", "news_keywords": "Outlander", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1110296, "title": "'Outlander' Renewed for Seasons 5 and 6 at Starz", "published_at": "2018-05-09 12:00:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/0e04c600-9262-4b01-8305-a3c6dbb316f8_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Outlander", "topics": "TV News", "body": "No surprise here: Starz has extended Outlander for two additional seasons.\r\nThe premium cable network on Wednesday announced that it has renewed the Ron Moore drama based on Diana Gabaldon's best-selling book series for seasons five and six.
