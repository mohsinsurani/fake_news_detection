However, after enjoying some time with her youngest son, five-month-old Lux Russell, on the beach, the \"Teen Mom 2\" star opted out of the procedure and decided there was a better way to get her body back to its normal size.\n\nOn Twitter, after canceling the plastic surgeries just hours before they were scheduled to begin, Kailyn Lowry took to her Twitter page and said that she had traveled to Florida for a breast augmentation and liposuction.\n\n\"Hours before my surgery, I decided I don't want to go through with it,\" Lowry explained. The longtime reality star and mother of three then said that once she returned to her home in Delaware, she would use the money she was going to use for her plastic surgery procedures to pay for a nutritionist and get back to working out.\n\nWhat does Javi Marroquin think of Kailyn Lowry's decision?\n\nOne day after her tweet was shared, Javi Marroquin spoke to E! News, confirming that he was \"super proud\" of Kailyn Lowry for her decision to pass up going under the knife for a second time. As he explained, he used to tell her frequently that it is better to alter her body naturally than through surgery. That way, the reward is greater.\n\nKailyn Lowry previously traveled to Florida in early 2016 for several surgeries by Dr. Michael Salzhauer, who also goes by the nickname Dr. Miami. At the time, Lowry underwent chin liposuction, a Brazilian butt lift, and a tummy tuck. However, later that same year, Lowry became pregnant with the son of her now-ex-boyfriend Chris Lopez.\n\nRight away, fans questioned why she would get pregnant so soon after spending money on getting her body back to size.\n\nJavi Marroquin supports whatever makes Kailyn Lowry happy\n\nJavi Marroquin, who shares a four-year-old son with Lowry, also weighed in on the \"Teen Mom 2\" star's decision against surgery on Twitter, telling his fans and followers he is happy with whatever is going to make Kailyn Lowry happy with herself.\n\nTo see more of Kailyn Lowry, Javi Marroquin, and their co-stars, including Jo Rivera, Vee Torres, Jenelle Evans, David Eason, Nathan Griffith, Leah Messer, Jeremy Calvert, Corey Simms, Chelsea Houska, Cole DeBoer, and Briana DeJesus, tune in to the upcoming season of \"Teen Mom 2.\" The new season is expected to premiere on MTV sometime in the coming months.", "images": ["https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/1/24/660x290/b_1200x630x75/javi-marroquin-and-kailyn-lowry-pose-together-photo-via-instagram_1794591.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/2/43/profile_2043077_1512667597.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/0/638/profile_638977_1468627419.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/1/24/660x290/b_502x220x75/javi-marroquin-and-kailyn-lowry-pose-together-photo-via-instagram_1794591.jpg"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/1/24/660x290/b_1200x630x75/javi-marroquin-and-kailyn-lowry-pose-together-photo-via-instagram_1794591.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Lindsay Cronin", "'Vanderpump Rules' Star Tom Sandoval Believes Men Should Wear Makeup", "'Rhobh' Star Camille Grammer Explains Why She Talks About Ex-Husband Kelsey", "'Rhoc' Star Tamra Judge Says Kelly Dodd Likes To 'Destroy'"], "canonical_link": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2018/01/javi-marroquin-reacts-to-kailyn-lowrys-plastic-surgery-shocker-002313955.html", "title": "Javi Marroquin reacts to Kailyn Lowry's plastic surgery shocker", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, user-scalable=0", "description": "What does Kailyn Lowry's former husband think about her recent trip to Miami?", "news_keywords": "plastic surgery, Lowry", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956, "pages": 556225464427184}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Blasting News", "url": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2018/01/javi-marroquin-reacts-to-kailyn-lowrys-plastic-surgery-shocker-002313955.html", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Javi Marroquin reacts to Kailyn Lowry's plastic surgery shocker", "image": {"identifier": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/1/24/660x290/b_1200x630x75/javi-marroquin-and-kailyn-lowry-pose-together-photo-via-instagram_1794591.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Javi Marroquin and Kailyn Lowry pose together.
