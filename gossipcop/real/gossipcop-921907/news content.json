In particular, boy bands and girl groups seem more often than not to announce that they\u2019re going on \u201chiatus,\u201d rather than breaking up for good, when revealing their initial split.\n\nBut why not just end it?\n\n\u201cIt is smart,\u201d veteran publicist Diana Baron tells Billboard about the strategy. \u201cIt gives them them some cushion to see if each can succeed individually. And importantly, it avoids fan hysteria about who is at fault and the negativity that arises as fans pick a foil for a breakup.\u201d\n\nThe latest group to test the solo waters is Fifth Harmony, who revealed to the Harmonizer nation on Monday morning (March 19) that they are taking a hiatus in order to focus on solo projects and personal growth. \u201cAfter six years going hard, non stop, we also realized that in order to stay authentic to ourselves and to you, we do need to take some time for now to go on hiatus from Fifth Harmony in order to pursue solo endeavors,\u201d the group wrote in a statement.\n\nRelated Fifth Harmony Announce Hiatus to Pursue Solo Careers\n\n5H kept it very positive, saying they were excited and grateful to take the time to \u201cgrow creatively and really find our footing as individuals. In doing this we are allowing ourselves to gain new experiences, strengths and perspectives that we can bring back to our Fifth Harmony family.\u201d At press time there was no further information on how long the hiatus might last. In taking this career turn, 5H\u2019s remaining members \u2014 Ally Brooke, Normani, Dinah Jane and Lauren Jauregui, with former fifth member Camila Cabello having already left the group in late 2016 \u2014 follow in the footsteps of One Direction and *NSYNC, who announced their own ongoing hiatuses in, respectively, 2016 and 2002.\n\nWhile the post-hiatus plan is always to put a pin in it and come back years down the line, for most groups the status is frequently permanent. One Direction have kept the door open even though all four members have released solo material to varying degrees of success and, it was reported last month by BBC News that the group\u2019s touring company, Rollcall Touring LTD., has closed up shop, dealing another strike to hopes of a reunion.\n\nSimilarly, though groups such as *NSYNC and Destiny\u2019s Child have staged one-off reunions over the years on special occasions, the supernova careers of their respective leaders \u2014 Justin Timberlake and Beyonc\u00e9 \u2014 make it unlikely that a full-on reunion will transpire in the near future.\n\nThere is no legal reason, per se, for groups to announce a hiatus versus a break up, and acts don\u2019t typically legally dissolve their agreements when they take a pause due to ongoing business related to merchandise and the collection of royalties and publishing. Though they\u2019ve been on a break for decades, bands such as R.E.M., Led Zeppelin and Pink Floyd continue to bring in a reliable revenue without touring or recording, with an option to reboot the machine always lingering in the background.\n\nA music business attorney who requested anonymity tells Billboard that regardless of the reason for the hiatus, whenever new groups sign deals with labels there is always a \u201cleaving member\u201d provision that makes room for the possibility that an artist can leave the group, or that everyone might split. But that doesn\u2019t mean their label\u2019s rights to their individual services, or future services, ends. \u201cThe leaving member provision makes it so the label is entitled to whatever solo career they may pursue,\u201d the lawyer says, adding that the label has the option to pursue a deal with the suddenly solo artist or not.\n\nEither way, the attorney says taking a hiatus is not a way to get out of a recording contract. \u201cIf you break up and never get back together again then the label can\u2019t force you into the studio to make another album,\u201d the lawyer says.\n\nKen Weinstein, co-founder of Big Hassle Media, gives the perfect example of why saying you\u2019re breaking up is sometimes a trap. \u201cSpeaking as a huge fan of The Who, they announce that they\u2019re doing their final tour before they hit the road, so you think, \u2018Shit, I have to see the band!\u2019 Which will, of course, help sell tickets. But then I got angry when they kept coming back,\u201d he tells Billboard of the Rock Hall of Fame duo\u2019s numerous final swings.\n\nThe savvy groups, Weinstein says, know that it\u2019s best to never say never: \u201cWhy plague yourself by saying, \u2018I will never do this again,\u2019 and then have to live by that? An indefinite hiatus leaves room for whatever you want to do later because maybe you want to come back and work with these people again. Life is long and there are always possibilities.\u201d\n\nAs a first-hand example, Weinstein points to two of his current artists, Heartless Bastards founder Erica Wennerstrom and Gaslight Anthem singer Brian Fallon. The latter is on the road promoting his solo album Sleepwalkers, while Gaslight is on hiatus, though Fallon never said the group was done for good. In fact, they are playing more than a dozen dates this summer at which they\u2019ll celebrate the 10th anniversary of their landmark The \u201959 Sound album in its entirety.\n\n\u201cBrian is following his muse wherever that goes, and now it\u2019s leading him to write solo records. But Brian and the guys are totally comfortable celebrating their amazing album, because it\u2019s brought so much joy to so many people,\u201d Weinstein says. \u201cThey never had the albatross of, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re breaking up so we can\u2019t come back.'\u201d\n\nSimilarly, Wennerstrom, the only consistent member of Heartless Bastards, began writing songs last year that spoke more directly to her, so she recorded the solo album Sweet Unknown, which is due out on Friday (March 23). \u201cThere\u2019s a difference between what a Heartless Bastards and an Erica song is, and she wasn\u2019t sure certain songs she was writing belonged to the band,\u201d Weinstein says.\n\nSometimes it feels like you\u2019ve reached that door-slamming, \u201cI never want to see you again\u201d moment in your band\u2019s career and you think there\u2019s no way to bring it all back home again. But if we\u2019re being honest, a lot of groups who\u2019ve staged farewell tours, announced final albums or said they were done for good \u2014 like Smashing Pumpkins recently, or LCD Soundsystem \u2014 have come back for reunion tours and albums. Maybe the women of 5H just need a bit of time to live their lives and find some new inspiration they can bring back with them to their \u201cFifth Harmony family.\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/fifth-harmony-vmas-press-room-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/fifth-harmony-vmas-press-room-2017-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gil Kaufman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/pro/fifth-harmony-break-why-hiatus-not-split/", "title": "Fifth Harmony\u2019s Break: Why Do Bands Go on \u2018Hiatus\u2019 Instead of Calling it Quits?", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "To break up or go on hiatus?
