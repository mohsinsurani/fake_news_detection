Blast one of the shoes all over with a hair dryer for around a minute, until it\u2019s warm and soft. Put the shoe on your foot. Repeat with the other shoe. Walk around your house at least until the shoes have cooled - the longer you can keep them on the better. If you have time, ideally do this a couple of times.\n\nThen enjoy comfortable shoes that are molded to your feet and won\u2019t pinch, squeeze or rub your toes.\n\nThat way you can dance all night, with making sure to show off your best shapes on the D-floor your only concern.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/18/12/how-to-break-in-shoes-quickly-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/18/12/how-to-break-in-shoes-quickly-0.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/18/12/how-to-break-in-shoes-quickly-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Hosie"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/shoes-how-to-break-in-stretch-quickly-fast-heels-rubbing-pain-too-small-blisters-a8116536.html", "title": "How to break in new shoes quickly", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "It's remarkably simple", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Fashion", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/life-style/fashion", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2020-10-22T10:26:04.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The trick to breaking in new shoes quickly", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/fashion/shoes-how-to-break-in-stretch-quickly-fast-heels-rubbing-pain-too-small-blisters-a8116536.html", "type": "article", "description": "It's remarkably simple", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/18/12/how-to-break-in-shoes-quickly-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/18/12/how-to-break-in-shoes-quickly-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2020-10-22T10:26:04.000Z", "modified_time": "2020-10-22T10:26:04.000Z", "section": "Lifestyle", "subsection": "Fashion", "author_name": "Rachel Hosie", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 192, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2020-10-22T10:26:04.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "The trick to breaking in new shoes quickly", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "It's remarkably simple", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/12/18/12/how-to-break-in-shoes-quickly-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Shoes,Feet,life hacks,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1603362364.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
