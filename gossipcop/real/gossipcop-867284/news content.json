Brave men, all of you. Butchered a woman, pregnant with a baby. Cut the throat of a mother of five. Slaughtered your guests after inviting them into your home.\u201d\n\n\u2715 Game of Thrones: Season 7 Episode 2 preview\n\nAs the address continues, the Frey men begin to choke; they\u2019ve been poisoned. The Lord continued: \u201dBut you didn't slaughter every one of the Starks.\n\n\u201cNo, no, no. That was your mistake. You should have ripped them all out, root and stem. Leave one wolf alive, and the sheep are never safe.\u201d\n\nAs they hit the floor, Arya reveals herself, turning to Walder's latest wife, telling her to deliver a message to the crown: \u201cTell them the North remembers. Tell them winter came for House Frey.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s brutal revenge, Maisie Williams saying of the scene: \u201cIt\u2019s so f**ked up! Even Arya is surprised she has so much power. In that last moment she\u2019s staring out at all those men dying, she\u2019s turned into a bit more of a monster than she\u2019s ever realised. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s sad about that but she\u2019s got it on her mind.\u201d\n\nThe disturbing scene also brings together some story threads from George R.R. Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire series, the books on which Game of Thrones is based.\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nAs The Hollywood Reporter explains, Arya\u2019s revenge against the Frey\u2019s encapsulates Lord Wyman Manderly of White Harbor\u2019s very own revenge story from the books.\n\nMartin\u2019s series sees Lord Manderly openly working with the Freys, Boltons, and Lannisters, while also plotting revenge for his son \u2014 lost in the Red Wedding \u2014 behind their backs.\n\nThe character kills numerous members of the Frey family and cooks them into pies, serving them up to relatives. \"The best pie you have ever tasted, my lords,\" Manderly says during A Dance with Dragons. \"Wash it down with Arbor Gold and savour every bite. I know I shall.\u201d\n\nDuring the season six finale, Arya gives Walder a pie before slitting his throat. She then brings the Manderly storyline to a conclusion by serving the Frey sons poisoned Arbor Gold.\n\nWhat the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Show all 44 1 /44 What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Rory McCann Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Sandor \"The Hound\" Clegane What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Cersei Lannister What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Lena Headey Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Tyrion Lannister What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Peter Dinklage AFP/Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Daenerys Targaryen What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Emilia Clarke Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Jon Snow What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Kit Harington AFP/Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Sansa Stark What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Sophie Turner Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Jaime Lannister What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Nikolaj Coster-Waldau Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Arya Stark What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Maisie Williams Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Theon Greyjoy What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Alfie Allen Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Brienne of Tarth What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Gwendoline Christie AFP/Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Bran Stark What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Isaac Hempstead-Wright Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Petyr \"Littlefinger\" Baelish What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Aidan Gillen Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Missandei What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Nathalie Emmanuel Getty Images for Entertainment Weekly What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Varys What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Conleth Hill Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Melisandre What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Carice von Houten Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Samwell Tarly What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character John Bradley Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Gilly What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Hannah Murray Getty Images for Turner What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Jorah Mormont What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Iain Glen AFP/Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Davos Seaworth What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Liam Cunningham Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Tormund Giantsbane What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Kristofer Hivju Getty Images What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Bronn What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Jerome Flynn Getty Images for BFI What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Gregor 'The Mountain' Clegane What the Game of Thrones cast look like out of character Haf\u00fe\u00f3r J\u00fal\u00edus Bj\u00f6rnsson\n\nThe second storyline the young Stark has seemingly encapsulated is Lady Stoneheart. For those unaware, Stoneheart is the reanimated corpse of Catelyn Stark \u2014 brought to life by the Brotherhood Without Banners \u2014 who exacts revenge on the Red Wedding perpetrators.\n\nWith only twelve episodes remaining, there\u2019s almost zero chance we\u2019ll see Stoneheart; instead, Arya has encapsulated the undead character\u2019s quest to murder those traitors across Westeros.\n\nThe question remains of where will Arya go next? During the episode, she tells Ed Sheeran and his Lannister gang she\u2019s heading South to \u201ckill the Queen\u201d. But, could we see her travelling North to Winterfell? The teaser for episode two has already revealed a likely reunion will take place, but doesn\u2019t confirm where she\u2019s heading.\n\nGame of Thrones airs weekly on Sky Atlantic in the UK and is available on NOW TV.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp", "https://www.independent.co.uk/img/third-party/Amazon_Prime.svg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jack Shepherd"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-1-premiere-arya-stark-walder-frey-lady-stoneheart-books-a7846461.html", "title": "Game of Thrones season 7 premiere's opening Arya scene combines two iconic storylines from the books", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "'Wash it down with Arbor Gold and\u00a0savour\u00a0every bite'", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-07-18T13:18:48.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "How the Game of Thrones season 7 opening scene brings together two iconic threads from the books", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/game-of-thrones-season-7-episode-1-premiere-arya-stark-walder-frey-lady-stoneheart-books-a7846461.html", "type": "article", "description": "'Wash it down with Arbor Gold and\u00a0savour\u00a0every bite'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-18T13:18:48.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-18T13:18:48.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Jack Shepherd", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 888, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 8}, "date": "2017-07-18T13:18:48.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "How the Game of Thrones season 7 opening scene brings together two iconic threads from the books", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'Wash it down with Arbor Gold and\u00a0savour\u00a0every bite'", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/17/11/game-of-thrones-arya.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Game of Thrones season 7,Game of Thrones,Arya Stark,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500383928.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
