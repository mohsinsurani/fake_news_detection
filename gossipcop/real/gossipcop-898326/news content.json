The multihyphenate, 30, stopped by The Talk on Tuesday, December 6, where, following a discussion about recently rekindled couple Justin Bieber and Selena Gomez, she opened up about reuniting with ex-boyfriend Matthew Koma.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s going so great,\u201d she said. \u201cI mean, this is the third time that we\u2019ve dated and I think that what [Gomez] says has so much merit to it.\u201d\n\nGomez recently explained why she got back together with her off-and-on love of six years. \u201cI\u2019m 25. I\u2019m not 18, or 19, or 20,\u201d she told Billboard. \u201cI cherish people who have really impacted my life. So maybe before, it could have been forcing something that wasn\u2019t right. But that doesn\u2019t mean caring for someone ever goes away.\u201d\n\nDuring her appearance on The Talk, Duff reiterated Gomez\u2019s sentiments: \u201cTiming is such a big deal \u2026 third time\u2019s the charm!\u201d\n\n\u201cI think that you have history and a past with someone and love, and just because it doesn\u2019t work out the first time, the second time,\u201d she continued, \u201cas long as there\u2019s not too much damage done, then, it can always work out again.\u201d\n\nThe on-again couple stepped out in October amid reconciliation rumors and have since been present on each other\u2019s Instagram accounts. On October 25, Duff shared a Boomerang clip in which she turned Koma\u2019s head to reveal a kiss mark from her lipstick on his cheek.\n\nThe duo had previously split in March after several months of dating. Duff was previously wed to former NHL pro Mike Comrie, with whom she shares 5-year-old son Luca, and has been linked to Jason Walsh and Eli Sandvik.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/12/hilary-duff-matthew-koma.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/12/hilary-duff-matthew-koma.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C1018px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/12/hilary-duff-matthew-koma.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicole Mazza", "Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hilary-duff-on-matthew-koma-romance-third-times-the-charm/", "title": "Hilary Duff on Matthew Koma Romance: \u2018Third Time\u2019s the Charm!\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Hilary Duff opened up about rekindling her romance with Matthew Koma \u2013 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Hilary Duff on Matthew Koma Romance: \u2018Third Time\u2019s the Charm!\u2019", "description": "Hilary Duff opened up about rekindling her romance with Matthew Koma \u2013 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/hilary-duff-on-matthew-koma-romance-third-times-the-charm/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-06T23:35:36+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/12/hilary-duff-matthew-koma.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/12/hilary-duff-matthew-koma.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-12-06T23:35:36+00:00"}, "author": "Nicole Mazza", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Hilary Duff on Matthew Koma Romance: \u2018Third Time\u2019s the Charm!\u2019", "description": "Hilary Duff opened up about rekindling her romance with Matthew Koma \u2013 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/12/hilary-duff-matthew-koma.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512603336.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
