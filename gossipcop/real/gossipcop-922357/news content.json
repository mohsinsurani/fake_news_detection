He was 89.\n\nAvruch died Tuesday at his Boston home from heart disease, his family said in a statement to WCVB-TV .\n\nAvruch played Bozo the Clown from 1959 to 1970, a clown character particularly popular in the U.S. in the 1960s because of widespread franchising in television. Avruch became the first nationally-syndicated Bozo the Clown.\n\n\"He had a heart of gold,\" manager Stuart Hersh told The Associated Press on Wednesday, \"He brought the Bozo the Clown character to life better than anyone else's portrayal of Bozo the Clown.\"\n\nLOVED Frank.

He toured the world performing as Bozo the clown for UNICEF.\n\n\"He touched so many people with his portrayal,\" Hersh said.\n\nAvruch is survived by his wife Betty, two sons Matthew and Steven and several grandchildren.\n\n\"While it's hard to say goodbye, we celebrate the legacy of joy and laughter he brought to millions of children around the world as Bozo the Clown on TV and as a UNICEF Ambassador and later as host of Channel 5's Great Entertainment and Boston's Man About Town,\" Avruch's family said in a statement to the station. \"Our dad loved the children of all ages who remembered being on his show and was always grateful for their kind words.
