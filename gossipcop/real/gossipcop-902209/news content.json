Merry Christmas \ud83c\udf81\ud83c\udf84#bellyfannypacksarein#ithink,\u201d Jordan wrote Monday.\n\nAaron\u2019s relationship with the close-knit Rodgers clan has been essentially nonexistent in recent years. Jordan discussed friction with his NFL sibling during his stint on Season 12 of ABC\u2019s long-running dating competition, and chatter surrounding the Rodgers family feud appeared to intensify after Ed spoke with the New York Times in January.\n\n\u201cAaron has never wanted to air this out in a public forum. He\u2019s going through great precautions not to make this worse,\u201d a source close to Aaron told People earlier this year. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to see him on Oprah crying about all of this. He will deal with his family issues privately.\u201d\n\nThe quarterback\u2019s former girlfriend, actress Olivia Munn, was said to be at the center of familial tensions. But even after their split in April, it appears Aaron and the Rodgers kin have yet to mend fences.\n\n\u201cAaron still hasn\u2019t been in contact with his family,\u201d an insider told US Weekly in June. \u201cHis mom, Darla, has reached out to him multiple times in the last few months, but hasn\u2019t heard back from him.\u201d\n\nJordan previously stated he hopes to have his family in attendance at his future nuptials.\n\n\u201cAbsolutely. There\u2019s no scenario in which I wouldn\u2019t want my entire family at a wedding,\u201d Jordan said in 2016. \u201cThat\u2019s something all of our family wants and hopes for at some point.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/07/rodgers12.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=389", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2021/03/Ian-OConnor.png?w=152", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/newspress-collage-24152610-1665088896729.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1665074843&w=260", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6&comscorekw=sports", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2013/08/joel-sherman.png?w=76", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/rodgers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2019/10/podcast_nypsports_ny_post_sports_sidebar_widget_image_520x280_b.jpg?quality=90&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/rodgers.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Jaclyn Hendricks", "Contact The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/12/27/did-aaron-rodgers-family-feud-carry-over-to-christmas/", "title": "Did Aaron Rodgers\u2019 family feud carry over to Christmas?", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
