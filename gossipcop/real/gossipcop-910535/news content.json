News reports that Jay's company S. Carter Enterprises recently secured a trademark for the name Hovino. Under the trademark, the paperwork claims that it will be used for \"goods and services\" related to \"restaurant and caf\u00e9 services, carry-out restaurant services, pubs, cocktail lounges, wine bars, and more.\" Jay Z already owns the 40/40 Club, a sports bar and lounge, but it seems that isn't enough for the business-minded rapper. And the way Hovino sounds, we're thinking this one might have an Italian menu instead of finger foods and drinks.\n\nBut Jay Z isn't stopping there.\n\nTMZ also reported Jay is making moves with his Roc Nation clothing brand Paper Planes. Although his company already owned the trademark for it in regards to clothing, it seems Jay wants to expand it into a full brand with athletic gym bags, tour books, jewelry, and possibly a cosmetic line. According to TMZ, the paperwork states he's looking to use the brand in a larger capacity, including department stores, an online shopping site, and for musical recordings.\n\nThe plane logo was created by Jay's business partner and childhood friend Emory Jones. The two launched the brand back in 2015.\n\n\"I think we just wanted to represent our lifestyle of where we\u2019re at right now,\" said Jones in a GQ interview when it first launched. \"When you\u2019re moving around the world like we are, it was like, why not? Look, we\u2019re not trying to be a fashion brand, we\u2019re just trying to be a part of culture. We wanted to be a part of that luxury comfort, technical space.\"", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/my0gwcdo7desbev1unzd/jay-z-restaurant", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6685975&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/my0gwcdo7desbev1unzd/jay-z-restaurant?fimg-ssr-default", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_author_pic/Screen_Shot_2016-05-15_at_3.56.42_AM_aoxhjm.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 203 115\"%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/my0gwcdo7desbev1unzd/jay-z-restaurant", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/music/2018/01/jay-z-restaurant-hovino", "title": "Jay Z May Be Opening a Restaurant Named Hovino", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ICK39wBGvCQQMHpEUykVHWF8Ox_0MME-_qxe6ixFUik", "theme-color": "#000000", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jay Z filed paperwork for the name Hovino.", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "Jay Z May Be Opening a Restaurant Named Hovino", "description": "Jay Z filed paperwork for the name Hovino.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/2018/01/jay-z-restaurant-hovino", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/my0gwcdo7desbev1unzd/jay-z-restaurant", "site_name": "Complex"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310521533114641, "pages": 117696581735620}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jay Z May Be Opening a Restaurant Named Hovino", "description": "Jay Z filed paperwork for the name Hovino.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/2018/01/jay-z-restaurant-hovino", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,h_300,q_auto,w_600/fl_lossy,pg_1/my0gwcdo7desbev1unzd/jay-z-restaurant", "site": {"id": 13049362}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
