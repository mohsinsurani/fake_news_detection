News.\n\nEdwards\u2019 attorney Jonathan Turner told the outlet Edwards was not allowed to be within 100 feet of Bookout, her husband Taylor McKinney and their two children, Jayde 2, Maverick, 24 months. Bookout shares oldest son, Bentley, 9, with Edwards.\n\nThe order of protection will not affect his ability to see their son Bentley, Turner said as it will give him \u201ca lot more protection against any false allegations, allows him to avoid getting arrested without a hearing first, and allows him to be around his son most importantly.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Edwards and Bookout did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nThe mother of three initially filed for an order of protection in March and listed her three children, Jayde, Maverick and Bentley in the protection order. McKinney also filed an order of protection against Edwards.\n\nShe shares Bentley with Edwards, while her youngest two she shares with husband Taylor McKinney.\n\nJohn Phillips/Getty; MTV\n\nBookout also claimed in court documents obtained by E! News at the time that Edwards had \u201cleft voicemail messages threatening to show up at my house and take my son\u201d and alleged he \u201chas made threats to show up and hurt me if I don\u2019t answer my phone.\u201d\n\nThe MTV star also alleged that Edwards had appeared at Bentley\u2019s baseball game in May 2017 \u201cunder the influence of heroin and got in my face, yelling and threatening to hurt me,\u201d RadarOnline reported at the time.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

on the way to his wedding with Mackenzie Standifer Edwards, who was seen at times taking the steering wheel from him while on the road.\n\nThe news of the order comes after Edwards was arrested in Tennessee in March for violating terms of his probation stemming from a prior heroin possession charge.", "images":
