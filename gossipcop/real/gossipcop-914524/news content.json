During an intense argument on the roof of the school, Bonnie (Zo\u00eb Kravitz) shoves Perry (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd), causing him to plummet to his death.\n\nThis ending was the culmination of a narrative that kept Monterey\u2019s most glamorous moms and dads in the dark about Perry\u2019s behavior. Until that night, no one knew that he abused his wife, Celeste (Nicole Kidman), and sexually assaulted Jane (Shailene Woodley), resulting in the birth of her son.\n\nA rapid chain of events on the night of the least fun trivia night in history all led to Perry\u2019s demise. Here\u2019s a rundown of exactly what happened.\n\nCeleste\u2019s choice:\n\nCeleste learns that her son Max was bullying Amabella, tragically emulating his father\u2019s abusive behavior. (Remember the stuffed animal\u2019s missing limb?) This revelation is the pivotal crack in her denial that the twins were safe from Perry\u2019s violence. Later on, Perry discovers that as he feared, Celeste is leaving him. She scrambles to set her hastily prepared escape plan in motion before the party.\n\nIll-advised karaoke:\n\nDuring Ed\u2019s (Adam Scott) cringe-inducing song to Madeline (Reese Witherspoon), she\u2019s so overcome by guilt about cheating on him that she races to the caution-taped site of her affair with Joseph. Jane runs after her, and consoles her. Sporting the most elaborate Audrey Hepburn costume ever, Renata (Laura Dern) interrupts and apologizes to Jane for mistreating her. Celeste joins them. Perry arrives soon after, ordering her to the car. She refuses to go, insisting on staying with her friends. Bonnie hangs back and surveils the scene from a level above everyone.\n\nShailene Woodley and Reese Witherspoon in Big Little Lies. Hilary Bronwyn Gayle\u2014HBO\n\nThe struggle:\n\nIn a chilling moment, Perry is revealed to be Jane\u2019s rapist, as the horror on her face registers at the sight of him. Celeste quickly puts this information together as well. Enraged, Perry hits Celeste. Madeline and Renata try to restrain them, but he lashes out at them too. Bonnie races to the scene and shoves him, ultimately costing Perry his life. He tumbles down the concrete stairs to his death.\n\nThe end:\n\nThe show caps off with coordinated testimonies proving the core group doesn\u2019t rat out Bonnie, who a detective says could potentially face community service for involuntary manslaughter. Perry\u2019s death leaves his family on the road to recovery with a little help from the other moms. And help, the curtain dropper assures fans, is something that each mom will have. In this tidy ending, they all play at the beach, moving on together.\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ocean-underwater.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/big-little-lies-hbo-kidman-witherspoon-woodley1.jpg?quality=85&w=2650", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/big-little-lies.jpg?quality=85&w=2000", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/boss-baby.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/big-little-lies-hbo-kidman-witherspoon-woodley1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/big-little-lies-hbo-kidman-witherspoon-woodley1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Hoffman"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4715786/big-little-lies-finale-recap/", "title": "Let's Talk About Who Died on Big Little Lies", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "In the final episode of Big Little Lies titled \u201cYou Get What You Need,\u201d we finally out who died\u2014as well as the identity of the killer.", "og": {"title": "Let's Talk About Who Died on 'Big Little Lies'", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4715786/big-little-lies-finale-recap/", "description": "Spoilers ahead!", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/big-little-lies-hbo-kidman-witherspoon-woodley1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4715786/big-little-lies-finale-recap/", "description": "In the final episode of Big Little Lies titled \u201cYou Get What You Need,\u201d we finally out who died\u2014as well as the identity of the killer.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/big-little-lies-hbo-kidman-witherspoon-woodley1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4715786/big-little-lies-finale-recap/", "title": "Let's Talk About Who Died on 'Big Little Lies'", "description": "Spoilers ahead!", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/big-little-lies-hbo-kidman-witherspoon-woodley1.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
