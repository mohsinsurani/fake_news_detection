For a special episode in honor of the host's 50th birthday, \"Mean Tweets\" was twisted to focus on the former Man Show host. However, instead of reading the tweets himself, the show invited celebrity friends to read mean tweets about Kimmel.\n\nThe most notable tweet -- besides Chris Hemsworth's confusion -- might have been Larry David's. He had a tweet that read, \"I forgot Jimmy Kimmel's name so I googled 'Ugly late night talk show host' and I got him, top link.\" David wasn't able to keep it together afterward, which is fair because that's a savage tweet.\n\nIt turns out David couldn't handle reading any of the tweets he was given during the shoot. Kimmel decided to air the outtakes of David's shoot the next night. He read a handful of tweets and could hardly get through any of them. It makes sense that a guy who plays a jerk on TV would have a real understanding the kind of trolling he had to perform.\n\nWatch David's uncontrollable laughter above, and catch the last couple installments of \"Mean Tweets\" here and here.\n\nSign up here for our daily Thrillist email, and get your fix of the best in food/drink/fun.", "images": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/RTaDvKMtUeA/hqdefault.jpg", "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2719692/1200x600/scale"], "top_img": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2719692/1200x600/scale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dustin Nelson", "Published On At Pm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mean-tweets-jimmy-kimmel-larry-david-outtakes", "title": "Larry David Can't Stop Laughing in His Hilarious 'Mean Tweets' Outtakes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "keywords": "thrillist editorial, nation, news, dustin nelson, standard, entertainment, food, context, late night, movie and tv genres, talk show, topics, medicine, occasion, birthday, jimmy kimmel, [none]", "robots": "max-image-preview:large, follow, index", "description": "Larry David recently appeared on Jimmy Kimmel's \"Mean Tweets.\" The \"Curb\" star couldn't stop laughing and these outtakes prove that's how the whole shoot went.", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Thrillist"}, "parsely-title": "Larry David Can't Stop Laughing in His Hilarious 'Mean Tweets' Outtakes", "parsely-link": "https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mean-tweets-jimmy-kimmel-larry-david-outtakes", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://assets3.thrillist.com/v1/image/2719692/1200x600/scale;", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-11-16T01:01:58.000Z", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-author": "Dustin Nelson", "parsely-tags": ",entertainment,news", "fb": {"pages": 101800100890, "app_id": 111767172173562}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.thrillist.com/fbihtml/news/nation/mean-tweets-jimmy-kimmel-larry-david-outtakes"}, "og": {"site_name": "Thrillist", "url": "https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/mean-tweets-jimmy-kimmel-larry-david-outtakes", "type": "article", "title": "Larry David Can't Stop Laughing in His Hilarious 'Mean Tweets' Outtakes", "description": "\"Who picked these out?
