Did he finish the banana?\u201d she asked.\n\nWhen grilled by Kimmel as to whether it was true, Yancey said: \u201cIt was either real or it was a nightmare.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Former 'Bachelorette' Contestant Found Dead at 31\n\nBlake for one was not amused, and on Monday night\u2019s episode he blamed Lucas for his own rejection \u2014 dropping a few F-bombs and a Whaboom to express his disgust.\n\nOn the flip side, \u201cI think it was Blake\u2019s fault I was eliminated,\u201d Yancey told Kimmel.\n\n\u201cWhat is next for the Whaboom guy? You\u2019ve got to be on \u2018Bachelor in Paradise,\u2019 but what else?\u201d the bemused host asked.\n\n\u201cThis shirt as you can see, I\u2019ll take off this jacket to show off the gun show, but I am going to be selling these shirts and all the money is going for charity,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThose are going to fly off the shelves, Kimmel scoffed.\n\nWatch the video below.\n\n\u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d airs Mondays at 8 p.m. on ABC, \u201cJimmy Kimmel Live!\u201d airs 11:35 p.m. on ABC.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png",
