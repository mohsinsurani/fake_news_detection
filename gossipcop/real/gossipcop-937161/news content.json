Both the newly-appointed Duke of Sussex and the Duke of Cambridge wore the frockcoat uniform of the Blues and Royals during Harry's wedding to former Hollywood actress Meghan. In a statement, Kensington Palace said: \"Her Majesty The Queen gave her permission for Prince Harry to get married in his uniform.\"\n\nGETTY/REUTERS Queen granted Prince Harry special permission to sport a beard while wearing uniform\n\nREUTERS After leaving the Army in 2015 Prince Harry was promoted to the rank of major\n\nI think if you've retired from the Army you probably do need somebody's permission to wear your old uniform Historian Hugo Vickers\n\nIt is understood that the permission covered the fact that Harry has a beard. Historian Hugo Vickers said the permission may also have been granted because Harry has retired from active service. British Army rules do not usually allow beards, except in rare circumstances, such as because of skin complaints, or for religious reasons. Pioneer Sergeants are the only rank allowed to have a beard, although members of the Special Forces can when behind enemy lines.\n\nHarry is, however, no longer a serving officer and therefore military rules may not apply to him. A bearded royal bridegroom is a rarity. Indeed none of the current Royal Family sported facial hair on their own wedding days. But the Queen's grandfather, George V, did have a beard when he married Mary of Teck. Mr Vickers said: \"Theoretically the Army don't like it which is why at one point he took the Salute at Sandhurst in a suit.\" In December, Harry wore a dark suit and overcoat, with medals on the outside, when he represented the Queen and inspected graduating officer cadets at the Sovereign's Parade at the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst in Camberley, Surrey.\n\nGETTY Prince Harry married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel", "images": ["https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1068671835/?value=0&label=u9gYCOmHtQYQ28bK_QM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/subnavbanner/desktop/11.jpg", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/logo/dr/logo.png", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/page/placeholder-vertical.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/theme/Mobile/img/page/placeholder-horizontal.gif", "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=568781449942811&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Historian Hugo Vickers"], "canonical_link": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/962318/the-queen-prince-harry-royal-wedding-beard", "title": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "THE Queen granted Prince Harry special permission to sport a beard while wearing uniform as he married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel today.", "verify-v1": "EGl3XPBuem43awGwLC1rXGpRHRnmNSwp7VZfnCAAcKE=", "msvalidate.01": "1960193A20395DAD3FCB640BCB0D91D7", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "fb": {"app_id": 823607694325129, "pages": 129617873765147}, "og": {"title": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.express.co.uk/news/royal/962318/the-queen-prince-harry-royal-wedding-beard", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg", "site_name": "Express.co.uk", "language": "en", "tags": "headlines,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Royal Wedding,Prince Harry,Queen,Beard,Meghan Markle,UploadExpress", "section": "Royal", "description": "THE Queen granted Prince Harry special permission to sport a beard while wearing uniform as he married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel today."}, "news_keywords": "headlines,ctp_video,autoplay_video,Royal Wedding,Prince Harry,Queen,Beard,Meghan Markle,UploadExpress", "article": {"tag": "UploadExpress", "published_time": "2018-05-19T17:15:00+01:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-19T17:38:54+01:00", "expiration_time": "2018-06-18", "section": "Royal", "image_count": 5, "video_count": 2, "word_count": 588, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0, "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/750x445/962318.jpg", "title": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "description": "THE Queen granted Prince Harry special permission to sport a beard while wearing uniform as he married Meghan Markle in a stunning Royal Wedding ceremony at St George\u2019s Chapel today."}, "video_autoplay": "false", "headline_short": "The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD", "vf": {"image": "https://cdn.images.express.co.uk/img/dynamic/106/237x141/962318_1.jpg", "container_id": "express-prod-962318", "site_id": "00000000-0000-4000-8000-0ed77b31aaaf"}, "robots": "noodp,noydir,all", "dataLayer": "{\"page\":{\"attributes\":{\"publicationName\":\"express\",\"ownerSite\":\"express\",\"ownerSiteDomain\":\"www.express.co.uk\",\"platformType\":\"responsive\",\"cmsPlatform\":\"Daily Express CMS\",\"pageType\":\"article\",\"sectionId\":\"106\"}},\"article\":{\"articleId\":\"962318\",\"articleTitle\":\"The Queen granted Prince Harry SPECIAL permission to sport BEARD\",\"articleAuthor\":\"\",\"firstPublishDate\":\"2018-05-19\",\"firstPublishTime\":\"17:15:00\",\"attributes\":{\"primaryTag\":\"Queen Elizabeth II\",\"allTags\":\"Queen Elizabeth II|Prince Harry|Royal wedding|royal wedding|prince harry|queen|beard|meghan markle|uploadexpress\",\"isAdvertorial\":false,\"isNative\":false,\"affiliateLinks\":false,\"activeLegalProceedings\":false,\"nudity\":false,\"isSensitive\":false}}}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526746500.0, "source": "https://www.express.co.uk", "summary": ""}
