We can\u2019t wait to see what the Roseanne team has in store for next year.\"\n\nShowrunner Bruce Helford originally told the publication he'd love to shoot more episodes: \"Everybody has things that they\u2019re doing, so it might be hard to get 22 episodes in. But I would love to do another 10 or 12 on a yearly basis.\"\n\nThe reboot of Roseanne sees its titular character and her husband Dan Conner (John Goodman) older and struggling with health problems and focuses on the struggles of their children: D.J. (Fishman) is parenting his black daughter alone while his wife is serving overseas, Darlene (Gilbert) lost her job and had to move home with her parents, bringing her two kids with her and Becky (Goranson) is contemplating becoming a surrogate to combat her debt.\n\nRecommended Donald Trump calls Roseanne Barr to congratulate her on sitcom reboot\n\nRoseanne also tackles the political divide that President Trump's election created between Roseanne and her sister Jackie (Metcalf), as well as the topic of gender-fluidity with Darlene's child.\n\nThe show is executive-produced by writer Whitney Cummings, actresses Gilbert and Barr, Tom Werner and Helford.\n\nRoseanne airs on Tuesdays at 8pm on ABC.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/09/roseanne-0.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/09/roseanne-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/09/roseanne-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ilana Kaplan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/roseanne-abc-season-2-renewal-sitcom-john-goodman-a8282326.html", "title": "Roseanne: ABC has revived sitcom for season 2", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The sitcom is coming back", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-03-30T20:54:06.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Roseanne reboot is such a hit it's already been renewed for a second season", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/roseanne-abc-season-2-renewal-sitcom-john-goodman-a8282326.html", "type": "article", "description": "The sitcom is coming back", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/09/roseanne-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/09/roseanne-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-03-30T20:54:06.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-30T20:54:06.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Ilana Kaplan", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 432, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2018-03-30T20:54:06.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Roseanne reboot is such a hit it's already been renewed for a second season", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The sitcom is coming back", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/03/29/09/roseanne-0.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Roseanne,Roseanne Barr,John Goodman,Revival,Season 2,Lady Bird,Whitney Cummings,Donald Trump,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522443246.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
