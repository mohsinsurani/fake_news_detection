While Jen and A-Rod have been spending the past fews day together in the Dominican Republic, their children joined them for the Easter holiday, and the families apparently had one amazing time together! Alex even posted two adorable pics on Instagram, showing the joint fams doing various activities together.\n\nIn his first photo, Alex can be seen wearing all white while lounging on a white leather couch. To his left are his two daughters Natasha Alexander, 12, and Ella Alexander, 8. J.Lo\u2019s son Maximilian (Max) David Mu\u00f1iz, 9, is also pictured. How adorable! The only cutie missing from the image? Max\u2019s twin Emme Maribel Mu\u00f1iz. The former Yankees star captioned the snapshot, \u201c#couchpotatoes #eastersundaywiththekids.\u201d\n\nLater, Alex shared another photo, this time writing, \u201c#happyeaster from all of us.\u201d The families reportedly stayed at the Casa De Campo Resort & Villas, which costs about $10,000 a night, according to E! News. And they definitely made the most out of their beautiful surroundings come Easter Sunday! In fact, an eyewitness reportedly told the media outlet that J.Lo and A-Rod hosted an Easter egg hunt at their villa!\n\n\u201cJen and Alex woke up early and had Easter baskets outside lined up on the patio waiting for their kids,\u201d E! News\u2018 source shared. \u201cThey had family and friends over for an egg hunt on the sprawling lawn of the property.\u201d After the egg hunt, the couple apparently had a family lunch together and watched movies inside the resort.\n\n\u201cJ.Lo and A-Rod were sitting next to each other at the table watching and having a great time. The kids got along great and had a fun time running around searching for eggs,\u201d the insider dished. \u201cA-Rod\u2019s mom was also there along with some of his family. Jennifer gets along great with them and it\u2019s like they have all known each other forever. Their kids have also really bonded and become good friends. A-Rod\u2019s older daughter, Natasha, is like a big sister to J.Lo\u2019s twins.\u201d\n\nThe lovebirds\u2019 getaway is expected to last 10 days, and Jennifer was even able to perform her very first show in the Dominican Republic while there! She took the stage at the Altos de Chav\u00f3n Amphitheater on the night of Apr. 15, and was joined by Gente de Zona and ex-husband Marc Anthony for a few songs.\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 do you love that Alex and Jennifer spent Easter together with their kids?
