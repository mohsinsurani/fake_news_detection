The island, home to Wonder Woman, is inhabited solely by women.\n\n\u201cI guess I\u2019ll cut to the chase,\" McKinnon's character says. \"Show of hands: Who all here is a lez?\"\n\nWhen none of the island's inhabitants raise their hands, McKinnon's character shares the frustration of many of the film's fans, exclaiming, \"The whole thing seemed so super gay.\"\n\ncall your senators and thank them for the Kate McKinnon / Gal Gadot kiss \u2014 Jill Gutowitz (@jillboard) October 8, 2017\n\nme: i rarely get emotional\n\n\n\ngal gadot: kisses kate mckinnon with her mouth open\n\n\n\nme: pic.twitter.com/JV4KBjuAKl \u2014 spooky mom daniela (@haughtmila) October 8, 2017\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like we\u2019re in a porn, but the plumber is genuinely there to fix the pipes,\" Bryant's character says as the island's inhabitants brush each other's hair and play wrestle.\n\nGadot's character offers to comfort the disappointed duo by conducting an experiment to test her heterosexuality \u2014 or lack thereof \u2014 with a kiss.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, the YouTube video showing the steamy 14-second kiss between Gadot and McKinnon had more than 2.7 million views. And social media was ablaze with reaction to the skit.\n\nSpeculation has long swirled regarding the sexuality of Wonder Woman \u2014 also known as Diana Prince\u2014 and in 2016, the current writer of the \"Wonder Woman\" comic book series, Greg Rucka, confirmed that she is in fact \"queer.\"\n\nGadot addressed the speculation in an interview with Variety, saying her character is \u201ca woman who loves people for who they are. She can be bisexual. She loves people for their hearts.\"\n\nThousands of fans are petitioning Warner Bros. to embrace Wonder Woman's bisexuality in the sequel to the film studio's blockbuster summer hit, which is set to hit theaters in December 2019.\n\nAs of Monday afternoon, a Change.org petition asking the studio to \"make Wonder Woman bisexual\" nearly met its goal of 10,000 signatures.\n\nFOLLOW NBC OUT ON TWITTER, FACEBOOK AND INSTAGRAM", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183151/171009-galkiss-out.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2017_39/2167246/170925-wonderwoman-out200p_81ed00dc6a087ec7eae57f66687080af.focal-60x60.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183146/171009-gal-out.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183151/171009-galkiss-out.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Foluk\u00e9 Tuakli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/memorable-makeout-kate-mckinnon-gal-gadot-lock-lips-snl-n809096", "title": "Memorable Makeout: Kate McKinnon and Gal Gadot Lock Lips on 'SNL'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/memorable-makeout-kate-mckinnon-gal-gadot-lock-lips-snl-n809096", "title": "Memorable Makeout: Kate McKinnon and Gal Gadot lock lips on SNL", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Kate McKinnon and \"Wonder Woman\" star Gal Gadot shared a kiss on this past weekend\u2019s episode.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183151/171009-galkiss-out.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183151/171009-galkiss-out.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183151/171009-galkiss-out.jpg", "title": "Memorable Makeout: Kate McKinnon and Gal Gadot lock lips on SNL", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Kate McKinnon and \"Wonder Woman\" star Gal Gadot shared a kiss on this past weekend\u2019s episode.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Kate McKinnon and \"Wonder Woman\" star Gal Gadot shared a kiss on this past weekend\u2019s episode.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "Memorable Makeout: Kate McKinnon and Gal Gadot lock lips on SNL", "description": "\"Saturday Night Live\" cast member Kate McKinnon and \"Wonder Woman\" star Gal Gadot shared a kiss on this past weekend\u2019s episode.", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183151/171009-galkiss-out.jpg", "type": "article", "unibrow": "OUT Pop Culture", "authorName1": "Foluk\u00e9 Tuakli", "contributorName1": "Brooke Sopelsa"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Mon Oct 09 2017 19:22:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Mon Oct 09 2017 19:48:36 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_41/2183151/171009-galkiss-out.jpg", "next-head-count": 93}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2cRZL70C0w"], "publish_date": 1507576920.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
