It also appeared to spark snickers from some of the players, late-night host Jimmy Kimmel and others in the crowd at Los Angeles\u2019 Staples Center.\n\nNumerous viewers hit Twitter to share their opinions, with a few calling it the \u201cworst rendition ever\u201d (though one argued that Roseanne Barr\u2019s intentionally bad performance at a 1990 San Diego Padres baseball game was worse).\n\nSee some of the reactions below.\n\nOmg.
