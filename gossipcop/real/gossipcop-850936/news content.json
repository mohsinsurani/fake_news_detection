In fact, the birth control pill is their number one choice. While research shows that the birth control pill is safe and effective, the pill can carry risks like any other prescription medication. It is important for women to know their risks for blood clots, and to understand their options for birth control.\n\nOne risk associated with birth control pills \u2013 or any form of hormonal birth control that contains estrogen, including the pill, patch, or ring \u2013 is a deadly blood clot. The use of birth control pills with estrogen increases a woman\u2019s risk for blood clots three-fold, and some of the newer birth control pills women use pose a risk two-times greater than older birth control pills. The use of patches and rings containing estrogen poses a risk double that of birth control pills. Women with a clotting disorder, a previous blood clot, or a family history of blood clots are at an even greater risk for blood clots.\n\nJoin the National Blood Clot Alliance (NBCA) during National Women\u2019s Health Week (NWHW), May 13-19, 2018, as we work together with the Alexandra L. Rowan Memorial Foundation to provide women with life-saving information about birth control and blood clots, and to help them determine, along with their doctor, their risk for blood clots and their best birth control options. Together, we are encouraging women to visit Women & Blood Clots for more information about birth control and blood clots. Even if you are a woman at risk for blood clots, it is still possible for you to plan your family as you choose, by understanding your risk for blood clots and taking these simple steps to reduce your risk:\n\nLearn more about birth control and blood clot risks by visiting Women & Blood Clots\n\nComplete the Risk Assessment and discuss their results and birth control options with their doctor\n\nTalk to their doctor about any personal or family history of blood clots, and their existing risk for blood clot\n\nEach year, up to 900,000 people are affected by blood clots, and about 100,000 people will die because of blood clots. However, many of these deaths can be prevented simply by sharing life-saving information. Women in particular face specific risks for blood clots that span their entire lives. In addition to the risk for blood clots connected to hormonal birth control, women are also at risk during pregnancy and childbirth, and when estrogen is used in the treatment of menopause symptoms later in life.\n\nTo learn more about women and blood clot risks, signs and symptoms, and prevention, please visit and share www.womenandbloodclots.org.\n\nWhat is Women\u2019s Health Week?\n\nNational Women\u2019s Health Week is a special observance led by the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services Office on Women\u2019s Health.
