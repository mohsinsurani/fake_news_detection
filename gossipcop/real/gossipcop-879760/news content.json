At least from what we get to see on social media and when the two are out in public, Chrissy and John look like they have a beautiful relationship and make a very happy family. I mean, when John tried to break up with her because he was too \u201cstressed,\u201d Chrissy had a very simple response: \u201cNo.\u201d What an inspiration. Their one-year-old daughter Luna definitely benefits from the couple\u2019s strong bond, but apparently she\u2019s also already learned a thing or two about making fun of her dad from her sarcastic mom.\n\nIn a new interview with E! News, Legend admitted that Luna is already making fun of him for his bad eyesight in the most adorable way, and, of course, with the support of her mom... and the entire planet population, probably.\n\n\"Chrissy has her doing this thing called 'Daddy Eyes,'\" Legend explained. \"[It started] because one day, I didn't have my contacts on, and I was squinting around the house. Luna started mocking my eyes. So Chrissy started calling it 'Daddy Eyes.'\"\n\nChrissy has actually captured Luna\u2019s adorable \u201cDaddy Eyes\u201d impression on her Snapchat before, and it's as adorable as you might have imagined.\n\n\"Luna has me cracking up all the time,\" Legend said, and, well, same. Just take a look as she watches her dad appear on Sesame Street for the very first time.\n\nWhen John first posted this video to instagram, Luna had no idea what Sesame Street was. She was sick and couldn't go to set when John was filming so all the characters made this video for her. This is her first time watching it and knowing how freaking epic it is A post shared by chrissy teigen (@chrissyteigen) on Aug 9, 2017 at 5:15pm PDT\n\nLegend also spoke to E! News about how Luna is growing up. Luna and Chrissy have joined Legend on the European leg of his current tour, and according to him, it's been a great experience so far, especially for the little one.\n\n\"I love having them with me,\" he said. \"I've seen Luna grow up during the tour... She's really starting to walk now and really starting to talk a bit more now, too. A lot of that's happened while we were on the road. She's been on her first tour bus ride. She's been to her first concert. It's really a lot of fun having her experience a lot of firsts during this.\"", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/c_scale,f_auto,q_auto,w_344/fl_lossy,pg_1/COMPLEXNEWS___1000x1500_ypabtg", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6685975&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/zqcfkemyvzxwv5k3thtc/chrissy-teigen-luna-john-legend", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 41 23\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 203 115\"%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/zqcfkemyvzxwv5k3thtc/chrissy-teigen-luna-john-legend", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/09/chrissy-teigen-teaches-daughter-luna-to-make-fun-of-her-dad-john-legend", "title": "John Legend Is Already Getting Roasted by His Daughter\u2014Thanks to Chrissy", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ICK39wBGvCQQMHpEUykVHWF8Ox_0MME-_qxe6ixFUik", "theme-color": "#000000", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "John Legend admits Chrissy Teigen has already taught their daughter Luna how to make fun of him.", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "John Legend Is Already Getting Roasted by His Daughter\u2014Thanks to Chrissy", "description": "John Legend admits Chrissy Teigen has already taught their daughter Luna how to make fun of him.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/09/chrissy-teigen-teaches-daughter-luna-to-make-fun-of-her-dad-john-legend", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/zqcfkemyvzxwv5k3thtc/chrissy-teigen-luna-john-legend", "site_name": "Complex"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310521533114641, "pages": 117696581735620}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "John Legend Is Already Getting Roasted by His Daughter\u2014Thanks to Chrissy", "description": "John Legend admits Chrissy Teigen has already taught their daughter Luna how to make fun of him.", "url": "https://www.complex.com/pop-culture/2017/09/chrissy-teigen-teaches-daughter-luna-to-make-fun-of-her-dad-john-legend", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,h_300,q_auto,w_600/fl_lossy,pg_1/zqcfkemyvzxwv5k3thtc/chrissy-teigen-luna-john-legend", "site": {"id": 13049362}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
