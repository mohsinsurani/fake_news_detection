The figure is an homage to the unicorn that Erika entered on during her debut DWTS dance.\n\nErika had promised that she would gift her professional partner, Gleb Savchenko, with her Lamborghini if the pair won this season of DWTS. So Gleb also got a concillation prize from Lara in the form of a remote-controlled green Lambo. Everybody wins!\n\nYesss I got my Lamborghini \ud83d\ude97 and @theprettymess got her unicorn \ud83e\udd84 thank you @goodmorningamerica we were winners after all #minimirrorball A post shared by Gleb Savchenko (@glebsavchenkoofficial) on Apr 18, 2017 at 6:12am PDT\n\nErika looked back fondly on her DWTS experience during her interview with GMA. \"It felt great. We did end on a high note. It was beautiful. It was emotional. I felt good about it,\" Erika reflected on her final performance, a Viennese waltz to Sia's cover of \"Unforgettable.\" \"We worked hard. I'm proud of us.\"\n\n\n\n\n\nWatch Erika dish on her \"intense\" DWTS rehearsals, below.", "images":
