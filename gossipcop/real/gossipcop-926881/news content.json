Charlize Theron has gradually learned this throughout her years as a mother-of-two, and just even revealed that her own children, Jackson and August, can sometimes be \u201ca\u2013holes\u201d!\n\n\u201cI just see things clearer. A child in my twenties was the scariest idea I could think of. When I got to my thirties, I was so ready. But there\u2019s a moment where you\u2019re like, \u2018Oh God, I hope once I have my kids, I\u2019m still going to want to be a parent this much,'\u201d she explained to ELLE. \u201cI have bad days. I make mistakes. Going through the tantrum stages when they\u2019re such little a\u2013holes. And they choose the worst moments. It\u2019s a lot for one person. But after six years of having my two nuggets, there\u2019s not a day when I wish I hadn\u2019t done this.\u201d\n\nGetty Images\n\nThe actress adopted her son and daughter back in 2012 and 2015, respectively. Going into motherhood as a single parent, Charlize put a lot of pressure on herself to be perfect in her new role. \u201cIn the beginning, I wanted to do it all and didn\u2019t reach out for as much help as I actually needed. I felt, \u2018If I don\u2019t do all of this, then maybe I am a bad parent,'\u201d she revealed to the magazine.\n\n\u201cThe second time, I realized I am happier and my kids are happier if I ask for more help. People think I have a staff of 40, but I don\u2019t. I have one nanny and my mom up the street and amazing friends and family. I call them my village,\u201d Charlize continued. \u201cBut I\u2019ve learned to balance things out more. I look at my fuel gauge and think, \u2018Is it full or is it empty?\u2019 Then it\u2019s up to me to decide how to fill that tank back up or just remain empty. But what can you do on an empty tank?\u201d\n\nOne thing\u2019s for sure \u2014 Charlize\u2019s children have a great mother and grandmother. She may be a single parent, but she\u2019s not raising her kids alone. \u201cI knew that I would have to have my mom help me if I was going to do this as a single parent,\u201d the 42-year-old said. \u201cTo not acknowledge her in co-parenting my children would be a lie. She has jokingly said, \u2018Being a grandparent is what I was born to do.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Yo, b-tch! What about me? Was it not to raise me? I\u2019m your kid!\u2019 But I\u2019m so lucky to have that. I would feel pretty alone if I didn\u2019t have a partner in crime in all of this.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charlize-theron-kids-getty.png?resize=962%2C624&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charlize-theron-son.jpg?fit=400%2C400&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C400", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TITANIC_300x490_7_11r.gif?fit=300%2C490&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charlize-theron-kids-getty.png?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/charlize-theron-kids-getty.png?resize=962%2C624&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsey Burns"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/charlize-theron-children-157994/", "title": "Charlize Theron Admits Her Children Can Be \"A--holes\"", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Sometimes, being the best mom you can be means admitting that your kids aren't perfect.
