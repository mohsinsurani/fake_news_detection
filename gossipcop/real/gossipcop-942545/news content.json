Now, it looks like the actress is looking back at those years with the same fondness the fans do.\n\nThe star revealed that it was Clooney who taught her to respect everybody on set.\n\nMargulies was in attendance at the American Film Institute\u2019s Life Achievement Award Gala that honored Clooney earlier in the week, and while there, she shared with ET a story from the set of the medical drama.\n\nShe recalled Clooney shutting down a diva guests star.\n\n\u2018I remember that it was a guest star who was \u2026 they were upset, and they were keeping all of us waiting while in their trailer. And we were on set waiting and when they came on I was just watching, and George said, \u2018You know, you keep all of us waiting. The crew actually does not get to go home to see their families. So that is what that little tantrum was.\u2019 And I was like, \u2018Nice!\u2019 never happened again.\u2019\n\nThe actress went on to praise her fellow actor, even more, talking about how \u2018lucky\u2019 she was to work with him.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u2018We loved working together. We were good together. We could finish each other\u2019s sentences. It was easy. His body of work really speaks for itself. He knows so much about the business and yet has never, ever gotten jaded by it. He\u2019s truly noble. He treats every single person alike on the set it, does not matter their job title\u2026 Yeah, he taught me everything,\u2019 she gushed.", "images":
