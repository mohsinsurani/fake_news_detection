News is a flirty business & it seems like current epidemic of #SexHarassmentAllegations may be criminalizing courtship & conflating it w predation. What about #GarrisonKeillor? \u2014 Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) November 29, 2017\n\nADVERTISEMENT\n\nRivera\u2019s comments came just moments after Variety published an explosive report detailing multiple accusations against Lauer, including that he gave a colleague a sex toy as a gift and exposed himself without consent to a female employee.\n\nLauer also reportedly had a button under his desk that allowed him to lock his door without getting up.\n\nIn a second tweet, Rivera implied that women who have accused powerful men of sexual harassment are doing it to \u201cget even\u201d with former bosses or ex-partners.\n\nA jerk's a jerk in dating. #SexHarassment should be confined to situations where superior imposes himself on subordinate who feels unable to complain because of power of perp or feared consequences to victim's employment. Shouldn't be used to get even w bad bosses or hated ex's \u2014 Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) November 29, 2017\n\nRivera has defended men accused of sexual harassment before, including the former CEO and chairman of Fox News, who was forced out amid multiple accusations of misconduct.\n\n\"Don't believe the crap about Roger Ailes,\" Rivera said on Twitter last year.\n\nDon't believe the crap about #RogerAiles. Only ones talking dirt are those who hate #FoxNews & want to hurt network that's kicking their ass \u2014 Geraldo Rivera (@GeraldoRivera) July 19, 2016\n\nA Fox News spokeswoman told The Hill, \"Geraldo's tweets do not reflect the views of FOX News or its management. We were troubled by his comments and are addressing them with him.\"\n\n-Updated 8:44 p.m.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-footer.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/styles/thumb_small_article/public/lauermatt_gettyimages_112917_2.jpg?itok=bwBEUaJa", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=10314615&c3=&c4=http://thehill.com/homenews/media/362419-geraldo-weighs-in-on-matt-lauer-news-is-a-flirty-business&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lauermatt_gettyimages_112917_2.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://thehill.com/sites/all/themes/thehill/images/redesign/thehill-logo-big.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-51dZx4IkAE4Zk.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lauermatt_gettyimages_112917_2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033/http://thehill.com/homenews/media/362419-geraldo-weighs-in-on-matt-lauer-news-is-a-flirty-business", "title": "Geraldo defends Matt Lauer: 'News is a flirty business'", "meta_data": {"Smart_Paging": "on", "author": "Avery Anapol", "description": "Geraldo Rivera came to Matt Lauer\u2019s defense Wednesday after the longtime \u201cToday\u201d host was fired from the network over sexual harassment complaints.", "keywords": "Sexual harassment,Matt Lauer, Geraldo Rivera,", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "fb": {"admins": 100000299130732, "pages": 7533944086, "app_id": 566538590082898}, "og": {"site_name": "TheHill", "type": "article", "title": "Geraldo defends Matt Lauer: 'News is a flirty business'", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033/http://thehill.com/homenews/media/362419-geraldo-weighs-in-on-matt-lauer-news-is-a-flirty-business", "description": "Geraldo Rivera came to Matt Lauer\u2019s defense Wednesday after the longtime \u201cToday\u201d host was fired from the network over sexual harassment complaints.", "updated_time": "2017-11-29T20:43:36-05:00", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://thehill.com/sites/default/files/lauermatt_gettyimages_112917_2.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "title": "Geraldo defends Matt Lauer: 'News is a flirty business'", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171130065033im_/http://thehill.com/homenews/media/362419-geraldo-weighs-in-on-matt-lauer-news-is-a-flirty-business", "description": "Geraldo Rivera came to Matt Lauer\u2019s defense Wednesday after the longtime \u201cToday\u201d host was fired from the network over sexual harassment complaints.", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-29T16:19:53-05:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-29T20:43:36-05:00"}, "dcterms.title": "Geraldo defends Matt Lauer: 'News is a flirty business'", "dcterms.creator": "Avery Anapol", "dcterms.description": "Geraldo Rivera came to Matt Lauer\u2019s defense Wednesday after the longtime \u201cToday\u201d host was fired from the network over sexual harassment complaints.", "dcterms.date": "2017-11-29T16:19-05:00", "dcterms.type": "Text", "dcterms.format": "text/html", "dcterms.identifier": "http://thehill.com/homenews/media/362419-geraldo-weighs-in-on-matt-lauer-news-is-a-flirty-business", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=396640962"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511990393.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
