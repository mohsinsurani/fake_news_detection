Pregnant Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian revealed the contents of her hospital bag on her app on Friday, April 6, and she\u2019s actually packing somewhat light.\n\n\u201cWhen it comes time to go to the hospital to deliver my baby girl, I\u2019ll be ready. Of course, I\u2019m already packed up and have been for a while,\u201d wrote the reality star, who\u2019s expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson. \u201cI knew exactly what I wanted to put in my hospital bag \u2014 lots of comfy things for me and for her!\u201d\n\nKardashian\u2019s list of must-haves includes her computer and charger, pajamas that button in the front (for breast-feeding), a going-home outfit and sneakers, a pillow, slides, maternity bras, a camera and her \u201cfavorite\u201d Barefoot Dreams blanket. It sounds like the Keeping Up With the Kardashians star, 33, knows what she\u2019s doing. Perhaps she consulted her sisters \u2014 Kim and Kourtney Kardashian and Kylie Jenner are all moms \u2014 about what to bring.\n\nMeanwhile, her little girl will have two gowns, matching receiving hats and blankets, socks and swaddles waiting for her when she makes her big debut.\n\nThe Strong Looks Better Naked author also shared that meat has repulsed her since she got pregnant. \u201cJust the sight of it makes me nauseous. So, I\u2019ve become somewhat of a vegetarian during pregnancy, but not by choice,\u201d she divulged.\n\nKardashian has not revealed her due date, although she should be meeting her first child pretty soon. Us Weekly broke the news in September 2017 that the Revenge Body host is expecting a baby with her NBA player boyfriend, 27. She confirmed the pregnancy on Instagram in December 2017 and shared that she was having a girl during a March episode of KUWTK.\n\nUs exclusively reported that Kardashian will be giving birth in Ohio \u2014 Thompson plays for the Cleveland Cavaliers \u2014 and her mother, Kris Jenner, will be joining her there for the delivery. \u201cThe baby birth is imminent,\u201d a source told Us on Wednesday, April 4.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian1.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1851px%2C973px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian1.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1851px%2C973px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-khloe-kardashian-whats-in-my-hospital-bag/", "title": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian: What\u2019s in My Hospital Bag", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian is packing somewhat light for the delivery of her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian Keeps Her Hospital Bag Surprisingly Minimal", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian is packing somewhat light for the delivery of her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-khloe-kardashian-whats-in-my-hospital-bag/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:06:14+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian1.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1851px%2C973px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian1.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1851px%2C973px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-04-06T23:07:27+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:06:14+00:00"}, "author": "Erin Crabtree", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian Keeps Her Hospital Bag Surprisingly Minimal", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian is packing somewhat light for the delivery of her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson \u2014 find out more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tristan-thompson-khloe-kardashian1.jpg?crop=47px%2C0px%2C1851px%2C973px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523056047.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
