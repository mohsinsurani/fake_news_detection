For one thing, I think the audience was supposed to feel uncomfortable with Betty's performance. Betty gets on stage because she feels that she has to in order to ultimately protect her boyfriend, whereas Blair did it because she was feeling sexy and powerful. Earlier in the episode, Toni Topaz (Vanessa Morgan) even calls out the Serpent tradition as sexist and misogynistic. It's quite possible that this scene was not supposed to be titillating at all, but an example of how vulnerable a situation Betty was putting herself in at the time.", "images": ["https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/582/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1901398/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg"], "top_img": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/582/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1901398/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ineye Komonibo", "Katherine Singh", "Mekita Rivas", "Olivia Truffaut-Wong", "Melissah Yang", "Shamira Ibrahim", "Betty Cooper Riverdale Striptease Reactions Controversy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/184365/betty-cooper-riverdale-striptease-mad-world-reaction", "title": "The Internet Has Feelings About Betty's Riverdale Striptease & Mostly It's \"Girl, Why?\"", "meta_data": {"title": "Betty Cooper Riverdale Striptease Reactions Controversy", "description": "\"Oh no.\"", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2017/12/184365/betty-cooper-riverdale-striptease-mad-world-reaction", "title": "The Internet Has Feelings About Betty's \"Riverdale\" Striptease & Mostly It's \"Girl, Why?\"", "description": "\"Oh no.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/582/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1901398/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/582/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1901398/image.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1050}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Internet Has Feelings About Betty's \"Riverdale\" Striptease & Mostly It's \"Girl, Why?\"", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29", "description": "\"Oh no.\"", "image": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/entry/582/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/1901398/image.jpg"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/d92/112,0,1776,2400/x,80/1901397/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "news_keywords": "riverdale, betty cooper, betty cooper striptease, betty cooper mad world, britney spears snake dance, britney spears vmas, betty cooper dances to mad world, riverdale season 2, southside serpents,", "p": {"domain_verify": "b10faeb45f92f5ebf0073a215d615ea9"}, "entry_template": "entry.article", "author": "Kaitlin Reilly"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513555200.0, "source": "https://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
