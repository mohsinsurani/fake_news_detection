There\u2019s no denying that baby bump these days!\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nBut besides the pregnancy \u2014 though we\u2019re sure the pregnancy is a big part of it \u2014 she\u2019s really just seemed so happy and peaceful, hasn\u2019t she?\n\nLike after so many ups and downs, she\u2019s finally settled in a place where she wants to be in life.\n\nIt\u2019s so nice to see.\n\nAnd if you weren\u2019t near tears over the beautiful turnaround of Khloe Kardashian\u2019s life already, well, let her break it all down for you in this lengthy but super touching Instagram post she made today!\n\nFor her photo, she shared an older photo of herself along with a much more recent one \u2014 her \"revenge body\":\n\nIn the caption, she wrote \"Sometimes it\u2019s hard for me to post these transformation posts only because I can\u2019t imagine my life being this unhealthy again.\"\n\nTo clarify, she added that \"Never would I ever consider myself fat, but I would consider myself unhealthy mentally/physically and not knowing my true value. Mind, body and soul.\"\n\nAww, KoKo.\n\n\"For me,\" she wrote, \"my transformation started from within. I needed to heal myself from the inside out.\"\n\n\"Once I started putting myself first, everything started falling into place. My life transformed a few years ago when I made the decision to stop existing and start living.\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nA few years ago, of course, is when she split from Lamar Odom and began focusing hard on her fitness.\n\nShe\u2019s said many times that she began going to the gym as a way to deal with everything that was going on with Lamar \u2014 his downward spiral began while they were still together.\n\nIt must have been tough for her to file for divorce and take care of herself when so many people were convinced that they were soulmates, destined to be together forever.\n\nBut, as she explained, \"I decided when I was ready regardless of what anybody else was saying about me. Regardless of the pressures. I had to do this on my terms or I knew it wouldn\u2019t last.\"\n\n\"It\u2019s ok to take the control back,\" she advised her followers. \"Choose your life. Don\u2019t let anybody else decide for you!\"\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\n\"We are no victims to life but we can become victims and prisoners to the people that we choose to surround ourselves with if we allow them to break us and consume us.\"\n\nAnyone else loving this motivational speaker side of Khloe? Because we are kind of living for it.\n\n\"Never be afraid to put yourself first!\" she preached. \"Never choose comfort over your own well-being! Never forget that fate loves the fearless!\"\n\n\"Today\u2019s wisdom was yesterday\u2019s pain. Tomorrow\u2019s happiness is today\u2019s bravery! I am so proud of myself for being stronger than I\u2019ve ever been \u2014 mind body and soul.\"\n\nAnd she should be \u2014 we still don\u2019t know all that went on with her marriage to Lamar, but just considering what we do know, it\u2019s amazing that she\u2019s been able to pull herself up like this.\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\nWe all saw how deeply she loved him, and we also saw how deeply he betrayed her. She definitely should be proud of her strength.\n\nKhloe also wrote that she\u2019s \"even prouder of myself that I\u2019ve been able to maintain a healthy lifestyle for so many years. I broke that cycle and I\u2019m happier than I have ever been!\"\n\n\"You can do this!! Start from within and nothing can stop you,\" she finished. \"Elevate yourself \u2014 mind body and soul.\"\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder why so many people refer to her as the best Kardashian, huh?", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/khloe-kardashian-poses-with-arms-crossed-769x1024.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201142%201222'%3E%3Crect%20width='1142'%20height='1222'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20769%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='769'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/globe-logo-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-before-and-after.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/khloe-kardashian-made-up-and-so-done.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20688'%3E%3Crect%20width='700'%20height='688'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/09/khloe-kardashian-duck-lips-selfie.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-at-6-months-771x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/khloe-kardashian-poses-with-arms-crossed-720x540.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/khloe-kardashian-poses-with-arms-crossed.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/08/Kim-Kardashian-Pete-Davidson-Getty-1395054359-copy-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='540'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/the-edwards-320x240.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/khloe-kardashian-baby-bump.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20771%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='771'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20523%20692'%3E%3Crect%20width='523'%20height='692'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20698%20691'%3E%3Crect%20width='698'%20height='691'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/12/khloe-kardashian-poses-with-arms-crossed.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-im-happier-than-ive-ever-been-sorry-lamar/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian: I'm Happier Than I've Ever Been!
