I am truly sorry for making a bad joke about her politics and her looks. I should have known better. Forgive me \u2014 my joke was in bad taste.\u201d\n\nWalt Disney Co. CEO Bob Iger also weighed in on the decision to cancel Roseanne: \u201cThere was only one thing to do here, and that was the right thing,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nAdded executive producer Tom Werner, whose company Carsey-Werner exec produced the original Roseanne and its revival: \u201cI support ABC\u2019s decision to cancel the show in the wake of Roseanne Barr\u2019s most recent reprehensible tweets. Our goal was to promote constructive discussion about the issues that divide us. It represented the work of hundreds of talented people. I hope the good work done is not totally eclipsed by these abhorrent and offensive comments, and that Roseanne seeks the help she so clearly needs.\u201d\n\nShowrunner Bruce Helford added in a statement of his own: \u201cOn behalf of all the writers and producers, we worked incredibly hard to create an amazing show. I was personally horrified and saddened by the comments and in no way do they reflect the values of the people who worked so hard to make this the iconic show that it is.\u201d\n\nBarr\u2019s tweet prompted a massive outcry across social media, with thousands condemning the actress-comedian\u2019s comments and calling on ABC to cancel her series. The Disney-owned network\u2019s decision to cancel the comedy marked the first time the network has taken action in response to one of Barr\u2019s controversial tweets.\n\nAxing the Roseanne revival was no small decision for ABC. The rebooted comedy debuted its nine-episode run midseason and finished as the TV season\u2019s No. 1 scripted series on all of broadcast. Roseanne had been averaging a 5.5 rating among adults 18-49 and 19.3 million viewers with live-plus-3 lifts. With a full week of time-shifting, those numbers climbed to a 6.4 rating in the key demo and 22.1 million viewers. Either way, Roseanne was the highest-rated and most watched series of the broadcast season, eclipsing NBC\u2019s This Is Us and CBS\u2019 The Big Bang Theory \u2014 which had been in a heated battle for top status.\n\nIn response to Barr\u2019s tweet, co-star and exec producer Sara Gilbert \u2014 who was the driving force behind the revival \u2014 blasted her longtime friend and colleague. \u201cRoseanne\u2019s recent comments about Valerie Jarrett, and so much more, are abhorrent and do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least,\u201d she wrote on Twitter. \u201cThis is incredibly sad and difficult for all of us, as we\u2019ve created a show that we believe in, are proud of, and that audiences love \u2014 one that is separate and apart from the opinions and words of one cast member.\u201d Wanda Sykes, who served as a consultant on season one, also tweeted Tuesday that she would not be returning to the series following Barr\u2019s racist tweet.\n\nRoseanne was slated to return in the fall for an expanded 11th season of 13 episodes as ABC looked to build on the show\u2019s momentum. In a victory lap of sorts, Barr was the centerpiece of ABC\u2019s upfront presentation to Madison Avenue ad buyers earlier this month. The revival was part of a larger effort by Dungey \u2014 broadcast\u2019s lone African-American network topper \u2014 to cater to the underserved community who turned out in force to elect Donald Trump. The success of the Roseanne revival has prompted other broadcast networks to pick up a wave of multicamera comedies in a larger push to program for middle America. (To that end, Fox revived Tim Allen comedy Last Man Standing a year after ABC\u2019s cancellation.)\n\nRoseanne has never shied away from taking on timely and controversial subjects. In the spirit of its original run, which had a history of addressing larger political and social issues, the revival famously opened its new season with an episode that explored the country\u2019s divisive response to President Trump, whom Barr has publicly supported. The storyline between Roseanne Conner and her sister, Jackie (Laurie Metcalf), was designed to reflect the debate among Trump\u2019s working-class base and spur a larger discussion. The May 22 season finale, likewise, set the stage to explore a larger debate about health care in America.\n\nThe reboot also found itself under the microscope earlier this season when a one-off joke taking aim at fellow ABC comedies Black-ish and Fresh Off the Boat was blasted as being \u201creductive\u201d and \u201cbelittling.\u201d\n\nFor his part, Helford stressed ahead of and during the Roseanne revival that he hoped viewers would be able to separate the show from Barr\u2019s politics. \u201cWe never set out to be a show about politics. We set out to be a show about the Conners and how the current political climate affects the family,\u201d he told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe made a point of not mentioning names in the beginning, and I believe we will probably maintain that same thing. There is no agenda here, in any direction. The idea is to present all sides of the dialogue. Making it specific like that isn\u2019t necessary. That\u2019s not what we\u2019re doing. We\u2019re not talking about the personalities involved. We\u2019re talking about the effects of all the politics on the lives of people like the Conners.\u201d Helford served as showrunner on an early season of Roseanne before he was fired by the actress. He was poised to return as season 11\u2019s lone showrunner after Whitney Cummings opted to not return.\n\nABC\u2019s decision to cancel Roseanne leaves the network with a major hole on its schedule as the series was set to open its Tuesday lineup at 8 p.m. ABC now heads into the 2018-19 broadcast season without TV\u2019s No. 1 series and without prolific showrunner Shonda Rhimes, who exited last year for a deal with Netflix.\n\nBarr returned to Twitter late Tuesday with an apology to the writers, cast and crew who all lost their jobs Tuesday (and a plug for an upcoming interview): \u201cDon\u2019t feel sorry for me, guys!! \u2014 I just want to apologize to the hundreds of people, and wonderful writers (all liberal) and talented actors who lost their jobs on my show due to my stupid tweet. I will be on Joe Rogan\u2019s podcast friday,\u201d she wrote.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148352_3912_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148352_3912_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148352_3912_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/roseanne-canceled-at-abc-racist-tweet-1115412/", "title": "\u2018Roseanne\u2019 Canceled at ABC Following Racist Tweet", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "ABC has canceled 'Roseanne' following Roseanne Barr's racist tweet.", "news_keywords": "ABC, Roseanne, Roseanne Barr", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1115412, "title": "'Roseanne' Canceled at ABC Following Racist Tweet", "published_at": "2018-05-29 10:47:48", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/148352_3912_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Roseanne Barr", "topics": "TV News", "body": "ABC, in a stunning move, has decided to cancel its Roseanne revival following star Roseanne Barr's racist tweet Tuesday.\r\n\"Roseanne's Twitter statement is abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show,\" ABC Entertainment president Channing Dungey said Tuesday.\r\nEarly Tuesday, star, head writer and executive producer Barr attacked Valerie Jarrett, a senior adviser to former President Barack Obama, in a since-deleted tweet in which she said \"Muslim brotherhood & planet of the apes had a baby=vj.\" Barr subsequently apologized: \"I apologize to Valerie Jarrett and to all Americans.
