I didn\u2019t want to come. I wasn\u2019t going to postpone it, I was going not come, and people would understand. But Bobby said you have to go because we\u2019re going to raise money for thyroid cancer,\u201d Jill told E! News.\n\nAs for how she\u2019s doing since Bobby hospitalization, Jill says \u201cI\u2019m running on full adrenaline. I haven\u2019t eaten in days. I\u2019ve lost eight pounds.\u201d\n\nJill also revealed that she reconciled with Ramona Singer; saying that Ramona has been by her side non-stop during Bobby\u2019s hospitalization.\n\n\u201cIt means everything to me. Ramona came to the hospital and sat with me for a few hours. She\u2019s been emailing me and texting me every day,\u201d said Jill. \u201cThe past doesn\u2019t mean anything; it doesn\u2019t mean anything to us. Others haven\u2019t called, but\u2026I\u2019m blessed, I\u2019m so lucky, I\u2019m surrounded by friends.\u201d\n\nFor now, Jill says she and Bobby are taking things \u201cone hour at a time.\u201d Adding, \u201cHe had a good day yesterday.\u201d\n\nAt her Luxury Luncheon, Jill was surrounded by many former and current Housewives including a few of her Real Housewives of New York friends like Cindy Barshop, Tinsley Mortimer, Luann de Lesseps and Kelly Bensimon.\n\nRamona, who also attended the event with her new boyfriend Steve, opened up about being there for Jill despite their past issues.\n\n\u201cWhen I heard about Bobby, my heart broke. Jill and I have had a very interesting relationship over the years. But the thing is, when someone needs me, I am so there. When something bad happens in someone\u2019s life, you need people around you,\u201d Ramona explained. \u201cI went to visit Bobby, he was in great spirits, God Bless him, and Jill and I had a 45-minute talk. I think we both let our walls down and it was woman to woman, friend to friend. It was a wonderful chat, and we came away from it in a really good, bonding manner. Sometimes, unfortunately, tragedy brings people closer.\u201d\n\nI know we all make fun of how insane and crazy Ramona is but I think she does have a compassionate and kind side to her, especially when the cameras aren\u2019t around. We all saw how great Ramona was with Bethenny during her health scare last year and now this with Jill. It\u2019s so sweet to see the Housewives come together to support Jill during this difficult time. The AATRH team continues to keep Bobby and Jill in our prayers.\n\nAre you surprised Jill and Ramona have reconciled? Do you think Ramona has a compassionate side we don\u2019t see on RHONY? Can you believe Jill is holding it together so well?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/dish-033116-envy-teresa-giudice-melissa-gorga-01.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-jacqueline-laurita-feud-rhonj-season-7-return.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rs_600x600-170729181249-600.Ramona-Singer-Jill-Zarin.kg_.072917.jpg?fit=450%2C350", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/IMG_0351.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/bethenny.gif?resize=300%2C168", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rs_600x600-170127093026-600-real-housewives-2.jpg?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rs_1024x759-170729181249-1024.Ramona-Singer-Jill-Zarin-Cindy-Barshop-Tinsley-Mortimer.kg_.072917-2.jpg?resize=1024%2C759", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rs_600x600-170729181249-600.Ramona-Singer-Jill-Zarin.kg_.072917.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RHONJ-Season-8-Cast-All-About-the-Tea.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-112x112.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/kim-richards-zoom-806d5c24-4f13-40d7-bd34-ce05adec6acb.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hqdefault.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/rhop-reunion-fashion-poll-promote.jpg?resize=150%2C150"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/rs_600x600-170729181249-600.Ramona-Singer-Jill-Zarin.kg_.072917.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia", "Debbie Reed", "Gia F."], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170926123851/http://www.allabouttrh.com/2017/07/31/jill-zarin-reconciles-ramona-singer-amid-husband-bobby-zarins-cancer-battle/", "title": "Jill Zarin Reconciles With Ramona Singer Amid Husband Bobby Zarin's Cancer Battle - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jill Zarin Reconciles With Ramona Singer Amid Husband Bobby Zarin's Cancer Battle - The Real Housewives | News.
