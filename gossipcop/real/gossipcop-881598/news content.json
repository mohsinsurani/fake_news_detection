Brown / Stringer\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) \u2014 A woman has come forward to say she was involved with Kevin Hart a month ago but she is not an extortionist.\n\nMontia Sabbag (mahn-tee-uh suh-bahg) spoke to reporters at her lawyer's Los Angeles office Wednesday following Hart's weekend apology to his pregnant wife and children via an Instagram video for what he called an error in judgment.\n\nHe also said someone was trying to seek financial gain from his mistake and he'd rather confess than let that happen.\n\nSabbag says that since her involvement with Hart, her name and pictures have become public and lies have been written about her.\n\nShe says she's a recording artist and actress, and hasn't broken any laws.\n\nSabbag also mentioned unspecified recordings but says she had nothing to do with them.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg",
