Jesse Williams and Minka Kelly are dating, a source confirms to PEOPLE. \u201cThey\u2019re having a good time together,\u201d adds the source of the pair, who are currently working on a video game together. The news comes three months after Grey\u2019s Anatomy star Williams officially split from wife Aryn Drake-Lee. Williams filed for divorce on April 11, according to documents obtained by PEOPLE. The actor first met Drake-Lee, a real estate broker, while working as a schoolteacher in New York. The pair wed in September 2012 after more than five years of dating. Williams and Drake-Lee are currently in court regarding the custody agreement over their two young children: daughter Sadie, 3, and son Maceo, who was born in 2015. Williams, 35, addressed the split \u2014 and rumors of infidelity \u2014 in JAY-Z\u2018s short film Footnotes for 4:44, a visual accompaniment to the rapper\u2019s new album, which was released Monday, according to E! News . Without mentioning his ex by name, the father of two subtly referenced the rumors and revealed how difficult the split was. \u201cI was in a relationship 13 years, 13 real years, not 5 years, not 7 years \u2014 13 years,\u201d he said. \u201cAll of a sudden motherf\u2014ers are writing think-pieces that I somehow threw a 13-year relationship.\u201d \u201cLike, the most painful experience I\u2019ve had in my life with a person I\u2019ve loved with all of my heart \u2014 that I threw a person and my family in the trash because a girl I work with is cute,\u201d he continued. Most recently, Kelly, 37, sparked romance rumors last fall after being spotted in Cabo San Lucas, Mexico, with Wilmer Valderrama, to whom she was briefly linked in 2012. Kelly, however, has maintained the two never actually dated in the past. \u201cHe\u2019s not my ex,\u201d she told Power 106 last September. \u201cWe are good friends, and we always have been. It\u2019s funny, this whole \u2018back with my ex\u2019 thing. We\u2019re not exes!\u201d \u201cIt sucks when stories that aren\u2019t true are made up, you know?\u201d she added. \u201cLook, if it\u2019s true and it\u2019s out, then it\u2019s true and it\u2019s out. When it\u2019s not true and it\u2019s out is when it\u2019s really frustrating. You just have to find the comedy in all of it.\u201d Ultimately, the actress acknowledged media scrutiny of her personal life is par for the course. \u201cI think it comes with the territory,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s a small price to pay for the extraordinary life that I live.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/rgb-TAG-Registered-80px.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1493215813/Jesse%20Williams_0-900x600.jpg", "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1493215813/Jesse Williams_0.jpg?width=400"], "top_img": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1493215813/Jesse%20Williams_0-900x600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/jesse-williams-minka-kelly-dating/", "title": "Jesse Williams and Minka Kelly Are Dating: 'They're Having a Good Time Together,' Says Source", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The actor has reportedly moved on.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jesse Williams and Minka Kelly Are Dating: 'They're Having a Good Time Together,' Says Source", "description": "Jesse Williams and Minka Kelly Are Dating: 'They're Having a Good Time Together,' Says Source", "url": "https://www.essence.com/celebrity/jesse-williams-minka-kelly-dating/", "site_name": "Essence", "image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1493215813/Jesse%20Williams_0-900x600.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/essence", "modified_time": "2020-10-26T17:35:14+00:00", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jesse Williams and Minka Kelly Are Dating: 'They're Having a Good Time Together,' Says Source", "image": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1493215813/Jesse Williams_0.jpg", "site": "@essence", "label1": "Est. reading time", "data1": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "fb": {"pages": 68771922854}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.essence.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/cropped-essence-fav-icon-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.essence.com", "summary": ""}
