Maybe even the greatest she's ever experienced.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a good relationship,\u201d the 48-year-old actress and singer told HOLA! USA magazine. \u201cI feel like I can say that for the first time \u2014 I don\u2019t know \u2014 maybe ever.\n\n\"And not that I didn\u2019t have great relationships, full of love and adventure,\" Lopez added, perhaps in case ex-husbands Ojani Noa, Cris Judd and Marc Anthony and former flames Ben Affleck and Casper Smart were reading. \"But this is the first relationship I\u2019ve been where I feel like we really make each other better.\"\n\nJ.Lo and Rodriguez, who's six years younger than the \"Shades of Blue\" star, made their all-important red carpet debut at the Met Gala in May, and she's been singing his praises ever since. When he turned 42 in July, she wished him a happy birthday on Instagram, describing him as \"the man who makes my heart skip a beat every time he walks in the room.\"\n\nWhile J.Lo has had her fair share of high-profile relationships over the years, this one just feels different to her.\n\n\"We complement each other, and there\u2019s really pure, true love,\" Lopez told HOLA! USA. \"Just wanting to support the other person and make them happy. So there\u2019s a different selflessness in the love that\u2019s beautiful and different. And healthy!\u201d", "images":
