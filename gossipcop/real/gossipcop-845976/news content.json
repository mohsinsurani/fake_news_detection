Thanks? pic.twitter.com/HkosKBoSjI \u2014 Mike Feldman (@feldmike) December 17, 2017\n\nThe TODAY anchor\u2019s 3-year-old daughter seems to be enjoying a toy drum she received, according to a photo tweeted out by Savannah\u2019s husband, Mike Feldman.\n\n\u201cWhen your sister buys your daughter the gift that will keep on giving. Thanks?\u201d he wrote with a photo that showed Vale, the drum around her neck, a drumstick in each hand and a smile on her face.\n\nAs many parents know, the toy drum might be small in size, but the noise it pounds into the brains of grown-ups is mighty.\n\nI suggested the drum for a gift. Why why why https://t.co/pXiECYF3ng \u2014 Savannah Guthrie (@SavannahGuthrie) December 18, 2017\n\nSavannah quickly fessed up to her part of the uproar.\n\n\u201cI suggested the drum for a gift. Why why why,\u201d she wrote, retweeting Feldman\u2019s post. (Looking to make a similar mistake? Vale's drum is $36 on Amazon.)\n\nVale appears to be enjoying a wonderful holiday seasons so far. In addition to getting a fun new toy, she recently got to visit one of her idols, Peppa Pig.\n\nThe face-to-snout meeting came when Peppa, a rockstar among the preschool bunch, paid a visit last week to TODAY's Studio 1A. Vale initially appeared stunned by her brush with fame, but began jumping up and down with excitement after the shock wore off.\n\nThese items were hand-picked by our editorial team because we love them - and we hope you do, too.
