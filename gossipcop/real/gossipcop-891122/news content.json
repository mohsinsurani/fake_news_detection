He and his twin Grayson had just attempted a series of tongue challenges\u2014like tying cherry stems into knots\u2014and agreed, on camera, that the loser would get the piercing. Of course, the brothers could have called it off. But they would have to answer to their legions of social-media followers (27 million across Instagram, Twitter, YouTube and Facebook). So in late September, the Dolans flew from L.A. to their home state of New Jersey, where piercing laws are less strict, to document Ethan\u2019s experience in all its graphic glory; the resulting YouTube clip has 2 million views and counting. It\u2019s these kinds of outlandish stunts\u2014coupled with their boyish charm and good looks\u2014that have catapulted the Dolans into social-media stardom. As they put it, \u201cWe don\u2019t like to limit ourselves to a certain category, such as \u2018content creators\u2019 or \u2018influencers,\u2019 because we like to do it all.\u201d Increasingly, the Dolans are popping up offline as well. Earlier this year, they embarked on a nationwide variety-show tour, which sold out in several cities; now they\u2019re regular correspondents on MTV\u2019s relaunched TRL. But these gigs, they insist, are not jobs: \u201cWe enjoy what we do too much to consider it work.\u201d \u2014Raisa Bruner", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png",
