But, she said that she hopes her fans will learn from her mistakes and not tolerate abuse.\n\nIn her post, she also alleged that the leaked tape was not the first time that Gilinsky had mistreated her \u2013 with the first incident coming a year ago.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t make the same mistakes I did, your safety is never worth it. No matter what, no one deserves to be treated that way,\u201d she wrote.\n\nGilinsky, 20, took to Twitter Sunday to acknowledge and apologize for his actions on a leaked tape in which he used \u201cterrible \u2026 unforgivable\u201d words about Beer.\n\n\u201cMany of you [have been] asking me \u2018Why would you stay with him if it happened last year!\u2019 \u201d Beer wrote. \u201cMy theory was, and as horrible as this is, is that if I left him, he\u2019d do it to the next girl. I tried to fix him.\u201d\n\nGilinsky\u2019s own statement spoke to the circumstances: \u201cIn no way do I stand behind who I was in that part of my life. But people change & learn from their mistakes. The clip you\u2019ve all heard is from last year. I was in a very dark place, & clearly had no control over my emotions.\u201d\n\nIn her post, Beer continued, \u201cWe have both grown and changed so much at this point and it has been an extremely difficult thing to relive / even go thru \u2026 and I hope ALL of my fans learn from my foolishness. If someone is mistreating you in ANY way please speak up.\u201d\n\nIn his statement, Gilinsky called the recorded episode \u201cone of our lowest points\u201d and said, \u201cMadison knew if she didn\u2019t help me overcome my ways and change, no one would, & I would never learn from my mistakes. I\u2019ll never be able to thank her enough for believing in me the way she did during that time.\u201d\n\nReps for Beer and Gilinsky did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for additional comment.", "images":
