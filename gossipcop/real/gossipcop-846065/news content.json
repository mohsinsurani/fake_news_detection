Every kid is up doing the proper stuff, but she\u2019s just doing her own thing,\u201d Tatum said of Everly\u2019s participation in dance class, admitting \u201cShe kinda came out that way\u201d more so than himself or ex Jenna Dewan instilling a sense of spunk in their daughter.\n\n\u201cI wish I could take credit for that, but I can\u2019t, really,\u201d said the proud dad. \u201cThat\u2019s really all her. I think kids come out a little bit of what they\u2019re going to be, and then you foster that to be whatever you hope her to be in the world. She always just does her own thing.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Ortega/Getty\n\nThe discussion came about because Tatum recently posted a photo of Everly as the only person throwing up the rock-and-roll hand signal in a large group of kids.\n\n\u201cSo my daughter giving the lone \ud83e\udd1f [sign] at her school assembly today just confirmed what I already knew. She cool AF!\u201d he captioned the shot. \u201cAnd that I will never even come close to how f-ing cool she is. I\u2019m proud and feeling some pangs of dad dork growing.\u201d\n\nAddressing the post with ET, the actor said, \u201cI think everybody would think that was cool. \u2026 I\u2019m just watching her, and she\u2019s in a lone group of kids, and it\u2019s how they say, \u2018Be quiet\u2019 at assembly, and she\u2019s just the lone one, just holding it up and just being solid about it. Real calm. And I was like, \u2018Solidarity.\u2019 \u201d\n\nChris Polk/KCA2018/Getty\n\nTatum has long been an advocate for his daughter embracing her true and complete self, regardless of what others may pressure her into being. In May 2017, he wrote an essay for Cosmopolitan praising Dewan, 37, and revealing how he wants Everly to dismiss \u201cpreconceived standards\u201d and instead focus on what makes her feel empowered.\n\n\u201cI tried to imagine the things I\u2019d want her to read that would help her understand men and sex and partnership better, and at that moment, I realized a strange thing,\u201d wrote the Magic Mike star.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want her looking to the outside world for answers. My highest hope for her is just that she has the fearlessness to always be her authentic self, no matter what she thinks men want her to be.\u201d\n\n\u201cI guess if there\u2019s one thing that I think men wish women knew, it\u2019s just that they alone are enough,\u201d added Tatum, who announced his split from Dewan in April after nine years of marriage. \u201cWhen more women start to truly feel this power in themselves, the world will become so magical, it makes my head hurt.\u201d", "images":
