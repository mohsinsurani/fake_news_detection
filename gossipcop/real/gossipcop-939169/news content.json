A Google search leaves the holiday\u2019s origins ambiguous but seems to at least source it to a year: 2009. So happy Seventh-Annual National Wine Day, everyone. Who are we to argue with such a fantastic idea? To put you in the mood to guzzle some grapes, here are 20 TV characters who know their way around a bottle. Let their hardy livers inspire you.\n\nTyrion Lannister\u2014Game of Thrones\n\nThe shortest member of the Lannister clan is, nonetheless, its most accomplished drinker. Ever since Tyrion made his first appearance in the pilot he\u2019s not been too far from a wine bottle, goblet, or skin.\n\nCersei Lannister\u2014Game of Thrones\n\nBut if anyone could give Tyrion a run for his money in the drinking department, it\u2019s his sister: Cersei. The thirst she developed when holed up during the Battle of the Blackwater in Season 2 has only increased in the intervening years. Maybe if she had been drinking less and scheming more, Season 5 wouldn\u2019t have gone quite so terribly for her.\n\nAlicia Florrick\u2014The Good Wife\n\nAlicia recently got in trouble with her neighbors for running a law office out of her swanky Chicago apartment. But if I shared a recycling bin with the Florrick household, I would have raised a few flags long before. But, as Alicia puts it, she doesn\u2019t need wine\u2014she likes wine. For the record, she likes tequila too.\n\nLindsay Jillian\u2014You\u2019re the Worst\n\nAny one of the four core characters on this show could have cropped up here but somehow I think Linds is the most inclined to prefer wine. It\u2019s classy, just like her. I\u2019ll see you all back here on National Trash Juice Day when we celebrate all things Vernon.\n\nRobin Scherbatsky\u2014How I Met Your Mother\n\nIt\u2019s possible now that she\u2019s found a happily ever after with Ted, Robin is less inclined to drink under a desk while weeping. Then again, when Ted gets out his red cowboy boots, we won\u2019t blame Robin for taking a deep swig, or 20.\n\nThe Cul-de-sac Crew\u2014Cougar Town\n\nIf you don\u2019t have a Big Carl or Big Joe to call your very own, then fill the closest vase with all the wine you have, make fun of your neighbors, play Penny Can, and fondly remember this late, great show.\n\nTami Taylor\u2014Friday Night Lights\n\nTruth be told, both Eric and Tami Taylor enjoyed unwinding with a glass of wine, but I decided to put Mrs. Coach on here because . . .\n\nAmy Schumer\u2014Inside Amy Schumer\n\n. . . Amy Schumer paid such a beautiful homage to Connie Britton\u2019s character in her sketch \u201cFootball Town Nights.\u201d Bleary eyes, full glass, can\u2019t lose.\n\nBernard Black\u2014Black Books\n\nI don\u2019t recommend trying Bernard Black\u2019s wine popsicle (or ice lolly if you\u2019re British) at home. Freezing a full, glass wine bottle sounds like a recipe for disaster. But if you can pull it off, more power to you, and may I suggest a nice ros\u00e9?\n\nLiz Lemon\u201430 Rock\n\nYou know what pairs well with Night Cheese? Treadmill wine. But if neither of those sounds good, you might want to try some of Liz Lemon\u2019s patented Funky Juice. Find the recipe here.\n\nHannibal Lecter\u2014Hannibal\n\nWhat good is an elegantly prepared meal without a nice Chianti to wash it down?\n\nCarrie Mathison\u2014Homeland\n\nI don\u2019t, however, recommend you wash down your meds with wine. But if you do, make sure you\u2019re ready to blow your life up completely and repeatedly.\n\nKathie Lee Gifford and Hoda Kotb\u2014The Today Show\n\nO.K., yes, Kathie Lee and Hoda aren\u2019t exactly characters, but, well, aren\u2019t they? Like Tami Taylor before her, Kathie Lee got her own loving send-up courtesy of *S.N.L.\u2019*s Kristen Wiig. Wiig\u2019s preferred accessory? A wine glass, of course.\n\nEdina Monsoon and Patsy Stone\u2014Absolutely Fabulous\n\nEddie and Patsy\u2014maybe the original Hoda and Kathie Lee?\u2014are back in the news today thanks to the teaser for their upcoming movie. As you might expect, the women have not changed their hard-drinking ways one bit. You wouldn\u2019t want it any other way, would you, sweetie darling?\n\nSkyler White\u2014Breaking Bad\n\nWhen things got especially rough in the White household, Skyler turned to some classic white-wine therapy to get her through tense dinners and even tenser nights. I\u2019d like to think that with a little bit of closure from Walt, Skyler is no longer hitting the bottle quite as hard. But she should go ahead and do whatever she needs to do to get through. She deserves it.\n\nOlivia Pope\u2014Scandal\n\nIf you decide to go full Olivia Pope today and drink red wine while wearing white, then I take my over-sized white hat off to you. You\u2019re a braver drinker than most of us.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/56c5fdf1c8a238ad659192ed/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/wine-tami-taylor.gif",
