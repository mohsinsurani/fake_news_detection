It's funny.\"\n\nAfter Newton's comments, the quarterback proceeded to answer Rodrigue's question.\n\nCarolina spokesman Steven Drummond said in a statement to The Associated Press that Newton had a conversation with Rodrigue after the news conference ended and expressed regret for his remarks.\n\nRodrigue released a statement through The Charlotte Observer via email saying that Newton did not apologize when they spoke after the news conference.\n\nShe said she \"was dismayed by his response, which not only belittled me but countless other women before me and beside me who work in similar jobs. I sought Mr. Newton out as he left the locker room a few minutes later. He did not apologize for his comments.\"\n\nNFL spokesman Brian McCarthy said Wednesday night in a statement that Newton's comments \"are just plain wrong and disrespectful to the exceptional female reporters and all journalists who cover our league. They do not reflect the thinking of the league.\"\n\nDrummond said the Panthers \"strive as a department to make the environment for media comfortable for everyone covering the team.\"", "images":
