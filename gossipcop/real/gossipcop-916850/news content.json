{"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/style/real-housewives-luann-de-lesseps-arrest-cabaret.html", "text": "On a recent Wednesday afternoon, Luann de Lesseps \u2014 or \u201cThe Countess,\u201d as she is known on Bravo\u2019s reality series \u201cThe Real Housewives of New York City\u201d \u2014 was trying something new: memorizing her lines.\n\n\u201cI am not a scripted actress \u2014 I\u2019m more of an off-the-cuff-type person,\u201d she said.\n\nStanding in front of a baby-grand piano in her bright Upper West Side penthouse, freezing rain tapping gently against the windows, Ms. de Lesseps studied a printout of her introductory remarks for #CountessAndFriends, a cabaret show that will debut at the Manhattan nightclub Feinstein\u2019s/54 Below on Feb. 27. As the Grammy-winning composer Billy Stritch played \u201cWith a Little Help From My Friends,\u201d she addressed an imaginary crowd, and the elephant in the room.\n\n\u201cI had a list of songs I wanted to sing tonight, but as it turns out I am reconsidering some of them \u2014 like \u2018Jailhouse Rock\u2019 and \u2018I Fought the Law and the Law Won,\u2019\u201d said Ms. de Lesseps, dressed in Lululemon pants, a black turtleneck and velvet slippers. \u201cCraaaazy,\u201d she crooned like an unhinged Patsy Cline, \u201cfor thinking I could get out of those handcuffs.\u201d\n\nMs. de Lesseps was alluding to an incident that took place several weeks earlier, on the evening of Dec. 23, when she tried to escape a patrol car after getting arrested for disorderly intoxication and assaulting a police officer at the Colony Hotel in Palm Beach, Fla. Afterward, her mug shot appeared in just about every tabloid in America. In January, she pleaded not guilty to one felony (resisting an officer with violence) and two misdemeanors (trespassing and disorderly intoxication). A hearing has been set for April 13.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/23/fashion/23ENCOUNTERS/23ENCOUNTERS-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/23/fashion/23ENCOUNTERS/23ENCOUNTERS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fa5959070ccc5f4ed81ae861cfd96b38b500489cd2906c9eac1e9d5d36ce963f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/23/fashion/23ENCOUNTERS/23ENCOUNTERS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fa5959070ccc5f4ed81ae861cfd96b38b500489cd2906c9eac1e9d5d36ce963f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Dodes"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/style/real-housewives-luann-de-lesseps-arrest-cabaret.html", "title": "The Show Goes On for Arrested \u2018Housewife\u2019 Luann de Lesseps", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "After an incident in Palm Beach, Fla., the countess is working on her sobriety, revising her cabaret show and preparing for a likely Season 10 on Bravo.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/style/real-housewives-luann-de-lesseps-arrest-cabaret.html", "type": "article", "title": "The Show Goes On for Arrested \u2018Housewife\u2019 Luann de Lesseps (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/23/fashion/23ENCOUNTERS/23ENCOUNTERS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fa5959070ccc5f4ed81ae861cfd96b38b500489cd2906c9eac1e9d5d36ce963f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Luann de Lesseps in her penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side."}, "description": "After an incident in Palm Beach, Fla., the countess is working on her sobriety, revising her cabaret show and preparing for a likely Season 10 on Bravo."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/style/real-housewives-luann-de-lesseps-arrest-cabaret.html", "title": "The Show Goes On for Arrested \u2018Housewife\u2019 Luann de Lesseps (Published 2018)", "description": "After an incident in Palm Beach, Fla., the countess is working on her sobriety, revising her cabaret show and preparing for a likely Season 10 on Bravo.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/23/fashion/23ENCOUNTERS/23ENCOUNTERS-videoSixteenByNine3000.jpg?year=2018&h=1688&w=3000&s=55b8e629714990eac48bd21ea9da3073b24752d65a084f2833b081ae244f1a17&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Luann de Lesseps in her penthouse apartment on the Upper West Side."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/c2597072-f5c1-5583-a422-17ce8fe168bd"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-23T17:38:53.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-23T22:17:35.000Z", "section": "Style", "tag": "Music", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005758270, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/c2597072-f5c1-5583-a422-17ce8fe168bd", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/b8ee41fe05c847d18a38da390676e3e2", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/02/23/fashion/23ENCOUNTERS/23ENCOUNTERS-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=fa5959070ccc5f4ed81ae861cfd96b38b500489cd2906c9eac1e9d5d36ce963f&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Rachel Dodes", "news_keywords": "LuAnn de Lesseps,Feinstein's/54 Below,The Real Housewives of New York,Reality television,Music", "pdate": 20180223, "CG": "style", "CN": "encounters", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/style/real-housewives-luann-de-lesseps-arrest-cabaret.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/c2597072-f5c1-5583-a422-17ce8fe168bd", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/style/real-housewives-luann-de-lesseps-arrest-cabaret.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/23/style/real-housewives-luann-de-lesseps-arrest-cabaret.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519344000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
