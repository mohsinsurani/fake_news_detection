She lost her sister, Rona Newton-John, to brain cancer in 2013.\n\nEarlier this month, Newton-John checked in again with fans on Facebook to let them know she was \"grateful\" to them and \"feeling good.\"\n\nWrote the star, \"I am totally confident that my new journey will have a positive success story to inspire others!\"", "images":
