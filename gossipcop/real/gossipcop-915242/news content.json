I don\u2019t really know where to get started on this \u2018Jennifer Lawrence wearing a revealing dress in the cold\u2019 controversy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThis is not only utterly ridiculous, I am extremely offended. That Versace dress was fabulous, you think I\u2019m going to cover that gorgeous dress up with a coat and a scarf? I was outside for five minutes. I would have stood in the snow for that dress because I love fashion and that was my choice.\u201d\n\nAn article in Jezebel had the headline, Please Give Jennifer Lawrence a Dang Coat, showing the actor\u2019s co-stars, Joel Edgerton and Jeremy Irons among them, wearing large coats and scarves.\n\nThe Red Sparrow photocall in London.

One tweet that called it \u201cquietly depressing and revealing\u201d received over 12,000 likes.\n\n\u201cThis is sexist, this is ridiculous, this is not feminism,\u201d she wrote. \u201cOverreacting about everything someone says or does, creating controversy over silly innocuous things such as what I choose to wear or not wear, is not moving us forward. It\u2019s creating silly distractions from real issues. Get a grip people. Everything you see me wear is my choice. And if I want to be cold THAT\u2019S MY CHOICE TOO!\u201d\n\nThe event in question took place at London\u2019s Corinthia Hotel during a photocall for Red Sparrow, the espionage thriller in which Lawrence plays a prima ballerina turned Soviet spy who seduces men in order to gain intelligence from them.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9360ddf407c3e5021a969068d8bd9c84b451fe4a/385_363_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9360ddf407c3e5021a969068d8bd9c84b451fe4a/385_363_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8db797c1ab11006071d110b6907ba16d", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Jennifer+Lawrence%2CFilm%2CCulture%2CFashion%2CVersace", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ed804ce80c7ca2e3d5257e81113d011bfb7b4cb2/172_523_2493_1495/master/2493.jpg?width=445&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9360ddf407c3e5021a969068d8bd9c84b451fe4a/385_363_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8db797c1ab11006071d110b6907ba16d", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jake Nevins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/21/jennifer-lawrence-dress-response-red-sparrow-photos", "title": "Jennifer Lawrence responds to 'sexist' dress criticism: 'It was my choice'", "meta_data": {"description": "The actor criticized media outlets for \u2018ridiculous\u2019 comments about an outfit she wore during the press tour for her latest film", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/21/jennifer-lawrence-dress-response-red-sparrow-photos", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9360ddf407c3e5021a969068d8bd9c84b451fe4a/385_363_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8db797c1ab11006071d110b6907ba16d", "height": 720}, "title": "Jennifer Lawrence responds to 'sexist' dress criticism: 'It was my choice'", "description": "The actor criticized media outlets for \u2018ridiculous\u2019 comments about an outfit she wore during the press tour for her latest film", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jake-nevins", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-07-02T13:50:07.000Z", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2018-02-21T16:45:12.000Z", "tag": "Jennifer Lawrence,Film,Culture,Fashion,Versace"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2018/feb/21/jennifer-lawrence-dress-response-red-sparrow-photos?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/feb/21/jennifer-lawrence-dress-response-red-sparrow-photos", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2018/feb/21/jennifer-lawrence-dress-response-red-sparrow-photos?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2018/feb/21/jennifer-lawrence-dress-response-red-sparrow-photos?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jhnevins", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/9360ddf407c3e5021a969068d8bd9c84b451fe4a/385_363_2321_1393/master/2321.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=6fbb16e11ac5f1cb5033dd0c11e28236", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519171200.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
