After all, she\u2019s played princesses on two Shonda Rhimes shows. But, like her characters\u2019 roads to the throne, Rahimi\u2014who currently stars in her second princess role on Rhimes\u2019s latest series, \u201cStill Star-Crossed\u201d\u2014didn\u2019t face an easy path to success.\n\nAs a first-generation Iranian American, Rahimi was bullied for her textured brown hair and light-red freckles, which are natural Iranian traits passed down from her mother and grandmother. And though they\u2019ve become Rahimi\u2019s most complimented features (just take a look at her Instagram), they were also the source of her darkest insecurities growing up. \u201cIt\u2019s made me stronger as a person,\u201d she says. \u201cI feel like if people can just wait out adolescence, it does get so much better.\u201d\n\n\u201c If people can just wait out adolescence, it does get so much better. \u201d\n\nRaised by two Iranian immigrants who fled Iran in the \u201970s to escape a dictatorship, Rahimi spent her childhood crammed into a one-bedroom apartment in the San Fernando Valley with her parents and older brother. While her parents steadily worked their way up\u2014her dad as a dentist; her mom as an attorney\u2014Rahimi\u2019s struggles continued in school.\n\n\u201cI had buck teeth, frizzy hair, freckles, and a retainer,\u201d Rahimi says. \u201cPeople called me Hermione sometimes, which I loved because I thought she was brave, but they meant it in sort of a mean way.\u201d Along with calling her \u201cmetal mouth,\u201d Rahimi\u2019s classmates would make fun of her hair and say her freckles were a sign of disease. \u201cIt\u2019s part of the reason why I\u2019m so quiet,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s something I\u2019ve learned to embrace, but it was definitely hard.\u201d\n\nAs a result of the bullying, Rahimi withdrew into herself and made efforts to change her appearance. To hide her hair texture, she braided her hair every day before graduating to a straightener. She even tried shaving parts of her head and dabbled in keratin treatment. When she started using makeup, she did her best to mask her freckles.\n\nRahimi slowly started regaining her confidence at age 12, when she starred as Cha-Cha DiGregorio in a seventh-grade production of Grease\u2014a role she auditioned for on a whim that sparked her passion for acting. \u201cIt was a place where I could have a voice,\u201d Rahimi says. \u201cI was such a quiet kid that performing became a time when people would listen to me.\u201d\n\n\u201c Performing became a time when people would listen to me. \u201d\n\nAfter a push from a high school drama teacher, Rahimi went on to study theatre at the University of California, Los Angeles before finding an agent and nabbing small parts in the indie world. But she still felt plagued by the insecurities she faced growing up. \u201cI would go to auditions with a full face of makeup and straightened hair, thinking that that\u2019s what people were looking for,\u201d she says.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t until about four years ago, when Rahimi was 21 and dating a man who was raised with a different view of beauty, that her own perspective started to shift. \u201cHe grew up in Paris and women there don\u2019t really wear makeup. They are a little bit naturale,\u201d says Rahimi. \u201cHe told me to just embrace my natural hair.\u201d\n\nAs a result, Rahimi grew out her natural hair, which was cut short and slightly damaged from the keratin, and toned down her makeup drastically. \u201cI started getting so many nice compliments from women who had incredible hair who were like, \u2018I want your hair,\u2019\u201d she says. \u201cYou\u2019re telling me you want my hair? It was crazy. I noticed as soon as I stopped doing that was when I really started to book roles, too.\u201d\n\nSoon after, Rahimi scored her big break on Rhimes\u2019s comedy crime-drama show, \u201cThe Catch,\u201d playing Princess Zara Al-Salim, a headstrong modern-day Arabian princess. Though the part only lasted three episodes, Rahimi caught Rhimes\u2019s eye, who cast her as a series regular in \u201cStill Star-Crossed,\u201d a multi-ethnic take on Shakespeare\u2019s Romeo and Juliet. In it, Rahimi stars as Princess Isabella, one of five leads of color.\n\nThough the show has faced backlash for straying from the original Romeo and Juliet, Rahimi isn\u2019t concerned about the criticism. \u201cIt\u2019s historical fiction, not a historical drama. It doesn\u2019t need to make sense,\u201d she says. \u201cThat\u2019s what TV and film is all about\u2014to just put you into a world. [The show] looks more like the world we live in. You don\u2019t go somewhere and just see all one type of person anymore.\u201d\n\nShe appreciates that Rhimes doesn\u2019t play into Hollywood white-washing, something Rahimi\u2019s accustomed to after hearing time and again that casting directors \u201cdecided to go a different direction\u201d\u2014a code, she explained, that usually means choosing the blonde, white girl.\n\n\u201cI always loved that Shonda\u2019s shows are so colorful and multiracial,\u201d says Rahimi. \u201cI\u2019ve seen a white woman with brown hair and brown eyes and maybe a bit of a tan play Hispanic or Middle Eastern and put on an accent. I really think [casting directors] should give those opportunities to someone who comes from that culture because they carry it inside of them.\u201d\n\n\u201c You don\u2019t go somewhere and just see all one type of person anymore. \u201d\n\nRacial diversity isn\u2019t the only thing Rahimi praises \u201cStill Star-Crossed\u201d for. After regularly playing \u201cditzy party girls\u201d and \u201cwomen manufactured by men for men,\u201d she says it\u2019s refreshing to play a complicated, hyper-intelligent princess who, in some ways, is more fit to rule than her brother\u2014but is forced to sit on the sidelines because she\u2019s a woman. Rahimi sees plenty of parallels between the sexism in the show and America in 2017.\n\n\u201cThe U.S. could\u2019ve had a woman in power after our last election,\u201d she says. \u201cMaybe [Hillary Clinton] wasn\u2019t the best option, but she was better than the current option. There was a lot of prejudice because she was a woman. That relates fully to the show. Even though it\u2019s set in the 1700s, it\u2019s still prevalent today and definitely an issue.\u201d\n\nAs the daughter of Iranian immigrants, Rahimi feels particularly fired-up about the Trump Administration, especially after the recent travel ban against six Muslim-majority countries, including Iran. \u201cThe U.S. was built on immigrants and [the ban] is insane to me,\u201d Rahimi says. \u201cI think a lot of people are upset, even the people whose beliefs were in line with the Republican party and the conservatives. This is more than that; it\u2019s about humanity.\u201d\n\nRahimi is using her voice as an Iranian-American actress to combat the bill by making phone calls, sending letters, and attending town hall meetings. On a less political level, Rahimi\u2013who dreams of diversifying the beauty industry away from \u201cEuropean Anglo-American-looking girls\u201d\u2014is passionate about reshaping the way all young girls, not just those of Middle Eastern descent, see themselves while growing up.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m happy with who I am. I think a princess has to be confident,\u201d Rahimi says. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to just be who you are. It\u2019s good to embrace our differences. We shouldn\u2019t all look the same. This world would be so boring.\u201d", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rachel-Aven-The-Bachelorette.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/medalionrahimilioneldeluy_img4816.jpg?w=670", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/medalion-rahimi-still-star-crossed-2.jpg?w=670", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/queen-elizabeth-ii-1.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/jeffrey-dahmer.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=146467699155455&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/medalion-rahimi-feat.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/medalion-rahimi-still-star-crossed.jpg?w=670", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-Square.jpg?resize=%2C", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/lioneldeluymedalionrahimi2.jpg?w=670", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/king-charles-prince-harry-meghan-markle.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jeffrey-Dahmer-2.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/medalion-rahimi-feat.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/medalion-rahimi-still-star-crossed/", "title": "How Medalion Rahimi Overcame Bullying to Become Shondaland\u2019s Next Muse", "meta_data": {"description": "Iranian-American actress Medalion Rahimi talks 'Still Star-Crossed,' diversity in Hollywood, natural beauty, and Donald Trump's Muslim ban.", "keywords": "medalion rahimi, still star-crossed, diversity, beauty, donald trump, muslim, ban, iran", "msvalidate.01": "7A34A1C1904BAFB83691E8B3718CA9A2", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/stylecaster", "published_time": "2017-07-28T20:00:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-04T16:12:33+00:00", "author": "Jason Pham", "section": "Entertainment", "tag": "Shonda Rhimes"}, "google-site-verification": "yB_5UwT5pPNnn93Mba5HIaFkNtbrafDQWP_Rj34Iw08", "news_keywords": "diversity, Shonda Rhimes", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Jason Pham", "theme-color": "#fff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "StyleCaster", "application-name": "StyleCaster", "og": {"site_name": "StyleCaster", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://stylecaster.com/medalion-rahimi-still-star-crossed/", "title": "How Medalion Rahimi Overcame Bullying to Become Shondaland\u2019s Next Muse", "description": "The Iranian-American actress talks natural beauty, diversity in Hollywood, and Trump\u2019s Muslim ban.", "image": {"identifier": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/medalion-rahimi-feat.jpg", "width": 960, "height": 540}}, "fb": {"app_id": 134683123322801, "pages": 48566051011, "article_style": "scdefault"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@stylecaster", "creator": "@stylecaster", "title": "How Medalion Rahimi Overcame Bullying to Become Shondaland\u2019s Next Muse", "description": "The Iranian-American actress talks natural beauty, diversity in Hollywood, and Trump\u2019s Muslim ban.", "image": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/medalion-rahimi-feat.jpg", "account_id": 55678606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501272049.0, "source": "https://stylecaster.com", "summary": ""}
