She met her current boyfriend, Andrew Glennon, while filming Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition with Baier during summer 2017.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t have a relationship with him,\u201d Portwood added. \u201cI don\u2019t really acknowledge that past and my future is so much brighter and better.\u201d\n\nSpeaking of her future, the MTV star, who welcomed James with Glennon on May 8, told Us that she is excited to see her son and 9-year-old daughter, Leah, whom she shares with her ex-fianc\u00e9 Gary Shirley, grow up together.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just really excited to see you know, my kids grow up and just live a life differently than what I did,\u201d she told Us. \u201cI grew up really poor and it was really hard times and I just want to stop the cycle and I think I\u2019m doing a pretty good job of that now with my baby, so I\u2019m just excited for the future.\u201d\n\nAs for her relationship with Glennon, Portwood told Us that the new parents are enjoying date nights at home.\n\n\u201cWe both kind of cooked dinner together and we just put James in like the little corner next to the table with us in a swing and we just had like a glass of wine and had some dinner,\u201d she explained. \u201cThat was our little date night and we were happy and cuddled afterwards. Those are just the things that we have to do right now until he gets older and we\u2019re perfectly fine with it.\u201d\n\nFor more on Portwood\u2019s life as a mother of two, pick up the new issue of Us Weekly on newsstands now!\n\nReporting by Carly Sloane", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Matt-Baier-amber-portwood.jpg?crop=0px%2C23px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Matt-Baier-amber-portwood.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Matt-Baier-amber-portwood.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-reveals-matt-baier-congratulated-her-after-sons-birth/", "title": "Amber Portwood Reveals Matt Baier Congratulated Her After Son\u2019s Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Exclusive,teen mom og", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "\u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 star Amber Portwood told Us Weekly exclusively that her ex-fiance Matt Baier congratulated her after she welcomed her newborn son, James \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Amber Portwood Reveals Matt Baier Congratulated Her After Son\u2019s Birth", "description": "\u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 star Amber Portwood told Us Weekly exclusively that her ex-fiance Matt Baier congratulated her after she welcomed her newborn son, James \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amber-portwood-reveals-matt-baier-congratulated-her-after-sons-birth/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-29T19:59:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Matt-Baier-amber-portwood.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Matt-Baier-amber-portwood.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-29T23:00:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-29T19:59:41+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Amber Portwood Reveals Matt Baier Congratulated Her After Son\u2019s Birth", "description": "\u2018Teen Mom OG\u2019 star Amber Portwood told Us Weekly exclusively that her ex-fiance Matt Baier congratulated her after she welcomed her newborn son, James \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Matt-Baier-amber-portwood.jpg?crop=0px%2C35px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1530313242.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
