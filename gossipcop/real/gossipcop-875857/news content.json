The timing, certainly, is interesting, since Perry only just released the video for her own alleged Swift diss track \"Swish Swish\".\n\nLess than an hour after \"Look What You Made Me Do\" dropped, Nicki Minaj tweeted the simple message: \"N**** sit down. Be humble.\"\n\nSwift, of course, wasn't named in the subtle shade and the tweet is a possible reference to Kendrick Lamar's \"HUMBLE\", but Minaj's intention seems pretty clear - the Twitter users immediately replying with GIFs of an offended looking Swift, certainly, seemed set on their interpretation.\n\n\n\nSwift and Minaj have their own history, with the latter having expressed frustration in 2015 that her wildly popular video for \"Anaconda\" didn't receive a nomination for Video of the Year at the MTV Video Music Awards, writing, \"If your video celebrates women with very slim bodies, you will be nominated for vid of the year.\"\n\nSwift, again, wasn't directly named in Minaj's post, though she replied with: \"I've done nothing but love & support you. It's unlike you to pit women against each other. Maybe one of the men took your slot.\"\n\n\n\nThe pair did seem to make amends, performing together at the VMAs; that said, Minaj did just feature on Perry's \"Swish Swish\".\n\nSwift wiped clean her social media pages last week, before building up hype for her new album Reputation through a series of video snippets of snakes.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clarisse Loughrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-look-what-you-made-me-do-be-humble-reputation-album-release-date-single-a7912216.html", "title": "Look What You Made Me Do: Nicki Minaj tweets 'be humble' after Taylor Swift drops new single", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Swift's latest release has been the centre of intense discussion as to who the song might be directed toward", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-08-25T11:13:57.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Nicki Minaj tweeted a subtle message to Taylor Swift about her new single", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj-look-what-you-made-me-do-be-humble-reputation-album-release-date-single-a7912216.html", "type": "article", "description": "Swift's latest release has been the centre of intense discussion as to who the song might be directed toward", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-25T11:13:57.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-25T11:13:57.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 435, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-08-25T11:13:57.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "Nicki Minaj tweeted a subtle message to Taylor Swift about her new single", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Swift's latest release has been the centre of intense discussion as to who the song might be directed toward", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/25/10/taylor-swift-nicki-minaj.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Taylor Swift,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503659637.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
