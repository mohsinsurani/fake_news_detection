The Internet went crazy after behind-the-scenes footage of Watson and Dan Stevens\u2019 scenes from the movie Beauty and the Beast got leaked.\n\nThese scenes quickly became memes as we expected and they show Belle in her iconic yellow ball dress being escorted to her romantic night in the castle by a very strange-looking beast.\n\nBy strange we mean that Stevens was decked out in a bulbous motion-capture Lycra suit along with stilt-type contraptions in his feet!\n\nDressed like that, he was solemn while attempting to walk down the castle stairs. It\u2019s just hilarious!\n\nHow about we call the movie Beauty and the Puffy Guy, instead?\n\nThis doesn\u2019t look like any other fairy tale anyone\u2019s ever seen before, trust us!\n\nIn a behind-the-scene interview, filmmakers explained that for making Stevens image as beastly as possible, his suit was decked out with stilts and also with some extra padding which to us looks more like a crash-test dummy than an adorable yet feared Beastly creature.\n\nBest thing ever! I now want to watch the whole movie with @thatdanstevens just in the ugly suit. Love this movie more and more daily. pic.twitter.com/oXKQgZ077b \u2014 Harlee (@albionscastle) May 24, 2017\n\nStevens explained, \u201cPuppeteering the suit to the motion capture was an ordeal for my calf muscles alone, let alone the whole body, just to kind of manipulate it.\u201d\n\nThe movie\u2019s director, Bill Condon, praised him for his amazing performance and hard work. He said that \u201cI really stood in awe of Dan.\u201d\n\n\u201cNot only did he conquer the technology, but he had fun with it. I always said, we could get everything else in this movie right, but if we didn\u2019t get a beast that people believed in, then it wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Condon continued.\n\nAnd it\u2019s pretty obvious that it worked. The adaptation of the animated Disney classic topped the $900 million mark at the worldwide box office in its very first month.\n\nIn April, it surpasses the $1 billion box office mark and this is quite an amazing thing.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDisney\u2019s animated classic takes on a new fresh form with a widened mythology in the movie. A young price in the form of a beast which can be freed only by true love meets Belle who is the only human girl to ever visit his castle since it was enchanted. And from here, you\u2019ll just have to chek the story out for yourselves!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Emma-Watson-Accepting-Her-Award-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Get-A-Glimpse-Of-Dan-Stevens-Before-CGI-And-Youll-Never-Look-At-The-Beauty-And-The-Beast-The-Same-Way.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Rob-Kardashian-Blac-Chyna-Tyga-Back-Together-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Emma-Watson-Tom-Hanks-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/phaedra-parks-4-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Tiny-Divorce-T.I.-Distraction-300x179.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/Emma-Waston--700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Ben-Stiller-and-Christine-Taylor-300x160.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bernice-Burgos-T.I.-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x190.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Bernice-Burgos-And-Tameka-Tiny-Cottle-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/brad-pitt-chris-cornell-300x222.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Get-A-Glimpse-Of-Dan-Stevens-Before-CGI-And-Youll-Never-Look-At-The-Beauty-And-The-Beast-The-Same-Way.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170527131856/http://celebrityinsider.org/get-a-glimpse-of-dan-stevens-before-cgi-and-youll-never-look-at-the-beauty-and-the-beast-the-same-way-40247/", "title": "Get A Glimpse Of Dan Stevens Before CGI, And You\u2019ll Never Look At \u2018The Beauty And The Beast\u2019 The Same Way", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "Dan Stevens, emma watson, The Beauty and the Beast,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Dan Stevens, emma watson, The Beauty and the Beast,", "description": "We keep wondering - how did Emma Watson manage to keep a straight face?
