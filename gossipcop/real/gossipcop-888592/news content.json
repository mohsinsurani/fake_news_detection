In addition to an impressive line-up of performers, including Lyle Lovett, Sam Moore, Cassadee Pope and more, the event had a group of special attendees: real-live former U.S. presidents. All of them.\n\nJimmy Carter, George Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama attended the concert, and Lady Gaga, who made a surprise appearance, couldn't resist the photo op. The \"Joanne\" singer posed alongside the former presidents, and she tweeted out the epic picture, writing that there's \"Nothing more beautiful than everyone putting their differences aside to help humanity in the face of catastrophe.\"\n\nNothing more beautiful than everyone putting their differences aside to help humanity in the face of catastrophe. #OneAmericaAppeal pic.twitter.com/2TPdPonvWv \u2014 xoxo, Gaga (@ladygaga) October 22, 2017\n\nFor her performance, Gaga wore a beautifully tailored white pantsuit and silver statement earrings, and she opted for a glamorous blonde bob.\n\nIt really is wonderful to see the country come together to support its citizens!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/10/102217-ladygaga.jpg?itok=DyVx3Ga-", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/10/102217-ladygaga.jpg?itok=mKzGVS6l", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/10/102217-ladygaga.jpg?itok=DyVx3Ga-", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171022210443/http://www.instyle.com/news/lady-gaga-presidents-hurricane-relief-concert-photo", "title": "Lady Gaga Poses With All the Ex-Presidents at Hurricane Relief Concert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Celebrity,Charity,Music,George W.
