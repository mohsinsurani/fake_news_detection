This time he took aim at \u201cAlex\u201d Baldwin\u2019s impression of him.\n\nIn a since deleted tweet, Trump remarked, \u201cAlex Baldwin, whose dieing mediocre career was saved by his impersonation of me on SNL, now says playing DJT was agony for him. Alex, it was also agony for those who were forced to watch. You were terrible. Bring back Darrell Hammond, much funnier and a far greater talent!\u201d\n\nTrump deleted the tweet and later reposted the comment, correcting Alex Baldwin to Alec Baldwin and cleaning up his \u201cdieing\u201d error to \u201cdying.\u201d\n\nBaldwin, Alec not Alex, responded through his foundation\u2019s Twitter account with a grim prediction of the President\u2019s future writing, \u201cAgony though it may be, I\u2019d like to hang in there for the impeachment hearings, the resignation speech, the farewell helicopter ride to Mara-A-Lago. You know. The Good Stuff. That we\u2019ve all been waiting for.\u201d Baldwin added in another Twitter response that the President should ask First Lady Melania Trump to stop asking for Saturday Night Live tickets\n\nBaldwin began regularly delivering his impression of Trump on Saturday Night Live in 2016, taking over for announcer Hammond during the premiere of the show\u2019s 42nd season with a cold open skit about the first presidential debate.\n\nTrump previously called the show \u201cunwatchable\u201d saying Baldwin\u2019s impersonation \u201cjust can\u2019t get any worse.\u201d\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-history-movies-01.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-snl-baldwin-twitter.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-alex-alec-baldwin-tweet.png?w=635", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ryan-seacrest.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/donald-trump-snl-baldwin-twitter.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Marie Segarra"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5182486/alec-baldwin-twitter-response-trump/", "title": "Alec Baldwin Responds to Donald Trump on Twitter", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Trump is no stranger to playing television critic for Saturday Night Live.
