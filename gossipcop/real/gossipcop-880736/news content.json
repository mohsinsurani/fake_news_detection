Alas, there was no recognition for the show that Rae adapted from her \u201cAwkward Black Girl\u201d web series.\n\n\u201cI get it,\u201d she told The Wrap. \u201cThere\u2019s just so much good, good TV out there. The fact that we were being considered in the first place, it was already like, \u2018This is dope.'\u201d\n\nAlso Read: What Is HBO's Next Breakout Comedy Hit?\n\n\u201cAll I could think was how dope it would have been and how great it would have been for the exposure of the show because I feel like more and more people are slowly becoming aware about our show,\u201d the creator, showrunner and star of \u201cInsecure\u201d continued. \u201cAnd then when you get nominated for an Emmy, obviously more people pay attention \u2014 it sort of fast-tracks it. So for that alone, I was bummed.\u201d\n\nRae pointed out that the lack of Emmys attention \u201cmotivates us all to work harder.\u201d She added that the show\u2019s team is \u201cvery, very proud of the work that we\u2019re doing and stand behind it. So we\u2019ll just see what happens next year.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Silicon Valley' Star TJ Miller on Why He's Thankful for His 'Curtain Call'\n\nThere\u2019s no question that TV has made definite strides in becoming more diverse over the years. However, it\u2019s notable that none of the 14 series nominated for best comedy or best drama features a solo female showrunner or creator.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s not a big pool,\u201d Rae said about this statistic. \u201cThis is something that just started happening in the last couple of years, where you have shows led by women. So it feels like the television academy just needs to catch up.\u201d\n\n\u201cInsecure\u201d launches Season 2 on Sunday at 10:30 p.m. ET on HBO.", "images":
