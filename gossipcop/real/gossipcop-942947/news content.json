In her 17-minute address, the 38-year-old, who graduated from the Ivy League institution in 2001, shared practical advice \u2014 buy a toilet plunger before you need one \u2014 and opened up about life as a single mother.\n\nThe Mindy Project creator and star welcomed her daughter, Katherine Kaling, on December 15. She honored her late mom, Dr. Swati Roysircar, by choosing the middle name Swati for her first child. Kaling has not revealed the identity of the infant\u2019s father.\n\n\u201cAfter my daughter was born in December, I remember bringing her home and being in my house with her for the first time and thinking, \u2018Huh. According to movies and TV, this is traditionally the time when my mother and spouse are supposed to be here, sharing this experience with me,\u2019\u201d Kaling told the crowd. \u201cAnd I looked around, and I had neither. And for a moment, it was kind of scary. Like, \u2018Can I do this by myself?\u2019\u201d\n\nThe brief moment of panic quickly passed. \u201cThat feeling went away, because the reality is, I\u2019m not doing it by myself,\u201d Kaling shared. \u201cI\u2019m surrounded by family and friends who love and support me. And the joy I feel from being with my daughter Katherine eclipses anything from any crazy checklist.\u201d\n\nThe Oceans 8 actress urged graduates to not \u201cbe scared\u201d if they \u201cdon\u2019t do things in the right order\u201d and to remember that life takes unexpected twists.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have a child before I got married, but hey, it turned out that way, and I wouldn\u2019t change a thing,\u201d she said. \u201cI didn\u2019t think I\u2019d have dessert before breakfast today, but hey, it turned out that way and I I wouldn\u2019t change a thing.\u201d\n\nKaling, who starred alongside Reese Witherspoon in A Wrinkle in Time, also shared wisdom on self-confidence. \u201cI was not someone who should have the life I have now, and yet I do,\u201d she revealed. \u201cI was sitting in the chair you are literally sitting in right now and I Just whispered, \u2018Why not me?\u2019 and I kept whispering it for 17 years; and here I am, someone that this school deemed worthy enough to speak to you at your Commencement.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you that you can\u2019t do something, but especially not yourself. Go conquer the world. Just remember this: Why not you? You\u2019ve made it this far.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mindy-kaling-dartmouth.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mindy-kaling-dartmouth.jpg?crop=543px%2C14px%2C1432px%2C752px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mindy-kaling-dartmouth.jpg?crop=543px%2C14px%2C1432px%2C752px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mindy-kaling-talks-being-a-single-mom-in-dartmouth-commencement-speech/", "title": "Mindy Kaling Talks Being a Single Mom in Dartmouth Commencement Speech", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Mindy Kaling opened up about life as a single mom to daughter, Katherine, in her commencement speech at Dartmouth College on Sunday, June 10 \u2014 find out what she said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mindy Kaling Gets Real About Life as a Single Mom in Commencement Speech", "description": "Mindy Kaling opened up about life as a single mom to daughter, Katherine, in her commencement speech at Dartmouth College on Sunday, June 10 \u2014 find out what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mindy-kaling-talks-being-a-single-mom-in-dartmouth-commencement-speech/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-11T13:25:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mindy-kaling-dartmouth.jpg?crop=543px%2C14px%2C1432px%2C752px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mindy-kaling-dartmouth.jpg?crop=543px%2C14px%2C1432px%2C752px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-11T13:25:13+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mindy Kaling Gets Real About Life as a Single Mom in Commencement Speech", "description": "Mindy Kaling opened up about life as a single mom to daughter, Katherine, in her commencement speech at Dartmouth College on Sunday, June 10 \u2014 find out what she said", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/mindy-kaling-dartmouth.jpg?crop=543px%2C14px%2C1432px%2C752px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@rachelpaula", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528723513.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
