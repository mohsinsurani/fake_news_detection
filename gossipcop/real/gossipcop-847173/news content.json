Someone pushed him onto the sidewalk and into girlfriend Gigi Hadid\u2019s apartment building.\n\nMalik, 24, wore a black Cartoon Network t-shirt and light-color ripped jeans. His left pant leg was rolled up to show his injured foot, which was covered in a white and blue sock.\n\n\u201cZayn injured his foot but is fine,\u201d a rep for the star told Page Six but would not elaborate on further details.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear if he plans to attend this year\u2019s Met Gala slated for Monday, May 1.\n\nLast year, he and Hadid, 22, wore matching metal-esque ensembles to the swanky party. Hadid\u2019s gown was designed by Tommy Hilfiger, while Malik wore a Versace tuxedo with metal-plated sleeves.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/zayn-foot.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/zayn-foot.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/zayn-foot.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/04/30/zayn-malik-uses-wheelchair-after-foot-injury/", "title": "Zayn Malik uses wheelchair after foot injury", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
