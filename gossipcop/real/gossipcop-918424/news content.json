On Monday night the actress tweeted, \u201cFake tattoo proofreading position available. Experience with apostrophes a must.\u201d\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe original story continues below.\n\nIf anyone had any doubts about Emma Watson\u2019s commitment to the Time\u2019s Up movement, behold her new ink. Watson debuted a tattoo on her inner arm at Monday Night\u2019s Vanity Fair Oscar party, \u201cTimes Up\u201d written in a large, cursive script.\n\nIt\u2019s unclear whether this new addition is permanent or not (though Twitter seems to have agreed that it\u2019s temporary, but there is one little grammatical problem she may want to go back and fix if so. The \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d written on her arm is missing its very crucial apostrophe. Fortunately, it\u2019s much easier to go back and add ink to tattoos than it is to remove it, temporary or not.\n\nThis wouldn\u2019t be the first time Watson has psyched the world out with fake tattoos. While attending the Glastonbury music festival in 2010, she sported a temporary tattoo on her upper arm, two birds unraveling a scroll that read \u201cmother lover.\u201d For her role in 2013\u2019s The Bling Ring, Watson had some faux ink on her lower back and even added some stars on her hip for a GQ cover that year.\n\nWatson\u2019s current tattoo, fake as it may be, is in support of a cause that the actress has championed for years. In September 2014, the U.N. Women Goodwill Ambassador announced her U.N. campaign, HeForShe, encouraging men to support gender equality. In January, Watson brought women\u2019s rights activist, Marai Larasi, as her date to the Golden Globes.\n\n\u201cThere is no question that #TIMESUP should be and will be a global movement,\u201d Watson wrote on Instagram after the BAFTAs last month. \u201cA movement that is defined and led by those affected by the problem, not by those in power.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d0ddd374b104fc486444b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/VFOscars2017_HannahThomson_DSC_4023.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d85fc3c0f45451fecd643/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/VFOscars2017_HannahThomson_DSC_5284.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d6b21374b104fc4864471/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d2f52adad664a16b0fdd1/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2018-VF-OSCARS-1375.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d84921d14714f6de442d2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/VFOscars2017_HannahThomson_DSC_5284.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d0ce25c509c53ae7926b6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/2018-oscars-tiffany-haddish.gif", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9c9a645c509c53ae792660/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/t-red-carpet-2018-oscars.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d6b21374b104fc4864471/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63346f17998599490392c7f7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d6b21374b104fc4864471/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Erika Harwood"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/emma-watson-debuts-temporary-tattoo-at-the-vanity-fair-oscar-party", "title": "Emma Watson Debuts Temporary Time\u2019s Up Tattoo at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Watson has traded in her pin for some (temporary) ink.", "id": "5a9d6a6ee6cd8a4072c5d90b", "keywords": "emma watson,tattoo,vanity fair oscar party,awards,oscars 2018,vanities,oscar party", "news_keywords": "emma watson,tattoo,vanity fair oscar party,awards,oscars 2018,vanities,oscar party", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a9d6a6ee6cd8a4072c5d90b", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Watson has traded in her pin for some (temporary) ink.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d6b21374b104fc4864471/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d6b21374b104fc4864471/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Watson has traded in her pin for some (temporary) ink.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d6b21374b104fc4864471/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Emma Watson Debuts Temporary Time\u2019s Up Tattoo at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/03/emma-watson-debuts-temporary-tattoo-at-the-vanity-fair-oscar-party"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-05T16:08:33.089Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-05T16:08:33.089Z", "author": "Erika Harwood"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Watson has traded in her pin for some (temporary) ink.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a9d6b21374b104fc4864471/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Emma-Watson.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Emma Watson Debuts Temporary Time\u2019s Up Tattoo at the Vanity Fair Oscar Party"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520266113.089, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
