Since the show's finale in 1995, Stamos has appeared in numerous TV films and series. Since 2005, he has been the national spokesperson for Project Cuddle.[2]\n\nFrom 2005 to 2009, Stamos had a starring role on the NBC medical drama ER as Dr. Tony Gates. In October 2009, he began playing the role of Albert in the Broadway revival of Bye Bye Birdie, which he played until January 2010.

His original family surname is Stamatopoulos (Greek: \u03a3\u03c4\u03b1\u03bc\u03b1\u03c4\u03cc\u03c0\u03bf\u03c5\u03bb\u03bf\u03c2).[4]\n\nIn his youth, Stamos worked for his father's restaurants, and as a teenager, had a job flipping burgers in the Orange County area. He attended John F. Kennedy High School and played in the marching band there. At 15, he attended his first Beach Boys concert; a huge fan, he would later tour with the band. His parents were supportive of his aspiration to be an actor, and although he planned to enroll at Cypress College for the 1981 term, he skipped his first semester to focus on launching a career as an actor\u2014with his father's blessing.
