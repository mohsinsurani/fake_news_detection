Rowling herself just let a big one spill during the intermission of the play\u2019s Broadway opening night.\n\nThis particular secret has to do with the upcoming Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them sequel \u2014 specifically, the character played by Jessica Williams. While the duo dined out together, they decided to share they announcement on social media: Williams will play Professor Eulalie \u201cLally\u201d Hicks, who teaches at Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry, America\u2019s equivalent of Hogwarts.\n\nLest we get ahead of ourselves, Rowling later tweeted that the next Fantastic Beasts film, The Crimes of Grindelwald, will only feature a \u201chint\u201d of Lally, and that her \u201ctrue glory\u201d will be revealed in the third film.\n\nYou only see a HINT of Lally in Fantastic Beasts 2. Her true glory is revealed in FB3. https://t.co/8vyhdlU71m \u2014 J.K. Rowling (@jk_rowling) April 22, 2018\n\nWilliams, a diehard Harry Potter fan, was announced as part of the cast back in October. \u201cI hung out with J.K. [Rowling], and she had reached out to me a couple of days after we met. She sent me these emails about this really amazing character that she had been working on. That\u2019s pretty much how it all got started,\u201d Williams told EW. \u201cIt\u2019s like my wildest dream \u2026 I could not have fathomed that when I was in the fourth grade reading these books, there would be a character I play that exists in this universe. It\u2019s insane to me.\u201d\n\nProfessor Eulalie (Lally) Hicks of Ilvermorny School of Witchcraft and Wizardry with some random woman during the interval of #CursedChildNYC pic.twitter.com/Kl7joRz8me \u2014 J.K.
