News has learned Kim Kardashian West is in talks with the White House.\n\nThe \"Keeping Up With the Kardashians\" star's rep confirmed Wednesday that Kardashian West and Jared Kushner, who is President Donald Trump's senior adviser and son-in-law, are speaking. This news follows Mic's report that Kardashian West and Ivanka Trump's husband are in talks about a \"possible presidential pardon or clemency\" for 62-year-old great-grandmother Alice Marie Johnson.\n\nJohnson is currently serving a life sentence for a first-time, nonviolent drug offense. It's been more than 20 years since she began her sentence in federal prison in October 1996.\n\nKourtney Kardashian Meets With Congressional Leaders About Cosmetics Reform\n\n\"I had been in management for 10 years when I lost my job,\" Johnson says in a Mic video explaining her case. \"I struggled financially, I couldn't find a job fast enough to take care of my family. I felt like a failure, I went into a complete panic and out of desperation, I made one of the worst decisions of my life to make some quick money.\"\n\nShe continued, \"I became involved in a drug conspiracy.\"\n\nKardashian West first publicly discussed Johnson's case back in October 2017 when she tweeted an article about her imprisonment.\n\n\"This is so unfair,\" Kardashian West wrote to her Twitter followers.\n\nThe following month, the New York Daily News reported that Kardashian West had enlisted her lawyer to \"help the clemency campaigns\" of Johnson and Cyntoia Brown.\n\nKardashian West's lawyer, Shawn Holley, told the publication at the time that Johnson \"has been a model prisoner and has the support of the warden, government officials and a host of others in her bid for release.\"", "images": ["https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/New_York_On_Dark@3x-5.png?fit=528%2C120&quality=85&strip=all&w=176&h=40", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/Osmo.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/poughkeepsie-hotel-shooting.png?resize=100%2C56&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/Migrant-Planes-Orange-COunty.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035083&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/Long-Island-Cocaine-bust.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NYC_aerial-1-1.png?fit=2060%2C847&quality=85&strip=all&w=400&h=44&crop=1", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/AP22280514288288.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/AP22281349654135.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2022/10/stream_1920x1080_2082043459780.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&resize=100%2C56", "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NY_On_Light@3x-3.png?fit=552%2C120&quality=85&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://media.nbcnewyork.com/2019/09/NBC@3x-7-1.png?fit=5761%2C3240&quality=85&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jess Cohen"], "canonical_link": "http://www.eonline.com/news/931640/kim-kardashian-in-talks-with-jared-kushner-to-pardon-an-imprisoned-grandmother", "title": "Kim Kardashian West in Talks With Jared Kushner to Pardon an Imprisoned Grandmother", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 5.8.5", "og": {"site_name": "NBC New York", "type": "article", "description": "One week after Kourtney Kardashian took Capitol Hill, E!
