On the song, she sings lyrics like \"Accelerate, c'mon babe / Pick up your speed / Stamina, fill me up / That's what I need.\"\n\nThe song's music video, which was directed by Zoey Grossman, also dropped at the same time on YouTube (via E! News).\n\nAguilera had previously released singles from her album Lotus in 2012. She later collaborated with A Great Big World for \"Say Something,\" with Pitbull for \"Feel This Moment,\" with Alejandro Fern\u00e1ndez for \"Hoy Tengo Ganas de Ti,\" and with Lady Gaga for \"Do What U Want.\" She later released \"Change,\" which benefited victims of the Pulse nightclub shooting and \"Telepathy,\" which was recorded for the Netflix Original series The Get Down.\n\nHowever, fans have been clamoring for Aguilera to release a new record for years. In January 2018, Aguilera responded to a fan who stuck a Post-it on her Hollywood Walk of Fame star, asking \"where the f***\" her new music was. \"It's coming b****es,\" Aguilera teased.\n\nThat April, a source revealed to Us Weekly that Aguilera, who rocked a more natural look on the cover of Paper magazine in late March, would be releasing new music in May.\n\nFortunately for all Aguilera fans, they won't have to wait much longer for the singer's new album. Aguilera will release her eighth studio album, Liberation, on June 15.\n\nBelow is the track list, as provided by Amazon Music:", "images": ["https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/christina-aguilera-drops-first-single-in-six-years/intro-1525450567.jpg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/christina-aguilera-drops-first-single-in-six-years/intro-1525450567.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Surpless"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/120825/christina-aguilera-drops-first-single-six-years/", "title": "Christina Aguilera Drops First Single In Six Years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/christina-aguilera-drops-first-single-in-six-years/intro-1525450567.jpg", "title": "Christina Aguilera Drops First Single In Six Years - Nicki Swift", "description": "Christina Aguilera is back!
