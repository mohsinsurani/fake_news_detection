The Today show host, 64, called into Andy Cohen\u2019s radio show on Wednesday, March 14, revealing that she reached out to both Harvey Weinstein and Bill Cosby after numerous women made allegations against them.\n\n\u201cSince I got into this business as a teenage girl, I have been sexually harassed, I have been sexually abused and I have been date raped. Don\u2019t tell me they\u2019re all the same, because they are not,\u201d she said on Andy Radio. \u201cI don\u2019t want to throw everybody on the same manure pile. Being a jerk is not the same as being a rapist. It just isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s when Cohen, 49, asked if she had reached out to Cosby after the allegations were made public, and she revealed she had.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been friends with Bill a long, long time,\u201d she said of the 80-year-old actor who was accused of sexual assault or rape by more than 60 women. Gifford then added, \u201cHarvey Weinstein was a friend of mine for 30 years \u2026 I called him and left a message.\u201d\n\nIt seemed that even Cohen was surprised, as he just kept saying \u201cWow\u201d while she continued. Weinstein has been accused by more than 80 women of sexual harassment or abuse. Both Weinstein and Cosby have denied all allegations of nonconsensual sex.\n\n\u201cI just want people to know I don\u2019t judge them,\u201d the TV personality continued. \u201cI don\u2019t like what they do, but God knows their hearts and there\u2019s hope for them. And you can\u2019t call yourself a friend when, the first minute where there\u2019s trouble, you run. That\u2019s called a fair-weather friend \u2026 and that\u2019s not a friend at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cI hope people aren\u2019t misunderstanding this. I am not saying that that kind of behavior is in any way acceptable. It isn\u2019t and as a woman who\u2019s experienced it, it\u2019s awful,\u201d she said, before again defending her friends. \u201cBut, can we at least look at each individual case and see it for it what it is and be merciful to people that are sorry for what they\u2019ve done? If we stop having mercy as a part of our vocabulary, Andy, our world will completely die.\u201d\n\nGifford recently revealed that after her former Today co-anchor Matt Lauer was fired for alleged inappropriate sexual behavior, she texted him with a message that read, \u201cI adore you.\u201d\n\n\u201cNo one is perfect in this world. What we need now is forgiveness and mercy for one another,\u201d she said during a November broadcast of Today after Lauer\u2019s firing. \u201cI send out my love to the person who came forward. May God heal that person. I send it to Matt his children and his wife and heal \u2026 We\u2019re broken and we need someone to put us back together. It is so possible, I am living proof of it. I didn\u2019t mean to go to church but sometimes, you gotta go to church.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kathie-lee-gifford-reached-out-to-harvey-weinstein-and-bill-cosby-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kathie-lee-gifford-reached-out-to-harvey-weinstein-and-bill-cosby-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-kathie-lee-gifford-reached-out-to-bill-cosby-harvey-weinstein/", "title": "Why Kathie Lee Gifford Reached Out to Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kathie Lee Gifford explains why she contacted Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein following the allegations of sexual assault against them \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kathie Lee Gifford to Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein: \u2018I Don\u2019t Judge Them'", "description": "Kathie Lee Gifford explains why she contacted Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein following the allegations of sexual assault against them \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/why-kathie-lee-gifford-reached-out-to-bill-cosby-harvey-weinstein/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-15T14:25:30+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kathie-lee-gifford-reached-out-to-harvey-weinstein-and-bill-cosby-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kathie-lee-gifford-reached-out-to-harvey-weinstein-and-bill-cosby-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-15T13:51:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-03-15T14:25:30+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Longeretta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kathie Lee Gifford to Bill Cosby, Harvey Weinstein: \u2018I Don\u2019t Judge Them'", "description": "Kathie Lee Gifford explains why she contacted Bill Cosby and Harvey Weinstein following the allegations of sexual assault against them \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/kathie-lee-gifford-reached-out-to-harvey-weinstein-and-bill-cosby-2.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521121879.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
