In the months that preceded his death, Williams faced daunting challenges, both professionally and personally. His film career had stalled, and his comeback sitcom, The Crazy Ones, was failing to find an audience on CBS. He was still harboring guilt about his divorce from Marsha Garces, his second wife and mother of two of his children, and adjusting to life with his new wife, Susan Schneider, whom he married in 2011.\n\nMeanwhile, Williams was also reeling from a cataclysmic diagnosis: in May 2014, he had been told that he had Parkinson\u2019s disease, news that stunned and overwhelmed the once-nimble comedian. Even more crushing than this is the possibility that Williams was misdiagnosed; an autopsy would later reveal that he actually had Lewy body dementia, an aggressive and incurable brain disorder that has an associated risk of suicide.\n\nHere, Itzkoff traces the last few months of Williams\u2019s life. His reporting draws on the perspectives of some of Williams\u2019s closest confidants and family members, including Billy Crystal; his Mork & Mindy co-star Pam Dawber; his oldest son, Zak Williams; his daughter-in-law, Alex Mallick-Williams; his makeup artist, Cheri Minns; and his old friends Mark Pitta, Cyndi McHale, and Wendy Asher. Robin is available May 15.\n\nCourtesy of Macmillan Publishers.\n\nWhy?\n\nIt was a question that crossed Robin\u2019s mind more often these days, now that he had put in roughly 35 years as a professional entertainer and more than 60 as a human being.\n\nWhat did he still get out of doing what he was doing, and why did he feel the compulsion to keep doing it? He had already enjoyed nearly all of the accomplishments that one could hope for in his field, tasted the richest successes, won most of the major awards. Every stage of his career had been an adventure into the unknown, an improvisation in its own right, but there was truly no road map for where he was now. Everything came to an end at some point; it was a reality he accepted and confronted so often in his work, even as he tried to out-race it. What would it look like for him, he wondered, when he wrapped things up and told the crowd good night for the last time? How could it be anything other than devastating?\n\nThe work was less abundant than it used to be and nowhere near as lucrative, and so much of it seemed to be focused on finality, particularly in the form of death. In August 2012, he had appeared in an episode of Louie, the cable-TV comedy written by and starring the comedian Louis C.K., that begins with both men meeting at the grave of a comedy-club manager who has recently died, and whom they both privately despised. \u201cWhen he died, I felt nothing,\u201d Louie tells Robin. \u201cI didn\u2019t care. But I knew\u2014when I pictured him going in the ground and nobody\u2019s there, he\u2019s alone, it gave me nightmares.\u201d Robin replies, \u201cMe too.\u201d\n\nLater that fall, Robin was in New York making a film called The Angriest Man in Brooklyn, another morbid indie comedy, in which he plays its title character, a surly lawyer who is diagnosed with an aneurysm and told he has 90 minutes to live. In one scene, the character jumps off the Brooklyn Bridge into the East River, but he survives, and he is dragged from the water by the doctor who, it turns out, has falsely diagnosed him. When he described the creation of this sequence to David Letterman, the host had asked him if he needed a gamma-globulin shot, and Robin answered, \u201cI didn\u2019t get a shot, and I hope it doesn\u2019t end up, 20 years from now, I\u2019m not like Katharine Hepburn, going, [quavering voice] \u2018E-very-thing\u2019s fi-ine.\u2019\u201d\n\nSo why did Robin persist in making these films, each one a far cry from the Hollywood features he had once thrived on, and which were lucky to receive even a theatrical release? Why did he continue to fill every free block of time in his schedule with work, whatever work he could find? Yes, he needed the money, especially now that he had two ex-wives and a new spouse he wanted to provide with a comfortable home. \u201cThere are bills to pay,\u201d he said. \u201cMy life has downsized, in a good way. I\u2019m selling the ranch up in Napa. I just can\u2019t afford it anymore.\u201d He hadn\u2019t lost all his money, but, he said, \u201cLost enough. Divorce is expensive.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6270778fc79ffab65a2f7d6d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined",
