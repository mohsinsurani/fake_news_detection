News earlier this year that the case is strictly \u201cabout protecting children who are victims of abuse.\u201d\n\nThe sisters claimed, \u201cRevealing juvenile identities under these circumstances is unacceptable and it\u2019s against the law. The media and custodians of public records who let these children down must be held accountable. This case has vast implications for all our children. We hope that by bringing this case to the public\u2019s attention, all children will be reported from reckless reporting.\u201d\n\nAccording to the lawsuit, the investigative reports that were conducted in 2006 occurred when the four Duggar girls were underage. They believed those reports would have only been accessible to law enforcement and child service officers. However, they alleged In Touch published as many as eight stories about the family drama.\n\nThen in June, it was revealed Josh was looking to join his sisters\u2019 lawsuit. However, new court documents obtained by E! News Thursday reveal the four sisters want a judge to deny his request.\n\n\u201cDeciding claims based on protecting victims of sex crimes from disclosure, while at the same time, having those claims consolidated with the perpetrator of those crimes will be confusing to the jury,\u201d stated the documents.\n\n\u201cIt would be next to impossible for a jury to ignore the perpetrator sitting next to the victims, yet decide the different issues, different claims and different damages that apply for victims as compared to perpetrator. Consolidation would undoubtedly give the false impression that the victim and the perpetrator are \u2018in this together.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe document went on to say, \u201cForcing the victims to join their claims with their perpetrator\u2019s claims would further traumatize the very victims Arkansas law is designed to protect.\u201d\n\nThe celebrity news site added a judge has yet to make a decision.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/kevinSpacey.jpeg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/meek-mill-kanye.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/24/640/360/896/500/072415_kf_josh.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/348/196/GettyImages-1427614638.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/436b45c1-kushner-kloss-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-411.svg", "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/24/640/360/072415_kf_josh.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/Getty_QueenElizabeth_PrinceAndrew.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/348/196/Kanye_West_Kim_Kardashian.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/24/640/360/072415_kf_josh.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/josh-duggars-sisters-want-him-out-of-their-privacy-lawsuit-says-report", "title": "Josh Duggar's sisters want him out of their privacy lawsuit, says report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Duggar sisters are determined to keep their controversial sibling out of their privacy lawsuit.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Josh Duggar's sisters want him out of their privacy lawsuit, says report", "dcterms.abstract": "The Duggar sisters are determined to keep their controversial sibling out of their privacy lawsuit.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "The Duggar sisters are determined to keep their controversial sibling out of their privacy lawsuit.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:a17931e8-9a26-58c6-8c9f-1ab629619ae9", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2017-09-08", "dcterms.created": "2017-09-08T12:02:13-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2017-09-18T23:35:45-04:00", "og": {"title": "Josh Duggar's sisters want him out of their privacy lawsuit, says report", "description": "The Duggar sisters are determined to keep their controversial sibling out of their privacy lawsuit.", "type": "article", "image": "http://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/24/640/360/072415_kf_josh.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/josh-duggars-sisters-want-him-out-of-their-privacy-lawsuit-says-report", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Josh Duggar's sisters want him out of their privacy lawsuit, says report", "description": "The Duggar sisters are determined to keep their controversial sibling out of their privacy lawsuit.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/2015/07/24/640/360/1024/512/072415_kf_josh.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/josh-duggars-sisters-want-him-out-of-their-privacy-lawsuit-says-report"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/In Court,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "incourt,entertainment", "classification-tags": "incourt,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
