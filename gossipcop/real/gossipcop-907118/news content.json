The 53-year-old actor appeared on Thursday\u2019s The Ellen DeGeneres Show where he talked to his neighbor, DeGeneres, about the destruction in their California town.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a really difficult week. The sadness, I can\u2019t get beyond it,\u201d Lowe admitted.\n\n\u201cI think people who live there, we kind of are holding onto each other,\u201d DeGeneres, who has also spoken to neighbor Oprah Winfrey about the disaster on the show, said.\n\nThere are 20 dead and three still missing in Montecito with 179 homes destroyed and more than 200 homes damaged.\n\nLowe explained that his son, Matthew, stayed behind the night of the mudslide as they were only under voluntary evacuation.\n\n\u201cI had a meeting out of town. At 4 o\u2019clock in the morning, I got a FaceTime from Matthew panicking\u2026 fires everywhere because gas lines were rupturing. It was like Armageddon,\u201d Lowe said.\n\nThe actor believes that the reason the community suffered so many fatalities was due to confusion.\n\n\u201cPeople who saw the fires, they woke up, went out to see what was going on and then were washed away. It was truly a perfect storm of bad events,\u201d he explained.\n\nDeGeneres noted that she\u2019s been told they have a mandatory evacuation in the area for possibly as long as March as they try to clean up the destruction.\n\nThey also gave viewers two ways to donate to help with the cleanup \u2013 RedCrossMontecito.com and DeGeneres\u2019 Montecito Disaster Relief GoFundMe page.\n\nLowe has been actively involved with the community cleanup, inviting local firefighters to his house for dinner and posing with a group of rescue dogs.\n\nFor more on the devastation in Montecito, watch Oprah\u2019s footage below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nRob Lowe Slams Bella Thorne's Tweet About Santa Barbara Traffic Following Fatal Mudslides\n\nEllen DeGeneres FaceTimes With Oprah Winfrey About Montecito Mudslides, Fights Back Tears\n\nOprah Winfrey Shares Video of How California Mudslides Affected Her Home", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/GettyImages-1429788071.jpg?h=8ebe1396&itok=I-YwmiTW", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/rob_lowe_ellen_degeneres.jpg?h=c266198b&itok=9uO69hxK", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%2011.17.16%20AM.png?h=22ea39b5&itok=NjZh8lt3", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-01/rob_lowe_ellen_degeneres.jpg?h=c266198b&itok=u07VzmOw"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/rob_lowe_ellen_degeneres.jpg?h=c266198b&itok=9uO69hxK", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Mcrady"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/rob-lowe-shares-stories-montecito-mudslide-sadness-i-cant-get-beyond-it-94521", "title": "Rob Lowe Shares Stories From Montecito Mudslide: \u2018The Sadness, I Can\u2019t Get Beyond It\u2019", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "Lowe appeared on Thursday\u2019s \u2018The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u2019", "keywords": "News, Rob Lowe, Ellen Degeneres", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rob-lowe-shares-stories-montecito-mudslide-sadness-i-cant-get-beyond-it-94521", "title": "Rob Lowe Shares Stories From Montecito Mudslide: \u2018The Sadness, I Can\u2019t Get Beyond It\u2019", "description": "Lowe appeared on Thursday\u2019s \u2018The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u2019", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/rob_lowe_ellen_degeneres.jpg?h=c266198b&itok=9uO69hxK", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Lowe appeared on Thursday\u2019s \u2018The Ellen DeGeneres Show.\u2019", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Rob Lowe Shares Stories From Montecito Mudslide: \u2018The Sadness, I Can\u2019t Get Beyond It\u2019", "creator": "Rachel McRady\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/rob-lowe-shares-stories-montecito-mudslide-sadness-i-cant-get-beyond-it-94521", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-01/rob_lowe_ellen_degeneres.jpg?h=c266198b&itok=9uO69hxK"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
