No one else was home at the time.\n\nThe burglars reportedly got into the home through a window or door on an upper floor. A ladder was apparently found in the backyard.\n\nDozens of celebrities have been hit by burglars this year, including David Spade, Jaime Pressly, Ronda Rousey, former Lakers Coach Byron Scott, Jason Derulo, Emmy Rossum, Dodgers star Yasiel Puig, Nicki Minaj, and Alanis Morisette, at their homes from West Los Angeles to the San Fernando Valley.", "images": ["https://losangeles.cbslocal.com/assets/show/losangeles/logo-square-32.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=418549723649035&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/01/550f2ecb-293a-43f7-ab2d-3505f970d5bd/thumbnail/1200x630/d9ae7f8f22a02f8c9458d5e1de4cde5a/mariah-carey.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/01/550f2ecb-293a-43f7-ab2d-3505f970d5bd/thumbnail/1200x630/d9ae7f8f22a02f8c9458d5e1de4cde5a/mariah-carey.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/", "title": "Report: Mariah Carey's LA Home Burglarized For $50K In Purses, Sunglasses", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "color-scheme": "only light", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Mariah Carey has joined a growing number of Los Angeles celebrities who have had their Los Angeles homes burglarized.", "keywords": "Mariah Carey", "news_keywords": "Mariah Carey", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/"}, "ios": {"app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223, "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews", "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/"}}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/", "title": "Report: Mariah Carey's LA Home Burglarized For $50K In Purses, Sunglasses", "description": "Mariah Carey has joined a growing number of Los Angeles celebrities who have had their Los Angeles homes burglarized.", "image": {"identifier": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/01/550f2ecb-293a-43f7-ab2d-3505f970d5bd/thumbnail/1200x630/d9ae7f8f22a02f8c9458d5e1de4cde5a/mariah-carey.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267, "pages": 57972945858}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSLA/", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"iphone": "CBS News", "ipad": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"iphone": 334256223, "ipad": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/", "ipad": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/", "googleplay": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/mariah-carey-burglary-50k-purses-sunglasses/"}}, "site": "@cbsla", "title": "Report: Mariah Carey's LA Home Burglarized For $50K In Purses, Sunglasses", "description": "Mariah Carey has joined a growing number of Los Angeles celebrities who have had their Los Angeles homes burglarized.", "image": "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/01/01/550f2ecb-293a-43f7-ab2d-3505f970d5bd/thumbnail/1200x630/d9ae7f8f22a02f8c9458d5e1de4cde5a/mariah-carey.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "theme-color": "#101010", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "CBS News", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508454000.0, "source": "https://losangeles.cbslocal.com", "summary": ""}
