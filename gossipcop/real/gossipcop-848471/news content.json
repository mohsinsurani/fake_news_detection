{"url": "https://www.gq.com/story/meet-brad-pitts-secret-weapon", "text": "You've probably never heard of Jean Black but she's been behind the scenes with Brad Pitt for over 27 years, a quiet cog in the machine that is his career\u2014and an integral part of his personal life. Black is a makeup artist who has worked with Pitt on about 30 of his films (they recently counted it up for fun), all of his editorial shoots, and all of his red carpet events. Needless to say, a working relationship like this in Hollywood, the most fickle of towns and industries, is very very unusual.\n\nBlack and Pitt in 1995.\n\nBlack's relationship with Pitt is endearing. She talks about him like he's a real, true friend because, well, that's exactly what he is. She\u2019s camped with him on a boulder for A River Runs Through It, trudged through mud for Fury, and been with him throughout his incredible personal and professional rollercoaster of a life. She\u2019s had the kind of experience with a celebrity that just doesn\u2019t exist for most normal people. She\u2019s the one in the trailer with him, she\u2019s the one holding cold spoons to his eyes when he's tired and looks it, she\u2019s there when he\u2019s falling in love, and there when he\u2019s getting divorced. And she has something (many things) to say about why Pitt is so lovable. Furthermore, she's the ultimate authority on what exactly it is about Brad Pitt's face that churns us all into a frenzy. Reluctant to take too much credit for her life's work, Black insists that Pitt's appeal is largely due to his charm\u2014to some kind of magical charisma that he himself is not aware of. We talked to her about some of his most iconic movies, what it\u2019s like to be friends with the ultimate celebrity, and how working with Pitt is the easiest job in Hollywood.\n\nGQStyle: How did you meet Brad? How did this get started?\n\nJean Black: In 1990 I got called to do a movie called Cool World and they told me that there was a young guy in it\u2014a young actor\u2014and his name was Brad Pitt. It started a long journey for us together.\n\nI would say you'd never think in a million years that you would be with someone 27 years and almost 30 films. To have travelled the world with him\u2026It's a whole life that I would never have thought possible. It\u2019s pretty unusual for someone like Brad, or someone in that position, to be so loyal.\n\nReally? Do you know anyone else who\u2019s been with their groomer as long as you\u2019ve been with Brad?\n\nMonty Westmore was with Paul Newman for, oh my God, for like 45 years or something? Julia Roberts had Richard Dean for quite a while. It does happen and when it does it\u2019s lovely. It says a lot about that person.\n\nAs Paul Maclean in A River Runs Through It John Kelly\n\nHow did your relationship evolve after that first movie?\n\nAfter Cool World I did a movie and I think Brad was up for A River Runs Through It. At that time Brad didn\u2019t really have the star power to ask for a personal, or to ask for me to come. But as it turned out, someone dropped out of the film in the makeup department and so they did end up calling me. I went and was the head of the department and then the next movie came up. I haven\u2019t done every movie with Brad but once I really got started with him as a personal, we\u2019ve done pretty much everything we could together. Like I said, his sense of loyalty is quite unusual. He\u2019s had the same manager even longer than me.", "images": ["https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce419ee7e6447b1025c04/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/brad-pitt-fury.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce419ee7e6447b1025c04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brad-pitt-fury.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/59024d71da176e01df8d469e/1:1/w_775%2Cc_limit/Brad-Pitt-GQ-Style-10.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/590a3b10e4b384371cdac9db/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/seven-years-in-tibet.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/style-logo-reverse.ff3e4c00c8da092461e3b0a33203c5b1db784b3d.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/590a3b11e4b384371cdac9dd/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/thelma-and-louise.jpg", "https://www.gq.com/verso/static/gq/assets/style-logo-header.84c12569a8e328faa7fde24fcd41c9a9cccfe6cd.svg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/590c903e5607d02ba9e2985b/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/LILI-contributor-illo-circle-template.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/590b8076111dd736fdd00b1f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/JeanBlack.jpeg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/63373eaf22949d5a0d1fa6e2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/590a3f2aeb1feb7c1b66dddc/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/a-river-runs-through-it_edit.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce41bdd27d21b427e2584/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/brad-pitt-se7en.jpg", "https://media.gq.com/photos/632b431b25d02accbd22d403/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/631bb1d74fc15b2eb6cd1978/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.gq.com/photos/63332cf2e04a5d8f458e5da2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce419ee7e6447b1025c04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brad-pitt-fury.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lili G\u00f6ksenin", "Michael Paterniti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.gq.com/story/meet-brad-pitts-secret-weapon", "title": "Meet Brad Pitt\u2019s Secret Weapon", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Jean Black, a makeup artist who never gives interviews, talks about working with Brad Pitt and his famous face for almost 30 years, and what it is that makes him so special.", "id": "590c87e1ee7e6447b1025bde", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "590c87e1ee7e6447b1025bde", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Jean Black, a makeup artist who never gives interviews, talks about working with Brad Pitt and his famous face for almost 30 years, and what it is that makes him so special.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce419ee7e6447b1025c04/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/brad-pitt-fury.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce419ee7e6447b1025c04/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/brad-pitt-fury.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Jean Black, a makeup artist who never gives interviews, talks about working with Brad Pitt and his famous face for almost 30 years, and what it is that makes him so special.", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce419ee7e6447b1025c04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brad-pitt-fury.jpg", "site_name": "GQ", "title": "Meet Brad Pitt\u2019s Secret Weapon", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.gq.com/story/meet-brad-pitts-secret-weapon"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-08T17:12:16.093Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-08T17:12:16.093Z", "author": "Lili G\u00f6ksenin"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@gqmagazine", "description": "Jean Black, a makeup artist who never gives interviews, talks about working with Brad Pitt and his famous face for almost 30 years, and what it is that makes him so special.", "domain": "https://www.gq.com", "image": "https://media.gq.com/photos/590ce419ee7e6447b1025c04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/brad-pitt-fury.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@gqmagazine", "title": "Meet Brad Pitt\u2019s Secret Weapon"}, "fb": {"app_id": 606963029328755, "pages": 7962048097}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494263536.093, "source": "https://www.gq.com", "summary": ""}
