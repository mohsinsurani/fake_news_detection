The Game of Thrones star and DNCE frontman took to Instagram Sunday to share matching photos of Turner\u2019s newly blinged-out hand resting on top of Jonas\u2019s with the captions, \u201cI said yes,\u201d and, \u201cShe said yes,\u201d respectively.\n\nHere\u2019s everything we know about Turner and Jonas\u2019s whirlwind romance.\n\nThe beginning\n\nThe pair first began appearing in photos together in late October, early November of 2016 after they partied together on Halloween.\n\nLess than a week later, they were spotted cuddling up at a pre-MTV Europe Music Awards Kings of Leon concert in the Netherlands.\n\n\u201cThey were really close together,\u201d one concertgoer reportedly told People. \u201cI didn\u2019t look very often because I was seated more in front of the room. The two or three times I was watching they were kissing. She was all smiley and he looked really sweet.\u201d\n\nTheir relationship appeared to be getting even more serious when they attended a friend\u2019s wedding together over Thanksgiving weekend after spending some quality time with Jonas\u2019s family.\n\nInstagram official\n\nTurner finally gave fans the long-awaited confirmation they were waiting on when she shared a photo of Jonas on a boat in Miami in January. \u201cMiami daze,\u201d she captioned the shot, which Jonas left a winky face comment on.\n\nThe two were photographed at the CAA talent agency\u2019s pre-Golden Globes 2017 party later that week. However, Turner evaded questions about their relationship on the red carpet leading up to the awards show. \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything. I\u2019m very happy,\u201d she told Extra when asked about Jonas. \u201cI\u2019m not saying anything. I don\u2019t know who you\u2019re talking about, really.\u201d\n\nUnder wraps\n\nIn a May interview with InStyle, Turner admitted that she was intent on keeping the details of her love life \u201cpretty private.\u201d\n\n\u201cI found it easier to date someone who understands the industry or is in that world,\u201d she explained. \u201cYou realize that you\u2019re not going to see each other all the time. And you don\u2019t feel like a jerk when you\u2019re like, \u2018My publicist says I can\u2019t do this\u2026'\u201d\n\nTwo months later, she elaborated further on the downside of trying to maintain a \u201cvery happy\u201d relationship in the public eye. \u201cYou do feel like you\u2019re living in a fishbowl,\u201d she told Marie Claire. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrating [that] it\u2019s the most mundane things that make the news\u2014how boring!\u201d\n\nTurner also seemed to hint that Jonas was responsible for helping her come out of her shell somewhat.\n\n\u201cI very much isolated myself for a while and forgot what was fun. Going out with friends, going out to eat, not really having a care,\u201d she told the U.K.\u2019s Sunday Times in July. \u201cAnd people I\u2019ve met recently in my life have drawn me out of that. It really helps you own those insecurities. The things I tortured myself about before, I can forget about.\n\nPuppy love\n\nThe two revealed that they had adopted a dog together in September, with Turner sharing a photo of their Siberian Husky puppy, Porky Basquiat, on Instagram while Jonas fawned over the pup in an Instagram story.\n\n\u201cMeet the newest addition to the krew @porkybasquiat,\u201d Turner wrote.\n\nEngagement\n\nThe first true confirmation of Turner and Jonas\u2019s relationship came on Oct. 15 when the pair announced their engagement on Instagram.\n\nThose close to the couple were quick to express their excitement about the impending union, with Jonas\u2019s younger brother, Nick Jonas, and Turner\u2019s longtime best friend, Maisie Williams, re-posting the engagement shot. \u201cAhh! Congratulations to my brother\u2026and sister in law to be on your engagement,\u201d Nick wrote. \u201cI love you both so much.\u201d\n\n\u201cCongratulations to my beautiful girlfriend on her engagement,\u201d Williams added. \u201cThis is just one of MANY life milestones we\u2019ll share. Love you both.\u201d\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/mayim-bialik.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-engagement.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=396&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jesse-Bryant-skiing-at-JHMR-e1612191790559.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-engagement.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=396&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4983806/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-relationship-timeline/", "title": "Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas Engaged: Relationship Timeline", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "To the surprise of many of their fans, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner and musician Joe Jonas have officially announced their engagement.", "og": {"title": "A Complete History of Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas's Romance", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4983806/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-relationship-timeline/", "description": "The Game of Thrones star and DNCE frontman have announced their engagement", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-engagement.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=396&crop=1", "width": 594, "height": 396}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4983806/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-relationship-timeline/", "description": "To the surprise of many of their fans, Game of Thrones star Sophie Turner and musician Joe Jonas have officially announced their engagement.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-engagement.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=396&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4983806/sophie-turner-joe-jonas-relationship-timeline/", "title": "A Complete History of Sophie Turner and Joe Jonas's Romance", "description": "The Game of Thrones star and DNCE frontman have announced their engagement", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/joe-jonas-sophie-turner-engagement.jpg?quality=85&w=594&h=396&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
