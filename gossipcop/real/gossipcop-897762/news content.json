It\u2019s crucial to talk about how commonplace this abuse is, but it\u2019s becoming more difficult to do so without becoming exhausted or desensitized. It\u2019s what makes Saturday Night Live\u2019s recent exploration of harassment \u2014 a visually soft, musical number from Cecily Strong, Kate McKinnon, Aidy Bryant, Leslie Jones, and Melissa Villase\u00f1or, with guest Saoirse Ronan \u2014 feel like a warm shower after a roll through the mud.\n\nOver the weekend, SNL debuted a catchy pop culture parody tackling the unending wave of sexual harassment allegations. This movement seems to have started with Harvey Weinstein, but the ripple has traveled far beyond Hollywood, and into industries and locations across the world. As the song title aptly puts it, \u201cWelcome to Hell.\u201d\n\nMusical comedy is nothing new for SNL, and the show has touched on feminist issues in group parodies before. But the biting juxtaposition of bubblegum pop and sexual harassment feels more like an outtake from the CW show Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, which regularly uses musical comedy to deconstruct thorny subjects like mental health and sexism. \u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d is a dead ringer for Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019s man-hating anthem \u201cLet\u2019s Generalize About Men,\u201d where series co-creator Rachel Bloom and company examine the pitfalls of the male population \u2014 and mock the way women talk about them.\n\nCrazy Ex-Girlfriend built its reputation on this sort of egalitarian satire, where its frustrated female characters declare that all men are emotionally stunted children while simultaneously acknowledging that this is absurd hyperbole. (\u201cThere are no exceptions / All 3 billion men are like this / All 3.6 billion men.\u201d) It plays on stereotypes from both sides: the women engaging in their proclaimed \u201cprimal ritual\u201d of drinking and complaining, the men putting up a tiresome cry of \u201cnot all men.\u201d The SNL song, on the other hand, represents a more literal case of ideologies clashing. Its staff can write and perform songs about harassment, but the show has also invited notorious abusers like Casey Affleck to host. (Louis CK has hosted the show four times.)\n\n\u201cWelcome to Hell\u201d is parody, but only in how it chooses to deliver its information. Dressed in pink or pastel and sporting sweetheart looks, these performers do their best bubblegum pop impression while addressing a harsh reality: harassment has always been part of women\u2019s lives. \u201cOh, this been the damn world,\u201d Strong sings of the recent headlines. Jones pops in to say, \u201cBut you do know that it\u2019s like a million times worse for a woman of color, right?\u201d The short even demonstrates some self-defense tactics women are taught: McKinnon holding her keys between her fingers to thwart would-be attackers, or Strong demonstrating acting so crazy, would-be molesters will decide she\u2019s \u201cnot worth the trouble.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ehJDRks8XiPCV0BqHpQanH7rJo=/0x0:2556x1258/1200x628/filters:focal(1278x629:1279x630)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9808445/Screen_Shot_2017_12_04_at_3.45.41_PM.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F2bBhonDKKcnDQCBQaLw-ONkrEL8%3D%2F0x0%3A4898x3265%2F100x100%2Ffilters%3Afocal(2449x1633%3A2450x1634)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F22263408%2Fgamestop_stock_hero.jpg&w=2400&q=75"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/4ehJDRks8XiPCV0BqHpQanH7rJo=/0x0:2556x1258/1200x628/filters:focal(1278x629:1279x630)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9808445/Screen_Shot_2017_12_04_at_3.45.41_PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Farokhmanesh"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/12/5/16735040/saturday-night-live-welcome-to-hell-video-crazy-ex-girlfriend-sexual-harassment", "title": "SNL takes on sexual harassment: \u2018Welcome to Hell\u2019", "meta_data": {"description": "The Verge is about technology and how it makes us feel.
