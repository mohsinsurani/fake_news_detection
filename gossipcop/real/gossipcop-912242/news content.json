He hired a high-end tepee, drank green juice and contemplated what playing the young Han Solo would mean.\n\n\u201cI wanted to make sure I was really choosing to do this myself. And it wasn\u2019t just because everybody in my life would think I was a lunatic if I said I didn\u2019t want to.\u201d It was time well spent, even if his conclusion was hardly surprising. \u201cWhen I really looked at it, I really wanted to do it.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s Thursday morning at the Cannes Film Festival, where Solo: A Star Wars Story was unveiled to the world\u2019s media two nights earlier. Ehrenreich, a sleepy-looking soul in a red lumberjack shirt and black jeans, has been living with taking over from Harrison Ford in one of the most recognisable roles in the Star Wars universe for two and a half years now.\n\nNot that this makes it any easier. The roguish space pirate Solo has been Ford\u2019s role alone for four decades.\n\nStar turn: could Ehrenreich be about to lose his anonymity? (Jonathan Olley/Lucasfilm) (Lucasfilm Ltd)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m lucky enough that this is happening after I\u2019ve been working for 14 years,\u201d he says. \u201cFor me, starting out and having less experience was more intense. This is intense but I have a certain set of tools at this point as far as coping.\n\n\u201cWhat do I have control over? I have control over my job, and my part and how much work I do on it. I don\u2019t have control over how well it turns out, how good the movie is, what anybody thinks or what anybody I\u2019m working with thinks.\u201d\n\nCertainly the 28-year-old Ehrenreich is no beginner. A Los Angeles native, he\u2019s already been to Cannes before with his debut, Francis Ford Coppola\u2019s 2009 road movie Tetro (they reunited for the horror Twixt two years later).\n\n\u201cI sat down with Francis and auditioned for him for about five months and then he went and put me in his film,\u201d he recalls. \u201cWe went and filmed in Argentina together. No trailers. It was just me sitting on his lap asking questions! It was a film school.\u201d\n\nAlden Ehrenreich in \u2018Tetro\u2019 in 2009\n\nSince then, he\u2019s worked for South Korean director Park Chan-wook on the psychological thriller Stoker and popped up in Woody Allen\u2019s Oscar-winning Blue Jasmine. More significantly, he was a co-lead in Warren Beatty\u2019s Howard Hughes biopic Rules Don\u2019t Apply and memorable in the Coen Brothers\u2019 1950s Hollywood comedy Hail, Caesar! as a rope-swirling TV cowboy.\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been so insanely lucky,\u201d he drawls, \u201cThe real gratification is that you get to be shoulder to shoulder [with these people] and be the beneficiary of their brilliance.\u201d\n\nThere are even strange connections to his casting in Solo, which is directed by Ron Howard (A Beautiful Mind), who once starred with Harrison Ford in 1973\u2019s American Graffiti, the film George Lucas made before directing the first Star Wars instalment. Coppola produced American Graffiti and it was cast by Fred Roos, who was also responsible for putting Ehrenreich in Tetro some 35 years later.\n\nEven before Tetro, Ehrenreich had contact with Lucas and Coppola\u2019s old buddy, Steven Spielberg. \u201cMy mum [Sari, an interior designer] never wanted me to act professionally,\u201d he explains. \u201cAnd I really didn\u2019t want to. I wanted a normal childhood and whatnot.\u201d\n\nAlden Ehrenreich as Hobie Doyle in \u2018Hail, Caesar!\u2019\n\nBut then he and a friend made a video for their pal\u2019s bar mitzvah \u2013 which was attended by Spielberg. \u201cHe liked me from the video, so he introduced me to DreamWorks. I got an agent through them and started acting professionally.\u201d\n\nTo complete this circle of Hollywood\u2019s Movie Brats, Ehrenreich met Lucas, who came to the Solo set. Crucially, he also spent time with Ford before the shoot commenced, at an airplane hanger in Santa Monica where they had lunch. Naturally, they talked about the character, although the typically reticent Ford swore Ehrenreich to secrecy.\n\n\u201cHarrison said, \u2018If anyone asks, tell them I taught you everything you need to know and you\u2019re not allowed to say anything!\u2019\u201d\n\nWhatever he told him, it worked. Ehrenreich captures Solo\u2019s gruff charms and misplaced confidence in embryonic form.\n\nEhrenreich in \u2018Solo\u2019 (Disney/Lucasfilm)\n\nHe went back to the original movies to watch Ford, but didn\u2019t set out to imitate him or copy a signature move, whether it\u2019s cocking his head or giving a wry smile. \u201cI don\u2019t really work in that sense. You\u2019re trying to make the thing feel as real as possible and really live through the scenes you\u2019re given.\u201d\n\nSet a decade or so before the original Star Wars, Ehrenreich\u2019s Solo is a wannabe pilot living on his grimy home planet and dreaming of escape with his girlfriend Qi\u2019ra (Game of Thrones\u2019 Emilia Clarke). What follows is one of the more freewheeling adventures in the Star Wars canon, as Han is mentored by Woody Harrelson\u2019s bandit Tobias Beckett and he meets his future Wookie copilot Chewbacca (Joonas Suotamo) and smuggler friend Lando Calrissian (Donald Glover).\n\nIt\u2019s not been smooth sailing, however, with the production parting company with original directors, The Lego Movie\u2019s Phil Lord and Christopher Miller. One report by online site Vulture claimed the pair haphazardly shot dozens of takes.\n\n\u201cThe original version of what we were going to do didn\u2019t work out so of course there is disappointment and I loved working with them,\u201d says Ehrenreich, diplomatically. \u201cBut then we were just so lucky to have Ron come in.\u201d\n\nHan and Chewbacca in \u2018Solo\u2019\n\nSo what was the first version like? Was it more broadly comic? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he continues. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously speculation that their version was this goofy whatever\u2026 we were still doing all the scenes.\u201d\n\nThere was improvisation with Lord and Miller but also with Howard. \u201cI\u2019m not a great person to speak to that because I wasn\u2019t seeing any of that cut together. I never saw what their version would\u2019ve been, so I don\u2019t really know.\u201d\n\nCritics have been kind to Ehrenreich (\u201cenduringly watchable\u201d said Variety) but how does he feel about the next step \u2013 losing his anonymity?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know when that thing happens,\u201d he shrugs. \u201cIs it the day the movie comes out? Is it when the posters go up? I don\u2019t know when all that happens or how that happens.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s totally unappealing to me in and of itself. I\u2019m not at all looking forward to that in any kind of way if that happens. But you do this and you sign up for it. It\u2019s another one of these things you learn to live with.\u201d\n\nWhile there is talk of further Solo instalments (Ehrenreich is signed up for three films and is more than willing to continue as Han), he\u2019s also editing a short film he\u2019s directed. \u201cI think I will make one more short and do a feature some time, within the next year and a half. It\u2019s a matter of finding the right story, gathering material. I\u2019m in the process of looking at a bunch of different stories right now, and finding a writer and putting it together like that.\u201d\n\nAs for his private life, he keeps it very quiet. At one point he was rumoured to be dating actor Kelsey McNamee (who had a tiny role in the Reese Witherspoon rom-dram Water For Elephants). And now \u2013 is there a special someone in his life?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a good question,\u201d he says, with a smirk. \u201cProbably Chewbacca!\u201d\n\n\u2018Solo: A Star Wars Story\u2019 opens 24 May", "images": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/img/third-party/Amazon_Prime.svg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/12/alden-ehrenreich.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/12/alden-ehrenreich.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/12/alden-ehrenreich.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["James Mottram"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/solo-star-wars-alden-ehrenreich-harrison-ford-ron-howard-a8363121.html", "title": "Alden Ehrenreich on playing Han Solo: Harrison Ford taught me 'everything I need to know'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The actor talks candidly about\u00a0entering the Star Wars universe, Solo\u2019s change of director, and\u00a0dealing with fame", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Features", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/films/features", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-05-22T13:21:55.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Alden Ehrenreich on playing Han Solo: Harrison Ford taught me 'everything I need to know'", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/features/solo-star-wars-alden-ehrenreich-harrison-ford-ron-howard-a8363121.html", "type": "article", "description": "The actor talks candidly about\u00a0entering the Star Wars universe, Solo\u2019s change of director, and\u00a0dealing with fame", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/12/alden-ehrenreich.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/12/alden-ehrenreich.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-22T13:21:55.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-22T13:21:55.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Film", "author_name": "James Mottram", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 1373, "image_count": 6, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2018-05-22T13:21:55.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Alden Ehrenreich on playing Han Solo: Harrison Ford taught me 'everything I need to know'", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The actor talks candidly about\u00a0entering the Star Wars universe, Solo\u2019s change of director, and\u00a0dealing with fame", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/05/22/12/alden-ehrenreich.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Solo: A Star Wars Story,Star Wars,Alden Ehrenreich,Ron Howard,Harrison Ford,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526995315.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
