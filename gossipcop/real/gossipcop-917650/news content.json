Simpson recounted the \u201chypothetical\u201d way he might have killed his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend, Ron Goldman, in a controversial two-hour special on Fox Sunday night, aptly titled, O.J. Simpson: The Lost Confession?\n\nOver the course of the special, Simpson described to publisher Judith Regan, in increasing detail, the series of events that could have hypothetically led to Nicole and Goldman\u2019s 1994 deaths. He made mention of a friend named \u201cCharlie\u201d who was with him at the time of the murders, though at certain points throughout the interview, he alternated between talking about Charlie and speaking in the first person.\n\nThe interview was originally conducted in 2006 in supposed conjunction with the release of his book, If I Did It. Backlash over both the proposed Fox special and the book quashed both before they could reach the public, but on Sunday, the footage finally aired, to mixed reviews. (If I Did It was eventually published by Beafort Books in September 2007, and the Goldman family won 90 percent of the proceeds of the sale of the book rights; an attorney for the Goldman family said they \u201cwelcomed\u201d the airing of the tapes, saying that the special allowed \u201ceveryone to make their own judgment.\u201d)\n\n\u201cI think Charlie is O.J. This is no hypothetical,\u201d said Christopher Darden, who was one of the prosecutors in the 1994 trial and also part of a panel of experts on Sunday night\u2019s special. \u201cI think he confessed to murder.\u201d\n\nMalcolm LaVergne, Simpson\u2019s current attorney, said Monday the idea that the hypothetical account amounted to a confession was \u201ca joke.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis was scripted by Judith Regan, the publisher of the book,\u201d LaVergne told CBS This Morning. \u201cMr. Simpson went along because quite frankly, he got a lot of money up front to go along with this.\u201d\n\nSimpson\u2019s own take on speaking out about a hypothetical murder appeared to be one of acceptance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very difficult for me because it\u2019s hypothetical,\u201d he said during the interview. \u201cI know and I accept the fact that people are going to feel whatever way they gonna feel.\u201d Here, the five most WTF moments from the Sunday night special.\n\nSimpson said that though Nicole and Goldman were \u201cphysically dead,\u201d they had essentially \u201ckilled\u201d him too.\n\nThe former NFL running back told Regan that he felt conflicted about his feelings toward Nicole and that he was worried that she was \u201closing herself\u201d following their divorce. When Regan asked him point-blank whether he felt lost as well, he responded with a surprisingly phrased answer: \u201cIn many ways, yeah. It was almost like Ron and Nicole were physically dead and it\u2019s almost like they killed me. Who I was was attacked and murdered also in that short period of time.\u201d He also said it \u201creally, really bothered\u201d him that a lot of people seemed to want him to be convicted of the murders.\n\nSimpson\u2019s friend \u201cCharlie\u201d was the one who alerted him to go to Nicole\u2019s house that day.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know why he had been by Nicole\u2019s house, but he told me, \u2018You wouldn\u2019t believe what\u2019s going on over there,'\u201d Simpson said. \u201cAnd I thought, \u2018Whatever\u2019s going on over there\u2019s gotta stop.'\u201d So, according to Simpson, both he and Charlie got into his infamous white Bronco and drove to Nicole\u2019s house. Once they had parked in a nearby alleyway, Simpson said he pulled a knife out from under his seat and \u201cI believe [Charlie] took it.\u201d\n\n\u201cCharlie\u201d may have been Simpson\u2019s imaginary friend or a second side to Simpson\u2019s personality, executive producer Terry Wrong told Fox in a teleconference; and though he appeared in the book If I Did It, it\u2019s important to note that Charlie was never mentioned in the actual 1994 court case.\n\nHe talked about \u201cblood and stuff\u201d that was at the scene of the crime and laughingly reminded Regan that he was speaking in hypotheticals.\n\n\u201cAs things got heated, I just remember Nicole fell and hurt herself and this guy kind of got into this karate thing,\u201d he said, describing the hypothetical moment when the confrontation escalated. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018Well, you think you can kick my ass?\u2019 And I remember I grabbed the knife \u2013 I do remember that portion, taking a knife from Charlie \u2013 and to be honest after that I don\u2019t remember, except I\u2019m standing there and there\u2019s all kind of stuff around and \u2026\u201d As he trailed off, Regan picked up the thread and asked, \u201cWhat kind of stuff?\u201d to which he replied, \u201cBlood and stuff.\u201d\n\nHe then added with a laugh, \u201cI hate to say this, but this is hypothetical. I don\u2019t think any two people could be murdered the way they were without everybody being covered in blood.\u201d\n\nAt times, Simpson used verb tenses that sounded more definitive than speculative.\n\nWhen Regan asked Simpson about the infamous glove that was left at the scene of the crime, and the passage in his book that said he removed it before taking the knife from Charlie, Simpson spoke in first person. \u201cYou know, I have no conscious memory of doing that [removing the glove] but obviously I must have because they found the glove there,\u201d he said. No murder weapon was ever found, though police officials have continued to look for one as recently as 2016.\n\nHe described in excruciating detail the process of getting rid of the evidence.\n\nSimpsons recalled having to dispose of bloody clothes following the hypothetical killing. When Regan asked Simpson directly, \u201cAnd you had left your keys and wallet in your pants pocket and you had to go back and get it?\u201d a momentarily stumped Simpson replied, \u201cYou know, to be honest, I think \u2013 I know that to be true, yes.\u201d Regan immediately followed up by asking him whether he believed in heaven and hell, and whether he thought he would see his late wife again someday. \u201cYes,\u201d he replied confidently. \u201cHey, look, I\u2019ve cursed her. I\u2019ve been to her gravesite and why \u2013 what the hell? Look at these kids. Look at Sydney with no mother. I\u2019ve done that. I\u2019ve done that.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/oj-simpson-confession-fox-moments-wtf-read-2018-e5701fad-a8c9-4ad7-9b00-824b81695c7b.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/oj-simpson-confession-fox-moments-wtf-read-2018-e5701fad-a8c9-4ad7-9b00-824b81695c7b.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/tv-movies/tv-movie-recaps/o-j-simpson-the-lost-confession-5-wtf-moments-124047/", "title": "\u2018O.J.
