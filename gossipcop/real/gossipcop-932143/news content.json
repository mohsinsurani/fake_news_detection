Thomas was reportedly back in the hospital on Tuesday undergoing a series of tests.\n\nHe had come forward on Monday and said he wasn\u2019t going to be a part of Markle and Prince Harry\u2019s nuptials because he didn\u2019t want to embarrass her following the paparazzi photo controversy. But Thomas reportedly slept on it and changed his mind Tuesday morning.\n\n\u201cOf course I\u2019d walk her down the aisle,\u201d he told TMZ. \u201cThis is a historic moment.\u201d\n\nWhile Thomas initially thought the surgery wouldn\u2019t complicate things, he said he now realizes how hard it would be to make the trip across the Pond.\n\nIn response to her father not making it, a spokesman for Kensington Palace released a statement late Monday saying: \u201cThis is a deeply personal moment for Ms. Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr. Markle in this difficult situation.\u201d\n\nThomas told TMZ that his daughter called him on Monday, but he missed the call. She reportedly texted him and said she loved him, was concerned about his health, and didn\u2019t blame him for the staged photos.\n\nThe Daily Mail revealed Sunday that Thomas secretly collaborated with a paparazzi agency to set up the pics, which showed him reading stories about his daughter\u2019s wedding and getting fitted for a suit.\n\nSources told The Post that he was \u201cset up\u201d by the LA-based company, identified as the Coleman-Rayner News Picture Agency.\n\nThey apparently took pics of Thomas drinking and entering a fleabag hotel \u2014 and threatened to release them if he didn\u2019t agree to pose for them.\n\n\u201cThey told him if he posed, they wouldn\u2019t put out the other pictures,\u201d a source explained. \u201cThey told him they\u2019d make him look good. They also gave him a few bucks for his trouble.\u201d\n\nColeman-Rayner did not immediately return calls or emails seeking comment about the alleged setup.\n\nWhile Queen Elizabeth II was reportedly \u201cvery angry\u201d about the photo controversy, Thomas told TMZ he didn\u2019t think she really cared at all.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the queen is thinking about what I\u2019m doing,\u201d he said.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/meghan-markle-dad.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/meghan-markle-dad.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/meghan-markle-dad.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/05/15/meghan-markles-dad-is-having-heart-surgery-cant-make-wedding-after-all/", "title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s dad won\u2019t attend royal wedding after all", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
