And, according to its star and co-creator, Rachel Bloom, that fourth run will be its final season.\n\n\u201cJust turned on my Wifi on our flight to Chicago and found out that #CrazyExGirlfriend has been renewed for a final season,\u201d Bloom tweeted Monday.\n\nThe CW declined comment on if season four will indeed be the show\u2019s endgame. A formal announcement on that is expected to come closer to May\u2019s upfronts, when the broadcast networks pitch their schedules to Madison Avenue ad buyers.\n\nStill, that Crazy would end with its fourth season should come as no surprise. Following the season one finale, Bloom told The Hollywood Reporter that her \u201cideal number\u201d of seasons is \u201caround four.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re a show about a very specific journey in a person\u2019s life. And it\u2019s not really a sitcom meant to spit out copies of itself,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cVery early on, we called it a 50-hour movie. I think we\u2019re beyond that now. There\u2019s always going to be plot movement, so there\u2019s only so far I think you can go with that. It could be five, but I think around four would be ideal for us creatively.\u201d\n\nWith its third season ending in February, Crazy has aired a total of 44 episodes. (Season one was 18 episodes, while two and three were 13 each.) Still, an abbreviated run could be considered likely for the newly announced fourth season.\n\nWhat Crazy lacked in overall viewers, the series, which was originally developed as a half-hour comedy for CW corporate sibling Showtime, made up for with critical and awards season love. One of the lowest-rated series on broadcast, Crazy has been an Emmy player for its original music and choreography, and Bloom won a Golden Globe for her starring role, among other accolades.\n\nNext season could see also The CW wrap Jane the Virgin after star Gina Rodriguez recently said the series would return for a \u201cfinal season.\u201d A formal announcement on that could also come in May.\n\nNext season will see The CW expand to a sixth night of originals (on Sundays). All told, the network renewed 10 shows Monday and has a record nine pilots as well as a spinoff of The Originals in contention for 2018-19. Still to be determined are the fates of The 100 and iZombie, with rookies Valor and Life Sentence both considered unlikely to return.\n\nKeep track of all the latest renewals and cancellations with THR\u2018s handy scorecardand of all the pilot pickups with our handy guide.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ceg311b_0353b_copy_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ceg311b_0353b_copy_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/crazy-girlfriend-end-season-4-rachel-bloom-says-1099019/", "title": "\u2018Crazy Ex-Girlfriend\u2019 to End With Season 4, Rachel Bloom Says", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The CW announced the renewal Monday but has yet to confirm the show's endgame.", "news_keywords": "Crazy Ex-Girlfriend, Rachel Bloom, The CW", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1099019, "title": "'Crazy Ex-Girlfriend' to End With Season 4, Rachel Bloom Says", "published_at": "2018-04-02 12:16:28", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ceg311b_0353b_copy_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The CW", "topics": "TV News", "body": "The end of the road for The CW's Crazy Ex-Girlfriend is in sight.\r\nOn Monday, the younger-skewing broadcast network announced that Crazy will return for a fourth run in the 2018-19 season.
