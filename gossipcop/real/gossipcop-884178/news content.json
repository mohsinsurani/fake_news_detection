The event took place at the Calamigos Beach Club in Malibu.\n\nDuring the party, the name of their son was revealed as Kenzo. And to celebrate that, Hart wore clothing from the brand Kenzo, the little one\u2019s name was emblazoned on the photo booth wall, and \u201cKENZO\u201d was spelled out on top of the dessert table in big blue letters.\n\nUpdates of the event were shared on Snapchat throughout the day, where Kevin did his best to show that he and Eniko are doing just fine following the controversial cheating and extortion scandal she had to deal with earlier this month.\n\nBefore the celebration took place, there was a report that the star had dished out $118,000 for the baby shower. Despite that though, they cut corners on the animals, opting for golden retrievers with faux lion manes as opposed to actual big cats. Kevin joked about it in a Snapchat video.\n\n\u201cWe couldn\u2019t afford a lion, so we just got a dog and put the thing around the dog,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s still ballin\u2019, it\u2019s just on a budget.\u201d\n\nThis will be the first child for Eniko, 33, and the third for Kevin, 38, who has Heavenly and Hendrix from his marriage to Torrei Hart. His kids were present to help celebrate their new baby brother.\n\nWhen speaking to Good Morning America about expecting another child back in June, Hart joked that despite it being something he planned with Eniko, he wasn\u2019t ready to be a dad again.\n\n\u201cI kept buying dogs. I held off for a long time,\u201d Hart said. \u201cEvery time she brought a baby up, I just showed up with a dog. Eventually, she was like, \u2018No. I want to have a kid.\u2019 I was like, \u2018I got two kids. We\u2019re married. My kids are your kids.\u2019 She was like, \u2018I know, but they\u2019re grown. I want new ones.\u2019 I was like, \u2018Stop talking about my kids like they\u2019re used cars.\u2019 I was like \u2018Alright, no, I get it. You\u2019re absolutely right. I want to have a baby.\u2019 So then we decided to have a baby. We actually planned it.\u201d\n\nAnd he\u2019s a-comin\u2019!\n\nCheck out pictures from the event below, which, all things considered, looked like it turned out quite lovely:\n\n#Harts #Family #LiveLoveLaugh #DopePic A post shared by Kevin Hart (@kevinhart4real) on Oct 2, 2017 at 8:07am PDT\n\n#EnikoHart's baby shower went on as planned, and she looked gorgeous\ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffd #KevinHart was there, making sure none of her friends ask her any questions about that little cheating scandal \ud83d\ude02\ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffe #TeaTENDERS A post shared by TeaTenders_LIV (@teatenders_liv) on Oct 2, 2017 at 4:01am PDT\n\n#PressPlay: #KevinHart & #Eniko's baby shower is too cute \ud83d\ude0d they're naming their son #Kenzo A post shared by The Shade Room (@theshaderoom) on Oct 1, 2017 at 4:58pm PDT", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/themes/mogmadamenoire/images/comment-bubble.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035391&c4=", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://dqk8ajncn0ugr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kevin-and-Eniko.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/themes/mogmadamenoire/images/madamenoire_logo_white.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/https://i2.wp.com/madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kevin-and-Eniko.jpg?resize=1068%2C602", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=187138648481959&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/themes/mogmadamenoire/images/madamenoire_logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://madamenoire.com/wp-content/themes/mogmadamenoire/images/ajax-loader.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://dqk8ajncn0ugr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kevin-and-Eniko.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria Uwumarogie"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145/http://madamenoire.com/843180/kevin-hart-baby-shower/", "title": "Kevin & Eniko Hart Had Their Baby Shower, And No, It Wasn't Awkward...", "meta_data": {"fb": {"admins": 100006356380901}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@MadameNoire", "title": "Kevin & Eniko Hart Celebrated Their Baby Shower This Weekend, And No, It Wasn't Awkward...", "description": "Ok, so it was a little awkward -- at least from the outside looking in.", "image": {"src": "https://i2.wp.com/madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kevin-and-Eniko.jpg?fit=660%2C372"}}, "description": "The Eniko and Kevin Hart baby shower took place this past weekend, and despite cheating and extortion scandals, it seemed like they had a great time.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kevin & Eniko Hart Had Their Baby Shower, And No, It Wasn't Awkward...", "description": "The Eniko and Kevin Hart baby shower took place this past weekend, and despite cheating and extortion scandals, it seemed like they had a great time.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145/http://madamenoire.com/843180/kevin-hart-baby-shower/", "site_name": "MadameNoire", "updated_time": "2017-10-02T13:13:59-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171002222145im_/http://dqk8ajncn0ugr.cloudfront.net/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kevin-and-Eniko.jpg", "width": 1068, "height": 602}}, "article": {"tag": "Kevin Hart", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2017-10-02T13:10:51-04:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-02T13:13:59-04:00"}, "generator": "WordPress 4.8.2", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-02 13:10:51", "sailthru.title": "Kevin & Eniko Hart Celebrated Their Baby Shower This Weekend, And No, It Wasn\u2019t Awkward\u2026", "sailthru.tags": "celebrity baby showers, eniko hart, Kevin Hart", "sailthru.author": "Victoria Uwumarogie", "sailthru.description": "Ok, so it was a little awkward -- at least from the outside looking in.", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i2.wp.com/madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kevin-and-Eniko.jpg?fit=1068%2C602", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i2.wp.com/madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/Kevin-and-Eniko.jpg?fit=50%2C28", "wp-parsely_version": "1.10.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i1.wp.com/madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/cropped-mn-favicon-1.png?fit=270%2C270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506964251.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
