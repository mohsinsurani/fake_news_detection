The character \u2013 13-year-old Cyrus Goodman, played by 15-year-old Joshua Rush \u2013 will begin his self-discovery in this Friday\u2019s second season one-hour premiere episode.\n\n\u201cAndi Mack is a story about \u2018tweens\u2019 figuring out who they are,\u201d said Disney Channel in a statement. \u201c(Creator) Terri Minsky, the cast and everyone involved in the show takes great care in ensuring that it\u2019s appropriate for all audiences and sends a powerful message about inclusion and respect for humanity.\u201d\n\nThe Walt Disney Co. released a general statement on stories and characters, which reads, in part, \u201cDisney remains committed to continuing to create characters that are accessible and relatable to all children.\u201d (Read that entire statement below.)\n\nThe coming-of-age series, starring Peyton Elizabeth Lee as the 13-year-old title character, premiered in March, becoming the top series of the year among girls (median age is 10) and #1 in its time period among all children ages six-14. It holds the top series spot on Disney Channel VOD, Disney Channel\u2019s DisneyNOW app and on Disney Channel UK.\n\nThe series, launching on Disney Channels around the world through mid-2018, was created by executive producer Minsky (Lizzie McGuire), and follows Andi as she comes to terms with news that Bex, the girl she thought was her older sister, is actually her mother.\n\nWith a realism not always evident on tween-focused programs, Andi Mack follows Andi, her family and her two best friends \u2013 Cyrus Goodman and Buffy Driscoll (Sofia Wylie) \u2013 as they navigate their lives.\n\nThe new season finds Andi hoping that her parents Bex (Lilan Bowden) and Bowie (Trent Garrett) will marry, while she also attempts to hash out her feelings for longtime crush Jonah Beck (Asher Angel).\n\nBut it\u2019s another storyline that\u2019s breaking Disney Channel ground: Cyrus begins to realize that he too has feelings for Jonah, a development that begins what a source describes as a journey to self-acceptance.\n\nIn the season premiere, Cyrus confides his feelings to a supportive Buffy, a scene intended to provide positive role models for children \u2013 and adults \u2013 watching.\n\nSubsequent episodes will follow Cyrus\u2019 ongoing story, which will include wrestling with how to tell his new girlfriend Iris.\n\nWe hear Minsky and Disney Channel, to ensure the story arc is age-appropriate and respectful, consulted with child development experts and was screened to organizations including GLAAD, PFLAG, The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy, and Common Sense Media.\n\nThe groups are effusive in their approval of the storyline:\n\n\u201cWith more and more young people coming out as LGBTQ, Andi Mack is reflecting the lives and lived experiences of so many LGBTQ youth around the country,\u201d said Sarah Kate Ellis, President and CEO of GLAAD. \u201cTelevision reflects the real life world and today that includes LGBTQ youth who deserve to see their lives depicted on their favorite shows. Disney has been a leader in LGBTQ inclusion and there are so many young people who will be excited to see Cyrus\u2019 story unfold.\u201d\n\nJaime M. Grant, Executive Director, PFLAG National, said, \u201cSharing one\u2019s innermost self can be challenging, and to do so as an adolescent can be particularly so, especially when in the midst of figuring it out for yourself. Coming out requires honest self-reflection, no small amount of bravery, and a safe place with at least one trusted person \u2013 a friend, a parent, a teacher \u2013 who can hold your confidence\u2026and your heart. Andi Mack\u2019s creative team captures this moment of revelation with such thought, care, and authenticity; it will be a memory moment for some, and a teachable moment for many.\u201d\n\nSaid Ginny Ehrlich, CEO, The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy: \u201cStarting conversations about trust, love, relationships and family dynamics is easier when a favorite TV show like Andi Mack explores them with humor and heart, and helps viewers figure out how they might handle similar situations. Andi Mack gives young people and their parents, mentors and champions a meaningful way to talk about these topics and the power to decide their futures.\u201d\n\nThe second season of Andi Mack premieres Friday, October 27 at 8 pm ET/PT on Disney Channel.
