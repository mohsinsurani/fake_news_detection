Fox has faced another health hurdle but is on the road to recovery. Time\n\nActor Michael J. Fox is recovering from recent spinal surgery unconnected to Parkinson's disease and the outlook is good, his spokeswoman said Friday.\n\n\"Michael J. Fox recently underwent spinal surgery unrelated to his Parkinson's,\" his rep, Leslie Sloane, said in a statement. \"He is recovering, feeling great, and looking forward to getting back on the golf course this summer.\"\n\nNo other details about Fox's surgery, including when it took place, were available.\n\nEarlier this month, the popular actor, 56, canceled an upcoming appearance at the Calgary Comics & Entertainment Expo (April 26-29), due to \"unforeseen circumstances,\" a Calgary Expo tweet said. He was to appear with castmates from the Back to the Future films.\n\nBesides the Future franchise, Fox is known for his work in Spin City, Family Ties, The Michael J. Fox Show and The Good Wife. He guest starred in this week's episode of ABC's Designated Survivor.\n\nFox was diagnosed with Parkinson's, which can result in body tremors and muscle rigidity, in the early 1990s. He has been a leader in efforts to help Parkinson's patients and to find a cure.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5774123615001_5774119533001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5da066e5cfa772995795ffa108a576c257b92b7b/c=0-331-3340-2218/local/-/media/2016/03/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635940915306962603--DIC-22.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5da066e5cfa772995795ffa108a576c257b92b7b/c=0-331-3340-2218/local/-/media/2016/03/20/USATODAY/USATODAY/635940915306962603--DIC-22.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Keveney"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/04/20/michael-j-fox-recovering-spinal-surgery-unrelated-parkinsons/538429002/", "title": "Michael J.
