The Arrow star posted an adorable photo of himself alongside his wife, Cassandra Jean, on Instagram from the music festival.\n\nAlongside the image, he wrote, \"Ever since we met in late 2011, my Wife has raved \u2013 no pun intended \u2013 about Coachella. I decided - in a semi-joking way \u2013 that I was going to hate it for no reason whatsoever. And I'd poke fun at her when the set list was released and she'd get excited. Then I'd ask her not to contact me at all during the weekend, again, jokingly.\"\n\nThe actor continued, \"And I DELIGHTED in the fact I knocked her up and she had to miss the festival for the first time in almost a decade. But then, in May of 2014, we fell in love with the desert... next thing you know we have a place there to relax during the Arrow season and host our friends and family.\"\n\nAlthough he hated the festival, without even visiting it, the Canadian actor decided to put his preconceived notions aside for his wife. Amell wrote, \"Then last year during Coachella, something felt different. She was at our house, with our friends, doing something she loves... without me. That's not how a marriage / friendship / partnership should work. If your Wife (or whatever) loves something, you should love it too. \"\n\nThe 35-year-old concluded the adorable post by saying, \" So I did something every spouse should learn to do: I admitted I was wrong and apologized in a very concise sentence with zero uses of the word \"but\", then asked to go. And we went. We did everything she wanted to do and I got to share an experience that brought us closer together because doing something your partner loves always helps you understand them better. What a weekend. Until next year. \u2600\ufe0f\u2764\"\n\nThe couple married in 2012. They have a 3-year-old daughter named Mavi Alexandra Jean Amell.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607277/lady-gaga-opens-about-her-mental-health-issues-prince-william-facetime-call.png?w=480&h=300&l=50&t=40?w=480&h=300&l=50&t=40&q=77", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607138/stephen-amell.jpg?w=400", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/thumb/1600112/jb.png?w=82&h=82&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607404/kevin-spacey.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607004/harry-styles-snl.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1605336/harry-styles.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607362/mick-philpott.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1456143/martian.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607509/riz-ahmed.png?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607439/jeff-bridges-kingsman-golden-circle.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1604010/kim-kardashian.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607319/meghan-markle-prince-harry.jpg?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607417/ryan-reynolds.png?w=166&h=112&l=50&t=40", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://g.ibtimes.co.uk/www/img/home/ibtimes-logo-scroll.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607138/stephen-amell.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607138/stephen-amell.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ruchinka Upadhyaya"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/arrows-stephen-amell-reveals-why-he-hated-coachella-adorable-post-wife-1617342", "title": "Arrow's Stephen Amell reveals how Coachella reaffirmed his love for wife in adorable post", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "Author": "Ruchinka Upadhyaya", "keywords": "Stephen Amell,Stephen Amell instagram,Stephen Amell as Arrow,Stephen Amell on Arrow season 5,Stephen Amell in Coachella,Stephen Amell news,Stephen Amell instagram post,Stephen Amell social media", "description": "Amell attended the Coachella music festival with his wife Cassandra.", "article": {"author": "http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/reporters/ruchinka-upadhyaya", "section": "Celebrity", "tag": "Stephen Amell as Arrow", "published_time": "2017-04-18T06:48:41+01:00", "modified_time": "2017-04-18T12:05:06+01:00"}, "og": {"title": "Arrow's Stephen Amell reveals how Coachella reaffirmed his love for wife in adorable post", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/arrows-stephen-amell-reveals-why-he-hated-coachella-adorable-post-wife-1617342", "site_name": "International Business Times UK", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/http://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607138/stephen-amell.jpg", "secure_url": "https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607138/stephen-amell.jpg"}, "description": "Amell attended the Coachella music festival with his wife Cassandra."}, "fb": {"app_id": 133405490194030}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@IBTimesUK", "creator": "@IBTimesUK", "title": "Arrow's Stephen Amell reveals how Coachella reaffirmed his love for wife in adorable post", "description": "Amell attended the Coachella music festival with his wife Cassandra.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170419105118im_/https://d.ibtimes.co.uk/en/full/1607138/stephen-amell.jpg"}, "news_keywords": "Celebrity,Stephen Amell,Stephen Amell instagram,Stephen Amell as Arrow,Stephen Amell on Arrow season 5,Stephen Amell in Coachella,Stephen Amell news,Stephen Amell instagram post,Stephen Amell social media", "Googlebot-news": "index, follow", "robots": "index, follow", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,ibtimes.co.uk,newsweek.com,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk", "com.silverpop.cothost": "pod6.ibmmarketingcloud.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492494521.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
