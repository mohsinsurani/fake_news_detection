The shocking footage sparked a Twitter backlash with the hashtag #SaveKaiser and cost the mother-of-three her job as an ambassador with Blue Apron.\n\nIn her memoir, Read Between the Lines: From the Diary of a Teenage Mom, Ms Evans admitted that at the peak of her drug addiction she was using heroin \u201cfour or five times a day\u201d.\n\n\u201cI was hooked,\u201d she said of her abusive relationship, which saw her arrested for possession of marijuana and heroin, according to Radar.\n\nThis week, Ms Evans appeared on The Brand podcast and admitted that while she was pregnant with daughter Ensley, she tested positive for THC, the principal psychoactive found in cannabis.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lie about that. I tested positive for THC,\u201d the reality star, 26, said.\n\nDaughter Ensley did not test positive.\n\nMs Evans said the chemical compound was found shortly after she had given birth to her daughter just over one year ago after Child Protective Services asked her if she had smoked during her pregnancy.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I did within the past 30 days,\u2019\u201d she explained.\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018I have really bad esophageal spasms and I throw up every five minutes. I can\u2019t eat.\u2019 And they said, \u2018OK, some mums do that. We are not here to judge. We are writing down your information.\u2019\u201d\n\nShe said that when Child Protective Services arrived for the wellness check, they closed the case soon after.\n\nBut then Ms Evans blamed online speculation over her parenting for at least 30 more visits from Child Protection, calling out \u201chaters online saying that I abuse my kids\u201d.\n\nDespite promising she\u2019s not using, viewers on the hit reality show, on which Ms Evans has appeared since 2011, aren\u2019t so sure.\n\nAll jokes aside, someone should go to the land and make sure that those kids (more so Kaiser) are in a safe situation. They do not deserve to be witnessing what\u2019s more than likely going on in their home.. #SaveKaiser #TeenMom2 #TeenMomOG #JenelleEvans #DavidEason \u2014 leeeasha (@leashaboo89) February 21, 2018\n\n\u201cFirst of all, if I were on drugs I wouldn\u2019t be able to sit here in the morning and get the kids ready and eat healthily. Or I\u2019d be losing a lot of weight,\u201d Ms Evans said.\n\nBut the young mum, who already has two children, sons Jace, 8, and Kaiser, 3 has a sketchy history with drug abuse, including a near-fatal heroin overdose in 2012.\n\n\u201cI was afraid to speak out and tell people that I was on drugs,\u201d she told Us Weekly last year,\n\n\u201cI basically blacked out and woke up not remembering anything.\n\n\u201cI really was so close to dying.\u201d\n\nAfter her overdose Ms Evans described how she withdrew from the drug, describing it as \u201cworst flu I\u2019ve ever had for seven days\u201d.\n\nBut by that stage the drug had already taken its toll; she had lost custody of son Jace and was \u201cdisowned\u201d by family and friends.\n\n\u201cIt hurt my heart, made me sick to my soul that I couldn\u2019t see my son. I filled that hateful void with more drugs,\u201d she wrote in her memoir.\n\n\u201cThe drugs always made the pain go away. They didn\u2019t turn on me or betray me. I guess heroin was my first steady, dependable lover. It gave me what I needed to live and I gave it my life. By this entry, heroin was the only thing I had in my life that loved me.\u201d\n\nAccording to Kidspot, a report published in the Journal of the American Medical Association claimed that the rate of pregnant women using marijuana has increased 62 per cent\n\nMarijuana is the \u201cmost widely used illicit drug among all pregnant women\u201d, the website claims, and said there is \u201csome cause for concern\u201d of the effects of marijuana on a foetus.\n\n\u201cInfants of women who used marijuana during pregnancy were more likely to be anaemic, have lower birth weight, and require placement in neonatal intensive care than infants of mothers who did not use marijuana,\u201d Dr Nora Volkow wrote in a paper, The Risks of Marijuana Use During Pregnancy, for the JAMA Network.\n\n\u2014
