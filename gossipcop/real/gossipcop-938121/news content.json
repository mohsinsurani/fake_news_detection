Adam Levine and Blake Shelton returned for their fourteenth season as coaches. Meanwhile, Alicia Keys returned for her third season after a one-season hiatus replacing Jennifer Hudson, alongside new coach Kelly Clarkson replacing Miley Cyrus.[1]\n\nThis season featured two new elements: the Block, added during the Blind Auditions, allows the coaches to block one coach from getting an artist the coach turned around for.[2] The Save, added during the Knockouts, allowed a coach to save an artist from elimination; However, if another coach also pressed his or her Steal button, the contestant could then decide whether they wanted to go to a new team or stay with their coach.[1]\n\nOn May 22, 2018, Brynn Cartelli was crowned the winner of The Voice. At age 15, Cartelli became the youngest winner in the show's history[3] surpassing Sawyer Fredericks & Danielle Bradbery at 16;[4] Clarkson became the first new coach to win on her first attempt and the third female coach to win a season (being Alicia Keys and Christina Aguilera). Additionally, runner-up Britton Buchanan became the highest-placing artist who advanced via an Instant Save, following Joshua Davis of season eight and Chris Jamison of season seven, who both placed third.[3]\n\nThe fourteenth season was also notable when Levine selected Angel Bonilla, the first transgender contestant to turn a chair in the American version.\n\nCoaches and hosts [ edit ]\n\nThe coaching lineup changed once again for the fourteenth season. Adam Levine and Blake Shelton returned as coaches, making them the only members of the coaching panel to be part of all fourteen seasons. Miley Cyrus and Jennifer Hudson did not return and were replaced by new coach Kelly Clarkson, who was Team Blake's battle advisor in the second season and key advisor for the Knockout Rounds in thirteenth season, and Alicia Keys who returned to the panel after a one season absence and participating in her third season as coach, Carson Daly returned for his fourteenth season as host.[5]\n\nThis season's advisors for the Battle Rounds were Julia Michaels for Team Adam, Shawn Mendes for Team Alicia, Hailee Steinfeld for Team Kelly, and Trace Adkins for Team Blake.[6]\n\nThe coaches perform a medley set in vintage Las Vegas in the promo. Adam Levine and Blake Shelton duet on \"Fly Me to the Moon\", Kelly Clarkson and Alicia Keys perform an amazing version of \"Feeling Good\".[7]\n\n\u00b7 Notes: At nineteen, Shawn Mendes became the youngest advisor on the American version of this show's history.\n\nTeams [ edit ]\n\nColor key\n\nWinner\n\nWinner Runner-up\n\nRunner-up Third place\n\nThird place Fourth place\n\nFourth place Eliminated in Live Shows\n\nEliminated in Live Shows Eliminated in the Live Playoffs Stolen in the Knockout rounds\n\nStolen in the Knockout rounds Eliminated in The Knockouts\n\nEliminated in The Knockouts Stolen in the Battle rounds\n\nStolen in the Battle rounds Eliminated in the Battle rounds\n\nEliminated in the Battle rounds Withdrew\n\nCoaches Top 48 artists Adam Levine Rayshun LaMarr Jackie Verna Sharane Calister Mia Boostrom Drew Cole Reid Umstattd Gary Edwards Jackie Foster Jordyn Simone Miya Bass Tish Haynes Keys Angel Bonilla Stephanie Skipper Genesis Diaz Davison Alicia Keys Britton Buchanan Jackie Foster Christiana Danielle Johnny Bliss Terrence Cunningham Kelsea Johnson Sharane Calister Dallas Caroline Miya Bass Jaclyn Lovey Jordyn Simone Livia Faith Megan Lee Shana Halligan Jamai Kelly Clarkson Brynn Cartelli Kaleb Lee D.R.

The coaches can each steal one losing artist from another team and save one artist who lost their Knockout on their own team. The top 24 contestants then moved on to the Live Playoffs.\n\nFor the first time ever in The Voice history, recent winners of the show returned as Key Advisors \u2014 Jordan Smith for Team Adam, Chris Blue for Team Alicia, Cassadee Pope for Team Kelly, and Chloe Kohanski for Team Blake.[9]\n\nColor key:\n\nArtist won the Knockout and advanced to the Live Playoffs Artist lost the Knockout but was stolen by another coach and advanced to the Live Playoffs Artist lost the Knockout but was saved by their coach and advanced to the Live Playoffs Artist lost the Knockout and was Eliminated\n\nLive Shows [ edit ]\n\nColor key:\n\nArtist was saved by the Public's votes Artist was placed in the bottom two, bottom three, or middle three or was saved by the coach Artist was saved by the Instant Save Artist's iTunes vote multiplied by 5 (except The Finals) after his/her studio version of the song reached iTunes top 10 Artist was eliminated\n\nWeek 1: Live Playoffs (April 16, 17, and 18) [ edit ]\n\nFor the first time, the Live Playoffs were split into two rounds and introduced immunity to the highest vote-getters to advance to the Top 12 in Round 1.\n\nRound 1 [ edit ]\n\nDuring the first round of the Live Playoffs, the Top 24 performed for the votes of the public. The artist with the highest number of votes on each team directly advanced to the Top 12, exempting from performing (and immune from elimination in) round 2.\n\nColor key:\n\nArtist received the highest number of votes on his/her team and directly advanced to the Top 12 Artist was not chosen by the public and was left to perform again in Round 2\n\nRound 2 [ edit ]\n\nFor Tuesday and Wednesday nights, the 20 remaining artists performed a second time for the votes of the public (separate from the previous round's votes). The artist with the highest number of votes on each team advances, and a third decided by the coach itself.\n\nColor key:\n\nArtist received the Public's vote and advanced to the Top 12 Artist was selected by their coach to advance to the Top 12 Artist was eliminated\n\nWeek 2: Top 12 (April 23 & 24) [ edit ]\n\nThis week's theme was \u201cStory Behind The Song\u201d. The two artists with the fewest votes competed for an Instant Save, with one artist eliminated from the competition. No artists received the iTunes vote multiplier this week as none of the singles reached the Top 10 iTunes.\n\nWeek 3: Top 11 (April 30 & May 1) [ edit ]\n\nThe theme for this week was \"Fan Night\", meaning that the artists performed songs chosen by the fans.\n\niTunes bonuses were awarded to Pryor Baird (#4) and Britton Buchanan (#6).[10]\n\nWeek 4: Top 10 (May 7 & 8) [ edit ]\n\nThe theme for this week was \u201cOvercoming Struggles\u201d. This week featured double elimination and a bottom three facing Instant Save.\n\niTunes bonuses were awarded to Kyla Jade (#5), Brynn Cartelli (#8),Buchanan (#9) and Baird (#10).[11]\n\nWeek 5: Semifinals (May 14 & 15) [ edit ]\n\nThe Top 8 performed on Monday, May 14, 2018, with the results following on Tuesday, May 15, 2018. This week's theme is \"Duet Medley Songs\".[12] In the semifinals, three artists automatically moved on to next week's finale, the two artists with the fewest votes were immediately eliminated and the middle three contended for the remaining spot in next week's finale via the Instant Save. iTunes bonuses were awarded to Jade (#2), Buchanan (#3), Cartelli (#4), Kaleb Lee (#5), Baird (#7) and Spensha Baker (#10).[13] In addition to their individual songs, each artist performed a duet with another artist in the competition, though these duets were not available for purchase on iTunes.\n\nWith the elimination of Rayshun LaMarr, Levine no longer had any artists remaining on his team, making it the first time since the fourth season (and the third time overall, with the first time being the third season)) in which none of his artists represented him in the finale. With the advancement of Cartelli to the finale, Clarkson became the third new coach to successfully get an artist on their team to the finale on their first attempt as a coach, the second being Alicia Keys, who coached W\u00e9 McDonald all the way to the finale of the eleventh season, and the first being Usher, who coached Michelle Chamuel all the way to the finale of the fourth season. This also marked the first time ever that two female coaches were represented in the finale, with Cartelli representing Clarkson, and Buchanan representing Keys.\n\nWeek 6: Finale (May 21 & 22) [ edit ]\n\nThe Final 4 performed on Monday, May 21, 2018, with the final results following on Tuesday, May 22, 2018. Finalists performed a solo cover song, a duet with their coach, and an original song. iTunes bonuses were awarded to Buchanan (#1 and #10), Cartelli (#3 and #6), Baker (#4) and Jade (#9).[14] Buchanan's \"Where You Come From\" and Cartelli's \"Walk My Way\" are the only songs that charted #1 on iTunes.\n\nThis is the first time that an artist who won the Instant Save in the semifinals didn't finish in the bottom two in the finals, with Buchanan finishing second. With Buchanan and Cartelli making it to the Top 2, this marked the first time in which the final results came down to two artists who have neither represented Shelton nor Levine, but two female coaches (Buchanan representing Alicia Keys, and Cartelli representing Kelly Clarkson), as well as the two coaches in the \"middle chairs.\"\n\nElimination chart [ edit ]\n\nColor key [ edit ]\n\nArtist's info\n\nTeam Adam\n\nTeam Adam Team Alicia Team Kelly\n\nTeam Kelly Team Blake\n\nResults details\n\nWinner\n\nWinner Runner-up\n\nRunner-up Third place\n\nThird place Fourth place Saved by Instant Save (via Twitter)\n\nSaved by Instant Save (via Twitter) Saved by the public\n\nSaved by the public Saved by their coach Artist did not receive immunity\n\nArtist did not receive immunity Immune\n\nImmune Eliminated Artist received one or more iTunes bonus that week\n\nArtist received one or more iTunes bonus that week Number of iTunes bonuses received\n\nOverall [ edit ]\n\nLive Show Results per week Artist Week 1 Playoffs Week 2 Week 3 Week 4 Week 5 Week 6 Finale Round 1 Round 2 Brynn Cartelli Safe Immune Safe Safe Safe Safe Winner Britton Buchanan Safe Immune Safe Safe Safe Safe Runner-up Kyla Jade Safe Immune Safe Safe Safe Safe 3rd place Spensha Baker Not Chosen Safe Safe Safe Safe Safe 4th place Pryor Baird Not Chosen Safe Safe Safe Safe Eliminated Eliminated (Week 5) Kaleb Lee Not Chosen Safe Safe Safe Safe Eliminated Jackie Foster Not Chosen Safe Safe Safe Safe Eliminated Rayshun LaMarr Not Chosen Safe Safe Safe Safe Eliminated Christiana Danielle Not Chosen Safe Safe Safe Eliminated Eliminated (Week 4) Jackie Verna Not Chosen Safe Safe Safe Eliminated Sharane Calister Safe Immune Safe Eliminated Eliminated (Week 3) D.R.
