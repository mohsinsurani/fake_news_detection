And that\u2019s kind of unfortunate,\u201d she said. \u201cSo I just want to encourage everyone to support real music and real artists because everyone deserves the same shot.\u201d\n\n\u201cI meant everything I said about everyone deserving the same shot,\u201d she added on Instagram. \u201cThere is a big issue in the industry that perpetuates the idea that an artist\u2019s talent and hard work should take a back seat to popularity and numbers. And I\u2019m aware that my music wasn\u2019t released yesterday, I\u2019m aware that, yes, my music has become fairly popular in the last year. But I\u2019m trying very hard to use the platform I\u2019ve been given to talk about these things and bring light to issues that aren\u2019t fair, all while trying to make the most of the weird, amazing success I\u2019ve been lucky enough to have.\u201d\n\nKevin Winter/Getty\n\nElsewhere in her note, Cara said that she\u2019s already beat her haters to the punch when it comes to criticizing her worth as an artist.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s something fun! I\u2019ve been thinking I suck since I was old enough to know what sucking meant. I\u2019ve beat u to it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why this means a lot to me. Despite my 183,625 insecurities, I\u2019ve been shown that what I\u2019ve created is worth something and that people actually give a s\u2014.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll of the years feeling like I wasn\u2019t good at anything or that I was na\u00efve for dreaming about something improbable have paid off in a way that I have yet to process,\u201d she continued. \u201cI know it sounds cheesy and dumb but it\u2019s the honest truth. Thanks to everyone who\u2019s shown me kindness and support along the way. I\u2019ll stop talking now.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kesha Delivers Emotional Performance of \u2018Praying\u2019 with Cyndi Lauper & Camila Cabello at Grammys\n\nIn addition to best new artist, Cara
