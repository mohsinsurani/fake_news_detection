Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, The Sinner.\n\n\u201cOK, I know I\u2019m not exactly fair and maybe biased here, but my wife\u2019s new show \u2013 @thesinnerusa \u2013 is amazing,\u201d the 10-time Grammy winner, 36, captioned a trailer for the eight-episode USA Network crime drama. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing I\u2019ve seen her in before, and she\u2019s incredible in the role. You should check it out when it premieres Wednesday on USA. \u2013JT.\u201d\n\nThe actress, 35, plays Cora, a young mother living in upstate New York who commits a brutal act of violence against a stranger. The series, which many critics are calling a \u201cwhydunit\u201d rather than a \u201cwhodunit,\u201d follows Cora and her inner struggles as viewers attempt to decipher whether her crime was motivated. \u201cI just did it. And I don\u2019t know why,\u201d a blood-soaked Cora says in one teaser.\n\nBiel opened up about The Sinner, which is based on Petra Hammesfahr\u2018s 2008 novel of the same name, during a recent appearance on the Today show. \u201cWe are not looking for who, we are looking for why,\u201d she said of the plot. \u201cWhy did this seemingly normal young woman who has a family and a child and husband, why did she do this horrific act? \u2026 We all as human beings have the possibility to snap and we don\u2019t do it. But what makes us cross the line?\u201d\n\nThe 7th Heaven alum also revealed how she\u2019d react if her and Timberlake\u2019s 2-year-old son, Silas, decides to become an actor one day. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to say no because I was given so many opportunities and my family was so supportive of everything, even when I was so young. But it\u2019s hard to say yes because it\u2019s such an intense experience,\u201d she said on Today. \u201cIt\u2019s a tough business. It\u2019s a ruthless business. I would be hesitant if he was so young.\u201d\n\nThe Sinner premieres on USA on Wednesday, August 2, at 10 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-260ffc45-72f4-47e7-b312-10fc492cbb34.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-260ffc45-72f4-47e7-b312-10fc492cbb34.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-timberlake-praises-jessica-biels-role-on-the-sinner-w495167/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Praises Jessica Biel's Role on 'The Sinner'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, 'The Sinner' \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Praises Jessica Biel's Role on 'The Sinner'", "description": "Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, 'The Sinner' \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/justin-timberlake-praises-jessica-biels-role-on-the-sinner-w495167/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:46:25+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-260ffc45-72f4-47e7-b312-10fc492cbb34.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-260ffc45-72f4-47e7-b312-10fc492cbb34.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-07-31T20:34:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:46:25+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Justin Timberlake Praises Jessica Biel's Role on 'The Sinner'", "description": "Justin Timberlake took to Instagram on Monday, July 31, to praise his wife, Jessica Biel, for her performance on her new TV series, 'The Sinner' \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/justin-timberlake-jessica-biel-260ffc45-72f4-47e7-b312-10fc492cbb34.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501533264.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
