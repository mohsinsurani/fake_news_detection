Back in July 2016, Mila told Howard she never found Ashton attractive while playing his girlfriend on their TV series \u201cThat \u201970s Show.\u201d But on Wednesday Ashton revealed she wasn\u2019t telling the truth.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s lying,\u201d Ashton said with a laugh. He explained a young Mila kept a diary back then and had written about her older on-camera boyfriend in a few of its pages.\n\n\u201cShe thought I was cute,\u201d he continued. \u201cAt first I think she thought I was good-looking \u2026 shortly thereafter, I was just annoying to her because I was like, big brother.\u201d\n\nScripts from the first season had a then 19-year-old Ashton kissing Mila who was only 14. \u201cIt was really weird. I was like, \u2018Isn\u2019t this illegal?'\u201d Ashton said of having to lock lips with his underage co-star. \u201cShe was like my little sister.\u201d\n\nThough the two played each other\u2019s love interests for several years on television, Ashton and Mila never dated while working on \u201cThat \u201970s Show.\u201d After the series ended, they remained friends and kept in touch but as Ashton remembers, it wasn\u2019t until he saw Mila several years later at an awards show that he felt a spark. However, since he had just split from actress Demi Moore, Ashton knew he wasn\u2019t ready to get into a new relationship.\n\n\u201cI was convinced I was gonna be the single guy. I was all about being the single guy,\u201d he told Howard.\n\nAshton decided to try and set Mila up with one of his friends and planned on introducing them at a party he was throwing at his house. Mila showed up but the friend didn\u2019t. And as the evening went on, it became clear that there was an attraction between Ashton and Mila.\n\n\u201cIt was pretty mutual. It was kind of obvious that things were happening,\u201d Ashton said.\n\nHoward wondered who made the first move and while Ashton wasn\u2019t sure who exactly kissed who first, he described how Mila was able to get a bit closer to him.\n\n\u201cI was smoking cigarettes at the time,\u201d Ashton explained. \u201cAnd she had quit smoking.\u201d Mila asked Ashton if he would \u201cshotgun\u201d a puff into her mouth, just so she could get a hint of smoke without actually having a cigarette. Ashton obliged.\n\n\u201cGradually, throughout the night, it got closer and closer and closer,\u201d he went on about how he and Mila moved toward one another. She ended up spending the night and the two have been together ever since.\n\nLike Howard and Beth, Ashton and Mila are big fans of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d and \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and even have a routine for watching the hit ABC reality series \u2013 he enjoys a vodka tonic while Mila drinks white wine. When contestants go on a one-on-one date together, Ashton revealed he and Mila will often mute the TV and guess at what\u2019s being said.\n\n\u201cWe shut the sound off and like, we imitate what the conversation probably is,\u201d Ashton said.\n\nEarlier this year, Ashton and Mila even guest starred on \u201cThe Bachelorette\u201d and gave one of Rachel Lindsay\u2019s suitors a \u201cHit \u2019em with the Hein\u201d on national television.\n\nAs seven years have gone by since Ashton\u2019s last visit to the Stern Show, Howard had to ask him what it was like joining the cast of \u201cTwo and a Half Men,\u201d a move that surprised many in Hollywood.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the thing, I was shocked I took the role in \u2018Two and a Half Men,'\u201d Ashton told Howard. That he would even be interested in taking the role only became known due to a nonchalant comment he made while having lunch with his then agent as the two discussed what Charlie Sheen had been making off the CBS sitcom.\n\n\u201cI turn to my agent and sort of flippantly said, \u2018If they offered me that job for that kind of money I\u2019d take it,'\u201d Ashton recalled. It wasn\u2019t long before Ashton received a phone call telling him the job was his if he wanted it, a decision he said he never saw coming.\n\n\u201cIt was a very, very, very nice payday,\u201d Ashton said of his salary.\n\nThe show remained a success although Ashton said he never felt any pressure in keeping the sitcom\u2019s ratings up. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t gonna live or die on me,\u201d Ashton told Howard, expressing that so long as the show could remain funny, it would remain a hit.\n\nIn addition to voicing criticism towards the series\u2019 creator Chuck Lorre, \u201cTwo and a Half Men\u2019s\u201d former star Charlie Sheen took some shots at his replacement Ashton. \u201cI didn\u2019t really, like, take it to heart,\u201d Ashton told Howard. Enough time has passed and he revealed there\u2019s no animosity between him and Charlie.\n\n\u201cFace to face he\u2019s always been cool with me,\u201d Ashton added.\n\nAshton is sticking to sitcoms, now starring in his Netflix comedy \u201cThe Ranch.\u201d The series was Ashton\u2019s answer to appealing to his fellow Midwesterners (he grew up in Iowa), a part of the country he says isn\u2019t represented nearly enough on TV.\n\n\u201cThere really wasn\u2019t anything that was servicing the middle of America,\u201d he told Howard.\n\nGrowing up, Ashton was a big fan of the series \u201cRoseanne\u201d and its blue-collar characters. \u201cFor me, that was what I related to,\u201d he said. \u201cIt made me feel like my family wasn\u2019t alone in our struggles.\u201d\n\nNow, he hopes his own series can achieve the same thing for those watching at home.\n\nPart 3 of \u201cThe Ranch\u201d is streaming now on Netflix.", "images": ["https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/themes/howardstern/assets/images/clipboard.svg", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/themes/howardstern/assets/images/email.svg", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/logo-white.png", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/41112-ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-062117-promo-315-getty.jpg", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/logo.png", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/themes/howardstern/assets/images/twitter.svg", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/07/HS-Footer-Logos.png", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/themes/howardstern/assets/images/reddit.svg", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/41113-ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-062117-header-700-ap.jpg?w=700", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/themes/howardstern/assets/images/facebook.svg", "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/themes/howardstern/assets/images/instagram.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/41112-ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-062117-promo-315-getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ryan O'Connell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.howardstern.com/show/2017/06/21/ashton-kutcher-gives-howard-his-side-story-how-he-and-mila-kunis-became-more-just-friends/", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Gives Howard His Side of the Story on How He and Mila Kunis Became More Than Just Friends", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Actor also talks taking over for Charlie Sheen on \"Two and a Half Men\" and the money he made from the sitcom", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ashton Kutcher Gives Howard His Side of the Story on How He and Mila Kunis Became More Than Just Friends | Howard Stern", "description": "Actor also talks taking over for Charlie Sheen on \"Two and a Half Men\" and the money he made from the sitcom", "url": "https://www.howardstern.com/show/2017/06/21/ashton-kutcher-gives-howard-his-side-story-how-he-and-mila-kunis-became-more-just-friends/", "site_name": "Howard Stern", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/41112-ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-062117-promo-315-getty.jpg", "width": 315, "height": 400, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thehowardsternshow/", "published_time": "2017-06-21T19:44:26+00:00", "modified_time": "2020-06-25T11:03:27+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@sternshow", "site": "@sternshow", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Ryan O'Connell", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "5 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "parsely-title": "Ashton Kutcher Gives Howard His Side of the Story on How He and Mila Kunis Became More Than Just Friends", "parsely-link": "http://www.howardstern.com/show/2017/06/21/ashton-kutcher-gives-howard-his-side-story-how-he-and-mila-kunis-became-more-just-friends/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/06/41112-ashton-kutcher-mila-kunis-062117-promo-315-getty.jpg?w=150&h=150&crop=1", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-06-21T19:44:26Z", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-tags": "ashton kutcher,charlie sheen,mila kunis", "parsely-author": "Ryan O'Connell", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.howardstern.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2020/06/favicon.png?w=180"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497999600.0, "source": "https://www.howardstern.com", "summary": ""}
