I also don\u2019t think I\u2019ve ever had an awareness of my own body as being super-sexual. It was always just my body.\u201d\n\nThe song also was the subject of a legal battle with Marvin Gaye\u2019s family being awarded $7.4m because of similarities between the hit and Gaye\u2019s track Got to Give It Up.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Music%2CRobin+Thicke%2CPharrell+Williams%2CCulture", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fc644d3eb497f90355b0232eb99e9db7d0f849b/202_18_1817_1091/master/1817.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fc644d3eb497f90355b0232eb99e9db7d0f849b/202_18_1817_1091/master/1817.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=335fb52760b399787eec34f27fbda698"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fc644d3eb497f90355b0232eb99e9db7d0f849b/202_18_1817_1091/master/1817.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=335fb52760b399787eec34f27fbda698", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Guardian Music"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/04/emily-ratajkowski-blurred-lines-video", "title": "Model Emily Ratajkowski: Blurred Lines video is 'the bane of my existence'", "meta_data": {"description": "The model and actor featured in Robin Thicke\u2019s 2013 video does not know why it\u2019s still talked about or why the female \u2018naked body is so controversial\u2019", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/04/emily-ratajkowski-blurred-lines-video", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fc644d3eb497f90355b0232eb99e9db7d0f849b/202_18_1817_1091/master/1817.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&enable=upscale&s=335fb52760b399787eec34f27fbda698", "height": 721}, "title": "Model Emily Ratajkowski: Blurred Lines video is 'the bane of my existence'", "description": "The model and actor featured in Robin Thicke\u2019s 2013 video does not know why it\u2019s still talked about or why the female \u2018naked body is so controversial\u2019", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/guardianmusic", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2017-02-14T18:20:20.000Z", "section": "Music", "published_time": "2015-09-04T19:39:13.000Z", "tag": "Music,Robin Thicke,Pharrell Williams,Culture"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://music/2015/sep/04/emily-ratajkowski-blurred-lines-video?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/music/2015/sep/04/emily-ratajkowski-blurred-lines-video", "iphone": "gnmguardian://music/2015/sep/04/emily-ratajkowski-blurred-lines-video?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://music/2015/sep/04/emily-ratajkowski-blurred-lines-video?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@guardianmusic", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/4fc644d3eb497f90355b0232eb99e9db7d0f849b/202_18_1817_1091/master/1817.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTUucG5n&s=a1a8cd60b3f8bcf2ddddc739248e85e6", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1441321200.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
