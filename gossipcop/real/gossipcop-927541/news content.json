And he\u2019s showing his sentimental side.\n\nThe 21-time Grammy winner shared a photo of himself with Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian\u2019s ex-husband, Lamar Odom, from 2016 on Sunday, April 15. \u201cMy favorite moment of walking into MSG to play Saint Pablo,\u201d West, 40, captioned the photo. \u201cI used to go to the hospital and play Lamar the album when he was learning to walk and talk again. Then we walked into the arena together.\u201d\n\nFormer NBA player Odom, 38, was hospitalized in October 2015 after he was found unconscious in a Nevada brothel. He made his first public appearance alongside West at his February 2016 Yeezy Season fashion show release party in New York. West\u2019s sister-in-law Khlo\u00e9 married Odom in 2009 and filed for divorce in 2013.\n\nWest\u2019s wife, Kim Kardashian, applauded her husband\u2019s efforts with Odom in an episode of Keeping Up With the Kardashians. \u201cKanye really felt we can cure him through music, like we can get him to talk,\u201d explained the 37-year-old Selfish author in 2016. He would go tot he hospital and he would rap and sing, and I think Lamar started to get his function back and started to talk once he started to listen to a lot of music.\u201d\n\nThe Odom memory comes at an interesting time. Khlo\u00e9 welcomed her first child, a daughter with Tristan Thompson on April 12. But the happy news has been overshadowed by allegations that the Cleveland Cavaliers player, 27, cheated on her with multiple women throughout her pregnancy.\n\nMeanwhile, Odom wasn\u2019t the only estranged Kardashian family member to get a shout-out on West\u2019s Twitter account. The rapper\u2019s first tweet following his hiatus was a screenshot of a long -sleeve shirt from his Saint Pablo tour, featuring an image of Caitlyn Jenneron the back. Wrote West: \u201cMy favorite Saint Pablo Tee.\u201d\n\nWhile there was no mention of daughters, North, 4, or Chicago, three months, West debuted two neck tattoo designs dedicated to his 2-year-old son, Saint West. He is inked with North\u2019s birthday on his wrist, so it\u2019s only a matter of time until little Chicago gets her tribute!\n\nWest has more than three million followers, but only follows one person back: Kim!\n\nRELATED: Kanye West goes on Twitter rant about the 2016 Grammys", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190830/aol-logo.svg",
