Tickets will be valid to attend the Lauv performance on July 26th along with The Chainsmokers show on July 29th as part of the Atlantic CityBeachFest Concert Series. Refunds are also available at point of purchase if preferred.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, dozens of fans of the \u201cSober\u201d songstress showed up to the seaside venue to sing her songs together and show their support.\n\n\u201cLovatics have decided to put on their own concert today in Atlantic City where Demi Lovato was scheduled to perform before the cancelation to show their support,\u201d one Twitter account captioned a moving clip of fans crowding onto the stage together to happily sing Lovato\u2019s songs despite her absence.\n\nThe touching scene took place just before ET learned that Lovato\u2019s team had staged an intervention for her roughly a month ago, where they encouraged her to enter a rehabilitation program, but a source said she refused to take their concerns seriously, leading to her hospitalization this week.\n\nLovatics have decided to put on their own concert today in Atlantic City where Demi Lovato was scheduled to perform before the cancelation to show her

straight into rehab when she is released from the medical facility where she is being treated, though her loved ones remain deeply concerned because she has told them she still believes she is able to beat her addiction on her own.\n\nGet more news on the singer\u2019s hospitalization in the clip below.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nDemi Lovato's Ex Wilmer Valderrama Visits Her at Hospital After Singer's
