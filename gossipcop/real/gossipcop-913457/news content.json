The footage featured the siblings playfully fighting for camera time while someone filmed and encouraged them, \u201cLet me see you dance.\u201d Prince busted out a few dance moves before Paris got a close-up and made a funny face.\n\n\u201cMy dearest brother. i could fly to the moon and back a thousand times and the distance still wouldn\u2019t amount to how much i adore you,\u201d Paris captioned the video post on Instagram. \u201cI\u2019ve always looked up to you, and to this day you\u2019re still the greatest role model i could ever hope for. i miss these days where we could wrestle and i\u2019d still have a chance at winning, though. i miss playing hot wheels and my little pony with you, i miss fighting like pirates and trying to cast spells with our harry potter wands.\n\n\u201ci miss the Saturdays where we would sleep in and eat porridge and OJ and watch gargoyles and [Transformers] (and sometimes cartoons in arabic?), and staying up late listening to you tell us wild bed time stories that always had a crazy twist at the end.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cYou\u2019ve always been my best friend in the whole wide universe and i\u2019m so lucky to have you in my life. i couldn\u2019t have wished for our friendship to turn out any better. we may not have our water guns and crash bandicoot, but we have so much more. you\u2019re the most fun, genuine, determined and hilarious person i know. and it makes ma soul happy to know dat i can always count on you, and no matter where we are in the world and in life, my home is with you and the little guy. i love you so much, gooko. i\u2019m so proud of you. happy birthday.\u201d\n\nTibrina Hobson/Getty\n\nIn an interview with the Today show in October, Prince gushed about his bond with Paris and 15-year-old brother Blanket Jackson, who now goes by B.G. or Bigi. \u201cMe and my siblings get along really well \u2014 especially my sister,\u201d Prince told Today\u2018s Natalie Morales. \u201cShe\u2019s grown so much and she\u2019s been able to really step up. I don\u2019t really see myself as her older brother. We\u2019re equal partners when it comes down to it. B.G. is just so mature for his age. It\u2019s a pretty strong bond.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Life After Michael: How Jackson\u2019s Kids Have Struggled And Succeeded After His Death\n\nThe three collaborated over Halloween to design mazes and a haunted house for the second annual Costume for a Cause event. \u201cIt\u2019s something that\u2019s bred into us, to really give back to the community,\u201d Prince explained. \u201cMy dad always taught me to lead by example, so I hope I can set a good example that you can have fun by helping other people and you can make a change just by doing that.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think he would definitely be proud of the type of work that we\u2019re doing and giving back to the community,\u201d added Prince, who started his own charitable foundation dedicated to helping foster children who have aged out of the system called Heal Los Angeles.", "images":
