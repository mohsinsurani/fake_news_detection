In that time period, do you think it\u2019s become any easier for women in the music industry to be independent, both artistically and financially?\n\nRozonda \u201cChilli\u201d Thomas: Women have more of a voice now. I think it was definitely harder before we came out and during the time that we came out. You had to fight a lot harder to make sure your voice was heard. We kicked down a lot of doors. It makes us feel really good when we hear someone like Lady Gaga thank us for paving the way for them. I definitely think that it\u2019s different and the struggle is not over, but not the same.\n\nSo much about TLC broke the girl group formula, but there are also aspects of your music that fall into the girl group history: harmonies, choreography, a sense of unity. Did you see yourself as fitting into that lineage when you were forming TLC?\n\nTionne \u201cT-Boz\u201d Watkins: I don\u2019t think we had girl groups on our minds at that time. I didn\u2019t know if I wanted to be in a group or just be an artist, period\u2026 But growing up [performing] in a band with my family, my mother and my father singing, of course I knew about the Ronettes. Patti LaBelle was one of my mom\u2019s favorite singers. The Supremes, I loved them. But honestly, it wasn\u2019t until I was put in the situation of a group that I started paying attention to the dynamics of being with girls, because I never got along with women growing up. I was like, \u201cUh oh, is this gonna be super hard for me?\u201d Then I started paying attention to groups.\n\nDid you ever sing girl group music growing up?\n\nT-Boz: Oh, yeah. [singing] \u201cWait a minute, Mister Postman!\u201d Of course. Even that song that\u2019s out now [\u201cFeel It Still\u201d by Portugal, the Man] sounds just like it and it\u2019s a major hit. When you hear something familiar to your ear that was already a hit, you don\u2019t know why you like it, you\u2019re just drawn to it. And I think that\u2019s why that single did so well, because it was a classic from the Marvelettes.\n\nWomen\u2019s self-esteem has always been a big topic for TLC, from \u201cUnpretty\u201d through your more recent song \u201cPerfect Girls.\u201d Do you have any thoughts on this now, in the age of Instagram?\n\nT-Boz: Social media has made it to where young girls are striving to be something that\u2019s not real. They have all these apps and filters where you can adjust your body shape. So I just want the younger generation to understand: None of us are perfect. We all have flaws. I just wish people would be more forthcoming about that. It cracks me up when you see somebody with a clearly fake booty; you wanna lie and say you was doing squats and you got on a push-up bra? Come on, man. Just say, \u201cI got some injections in my lips. I got cheekbones. I got a butt \u2019cause I didn\u2019t like mine being flat,\u201d and keep it moving.\n\nChilli: It\u2019s the deceitful part that makes it not okay. Nobody has this super-smooth everything from your head to your toenails.\n\nT-Boz, I know you have a teenage daughter and a younger son. And Chilli, you have an older son and you founded Chilli\u2019s Crew, an Atlanta nonprofit for disadvantaged teen girls. What are you trying to teach your daughter and your program girls today about how to live in this world?\n\nT-Boz: My daughter understands how to respect herself. She\u2019s been knowing that since she could talk. I\u2019ve heard her even tell her friends about how they should respect themselves. And I don\u2019t have to worry about nobody else raising my child, because I do. I\u2019m secure in knowing that I\u2019ve done my job as a parent and she\u2019s not looking to Instagram to raise her.\n\nChilli: It\u2019s sad because a lot of those girls [in Chilli\u2019s Crew] are in group homes and they have a lot of challenges. I tell them to tell themselves,\u201cI\u2019m not going to allow these circumstances to be the reason that I can\u2019t be successful.\u201d You don\u2019t always have to be a product of your environment\u2026. And with my son, I\u2019m just raising him to not be the average dude. That would not be acceptable to me. I\u2019m teaching him to be respectful not only to women but to adults. I tell him,\u201cI don\u2019t care how old you become, I\u2019m always gonna be older, so you\u2019re never gonna be my equal.\u201d", "images": ["https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/782/the%20shirelles%20_Will%20You%20Love%20Me%20Tomorrow_.jpg", "https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/782/The-Bobbettes.jpg", "https://cdn4.pitchfork.com/longform/782/GirlGroups.jpg", "https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/782/The%20Chantels%20_maybe_.jpg", "https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/782/15%20The%20Primettes%20_pretty%20baby_.jpg", "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5b3651720e04ca4ea852e76d/2:1/w_790/GirlGroups.jpg", "https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/782/13%20The%20Marvelettes%20_Please%20Mr.%20Postman_.jpg", "https://cdn.pitchfork.com/longform/782/18%20The%20Crystals_He%20Hit%20Me%20And%20It%20Felt%20Like%20a%20Kiss.jpg", "https://cdn4.pitchfork.com/longform/782/05%20The%20Andrews%20Sister_Boogie%20Woogie%20Bugle%20Boy.jpg", "https://cdn3.pitchfork.com/longform/782/GirlGroups_TLC_Inline.jpg", "https://cdn4.pitchfork.com/longform/782/03%20The%20Crystals_He_s%20a%20Rebel.jpg", "https://cdn2.pitchfork.com/longform/782/The-Cookies-Chains.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5b3651720e04ca4ea852e76d/2:1/w_790/GirlGroups.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-story-of-girl-groups-in-45-songs/", "title": "The Story of Girl Groups in 45 Songs", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no", "og": {"site_name": "Pitchfork", "url": "https://pitchfork.com/features/lists-and-guides/the-story-of-girl-groups-in-45-songs/", "title": "The Story of Girl Groups in 45 Songs", "description": "Starring the Supremes, TLC, the Ronettes, Destiny's Child, and more", "type": "article", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5b3651720e04ca4ea852e76d/2:1/w_790/GirlGroups.jpg"}, "description": "Starring the Supremes, TLC, the Ronettes, Destiny's Child, and more", "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@pitchfork", "title": "The Story of Girl Groups in 45 Songs", "description": "Starring the Supremes, TLC, the Ronettes, Destiny's Child, and more", "image": "https://media.pitchfork.com/photos/5b3651720e04ca4ea852e76d/2:1/w_790/GirlGroups.jpg"}, "keywords": "The Shangri-Las,The Emotions,The Crystals,The Andrews Sisters,The Dixie Cups,The Supremes,The Pointer Sisters,TLC,Labelle,En Vogue", "news_keywords": "The Shangri-Las,The Emotions,The Crystals,The Andrews Sisters,The Dixie Cups,The Supremes,The Pointer Sisters,TLC,Labelle,En Vogue", "msvalidate.01": "2E96EF3F0014FF765EEE9A9CE8B22E64", "fb": {"app_id": 207089362687909, "pages": 28015075999}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://pitchfork.com", "summary": ""}
