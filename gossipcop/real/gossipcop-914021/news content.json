This despite the fact Annihilation features an inclusive cast and is largely female-driven with Gina Rodriguez, Tessa Thompson, Sonya Miznuo and Tuva Novotny along with Oscar Isaac and Benedict Wong.\n\nAlex Garland, who directed and adapted the first novel in Jeff VanderMeer\u2019s Southern Reach trilogy, weighed in with a response to the criticism today:\n\n\u201cThis is an awkward problem for me, because I think whitewashing is a serious and real issue, and I fully support the groups drawing attention to it. But the characters in the novel I read and adapted were not given names or ethnicities. I cast the film reacting only to the actors I met in the casting process, or actors I had worked with before. There was no studio pressure to cast white. The casting choices were entirely mine. As a middle-aged white man, I can believe I might at times be guilty of unconscious racism, in the way that potentially we all are. But there was nothing cynical or conspiratorial about the way I cast this movie.\u201d\n\nAnnihilation centers on Lena (Portman), a biologist and expedition leader who ventures with a team into a secret environmental disaster area where events went sideways for her husband. In the first novel, the background of Portman\u2019s character and that of Leigh\u2019s government psychologist Dr. Ventress aren\u2019t revealed. It\u2019s not until the second book in the series, Authority, that we learn Portman\u2019s character is of Asian descent, and that Leigh\u2019s is half-Native American/half-Caucasian.\n\nVanderMeer hasn\u2019t commented about the recent whitewashing criticisms, but he has said on Twitter to fans that he \u201cnever expected or wanted a faithful adaptation from Garland \u2014 just a good one.\u201d\n\nMANAA board member Alieesa Badreshia blasted Garland in a statement this week saying: \u201cHe exploits the story but fails to take advantage of the true identities of each character. Hollywood rarely writes prominent parts for Asian American and American Indian characters, and those roles could\u2019ve bolstered the careers of women from those communities.\u201d\n\nEchoed Sonny Skyhawk, founder of American Indians in Film and Television: \u201cWe are not surprised by the Whack-a-Mole diversity replacement that goes on; just when you finish objecting to one white-washed casting, another one pops up.\u201d\n\nThe orgs\u2019 gripes come in the wake of DreamWorks/Paramount\u2019s $110 million manga adaptation Ghost in the Shell last year, which was dinged for its casting of Scarlett Johansson in what was originally a Japanese role. Other pics faulted by critics for their whitewashing include Marvel\u2019s Doctor Strange and Cameron Crowe\u2019s Aloha, the latter of which cast Emma Stone as a person of one-quarter Hawaiian and one-quarter Chinese descent.\n\nPortman learned at the pic\u2019s junket, as revealed in a Yahoo! interview, that her character was originally of Asian descent in the book.\n\n\u201cWe need more representation of Asians on film, of Hispanics on film, of Blacks on film, and women and particularly women of color, Native Americans \u2014 I mean, we just don\u2019t have enough representation,\u201d the Oscar-winning Black Swan actress said in response to being questioned about the controversy.\n\n\u201cThese categories like \u2018white\u2019 and \u2018nonwhite\u2019 \u2014 they\u2019re imagined classifications but have real-life consequences. \u2026 And I hope that begins to change, because I think everyone is becoming more conscious of it, which hopefully will make change,\u201d she added.\n\nSaid Leigh, \u201cThere should be more parts for everyone and more diversity in all films.\u201d\n\nTracking currently has Annihilation opening to between $10M-$15M.
