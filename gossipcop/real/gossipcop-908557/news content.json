Sunday, February 12, marks the 59th annual Grammy Awards, so if you\u2019re looking to celebrate Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s Lemonade album and Adele\u2019s earth-shattering comeback, you better tune in. While the Grammys are known for epic musical performances and the occasional collaboration, the red carpet has had its fair share of, um, daring looks. Love them or hate them, many outfits that graced the Grammys\u2019 red carpets have gone down in history.\n\n1. Lady Gaga in an egg, 2011\n\nWhat came first: the Gaga or the egg? In case you missed it back in 2011, Gaga laid in an enclosed, translucent egg while her minimalist entourage trotted her down the red carpet. Oh, and she and the egg were being lifted for the entire duration of the red carpet. Eventually, Gaga\u2019s egg hatched, revealing a less-anticipated look. The whole thing sounds bizarre; however, she redefined what it means to make a grand entrance.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/An-egg-like-container-with-singer-Lady-Gaga-inside.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Handsome-businessman-working-with-laptop-in-office-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/wallstcheatsheet-v2/images/icons/like.png?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/01/Hands-High-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Man-with-tooth-brush-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/iStock_000008605293_Small-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Kanye-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/An-egg-like-container-with-singer-Lady-Gaga-inside.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/08/Man-Napping-on-a-Couch-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Chanel-Runway-Paris-Fashion-Week-Womenswear-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/Pampering-cream-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/Pressed-Face-Powder-and-Puff-300x200.jpg?3b5891", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Women-and-shopping-300x200.jpg?3b5891"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012im_/http://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/An-egg-like-container-with-singer-Lady-Gaga-inside.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelsey Mulvey"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170217004012/http://www.cheatsheet.com/gear-style/most-memorable-grammy-looks-of-all-time.html/?a=viewall", "title": "12 of the Most Memorable Grammy Looks of All Time", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "noodp", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cheat Sheet", "syndication-source": "http://www.cheatsheet.com/gear-style/most-memorable-grammy-looks-of-all-time.html/", "description": "Many musicians take the Grammys as an opportunity to show off their best (and most outrageous) fashion choices.
