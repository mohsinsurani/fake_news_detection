The song took 23 weeks to reach the top spot, equaling the longest climb for a female artist with Sia's \"Cheap Thrills\" (2016) and Patti Austin's \"Baby, Come to Me\" (1982\u20131983). Cabello became the third artist in chart history to top both the Hot 100 and Billboard 200 for their first time in the same week, after Britney Spears and Beyonc\u00e9 did so in 1999 and 2003, respectively.[47] The song has also been certified Diamond by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA).[48] \"Havana\" became the ninth song to top the Mainstream Top 40, Rhythmic and Adult Top 40 airplay charts\u2013over the 22 years that all three charts have coexisted.[49]\n\n\"Havana\" reached number one on the Australian ARIA Singles Chart in its twelfth week on the chart, becoming Cabello's first number-one song, including during her time as part of Fifth Harmony.[50] It held the summit for three weeks before also being displaced by \"Perfect\".[51]\n\nThe song became Spotify's most-streamed song ever by a solo female artist in June 2018, with more than one billion streams at the time.[52]\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nCabello shared a 26-second preview of the short film for \"Havana\" on October 22, 2017, through her YouTube channel. The video featured appearances by Lele Pons as Bella, LeJuan James as Abuelita, Noah Centineo as Cabello's love interest, Marco DelVecchio as the twins Juan and Rodrigo and Mikey Pesante as the dancer. It was directed by Dave Meyers and was released on October 24, 2017. Young Thug also appears in the video.[53]\n\nSynopsis [ edit ]\n\n[54] The film scene gave the video a \"classic\" 1960s appeal, as described by a Fuse writer.\n\nThe main song starts late but the music video starts with Karla, played by Cabello, watching a telenovela, before being interrupted by her grandmother, who turns off the TV and advises her to live her life instead of spending her days indoors. Karla then leaves the house to go see a movie. The film she is watching, called Camila in Havana, takes the form of a music video, starring a version of herself wearing a fringe-covered red dress and performing at a club.[55] Aside from appearing as Karla, Cabello also plays the telenovela actress and the movie protagonist.[56][57] After the film ends, she leaves the cinema and stumbles across a cyclist, also the male protagonist of the film, and begins dancing with him.\n\nReception [ edit ]\n\nTom Breihan of Stereogum, which ranked the song 28th of 50 best music videos of 2017, reviewed on December 18, 2017: \"Camila Cabello is going to be a movie star one day, and she might still never deliver a better performance than the one she gives in this multiple-role video.\"[38]\n\nIt received four nominations at the 2018 MTV Video Music Awards, for Video of the Year, Song of the Year, Best Pop Video, and Best Choreography, winning the first.[58]\n\nAs of November 25, 2021, the video has received more than 1 billion views on
