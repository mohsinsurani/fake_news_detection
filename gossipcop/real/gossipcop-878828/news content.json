During the lengthy interview on her new movie Mother!, the conversation turned political about halfway through. After discussing the alleged pay gap between men and women, the interviewer asked Lawrence about climate change and the political climate in America.\n\n\u201cI mean when the director was asked about the film, why it was so dark, he said, \u2018It\u2019s a mad time to be alive.\u2019 And there is certainly an end of days feeling about it. For many people, in America who would say, [grimaces] perhaps it\u2019s truer there at the moment than anywhere else,\u201d the Channel 4 reporter prompted Lawrence to comment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s scary,\u201d she responded. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s this new language that\u2019s forming, I don\u2019t even recognize it. It\u2019s also scary to know, that climate change is due to human activity, and we continue to ignore it, and the only voice that we really have is through voting,\u201d Lawrence stated.\n\n\u201cAnd you have voted very recently, as a country\u201d the interviewer acknowledged.\n\n\u201cAnd we voted, and it was really startling,\u201d Lawrence added. She then insinuated that the hurricanes were \u201cMother Nature\u2019s rage and wrath\u201d at America for Trump.\n\n\u201cYou know you\u2019re watching these hurricanes now, and it\u2019s really hard especially while promoting this movie, not to feel mother nature\u2019s rage and wrath,\u201d she stated.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not just about climate change though is it, in America? It seems to be a time of huge division,\u201d the reporter added.\n\n\u201cYeah, it\u2019s really polarizing and upsetting. You know I\u2019ve heard things and seen things on T.V. in my own country that devastate me and make me sick, and it\u2019s just really confusing,\u201d Lawrence stated.\n\n\u201cDo you find President Trump confusing?\u201d the reporter pressed further.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t find him confusing. I think I know exactly what he is,\u201d Lawrence said solemnly before smirking.\n\nWrapping up the interview, the reporter asked Lawrence how she felt about the future. The Hollywood actress didn\u2019t have much hope with Trump leading the country, calling her recent film a \u201chowl of rage\u201d in response to what\u2019s going on in America:\n\nSUPPORT PRO-LIFE NEWS!

But a producer on the movie called this film, \u2018an impotent howl of rage.\u2019 It\u2019s like a helpless howl to the moon, like, it\u2019s just an assault.\u201d\n\nLawrence has been outspoken about President Trump before he was even president. Back in 2015, she cried that it would be \u201cthe end of the world\u201d if he took office, and told Trump \u201cf**k you\u201d during a 2016 televised talk show appearance. After he won the election, Lawrence penned an open letter to young women on the feminist side Broadly, that the election should \u201cenrage them.\u201d\n\n\u201c[L]ike Hillary, you can still be an inspiration and get important things done. Do not let this defeat you \u2014 let this enrage you! Let it motivate you! Let this be the fire you didn\u2019t have before. If you are an immigrant, if you are a person of color, if you are LGBTQ+, if you are a woman \u2014 don\u2019t be afraid, be loud!\u201d she wrote.\n\nLifeNews Note: Kristine Marsh is Staff Writer for MRC Culture at the Media Research Center where this originally appeared.", "images": ["https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/humancoalitionwebad91222.jpg", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/50KGiveaway300x250.jpg", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jenniferlawrence2.png", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/humancoalitionad34.jpg", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Carenetwebad92722.jpg", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/logo.png", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/texasrighttolifetopbanner122721.gif", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/CareNetlowerad72522.jpg", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/studentsforlifewebad1922.png", "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/sevenweekscoffee.png"], "top_img": "https://www.lifenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/jenniferlawrence2.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.lifenews.com/2017/09/07/actress-jennifer-lawrence-hurricanes-are-mother-natures-rage-for-voting-for-trump/", "title": "Actress Jennifer Lawrence: Hurricanes are \u201cMother Nature\u2019s Rage\u201d for Voting for Trump", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Life News", "OBKey": "avejq02j7xRr+0owuq+Pcw==", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Actress Jennifer Lawrence: Hurricanes are \"Mother Nature's Rage\" for Voting for Trump - LifeNews.com", "description": "In an interview with Channel 4, a British public service television network, American actress Jennifer Lawrence blamed the recent hurricanes on Donald Trump\u2019s voters, because they don\u2019t believe in man-made climate change.
