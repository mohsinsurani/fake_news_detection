And coming off the Women\u2019s March just a couple days prior, we were all kind of riding that high of female empowerment in the face of adversity.\n\nSo it was a bit of a letdown to hear Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd\u2019s acceptance speech when he received his award for Outstanding Performance by a Male Actor in a Miniseries for his role in Big Little Lies. Skarsg\u00e5rd plays Perry, an abusive husband in the HBO hit series, and in both his SAG Award acceptance speech and his acceptance speech for his Golden Globe he doesn\u2019t mention domestic abuse once. While we certainly don\u2019t place any of Perry\u2019s actions onto the actor, there is some cognitive dissonance in awarding a man for playing an abuser in a time when women are finally feeling emboldened enough to call out those who have abused them in real life, and then for that actor to completely ignore the subject of abuse when he\u2019s acknowledged for the role. You can watch his speech to see for yourself.\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pFQzqK3MrTc?feature=oembed\n\nTo add insult to injury, Skarsg\u00e5rd even manages to piss off veteran actor Robert DeNiro in the process, saying, \u201cA lot of people have been talking about who the greatest male actor ever is. Is it Mr. Robert DeNiro, or is it the tall guy from True Blood?\u201d DeNiro was nominated in the same category this year for his work in The Wizard of Lies, and while Skarsg\u00e5rd probably meant the comment to be a self-deprecating joke, DeNiro didn\u2019t seem to find the joke particularly funny.\n\nOf course, winning a major award like this must be a jarring experience, but it\u2019s upsetting to see Skarsg\u00e5rd choose to stay silent on abuse for both acceptance speeches. It\u2019s even more frustrating when the subject of abuse is not only prevalent in the news, but directly impacts the award he\u2019s receiving. Choosing to not share the burden of upending systemic oppression keeps the fight completely on the backs of victims and stalls real change. Staying silent isn\u2019t really an option anymore, and it\u2019s frustrating to see Skarsg\u00e5rd shirk a prime opportunity to speak out against domestic violence. Many people have become more vocal and more active in the fight, but in order to really make things better, we all must do our part to speak out.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/ALE-e1516650008543.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/ALE-e1516650008543.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/ALE-e1516650008543.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/alexander-skarsgard-speech-sag-awards/", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd gave another cringe-worthy speech at SAG Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd won a SAG Award last night, and once again chose to not speak out againt domestic violence in his acceptance speech.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd gave another cringe-worthy speech at SAG Awards", "description": "Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd won a SAG Award last night, and once again chose to not speak out againt domestic violence in his acceptance speech.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/alexander-skarsgard-speech-sag-awards/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/22/ALE-e1516650008543.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1000, "height": 696, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-22T16:54:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T14:32:29+00:00"}, "author": "kendallashley", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "kendallashley", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516640047.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
