On Wednesday night the real-life best friends recorded the whole night for Instagram, and it's impossible to look away.\n\nThe action began while the duo and a friend were staying up for a flight back to L.A. from Paris. After going out, they were back in a hotel room (with white wine) when the pink-haired Philipps whipped out her leave-in hair tint. \"Guys, we're going to dye her hair pink. What do you think? Is this a good idea? Look at that hair. It's going to be pink,\" Philipps explained to the camera.\n\nInstagram / @busyphilipps\n\nPhilipps says she uses the tint for 20 minutes to get her pink color, so they decided to put it into Williams' platinum pixie for five minutes. The goal: \"perfectly millennial pink\" hair. Philipps massaged it in; Williams' face is, in a word, incredible. In two words, incredible and relatable.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d65c60a05bb4492d981b67/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d65e7a799c8878e8723029/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-4.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/63371b8f9eface9ac35d57c2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1507152946/glamour_the-evolution-of-pubic-hair.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d661407657e1364ce55a37/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-7-1.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632b78f73261a7aac846dae7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d65bf3799c8878e8723027/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-5.png", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632c86b8584ad9bf0dd74d8a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d6633c7657e1364ce55a39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-7-2.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d65f1f799c8878e872302b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-3.png"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d6633c7657e1364ce55a39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-7-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rachel Nussbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/busy-philipps-dyed-michelle-williams-hair-pink-instagram", "title": "Busy Philipps Just Dyed Michelle Williams' Hair Pink on Instagram", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "While killing time in Paris, Busy Philipps and Michelle Williams decided to drink some wine and involve hair dye.", "id": "59d65074799c8878e8723023", "keywords": "busy phillips,michelle williams,pink hair", "news_keywords": "busy phillips,michelle williams,pink hair", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59d65074799c8878e8723023", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"While killing time in Paris, Busy Philipps and Michelle Williams decided to drink some wine and involve hair dye.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d6634e799c8878e872302d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/busy-philipps-michelle-williams-getty.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d6634e799c8878e872302d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/busy-philipps-michelle-williams-getty.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "And it actually turned out well.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d6633c7657e1364ce55a39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-7-2.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Busy Philipps Just Dyed Michelle Williams' Hair Pink on Instagram", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/busy-philipps-dyed-michelle-williams-hair-pink-instagram"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-10-05T17:30:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-05T17:30:00.000Z", "author": "Rachel Nussbaum"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "And it actually turned out well.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59d6633c7657e1364ce55a39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/michelle-williams-pink-instagram-7-2.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Busy Philipps Just Dyed Michelle Williams' Hair Pink on Instagram"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507224600.0, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
