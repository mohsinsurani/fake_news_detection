Jimmy Kimmel pranked his friend by turning his car into a moving billboard \u2014 and the TV host had a little help from Jennifer Aniston to pull it off.\n\n\u201cYour wife Jennifer Aniston helped me out. You know that recall notice you got for your car?\u201d Kimmel, 49, asked Theroux during Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Tuesday, May 16. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with the car. It was not being repaired. There\u2019s nothing wrong with the drive shaft.\u201d\n\nKimmel explained that he wanted to help Theroux, 45, campaign for an Emmy nomination for his role as Kevin Garvey in HBO\u2019s The Leftovers. \u201cBecause I feel like HBO could be doing a better job of promoting this for you, we had some experts adorn your car in a way that is going to bring you a lot of attention,\u201d the comedian said. \u201cLet\u2019s go outside to Hollywood Boulevard.\u201d\n\nThe cameras showed Theroux\u2019s black Mercedes covered in hilarious decals. The hood was splashed with a shirtless photo of the screenwriter and some messages read \u201cI\u2019d Eat These Leftovers\u201d and \u201cJustin Time for the Emmy Nominations.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis is what people will see as you drive around town. We even went so far as to put a hood ornament on the car,\u201d Kimmel said, pointing out the Emmy statuette on the front.\n\nTheroux cracked up and posed with his Mercedes after the show, writing, \u201cNever give @jimmykimmel the keys to your car. #humbledouched #doucheybrag #thanks?\u201d\n\nNever give @jimmykimmel the keys to your car. #humbledouched #doucheybrag #thanks?
