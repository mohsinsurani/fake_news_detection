The polymath has today announced The Hamildrops, a year-long program that will see new Hamilton content being released every month from now until December 2018. Kicking off the series is a previously unused, unrecorded song from the musical called \u201cBen Franklin\u2019s Song\u201d.\n\nMiranda apparently had intended to include the song as a solo introduction to Benjamin Franklin in Hamilton, but ended up cutting the character before ever composing the music. The lyrics, however, were written in the style of The Decemberists, so in 2016, he sent them to Colin Meloy to fully realize the song. The \u201creally swear-y\u201d song can be heard below.\n\nRelated Video\n\n\u00ef\u00bb\u00bf\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFans anticipating the promised Hamilton Mixtape 2 may be disappointed it will never come to light, but the Hamildrops should provide more than enough for Hamilfans to stay satiated. Read more of what Miranda had to say below.\n\nA year ago this month we released The Hamilton Mixtape. It was the culmination of so many dreams come true. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 14, 2017\n\nEvery artist, every interpretation represented the original impulse I had for this story, even before this thing was a musical. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 14, 2017\n\nI know I promised you a Hamilton Mixtape Vol. 2, but nothing\u2019s gonna match those songs in that order, beautifully sequenced by @jperiodBK, at that moment in December 2016.

We\u2019re gonna drop some new Hamilton content, every month, December NOW through December 2018. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 14, 2017\n\nDECEMBER\u2019S #HAMILDROP. \u2018member how I said I once wrote some Decemberists-esque lyrics for a Ben Franklin tune, but never set \u2018em to music? \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 14, 2017\n\nSo I sent the lyrics to @ColinMeloy. He's in @TheDecemberists. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 14, 2017\n\nAnd HE set it to music as only he and his crew can.\n\nIt absolutely blew me away.\n\nI weent BACK to write new lyrics for a bridge for him. Advertisement \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 14, 2017\n\nHe took it to @TheDecemberists & they brought Ben Franklin to life. \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) December 14, 2017\n\nSo enjoy BEN FRANKLIN\u2019S SONG.
