The helicopter descended from view prior to reaching the runway threshold and the sounds of impact were heard,\u201d the report reads. \u201cBoth instructors reported that a high-pitched \u2018whine\u2019 could be heard from the helicopter during the latter portion of the descent.\u201d\n\nThe remains of the plane were found approximately 220 feet prior to the edge of the runway.\n\nThe report goes on to state that pilot James Evan Robinson had extensive experience with the aircraft, a Schweitzer 269 Charlie 1. Of his 480.9 total hours of flight experience, over 300 hours had been accrued in the fatal helicopter\u2019s make and model.\n\nBrian Rayner, senior air safety investigator with the National Transportation Safety Board, previously told PEOPLE that Gentry\u2019s helicopter ride is being described as \u201cimpromptu, spur of the moment.\u201d\n\nSays Rayner, \u201c[It was a] \u2018Would you like to go for a helicopter ride?\u2019 \u201c\n\n\u201cNot long after takeoff, the pilot announced over the airport frequency \u2013 which was being monitored by a number of people \u2013 that he was having difficulty controlling engine RPM,\u201d says Rayner. \u201cA couple of different responses to that challenge were discussed, and he was performing an auto rotational descent to runway one.\u201d\n\nContinues Rayner, \u201cThe helicopter landed short of the runway in low brush, it was substantially damaged and the occupants were fatally injured.\u201d\n\nAccording to NJ.com, Robinson was pronounced dead on the scene. Gentry was taken to nearby Virtua Hospital, where he later succumbed to his injuries.\n\nIn a statement about the tragic accident, the Flying W said, \u201cThe day started with such excitement as the Montgomery Gentry bus rolled through our gates. The nicest people got off the bus and joined us on the ramp for what we hoped would be the best concert we have ever had. Sadly this was not to be.\u201d\n\nGentry was 50 years old; he is survived by wife Angie and daughters Kaylee and Taylor. A public memorial will be held in Nashville on Thursday.", "images":
