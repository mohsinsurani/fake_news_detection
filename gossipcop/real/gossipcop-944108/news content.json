I woke up this morning and watched the music video and was like, \u2018What the hell is going on?'\u201d\n\nClark, who owns a business in Toronto, told us the last time he saw Drake was a couple years ago and he sees some of the other cast members every now and then.\n\n\u201cIt sucks because it would have been great to see everybody,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best part is the fans are getting what they want and that\u2019s most important and everyone looks so happy, so that\u2019s kind of the silver lining there. It looked like everyone was having a great time, but for me, it was kind of sad too, because we were all really like family.\u201d\n\nBut Clark isn\u2019t the only former Degrassi Community School student who didn\u2019t make it to the reunion. Loyal fans of the long-running Canadian teen soap noticed that Ryan Cooley and Mike Lobel were also nowhere to be seen.\n\nCooley played J.T. Yorke alongside Drake for the first six seasons of \u201cDegrassi: The Next Generation.\u201d His character exited the series in memorable fashion, stabbed to death outside his ex-girlfriend\u2019s birthday party.\n\nThe actor couldn\u2019t be reached for comment, but an Instagram comment made by Drake on Wednesday night explained his absence. After being asked why J.T. was missing, the rapper responded, \u201cHe thought it was a scam.\u201d\n\nLobel, who played Sean\u2019s friend Jay Hogart for seven seasons, initially seemed irked he was not asked to appear in the video. On Wednesday night, he tweeted, \u201cI\u2019m a little upset.\u201d\n\nWhen reached for comment, he told us he was sure it was a production oversight: \u201cYeah I honestly don\u2019t have much to say on it, I wasn\u2019t invited to the shoot. I love Aubrey and think he\u2019s a great guy, everyone looked great in the video and I wish I could have been there to hang out with the crew.\u201d\n\nDrake, whose real name is Aubrey Graham, starred on the series as basketball star Jimmy Brooks for eight seasons. Other \u201cDegrassi: The Next Generation\u201d stars who did appear in the music video include Stefan Brogren (Snake), Shane Kippel (Spinner), Miriam McDonald (Emma), Cassie Steele (Manny), Sarah Barrable-Tishauer (Liberty), Lauren Collins (Paige), Adamo Ruggiero (Marco), Stacey Farber (Ellie), Jake Goldsbie (Toby), Jake Epstein (Craig), Andrea Lewis (Hazel), Christina Schmidt (Terri), Nina Dobrev (Mia), Melissa McIntyre (Ashley), LinLyn Lue (Ms. Kwan), Marc Donato (Derek), Dalmar Abuzeid (Danny), A.J. Saudin (Connor) and Paula Brancati (Jane).\n\nEven Ephraim Ellis, whose character Rick was responsible for putting Drake\u2019s character in a wheelchair, made an appearance despite the fact that, like Cooley, he was killed off on the show.\n\nJason Mewes and Kevin Smith, who had guest-star appearances on the show through the years, also popped up in the music video.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/degrassi.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/degrassi.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/degrassi.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/06/14/this-degrassi-actor-is-upset-he-was-left-out-of-drakes-new-video/", "title": "This \u2018Degrassi\u2019 actor is upset he was left out of Drake\u2019s new video", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
