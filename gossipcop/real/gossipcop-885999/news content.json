The three joined forces for the first concert performance of \u201cSafari.\u201d The Colombian singer and Williams have been friends for a while and we\u2019ve all been following this bromance since day one. \u201cIt is a blessing anytime I get to work with Pharrell. He has been a great teacher, in music, fashion, my career and more,\u201d the singer tells E! News.\n\n\n\n\u201cHaving him and BIA join me on the recording of \u2018Safari\u2018 was a dream come true, and I\u2019m grateful that we all finally got the chance to perform the song together in concert.\u201d The Energ\u00eda Tour, presented by Buchanan\u2019s, might just bring more celebrity guests since we know Balvin\u2019s got some pretty famous friends. The 32-year-old singer continues to work with whisky brand for their #EsNuestroMomento campaign. Back in March, the singer gave fans an opportunity to collaborate with him. Balvin\u2019s humble approach and constant evolution might just be the secret sauce of his unprecedented success seeing as \u201cMi Gente\u201d is about to join the Billion club on YouTube and Beyonc\u00e9 remixed the Balvin and Willy William smash hit. The track just skyrocketed to No. 3 on Billboard Hot 100.\n\n*eonline.com", "images": ["https://i.postimg.cc/YCdjz9jm/Eyedress20-Spaghetti20-Press20shot.jpg", "https://img7.uploadhouse.com/fileuploads/25518/25518387e2d27e652d25808a9154deece5416291.jpg", "https://i.postimg.cc/BnW8zYQc/Run-The-Jewels.jpg", "https://img3.uploadhouse.com/fileuploads/23086/2308610348eb7afeedee3f775b1ed8c5a988bdd5.png", "https://theneptunes.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/theneptunes.org-logo-footer.jpg", "https://theneptunes.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/sddefault-150x150.png", "https://theneptunes.org/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/theneptunes.org-logo.jpg", "https://i.postimg.cc/63R4VwKZ/SG-Lewis-I.jpg", "https://i.postimg.cc/WpByxfNR/maxresdefault.jpg", "https://img6.uploadhouse.com/fileuploads/25518/255183868d381c283abb0746db98235232d490bd.jpg", "https://i.postimg.cc/3JJXKZ4r/130740513-218214126443975-8526351777934701153-n.jpg", "https://i.postimg.cc/3wG5rww9/Nigo-Pharrell-gfdgr.jpg"], "top_img": "https://img6.uploadhouse.com/fileuploads/25518/255183868d381c283abb0746db98235232d490bd.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://theneptunes.org/2017/10/j-balvin-talks-about-his-friendship-with-pharrell-williams/", "title": "J Balvin Talks About His Friendship With Pharrell Williams", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "J Balvin Talks About His Friendship With Pharrell Williams - The Neptunes #1 fan site, all about Pharrell Williams and Chad Hugo", "description": "Los Angeles fans were in for a big surprise Sunday night when BIA and Pharrell Williams joined J Balvin at his sold-out concert.
