Here\u2019s what you need to know. (Video: Taylor Turner, Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\n\nComment on this story Comment Gift Article Share\n\n\u201cVice,\u201d the film about Vice President Dick Cheney that the general public won\u2019t be able to see until Christmas Day, earned six Golden Globe nominations, the most of any movie this year, while FX\u2019s \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u201d did best among TV series, with four nods. Wp Get the full experience. Choose your plan ArrowRight The 2019 Golden Globe announcements Thursday morning continued the streaming wars, but FX\u2019s 10 nods for shows such as \u201cAtlanta,\u201d \u201cPose\u201d and the final season of \u201cThe Americans\u201d meant a cable network earned the most nominations. HBO and Amazon each received nine nominations, followed by Netflix\u2019s eight. And in an era of prestige television, network TV received just four (three for NBC and one for CBS).\n\n\u201cThe Favourite,\u201d \u201cGreen Book\u201d and \u201cA Star Is Born,\u201d Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga\u2019s commercial and critical hit, received five nominations each, including for top acting and movie prizes.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd voters didn\u2019t ignore massive box office sensations. \u201cBlack Panther\u201d received three nominations (best original song, score and dramatic movie), and \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d was nominated for best musical or comedy movie and for best actress (Constance Wu).\n\n\u201cMary Poppins Returns,\u201d which also hasn\u2019t yet been released in theaters nationwide, received four nominations, including consideration for lead actors Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda.\n\nAnd only men are nominated for best directing in a motion picture, nearly a year after Natalie Portman made headlines for introducing that category of \u201call-male nominees\u201d during the ceremony.\n\nThe nominations still leave several questions: Will \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d which cleaned up at the 2018 Emmys and Golden Globes, make a repeat sweep in the three categories it\u2019s nominated in? Will box office disappointments like \u201cGreen Book\u201d become voter favorites? Can any song beat the memeable \u201cShallow\u201d? Does any other supporting actress stand a chance against Patricia Clarkson in \u201cSharp Objects\u201d?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAndy Samberg (NBC\u2019s \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d) and Sandra Oh (who is nominated for best dramatic actress in the television category for BBC America\u2019s \u201cKilling Eve\u201d) will host the 76th Annual Golden Globe Awards on Jan. 6 on NBC.\n\nThis post will update frequently with instant analysis.

Barry Jenkins (\u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d) won this award in 2017 for his last film, \u201cMoonlight,\u201d and \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d has been framed as Spike Lee\u2019s comeback. The only surprising nominee is arguably \u201cBohemian Rhapsody,\u201d which soared at the box office but received mixed reviews from critics. Many assumed early on that it would compete in the comedy or musical category.\n\nBest actress in a motion picture, drama\n\nAdvertisement\n\nGlenn Close, \u201cThe Wife\u201d\n\nLady Gaga, \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d\n\nNicole Kidman, \u201cDestroyer\u201d\n\nMelissa McCarthy, \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d\n\nRosamund Pike, \u201cA Private War\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d is considered one of Melissa McCarthy\u2019s first dramatic projects, while \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d was Lady Gaga\u2019s feature-film debut as a lead actress. On the other hand, we have veteran dramatic film actresses Glenn Close and Nicole Kidman. Rosamund Pike falls somewhere in the middle, with \u201cA Private War\u201d finally giving her another chance to showcase the acting chops that \u201cGone Girl\u201d proved she had. It\u2019s a tight race.\n\nBest actor in a motion picture, drama\n\nBradley Cooper, \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d\n\nWillem Dafoe, \u201cAt Eternity\u2019s Gate\u201d\n\nRami Malek, \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d\n\nJohn David Washington, \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d\n\nLucas Hedges, \u201cBoy Erased\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: This is probably the less exciting category for Bradley Cooper, who also earned a directing nomination for his debut film. Dafoe\u2019s performance as the much-younger Vincent Van Gogh is said to be one of his best ever, and Rami Malek\u2019s portrayal of Freddie Mercury is the only element of \u201cBohemian Rhapsody\u201d that almost everyone agreed worked well. This is the first-ever Golden Globe nomination for both John David Washington and Lucas Hedges. Again, another tight race.\n\nBest motion picture, comedy or musical\n\n\u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Favourite\u201d\n\n\u201cGreen Book\u201d\n\n\u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d\n\n\u201cVice\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d and \u201cVice\u201d haven\u2019t hit theaters yet, but both feature promising casts \u2014 Emily Blunt and Lin-Manuel Miranda in the former; Christian Bale, Amy Adams and Sam Rockwell in the latter \u2014 and stories that will probably evoke very different kinds of nostalgia. \u201cThe Favourite\u201d has been described as Yorgos Lanthimos\u2019s most approachable film, while \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d and \u201cGreen Book\u201d were both crowd-pleasers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest actor in a motion picture, comedy or musical\n\nChristian Bale, \u201cVice\u201d\n\nLin-Manuel Miranda, \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d\n\nViggo Mortensen, \u201cGreen Book\u201d\n\nRobert Redford, \u201cThe Old Man and the Gun\u201d\n\nJohn C. Reilly, \u201cStan and Ollie\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: General audiences have yet to see or hear much about John C. Reilly in \u201cStan and Ollie,\u201d which hits theaters after Christmas. The other nominees aren\u2019t major surprises: Even critics who disliked \u201cGreen Book\u201d praised Viggo Mortensen; the trailer for \u201cVice,\u201d set for a Christmas-day release, earned major buzz for Christian Bale\u2019s transformation into Dick Cheney; and Lin-Manuel Miranda rapping is among the most memorable aspects of the \u201cMary Poppins\u201d sequel. Award shows also love swan songs, and Robert Redford, 82, announced that he would retire from acting after \u201cThe Old Man and the Gun.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest actress in a motion picture, comedy or musical\n\nEmily Blunt, \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d\n\nOlivia Colman, \u201cThe Favourite\u201d\n\nElsie Fisher, \u201cEighth Grade\u201d\n\nCharlize Theron, \u201cTully\u201d\n\nConstance Wu, \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: At just 15 years old, Elsie Fisher is likely one of the youngest actresses to be nominated in this category. \u201cThe Favourite\u201d wisely submitted Olivia Colman as a lead actress, all but securing a nomination for the three main members of its cast. This is a tight race, especially given that Emily Blunt and Charlize Theron\u2019s performances brought their respective films to life. Constance Wu doesn\u2019t seem to stand much of a chance.\n\nBest director, motion picture\n\nBradley Cooper, \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d\n\nAlfonso Cuar\u00f3n, \u201cRoma\u201d\n\nPeter Farrelly, \u201cGreen Book\u201d\n\nSpike Lee, \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d\n\nAdam McKay, \u201cVice\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Natalie Portman made headlines in January when she presented this award by introducing \u201cthe all-male nominees.\u201d Not much has changed since then. All five of these men were floated as potential contenders before the official announcement, but two are especially notable: Bradley Cooper and Peter Farrelly. \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d is the directorial debut of Cooper, who has previously earned two acting nominations, and \u201cGreen Book\u201d is the first Golden Globe nod for Farrelly, known for \u201cThere\u2019s Something About Mary\u201d and \u201cDumb and Dumber.\u201d\n\nBest supporting actress in a motion picture\n\nAmy Adams, \u201cVice\"\n\nClaire Foy, \u201cFirst Man\u201d\n\nRegina King, \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d\n\nEmma Stone, \u201cThe Favourite\u201d\n\nRachel Weisz, \u201cThe Favourite\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Strong performances bolster \u201cThe Favourite,\u201d so it makes sense that multiple members of the boisterous main trio \u2014 which consists of Olivia Colman, Emma Stone and Rachel Weisz \u2014 made the cut. The New York Film Critics Circle recently honored Regina King for her performance as an anguished mother in \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d and Amy Adams, while in a movie that has yet to be released, has two Golden Globe wins and six nominations under her belt. Claire Foy is a reliable performer but somewhat of a surprise nominee, as many critics agree that \u201cFirst Man\u201d gave her little to do.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBest supporting actor in a motion picture\n\nMahershala Ali, \u201cGreen Book\u201d\n\nTimoth\u00e9e Chalamet, \u201cBeautiful Boy\u201d\n\nAdam Driver, \u201cBlacKkKlansman\u201d\n\nRichard E. Grant, \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d\n\nSam Rockwell, \u201cVice\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Pundits predicted a majority of these nominees months ago, especially in the cases of Mahershala Ali, who was nominated for \u201cMoonlight\u201d in 2017; Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet, who was nominated for his lead role in \u201cCall Me By Your Name\u201d in 2018; and Sam Rockwell, who won for \u201cThree Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\u201d in 2018. Some critics argued that Adam Driver outshone lead John David Washington in \u201cBlacKkKlansman,\u201d while Richard E. Grant stole many of his scenes as Melissa McCarthy\u2019s comical sidekick in \u201cCan You Ever Forgive Me?\u201d\n\nBest screenplay, motion picture\n\n\u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk\u201d\n\n\u201cThe Favourite\u201d\n\n\u201cGreen Book\u201d\n\n\u201cVice\u201d\n\n\u201cRoma\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: More-unusual films often wind up in the best screenplay category, but Paul Schrader\u2019s \u201cFirst Reformed\u201d didn\u2019t make the cut. \u201cThe Favourite\u201d makes sense, given its quippy dialogue, as do the touching \u201cRoma,\u201d buzzy \u201cVice\u201d and James Baldwin adaptation \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk.\u201d \u201cGreen Book\u201d is perhaps the most interesting choice of the bunch, as it was co-written by Nick Vallelonga, the real-life son of Viggo Mortensen\u2019s character, Tony.\n\nBest animated feature film\n\n\u201cIncredibles 2\u201d\n\n\u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d\n\n\u201cMirai\u201d\n\n\u201cRalph Breaks the Internet\u201d\n\n\u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: The only other animated film that had a real shot was \u201cEarly Man,\u201d a stop-motion flick from Nick Park (\u201cWallace and Gromit,\u201d \u201cShaun the Sheep\u201d). Disney and Pixar dominate this category every year at the Golden Globes \u2014 which tend to nominate one or two international, non-CGI projects to fill out a diverse field \u2014 and \u201cIncredibles 2\u201d is poised to continue that trend. The only film that could really pull off an upset is \u201cSpider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse,\u201d which features a Marvel superhero of color named Miles Morales.\n\nBest foreign language film\n\n\u201cCapernaum\u201d\n\n\u201cGirl\u201d\n\n\u201cNever Look Away\u201d\n\n\u201cRoma\u201d\n\n\u201cShoplifters\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: The most notable snubs here are Poland\u2019s \u201cCold War\u201d and South Korea\u2019s \u201cBurning,\u201d both of which many film critics named on their year-end lists. Reviews for \u201cCapernaum,\u201d \u201cNever Look Away\u201d and especially \u201cShoplifters\u201d are positive, and \u201cRoma,\u201d inspired by director Alfonso Cuar\u00f3n\u2019s upbringing, seems likely to land an Oscar nomination for best picture. \u201cGirl\u201d is a relatively controversial pick \u2014 while it earned a standing ovation at the Cannes Film Festival, it features underage frontal nudity and has received backlash from some trans critics.\n\nBest original song\n\n\u201cAll the Stars,\u201d \u201cBlack Panther\u201d\n\n\u201cGirl in the Movies,\u201d \u201cDumplin\u2019\u201d\n\n\u201cRevelation,\u201d \u201cBoy Erased\u201d\n\n\u201cShallow,\u201d \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d\n\n\u201cRequiem for a Private War,\u201d \u201cA Private War\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Lady Gaga and Bradley Cooper\u2019s \u201cShallow\u201d is the clear front-runner, having been stuck in everyone\u2019s head since the trailer for \u201cA Star Is Born\u201d first hit YouTube. Kendrick Lamar and SZA\u2019s \u201cAll the Stars\u201d had a similar effect \u2014 but to a lesser extent \u2014 much earlier in the year. The other nominees were slightly less predictable but also bolstered by star power: Dolly Parton sings \u201cGirl in the Movies\u201d; \u201cRequiem for a Private War\u201d is Annie Lennox\u2019s first new solo song in eight years; and \u201cRevelation\u201d succeeded in reaching a younger audience by pairing Sigur R\u00f3s frontman J\u00f3nsi with pop star Troye Sivan, who also has a supporting role in \u201cBoy Erased.\u201d\n\nBest original score, motion picture\n\nJustin Hurwitz, \u201cFirst Man\u201d\n\nMarc Shaiman, \u201cMary Poppins Returns\u201d\n\nMarco Beltrami, \u201cA Quiet Place\u201d\n\nAlexandre Desplat, \u201cIsle of Dogs\u201d\n\nLudwig Goransson, \u201cBlack Panther\u201d\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Like most non-acting categories, there\u2019s often gender disparity among nominated composers. The lack of Nicholas Britell, who was nominated in 2017 for scoring \u201cMoonlight\u201d and seemed likely to earn a nod for \u201cIf Beale Street Could Talk,\u201d is notable.\n\nBest TV series, drama\n\n\u201cKilling Eve\u201d (BBC America)\n\n\u201cHomecoming\u201d (Amazon)\n\n\u201cThe Americans\u201d (FX)\n\n\u201cPose\u201d (FX)\n\n\u201cBodyguard\u201d (Netflix)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Will \u201cThe Americans\u201d finally get its due after (finally) being nominated for its stunning final season? The FX drama could get overshadowed by BBC America\u2019s beloved \u201cKilling Eve,\u201d starring recently announced Golden Globes co-host Sandra Oh.\n\nBest actress in a TV series, drama\n\nSandra Oh, \u201cKilling Eve\u201d (BBC America)\n\nJulia Roberts, \u201cHomecoming\u201d (Amazon)\n\nKeri Russell, \u201cThe Americans\u201d (FX)\n\nElisabeth Moss, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu)\n\nCaitriona Balfe, \u201cOutlander\u201d (Starz)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: The Golden Globes love movie stars, so it\u2019s no shock to see Julia Roberts land a nod for \u201cHomecoming\u201d \u2014 and plenty of critics seemed to love the series as well. Elisabeth Moss, last year\u2019s winner, might be the one to beat again, although she\u2019ll have some tough competition from Sandra Oh, who is co-hosting the show, and Keri Russell, thanks to a knockout final season of \u201cThe Americans.\u201d Caitriona Balfe\u2019s inclusion may seem like a surprise (she didn\u2019t show up on many predictions lists), but this is her fourth-consecutive nomination.\n\nBest actor in a TV series, drama\n\nMatthew Rhys, \u201cThe Americans\u201d (FX)\n\nStephan James, \u201cHomecoming\u201d (Amazon)\n\nBilly Porter, \u201cPose\u201d (FX)\n\nJason Bateman, \u201cOzark\u201d (Netflix)\n\nRichard Madden, \u201cBodyguard\u201d (Netflix)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Last year\u2019s winner, Sterling K. Brown, wasn\u2019t even nominated this year. \u201cThis Is Us\u201d may have lost a bit of its breakout hit luster, but Brown still gets accolades for his emotional performances every week. In any case, the field is wide open, as the only repeat nominee is Jason Bateman for \u201cOzark.\u201d\n\nBest TV series, musical or comedy\n\n\u201cBarry\u201d (HBO)\n\n\u201cThe Good Place\u201d (NBC)\n\n\u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d (Amazon)\n\n\u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d (Netflix)\n\n\u201cKidding\u201d (Showtime)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: This is a solid lineup for a prestigious category. \u201cBarry\u201d is an obvious choice here \u2014 critics loved it \u2014 but Bill Hader\u2019s HBO dramedy faces strong competition from last year\u2019s winner, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel,\u201d which returned in fine form for its second season this week. The HFPA could also go with \u201cKidding,\u201d starring two-time Golden Globe winner Jim Carrey, who landed his first nomination in a TV category.\n\nBest actress in a TV series, musical or comedy\n\nRachel Brosnahan, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d (Amazon)\n\nAlison Brie, \u201cGLOW\u201d (Netflix)\n\nKristen Bell, \u201cThe Good Place\u201d (NBC)\n\nDebra Messing, \u201cWill & Grace\u201d (NBC)\n\nCandice Bergen, \u201cMurphy Brown\u201d (CBS)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Look at that \u2014 a category with more broadcast TV nominations than streaming services! NBC, network of the Globes, must be especially thrilled. Of course, Brosnahan is the front-runner with her delightful starring role as a housewife turned comedian, but the Globes like to throw curveballs. Given the fact that Candice Bergen landed a spot over some other tough competition (Issa Rae in \u201cInsecure,\u201d Maya Rudolph in \u201cForever\u201d), she might just take the prize.\n\nBest actor in a TV series, musical or comedy\n\nBill Hader, \u201cBarry\u201d (HBO)\n\nDonald Glover, \u201cAtlanta\u201d (FX)\n\nJim Carrey, \u201cKidding\u201d (Showtime)\n\nMichael Douglas, \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d (Netflix)\n\nSacha Baron Cohen, \u201cWho Is America?\u201d (Showtime)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Fun fact: This is a completely different lineup from last year, with no repeat names. And with the exception of Donald Glover (who won two years ago for \u201cAtlanta\u201d), none of these actors has ever been in this category before. While you could have probably guessed that movie stars like Jim Carrey and Michael Douglas would show up here, it is a bit of a mystery that Ted Danson of \u201cThe Good Place\u201d was left off the list. (And just for the record, we predict that Sacha Baron Cohen will walk away with this, although Bill Hader may be a close second.)\n\nBest TV movie or limited series\n\n\u201cSharp Objects\u201d (HBO)\n\n\u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u201d (FX)\n\n\u201cA Very English Scandal\u201d (Amazon)\n\n\u201cEscape at Dannemora\u201d (Showtime)\n\n\u201cThe Alienist\u201d (TNT)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: Leave it to the Hollywood Foreign Press Association to remind us of shows we completely overlooked this year \u2014 like Amazon\u2019s \u201cA Very English Scandal,\u201d which originally aired as a BBC miniseries. Beyond that, the category shows love to several critically acclaimed series and TNT\u2019s \u201cThe Alienist,\u201d which seems to be an awards show favorite this year. HBO\u2019s \u201cSharp Objects\u201d feels like the one to beat, but don\u2019t discount \u201cEscape at Dannemora\u201d or Ryan Murphy\u2019s \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace.\u201d Basically, it\u2019s anyone\u2019s game.\n\nBest actress in a TV movie or limited series\n\nAmy Adams, \u201cSharp Objects\u201d (HBO)\n\nPatricia Arquette, \u201cEscape at Dannemora\u201d (Showtime)\n\nLaura Dern, \u201cThe Tale\u201d (HBO)\n\nRegina King, \u201cSeven Seconds\u201d (Netflix)\n\nConnie Britton, \u201cDirty John\u201d (Bravo)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: The only name we\u2019re surprised to see here is Connie Britton, who is nominated for Bravo\u2019s disappointing limited series \u201cDirty John,\u201d which is based on the popular Los Angeles Times series turned podcast. The prize could really go to any of the women in this category, but we won\u2019t be surprised if Amy Adams takes it for HBO\u2019s closely watched \u201cSharp Objects.\u201d\n\nBest actor in a TV movie or limited series\n\nDarren Criss, \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u201d (FX)\n\nHugh Grant, \u201cA Very English Scandal\u201d (Amazon)\n\nBenedict Cumberbatch, \u201cPatrick Melrose\u201d (Showtime)\n\nAntonio Banderas, \u201cGenius: Picasso\u201d (National Geographic)\n\nDaniel Br\u00fchl, \u201cThe Alienist\u201d (TNT)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: This is pretty much what we expected from this category. Criss\u2019s performance in \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace\u201d won him critical acclaim \u2014 and an Emmy \u2014 but we\u2019re keeping our eyes on two voter favorites: Hugh Grant and Benedict Cumberbatch.\n\nBest supporting actress in a series, limited series or TV movie\n\nPatricia Clarkson, \u201cSharp Objects\u201d (HBO)\n\nThandie Newton, \u201cWestworld\u201d (HBO)\n\nPen\u00e9lope Cruz, \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u201d (FX)\n\nAlex Borstein, \u201cThe Marvelous Mrs. Maisel\u201d (Amazon)\n\nYvonne Strahovski, \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d (Hulu)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: There were at least two shoo-ins on this list: Yvonne Strahovski had a standout season on \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d and Patricia Clarkson\u2019s brutal performance in the grisly \u201cSharp Objects\u201d made plenty of headlines. While Pen\u00e9lope Cruz and Thandie Newton were also loved by critics and voters alike, Alex Borstein is the lone comedy nominee. Although it seems like a long shot that she could triumph over Clarkson, Borstein did win the Emmy this year for her \u201cMaisel\u201d role.\n\nBest supporting actor in a series, limited series or TV movie\n\nEdgar Ramirez, \u201cThe Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story\u201d (FX)\n\nBen Whishaw, \u201cA Very English Scandal\u201d (Amazon)\n\nHenry Winkler, \u201cBarry\u201d (HBO)\n\nAlan Arkin, \u201cThe Kominsky Method\u201d (Netflix)\n\nKieran Culkin, \u201cSuccession\u201d (HBO)\n\nIMMEDIATE REACTION: It feels safe to say that few people (if anyone) expected this list to include Kieran Culkin of \u201cSuccession,\u201d the HBO drama about a very wealthy and very dysfunctional family that owns a media empire. The rest were a bit more predictable, including this year\u2019s Emmy winner in this category, Henry Winkler.\n\nCorrection: An earlier version of this article listed \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d as a nominee for best drama series. It was not nominated in that category.
