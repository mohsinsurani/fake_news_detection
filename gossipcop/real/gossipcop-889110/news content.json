Luckily for all of us, American pioneer Khloe Kardashian finally discovered a way to get a flawless driver's license picture taken.\n\nOn last night's episode of Keeping Up With The Kardshians, the youngest of the Kardashian sisters had to make a trip to the DMV to get a new license (celebs, they're just like us). For the occasion, Khloe wasn't about to accept a lackluster photo like the rest of us commoners, so instead she brought her own lighting crew and glam squad along with her.\n\nE! Online\n\nKUWTK lighting director Landon Hosto was there to direct the photo session and hold up a giant round lighting fixture around Khloe's face\u2014which surely the folks at the DMV really enjoyed. Malika Haqq, meanwhile, was on-hand to give Khloe a few glam touchups before the photo session.\n\n\n\nAnd the end result? Flawless.\n\nE! Online\n\nWhile Karl Benz may be credited as the inventor of the first automobile, let the history books reflect that Khloe Kardashian single-handedly reinvented driver's license photos in the year 2017. Let us all aspire to someday reach this level of extra.\n\n[h/t E!]", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2478974-012-1665067784.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-arriving-for-lunch-at-the-abbey-of-san-news-photo-1665070515.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0551xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/765453da-3fc9-4650-8bff-01664371711e_1538431767.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rs-1024x576-171023121629-dl8-1509394813.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-del-castillo-teresa-mendoza-lrds3-tlmd-2-1664910940.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0566xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rs-1024x575-171023121629-dl2-1509392949.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.892xh;0,0.0640xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rs-1024x575-171023121629-dl2-1509392949.jpg?crop=0.562xw:1.00xh;0.220xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-on-september-26-news-photo-1665065585.jpg?crop=0.941xw:1.00xh;0.0304xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665155826.jpg?crop=0.984xw:1.00xh;0.00962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2479931-003-1665162992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0192xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665151779.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/hearst_magazines/5772762ed559303ef854e272/thumb_1467119151.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-and-gisele-b-c3-bcndchen-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1664907170.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rs-1024x574-171023121628-dl5-1509394788.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/rs-1024x575-171023121629-dl2-1509392949.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.892xh;0,0.0640xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a13121609/khloe-kardashian-dmv-drivers-license-photo/", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Staged The Most Extra Driver's License Photo Shoot at The DMV", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Khloe Kardashian Brought A Lighting Crew To The DMV -
