Candy a**es.\u201d\n\nThat set off a tizzy, as fans theorized Johnson was talking about Diesel.\n\nJohnson posted an Instagram of a clip from filming and wrote, \u201cYou guys reading this know how much I believe in the idea of TEAM EFFORT. That means respecting every person, their time and their value when they step on to my set or partner with our production company. And like with any team - that\u2019s a family - there\u2019s gonna be conflict.\u201d\n\n\u201cFamily is gonna have differences of opinion and fundamental core beliefs,\u201d Johnson continued. \u201cTo me, conflict can be a good thing, when its followed by great resolution.\u201d\n\nThings got so heated that costar Tyrese Gibson weighed in on social media, seeming to side with Diesel.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to announce that if Dewayne [sic] is in Fast9 there will no more Roman Peirce [sic],\u201d Gibson wrote on an Instagram posting. \u201cYou mess with family and my daughters survival I mess with yours\u2026\u2026\u2026 close your eyes dude you\u2019re a \u2018Clown.\u2019\u201d\n\nRelated: Tyrese Gibson threatens to quit \u2018Fast and Furious\u2019\n\nJohnson confirmed to Rolling Stone that he and Diesel\u2019s scenes were shot separately.\n\n\u201cThat is correct,\u201d the superstar said. \u201cWe were not in any scenes together.\u201d\n\nThe actor is set to star in a \u201cFast & Furious\u201d spinoff, \u201cHobbs and Shaw,\u201d which costars Jason Statham and is due out next year.\n\nAs for where Johnson and Diesel go from here, The Rock said \u201cI wish him all the best, and I harbor no ill will there, just because of the clarity we have.\u201d\n\n\u201cActually, you can erase that last part about \u2018no ill will,\u2019\u201d Johnson said. \u201cWe\u2019ll just keep it with the clarity.\u201d\n\nDiesel told USA Today last year he felt some things with Johnson had been \u201cblown out of proportion.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not always easy being an alpha\u201d the actor said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s two alphas. Being an alpha is sometimes a pain in the (butt).\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180623021911-dean-cain-superman-reserve-police-officer-newsource-orig-00000000.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1078,w_1915,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180405103638-02-dwayne-johnson-vin-diesel-restricted.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1425,w_2534,c_fill/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180122103509-ed-sheeran.jpg?q=x_0,y_175,h_2767,w_4917,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/160509113020-johnny-depp.jpg?q=x_3,y_254,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150424072306-01-scarlett-johansson-0424.jpg?q=x_5,y_0,h_2807,w_4989,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170519151216-the-rock.jpg?q=h_619,w_1024,x_0,y_38,c_crop/h_619,w_1100,c_lpad,b_rgb:061015/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180630174320-john-legend-families-togther-rally.jpg?q=x_291,y_101,h_811,w_1441,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180630095301-kenan-kel.jpg?q=x_336,y_11,h_755,w_1341,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180629053111-jon-stewart-01.jpg?q=x_241,y_97,h_850,w_1511,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180629070529-backstreet-boys-fallon.jpg?q=x_209,y_88,h_818,w_1454,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929104601-lisa-france-profile-image.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180903193755-geoffrey-owens.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1080,w_1919,c_fill/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180913083415-henry-cavill-superman-mxp-vpx-00000114.jpg?q=x_229,y_139,h_782,w_1389,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180623105505-kit-harington-rose-leslie.jpg?q=x_3,y_152,h_1302,w_2314,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180623144804-paul-ryan-seth-rogen.jpg?q=x_3,y_0,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180623024107-paul-mccartney-carpool-karaoke-sot-nr-00002501.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1078,w_1915,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150217160613-eminem-cannon-split.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180621073700-pete-davidson-ariana-grande-engagement-tonight-show-1.jpg?q=x_148,y_41,h_806,w_1433,c_crop/w_250", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180710094223-01-george-clooney-file-2018.jpg?q=x_127,y_57,h_1592,w_2830,c_crop/w_250"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180405103638-02-dwayne-johnson-vin-diesel-restricted.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1425,w_2534,c_fill/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/05/entertainment/dwayne-johnson-vin-diesel-feud/index.html", "title": "Dwayne Johnson shares Vin Diesel feud backstory", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Dwayne Johnson shares Vin Diesel feud backstory | CNN", "description": "What we would have given to be a fly on the wall in the trailer with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Vin Diesel.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180405103638-02-dwayne-johnson-vin-diesel-restricted.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1425,w_2534,c_fill/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/05/entertainment/dwayne-johnson-vin-diesel-feud/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Dwayne Johnson shares Vin Diesel feud backstory | CNN", "description": "What we would have given to be a fly on the wall in the trailer with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Vin Diesel.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180405103638-02-dwayne-johnson-vin-diesel-restricted.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1425,w_2534,c_fill/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "What we would have given to be a fly on the wall in the trailer with Dwayne \"The Rock\" Johnson and Vin Diesel.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-05T15:06:23Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-07T19:38:05Z", "tag": "celebrities, dwayne johnson, vin diesel", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "celebrities, dwayne johnson, vin diesel", "author": "Lisa Respers France", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522882800.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
