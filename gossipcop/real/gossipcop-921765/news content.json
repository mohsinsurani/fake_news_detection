After several teaser shots of the new campaign\u2014officially called \u201cLa Collection Memento N\u00b02\u201c\u2014KENZO and Spears finally unveiled their partnership on their social media channels.\n\nThe campaign, shot by legendary photographer Peter Lindbergh, focuses on the idea of cultural icons\u2014something that Spears wholeheartedly embodies. With a heavy focus on denim and the quintessential KENZO motifs, the collection is vast and wide ranging for both men, women and some pieces that may be worn by both genders. One of those motifs, for which KENZO had become internationally recognized, is \u201cthe jumping tiger,\u201d developed by Kenzo Takada in the 1970s.\n\n\u201cI was really flattered when KENZO approached me to the face of their 50th anniversary line,\u201d began Spears. \u201cI love the brand, and with denim being a big part of this collection, it made it that much more appealing to me since denim is such a part of my own style.\u201d (Who could ever forget her matching denim-on-denim moment on the Grammy\u2019s red carpet with then-beau Justin Timberlake?)\n\nThe collection elevates the ever-popular \u201cathleisure\u201d trend. For the main ad campaign shot, Britney Spears wears the Cropped \u2018Bamboo Tiger\u2019 Sweatshirt, the Denim \u2018Bamboo Tiger\u2019 Denim Baseball Cap (already sold out), The Mini Denim \u2018Kanagawa Wave\u2019 Rucksack and the Denim Shorts.\n\nThe collaboration certainly is a match made in heaven. Spears\u2019 is a timeless, American icon, and her reign as the queen of pop will surely last generations to come.\n\nAll photos from KENZO website.", "images":
