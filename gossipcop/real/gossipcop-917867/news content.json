This year\u2019s Razzies also awarded The Mummy, Fifty Shades Darker, and Baywatch, among other critically-maligned movies.\n\nTraditionally held the day before the Oscars, the Golden Raspberry Awards is attempting to become as much of a Hollywood institution as the Academy Awards themselves, but it might take some time before they achieve that level of prominence (if they do at all). As much as the Oscars are meant to honor the best that Hollywood has to offer, the Razzies do the opposite and disrespect to the worst of the worst. The Razzies are notable in that they traditionally target blockbusters that flopped at the box office and arthouse films that perhaps didn\u2019t strike a chord with general audiences, as well as particularly any movie that might place special effects, spectacle, and stars over its storytelling.\n\nRelated: Bad Movies Worse Than The Razzie 2018 Nominations\n\nThe 38th Annual Razzie Awards winners were announced this morning on YouTube, which can be viewed in the section above. While several movies took home awards this year, The Emjoi Movie won the most Razzies. It picked up four wins in total: Worst Picture, Worst Director, Worst Screenplay, and Worst Screen Duo for \u201cany two obnoxious emojis.\u201d\n\nFifty Shades Darker also picked up two Razzies, with the film itself being named the Worst Prequel, Remake, Rip-off, or Sequel of 2018 and Kim Basinger being named Worst Supporting Actress for her campy performance as Elena Lincoln. Mel Gibson was awarded for his non-performance in Daddy\u2019s Home 2 and named 2018\u2019s Worst Supporting Actor.\n\nTom Cruise, who previously earned a Razzie as one-half of Worst Screen Duo with Brad Pitt for Interview With The Vampire, finally won a Razzie as a solo act after many nominations. For his performance as Nick Morton in The Mummy, Cruise was named the Worst Actor of 2018. Tyler Perry was likewise named Worst Actress for his performance as Mabel \u201cMadea\u201d Simmons in Boo 2! A Madea Halloween. The Barry L. Bumstead Award \u2013 traditionally given to the worst film of the year that was not eligible to be nominated \u2013 was given to CHIPS. The Razzies also presented a special award, in conjunction with review-aggregate website Rotten Tomatoes, to Baywatch as the Razzie Nominee So Rotten You Loved It.\n\nSatirical as ever, the Razzies gave a nod to the #MeToo and #TimesUp movements with an In Memoriam segment devoted to the careers of the many producers, directors, and actors whose careers ended following allegations of harassment and misconduct. The musical montage of photos concludes with the words, \u201cVery Sorry, But We Won\u2019t Be Missing You \u2013 Or Your Kind.\u201d The Razzies also gave this year\u2019s Razzie Redeemer Award (a special award for previous Razzie winners who have made up for their previous bad work) to Hollywood itself, for attempting to create \u201ca Safe Hollywood-Haven where talent is protected, nourished and allowed to flourish with proper compensation.\u201d\n\nMore: 27 Worst Movies Ever Made (According To The Razzies)\n\nSource: The Razzie Awards\n\nThePremium Network Ad Free Browsing\n\nAd Free Browsing Over 10,000 Videos!\n\nOver 10,000 Videos!
