holiday.\n\nMost women I know think it\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s overrated, but some practically start foaming at the mouth whenever Refinery29 decides to start writing about it.\n\nStill, there is one thing I think we can all agree on: finding the perfect Valentine\u2019s Day gift is a Herculean task.\n\nLuckily, Gigi and Zayn just gave us a genius\u00c2 idea.\n\nThis year, instead of buying your boyfriend that fancy liquor he likes but is always too much of a scrub to spring for, get your boyfriend the Valentine\u2019s Day gift that shows the world his d belongs to you.\n\nGet him a keychain with your name on it.\n\nIt\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s the perfect litmus test to see if your boyfriend is one hundo percent obsessed with you or just in it for the nookie.\n\nREAD ALSO: Don\u2019t Worry If You\u2019re Single This V-Day, So Is Half of Sweden\u00c2\n\nZayn may be a reformed f*ckboy\u00c2 who smokes a lot of pot and believes in aliens\u00c2 \u00e2\u20ac\u201d come to think of it, those two qualities really go hand-in-hand \u00e2\u20ac\u201d\u00c2 but he has the one quality every woman looks for in a man: he will do anything for his girlfriend.\n\nJust like he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not embarrassed to spend a cozy winter\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s day taking selfies with her, he\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s not embarrassed to walk around town with a keychain with her name on it.\n\nNow that\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s love.\n\nREAD ALSO: How Zayn Got Gigi, Forward to Your Local F*ckboy\n\nPlus, getting your boyfriend a keychain with your name on it is like the perfect anti-cheating device.\n\nSure, where there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a will there\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s a way, but if goes out and reverts to his f*ckboy roots, any self-respecting girl will take one look at that keychain and be like, boy bye.\n\nSeriously, the gift idea is brilliant.\n\nDo it and see how your love compares to one of the greatest love stories of the millennial generation.\n\nI double dog dare you.\n\nREAD ALSO: Gigi\u2019s Screensaver is Zayn\u2019s Face Because Love Is Real", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1441612602832494&ev=PageView&noscript=1",
