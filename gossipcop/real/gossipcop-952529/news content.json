London\u2019s Metropolitan Police Service told Us Weekly that the death was not being treated as suspicious.\n\nNeilson worked as a model for years and was close friends with fashion designer Alexander McQueen, who died by suicide at age 40 in February 2015. She joined the Bravo reality series in 2014 but announced her exit the following year after two seasons. In more recent years, she worked as a children\u2019s author, writing a series of books titled The Me Me Me\u2019s, which were inspired by her struggles with dyslexia.\n\nThe reality star, who was raised in a wealthy British aristocratic family, had spoken candidly through the years about her past. She battled drug addiction and mental health issues after being assaulted at age 16 during a trip to Perth, Australia.\n\n\u201cI fell into a serious depression and became a heroin addict because it provided an escape bubble and was the only way I could cope,\u201d she told the Daily Mail in December 2015. \u201cIn a way, heroin saved me, because otherwise I would have killed myself.\u201d\n\nNeilson was married to banker Nathaniel Rothschild from 1994 to 1997.\n\nShe is survived by her parents, Max and Elizabeth, and her sister, Millie.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Annabelle-Neilson2.jpg?crop=268px%2C64px%2C1652px%2C868px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Annabelle-Neilson2.jpg?crop=268px%2C64px%2C1652px%2C868px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman", "Us Weekly Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ladies-of-london-star-annabelle-neilsons-cause-of-death-revealed/", "title": "\u2018Ladies of London\u2019 Star Annabelle Neilson\u2019s Cause of Death Revealed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "\u2018Ladies of London\u2019 star Annabelle Neilson\u2019s cause of death was revealed by the Westminster Coroner\u2019s Court on Tuesday, July 17 \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Ladies of London\u2019 Star Annabelle Neilson\u2019s Cause of Death Revealed", "description": "\u2018Ladies of London\u2019 star Annabelle Neilson\u2019s cause of death was revealed by the Westminster Coroner\u2019s Court on Tuesday, July 17 \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ladies-of-london-star-annabelle-neilsons-cause-of-death-revealed/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-07-18T13:49:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Annabelle-Neilson2.jpg?crop=268px%2C64px%2C1652px%2C868px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Annabelle-Neilson2.jpg?crop=268px%2C64px%2C1652px%2C868px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-17T14:56:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-18T13:49:41+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Ladies of London\u2019 Star Annabelle Neilson\u2019s Cause of Death Revealed", "description": "\u2018Ladies of London\u2019 star Annabelle Neilson\u2019s cause of death was revealed by the Westminster Coroner\u2019s Court on Tuesday, July 17 \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Annabelle-Neilson2.jpg?crop=268px%2C64px%2C1652px%2C868px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=74&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531839404.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
