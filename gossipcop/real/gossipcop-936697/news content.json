When we meet her, this other version of Regina, she\u2019s working in a bar. She\u2019s a little rough around the edges.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Once Upon a Time': Creators Defend Cast Shakeup Amidst Fan Outcry\n\nParilla acknowledged that other returning characters will emphasize unfamiliar aspects of their personalities in the new season, but that this will be especially true for the Evil Queen: \u201cShe looks very different \u2014 she feels different.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s no longer in charge,\u201d Parrilla continued. \u201cThis version of Regina is something else. I\u2019m still discovering her. I think we\u2019re all still discovering who she is \u2014 it\u2019s refreshing.\u201d\n\nWhen a journalist wanted to know the name that the other characters will now call Regina, Parilla replied cagily, \u201cI can\u2019t tell you \u2014 you\u2019ll have to tune in.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Marvel's Inhumans' Is 'Still a Work in Progress' Amid Trailer Backlash, ABC Says\n\nThis led series co-creator Edward Kitsis to quip, \u201c\u2018The Queen Formally Known as Regina\u2019 will also work.\u201d\n\nNew cast member Andrew J. West, who plays the adult version of Henry Mills, said that viewers will see Regina and Henry \u201cinteract in a way that you\u2019ve never seen them.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, \u201cOnce\u201d co-creator Adam Horowitz pointed out that the pair\u2019s \u201crelationship is central to the show, and remains so.\u201d\n\nABC announced in May that Season 7, which launches Oct. 6, will be without such core cast members as Ginnifer Goodwin (Snow), Josh Dallas (Charming) and Jennifer Morrison (Emma).", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png",
