Gimple over how his son\u2019s exit was handled.\n\n\u201cWatching Gimple fire my son 2 weeks before his 18th birthday after telling him they wanted him for the next 3 years was disappointing,\u201d Riggs\u2019 father wrote on Facebook following the AMC zombie drama\u2019s midseason finale, in which Carl was revealed to be suffering from a fatal zombie bite. \u201cI never trusted Gimple or AMC, but Chandler did. I know how much it hurt him. But we do absolutely know how lucky we have been to be a part of it all and appreciate all the love from fans all these years!\u201d\n\nSpeaking with The Hollywood Reporter, Riggs stated the decision to leave The Walking Dead was not his own, despite speculation that he was eyeing an exit in order to focus on college.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m taking a gap year right now to focus on acting for a while. Leaving Walking Dead wasn\u2019t my decision,\u201d Riggs told THR. \u201cI was planning on going to college until I found out. I found out when I was doing rehearsals for episode six back in June. It was quite the shocker for me, Andy and everyone because I don\u2019t think anyone saw it coming. It\u2019s definitely not a bad thing because it has been awesome being on the show but now I get to go and do a lot of other stuff that I haven\u2019t gotten to do before. Scott wanted to meet in person because it was such a big deal. We had just finished rehearsing for a scene in episode six and he wanted to meet with me and my mom and dad and talk about what\u2019s going to happen.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat is a bite on his side. \u2026 It will play out as bites play out on the show,\u201d Gimple said Sunday on AMC\u2019s post-show Talking Dead, speaking about the character\u2019s exit. \u201cIt\u2019s very important to Carl\u2019s story and the entire story, what happens in the next episode. I\u2019m just focused on the fact that Carl right now is alive and he has some business to attend to. That is a one-way ticket. But I\u2019d like to think that the things we see in the next episode are so important to his life and the other characters\u2019 lives.\u201d\n\nRiggs\u2019 impending exit from The Walking Dead is a shock for a number of reasons, including the fact that he is one of only five castmembers from the original season who still appear on the show. One of the others, Lennie James (Morgan), will depart The Walking Dead this season as well, joining the cast of Fear the Walking Dead for its fourth season.\n\nWhat\u2019s more, Carl remains an active presence in the Walking Dead comic books from Robert Kirkman and Charlie Adlard, on which the show is based. Many fans believed Carl would one day assume the lead role in the series, including Andrew Lincoln, who plays Rick Grimes, and has subsequently described Carl\u2019s demise as \u201cthe biggest death\u201d of the entire series.\n\n\u201cMy first reaction was silence,\u201d Lincoln told THR about his first reaction to learning of Carl\u2019s death. \u201cScott Gimple called me up and said, \u2018You\u2019re going to hate this one.\u2019 He\u2019s very good about alerting the cast when there\u2019s going to be a [character] death. I tried guessing four times and was nowhere near Chandler Riggs\u2019 name. Scott had to say that it was Carl. I just didn\u2019t speak for a minute. I always thought Carl was going to be the one who led the show forward; that Rick would hand over his boots and revolver when he walked off into the sunset in season 28.\u201d\n\nIn the comics, Carl plays a central role in one of the story\u2019s most recent arcs, \u201cThe Whisperer War,\u201d as his relationship with an outsider named Lydia causes a conflict between the Alexandrians and a group of survivors called the Whisperers, who walk among the walkers using flesh suits as camouflage.\n\n\u201cI was excited to do a lot of those storylines in the comics because there\u2019s a lot of really cool stuff,\u201d Riggs told THR. \u201cI\u2019m more excited to do other things than The Walking Dead than I was excited about doing those things on Walking Dead.\u201d\n\nAMC did not immediately respond to a request for comment on the matter.\n\nFollow THR.com/WalkingDead for full coverage of the AMC zombie series, including our exclusive interview with Chandler Riggs and our conversation with series lead Andrew Lincoln.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the_walking_dead_s08e08_still_1.jpg?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/upload_copy-embed.jpg?w=928", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the_walking_dead_s08e08_still_1.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the_walking_dead_s08e08_still_1.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Josh Wigler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/walking-dead-stars-father-reacts-show-exit-1066234/", "title": "\u2018Walking Dead\u2019 Star\u2019s Father Rips Showrunner for \u201cFiring\u201d Son", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Spoiler alert!", "news_keywords": "The Walking Dead", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Josh Wigler", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1066234, "title": "'Walking Dead' Star's Father Rips Showrunner for \"Firing\" Son", "published_at": "2017-12-11 08:44:32", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/the_walking_dead_s08e08_still_1.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The Walking Dead", "topics": "TV News", "body": "[Warning: This story contains major spoilers from episode 808, \"How It's Gotta Be,\" of AMC's The Walking Dead, as well as the comic book series on which the show is based.]\r\nGiven the magnitude of the twist, it's no surprise that many Walking Dead fans are upset about the looming departure of Carl Grimes, the young survivor played since season one by Chandler Riggs \u2014 and that list includes Riggs' own father, who took to social media to express his disappointment in Walking Dead showrunner Scott M.
