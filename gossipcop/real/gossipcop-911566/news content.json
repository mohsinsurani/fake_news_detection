Pink sucks and if you like her singing you\u2019re dumb #SuperBowl.\u201d Pink clapped back.\n\nIf I\u2019ve said it once, I\u2019ve said it 1000 times.

And here we are.\u201d\n\nBut the singer powered through, even spitting out a throat lozenge right before performing (a moment that of course social media users caught though they initially thought it was gum).\n\nPink shared her thanks with fans on Twitter.\n\nAll of your prayers and well wishes and candles got me through today. Thankyou so much for all the love and support.
