His first two official albums generated nearly 5.5 billion streams, according to Nielsen Music, and he had more than eight million Instagram followers hanging on to every word of his posts and stories, which like his music, were emotional missives that addressed depression and anger. He was just 20 when he died.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/arts/06xxxalbum1/06xxxalbum1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=54c996b5dc17e7d3dfdacb7467dc6af7f7fef23753249da55bc644edb53c1c1c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/arts/06xxxalbum1/merlin_147535275_3721f513-973a-4bda-8a3e-a46ca284d0a5-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/arts/06xxxalbum1/06xxxalbum1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=54c996b5dc17e7d3dfdacb7467dc6af7f7fef23753249da55bc644edb53c1c1c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Steve Knopper"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/arts/music/xxxtentacion-skins.html", "title": "As XXXTentacion\u2019s Posthumous Album Arrives, a Battle Over His Legacy Rages On", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The 20-year-old singer and rapper, who was killed in June while facing charges that he abused a woman, left behind superfans and vocal critics.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/05/arts/music/xxxtentacion-skins.html", "type": "article", "title": "As XXXTentacion\u2019s Posthumous Album Arrives, a Battle Over His Legacy Rages On (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/12/06/arts/06xxxalbum1/06xxxalbum1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=54c996b5dc17e7d3dfdacb7467dc6af7f7fef23753249da55bc644edb53c1c1c&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "XXXTentacion&rsquo;s meteoric career was mired in controversy.
