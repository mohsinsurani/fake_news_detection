Okay, so if you didn\u2019t get a Grammy, you get a puppy!\u201d\n\nAfter Corden made his announcement, handlers delivered puppies to the likes of Jerry Seinfeld and Sarah Silverman, much to the delight of the nominees and the audience.\n\nUnfortunately, it looks like not everyone who lost in their category got a puppy hand-delivered to them, as Kelly Clarkson took to her Twitter to lament not receiving a puppy.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/screen-shot-2018-01-26-at-11-27-28-am.png?w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/grammys-2018-james-corden-consolation-puppies.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/defining-works-black-renaissance-01b.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/grammys-2018-james-corden-consolation-puppies.jpg?quality=85&w=2000"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/grammys-2018-james-corden-consolation-puppies.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5122999/grammys-2018-consolation-puppies/", "title": "Grammys 2018: Losers Get Get Consolation Puppies", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Losers didn't go home empty-handed after the 2018 Grammy Awards, thanks to host James Corden who gifted losers with \"consolation puppies.\"", "og": {"title": "Celebrities Who Lost at the Grammys Got Consolation Puppies", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5122999/grammys-2018-consolation-puppies/", "description": "\"Nobody goes home empty handed!\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/grammys-2018-james-corden-consolation-puppies.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5122999/grammys-2018-consolation-puppies/", "description": "Losers didn't go home empty-handed after the 2018 Grammy Awards, thanks to host James Corden who gifted losers with \"consolation puppies.\"", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/grammys-2018-james-corden-consolation-puppies.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5122999/grammys-2018-consolation-puppies/", "title": "Celebrities Who Lost at the Grammys Got Consolation Puppies", "description": "\"Nobody goes home empty handed!\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/grammys-2018-james-corden-consolation-puppies.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
