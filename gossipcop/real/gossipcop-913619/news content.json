At the Coach show (she\u2019s an ambassador for the brand), the actress and singer sported a set of long, wispy, Brigitte Bardot-inspired bangs and what looks like some extensions to lengthen her ends. She teamed her new hair with a floral handkerchief hem dress, leather jacket and lace-up boots from the label.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty\n\nAlthough Gomez has been spotted out in L.A. since news broke that she\u2019d be seeking treatment for her ongoing battle with anxiety and depression, this is the 25-year-old\u2019s first time attending an event.\n\nLooking for more style content?
