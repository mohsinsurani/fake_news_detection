The Google Doodle came to fruition two years ago after a Latina lead on the Google marketing team, pitched it and it got approved.\n\n\u201cI felt like Selena deserved something very cool and thought we could go really big on this one,\u201d said Perla Campos, Global Marketing Lead for Google Doodles and project manager for the Selena Quintanilla Google Doodle. \u201cFrom that moment on, I contacted the family and they have been very close and positive partners to make every part of the project possible. Their partnership was so important here to make sure we did it right.\u201d\n\nCampos was raised in a small Texas town, similar to Selena who was born in Lake Jackson, Texas and spent part of her youth there and in Corpus Christi, Texas.\n\nAlthough it's been 22 years since Selena was shot and killed by the founder of her fan club, Campos said Selena is a \u201ctimeless\u201d icon.\n\nSelena Google Doodle Google\n\nRELATED: Smithsonian Uncovers Rare Video of Selena After 20 Years of Obscurity\n\n\u201cHer legacy has only grown with time and shows no signs of stopping. She represents all that is positive about Latino culture and I have no doubt she\u2019ll continue to be an inspiration for generations to come,\u201d Campos said.\n\nShe added that Selena proudly showcased her bicultural identity and has served as an inspiration to many Latinas, including Campos.\n\n\u201cShe proves that with hard work, anything is possible,\u201d Campos said. \u201cHer devotion to her passion, to her family and to living life to the fullest inspired me personally to go after my dreams and never stop believing in myself.\u201d\n\nIn this Nov. 14, 1994 file photo Selena Quintanilla-Perez performs during a concert at the Cunningham Elementary School in Corpus Christi, Texas.

According to her Selena's husband, Chris Perez, Selena was a third-generation Texan.\n\nIn 1993, Quintanilla won a Grammy for best Mexican-American album of the year and topped the Billboard charts for weeks on end. The \u201cSelena\u201d album would be just one of several albums she would release until her untimely death on March 31, 1995.\n\nFollow NBC Latino on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_42/2192556/selena.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_42/2192556/selena.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2016_26/951591/150327-selena-singing-mic-338p.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_30/2085121/marissaarmas.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_42/2192556/selena.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms Marissaarmas.Jpg", "Marissa Armas", "Marissa Armas Is An Associate Producer", "Multimedia Journalist For Nbc Latino.
