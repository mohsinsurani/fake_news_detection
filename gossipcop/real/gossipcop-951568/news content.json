I mean, aside from being phenomenal as Cheryl Blossom in Riverdale, Petsch is also a makeup and skin addict, talking quite candidly about her beauty routine in interviews. The most recent product favorite of Petsch\u2019s? A $14 eyebrow gel. Yes, that's finally something you can afford.\n\nThe Details\n\nIn a video posted to her YouTube channel, Petsch broke down her summer beauty look with a makeup tutorial, showing fans exactly how she conceals her skin (with Tarte Shape Tape (opens in new tab), of course), contours her eyes (with Wander Beauty Catch the Light Highlighter (opens in new tab)), and, of course, fills in her signature thick brows. Her favorite product? Pacifica Stunning Brows Eyebrow Gloss in Golden Brown (opens in new tab).\n\n\"It's a really nice, cruelty-free brand,\u201d says Petsch in the video, before applying the gel. \u201cI kinda just lightly brush the hairs up for a nice full brow that I don't have naturally.\" And unlike brow gels that tend to be gloopy or thick (you know\u2014the ones that leave marks on your brow bones), Pacifica\u2019s formula is lightweight and relatively sheer, using sunflower seed oil to smooth hair and add shine, along with a sheer does of golden-brown pigments for color.\n\n(Image credit: Courtesy of Brand)\n\nBasically, if you\u2019re looking for a subtle wash of color across your brows, this formula is an excellent pick. Still, because it doesn\u2019t contain any thickening fibers (like many brow gels do (opens in new tab)), I\u2019d recommend filling in your brows with a pencil or powder, first, to define the shape and add some bulk.\n\nWatch the rest of Petsch\u2019s tutorial, below, and then recreate the look on yourself! I can\u2019t promise you\u2019ll look like a Riverdale star by the time you\u2019re done, but, hey, it can\u2019t hurt to try.", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/m6cBFQ8LNNR6r3QZdkmunP-415-80.jpg", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/marieclaireus/missing-image.svg", "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzmrwEjKFznUhCK2HpFdoK-1200-80.jpg", "https://www.marieclaire.com/media/img/missing-image.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzmrwEjKFznUhCK2HpFdoK-1200-80.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chloe Metzger", "Beauty Editor", "Brooke Knappenberger", "Jenny Hollander", "Samantha Holender", "Gabrielle Ulubay", "Julia Marzovilla", "Window.Slicecomponents", "Window.Reliabledomcontentloaded.Then", "Var Componentcontainer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22170080/madelaine-petsch-pacifica-eyebrow-gel/", "title": "Madelaine Petsch Uses $14 Pacifica Eyebrow Gel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "pub_date": "2018-07-17T07:42:57+00:00", "description": "In a Youtube video posted to her channel, the Riverdale actress breaks down her entire beauty routine, including the foundation she uses, her favorite blush and eyeshadow, and, of course, her go-to ey", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/l0uowirhzd1627591128.svg", "og": {"site_name": "Marie Claire Magazine", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzmrwEjKFznUhCK2HpFdoK-1200-80.jpg", "width": 1200}, "type": "article", "title": "Madelaine Petsch Uses This $14 Eyebrow Gel and I Need It ASAP", "url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22170080/madelaine-petsch-pacifica-eyebrow-gel/", "description": "Brb\u2014stocking up immediately."}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/MarieClaire", "published_time": "2018-07-17T07:42:57Z", "modified_time": "2018-07-17T07:42:57.035Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-post-id": "L772DK4V9P7oUhAaekPBb5", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-07-17T07:42:57Z", "parsely-title": "Madelaine Petsch Uses This $14 Eyebrow Gel", "parsely-link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22170080/madelaine-petsch-pacifica-eyebrow-gel/", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzmrwEjKFznUhCK2HpFdoK.jpg", "parsely-section": "Makeup", "parsely-tags": "Category: Makeup,Category: Beauty,Category: News,Cosmetics,beauty,collection_trending-beauty,standard-article,collection_beauty-products-to-never-be-without,van-block-taboola,serversidehawk", "parsely-author": "Chloe Metzger", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@marieclaireus", "title": "Madelaine Petsch Uses This $14 Eyebrow Gel and I Need It ASAP", "description": "Brb\u2014stocking up immediately.", "creator": "@marieclaireus", "image": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/pzmrwEjKFznUhCK2HpFdoK-1200-80.jpg", "account_id": 15469402}, "google-site-verification": "G8uYPAX70T_vfdmDhxnUNSykxtjRTkSvHhloGBWT6R8", "taboola": {"url": "https://www.marieclaire.com/beauty/a22170080/madelaine-petsch-pacifica-eyebrow-gel/"}, "botify-site-verification": "gEo2ltw4ZxjJkBcaADHlIGePpMrucY2w", "msvalidate.01": "CC462E6DF91492086145CA5EBDCB615E"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531813377.0, "source": "https://www.marieclaire.com", "summary": ""}
