Many musicians decided to wear a white rose to make a stand for equal representation between sexes and for workplaces to be free of sexual harassment. Little Big Town said it was a personal choice for them, telling E! News' Giuliana Rancic that they were donning the roses for their children.\n\n\"We have children at home and we want to raise them to know that they can always speak out and take care of themselves and stick up for themselves,\" Kimberly Schlapman explains in the above clip. \"It's so important.\"\n\nBandmate Jimi Westbrook expressed that everyone in the music community and beyond should have love and respect for their colleagues regardless of one's gender. \"We've been together for a long time and that's what our relationship is based on,\" Westbrook adds. \"Men and women: equal and respect. That's the main thing. We have to respect and love each other. That's what being a human being is about.\"\n\nLittle Big Town won big during Sunday's Grammy Awards. The country quartet took home the Grammy for Best Country Duo/Group Performance for the Taylor Swift-penned song \"Better Man\" and learned the exciting news moments before being interviewed by E!\n\n\"It means everything. I don't want to put too much on awards, but it really means a lot when your peers and the community recognizes your music,\" Phillip Sweet said upon learning about their honor. \"We're so happy and thankful for Taylor Swift for sending us the song 'Better Man.' It's amazing.\"\n\n5 Best Moments of the 2018 Grammys", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Little-Big-Town-2018-Grammy-Awards.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/04/toc-logo-high-rez.png"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Little-Big-Town-2018-Grammy-Awards.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Annie Reuter"], "canonical_link": "https://tasteofcountry.com/little-big-town-2018-grammys-white-roses/", "title": "Why Little Big Town Wore White Roses to the Grammys", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "tasteofcountry", "description": "Each of the group's four members wore or held a white rose while walking the 2018 Grammy Awards red carpet.", "keywords": "little big town, little big town 2018 grammy awards, little big town white roses, little big town time's up, little big town equality,country music news,country music videos", "fb": {"app_id": 193351250697247, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 173910492638623}, "og": {"title": "Why Little Big Town Wore White Roses to the Grammys", "description": "Each of the group's four members wore or held a white rose while walking the 2018 Grammy Awards red carpet.", "url": "https://tasteofcountry.com/little-big-town-2018-grammys-white-roses/", "site_name": "Taste of Country", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Little-Big-Town-2018-Grammy-Awards.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@tasteofcountry"}, "sailthru.description": "Each of the group's four members wore or held a white rose while walking the 2018 Grammy Awards red carpet.", "sailthru.date": "2018-01-29 12:22:25", "sailthru.title": "Little Big Town Wore White Roses to the Grammys Because \u2018We Have Children\u2019", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-tasteofcountry, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, little-big-town, country-music-news, country-music-videos", "sailthru.author": "anniereuter", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Little-Big-Town-2018-Grammy-Awards.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/204/files/2018/01/Little-Big-Town-2018-Grammy-Awards.jpg", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "google-site-verification": "t80x4wa4iiZCfkwdxI-VdjMVAdsYFH5dLyW0f7yCBpk", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517228545.0, "source": "http://tasteofcountry.com", "summary": ""}
