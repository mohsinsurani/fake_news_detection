It\u2019s a common problem. Luckily, Kim Kardashian\u2019s go-to makeup artist of 10 years, Mario Dedivanovic, has a solution.\n\n\u201cOne of the biggest mistakes I see is choosing the wrong shade of concealer,\u201d he says. \u201cIf the concealer is too light, it can end up looking gray or chalky, drawing more attention to fine lines and wrinkles.\u201d Dedivanovic says that a hydrating formula with buildable, medium-to-full coverage like Laura Mercier Flawless Fusion Ultra-Longwear Concealer is less likely to get cakey and emphasize what you\u2019re trying to conceal.\n\n\u201cTry to avoid dry concealers, as they tend to stick and are not as easily blendable or flexible. Rather, look for a weightless concealer with both coverage and moisture,\u201d he adds.\n\nWhen covering fine lines and wrinkles, start with a tiny amount of concealer so it won\u2019t look heavy. Apply it in thin layers and make sure to blend well. As for the age-old question of whether you should apply the product before or after foundation, Dedivanovic recommends concealer as the step in your makeup routine immediately following foundation. \u201cApply concealer after foundation and blend into the foundation seamlessly,\u201d he says. Use a fluffy brush like Surratt Beauty Artistique Face Brush to set it in place with translucent powder. Dedivanovic likes Laura Mercier\u2019s Translucent Loose Powder.\n\n(Your browser doesn\u2019t support iframe)\n\nThe eye area tends to be more delicate and sensitive than the rest of your face, so Dedivanovic recommends a gentler approach when using concealer on this spot. \u201cThe skin around the eye is very thin and delicate, so any application should be done lightly,\u201d he explains. \u201cI like to first apply a layer of emollient moisturizer or an eye cream, such as Kiehl\u2019s Creamy Eye Treatment with Avocado, then gently blend the concealer to keep it from settling.\u201d\n\nJust as you did with the rest of your face, he says, set it with powder. \u201cDip a damp sponge or fluffy brush into loose powder, and lightly dab over the concealer,\u201d says Dedivanovic.\n\nFor extra insurance, he suggests setting the entire face with a glow-boosting, hydrating mist like Tatcha\u2019s cult favorite, Luminous Dewy Skin Mist.\n\nThis article was written by Erin Lukas from InStyle and was legally licensed through the NewsCred publisher network.
