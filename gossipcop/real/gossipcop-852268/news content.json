He was there again to help co-write her bad girl turn on Reputation in 2017. As a producer, he\u2019s worked with St. Vincent\u2019s Annie Clark on the minimalist piano pop for her 2017 record Masseduction, with Lorde on her larger-than-life album Melodrama, and is partly responsible for Sara Bareilles\u2019s commercial-perfect earworm \u201cBrave.\u201d He\u2019s reportedly working with Carly Rae Jepsen (again), the Dixie Chicks, and now Lana Del Rey.\n\n\n\nAntonoff rose to fame as a member of the largely forgotten band Fun., whose biggest hit was 2011's \u201cWe Are Young,\u201d but now he\u2019s often positioned as the reason why the music of many women artists is so great. He\u2019s been dubbed your favorite pop star\u2019s \u201csecret weapon\u201d by Pitchfork, and a \u201cmillennial pop svengali\u201d by Vanity Fair. His rise is especially inspiring, GQ once suggested, because he doesn\u2019t physically and sonically resemble typical pop producers. \u201cThe very nature of pop music has changed: people who look and think and sound like Jack Antonoff are allowed to participate in its making at the very highest levels,\u201d a profile from earlier this year read, which seemed to imply that Antonoff\u2019s geeky style and indie sincerity was in direct opposition to slicker pop makers who came up through the industry solely as writers and producers.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDespite his rising prominence, though, there\u2019s something admittedly irritating about his ubiquity. It\u2019s enough to warrant articles like this Noisey post: \u201cJACK ANTONOFF YOU STAY AWAY FROM THE DIXIE CHICKS,\u201d in which the entire body is \u201cno no no no nope.\u201d Because while Antonoff might be highly favored among artists we love, promoted (often via music critics) as a fresh new pop-maker and ally with a unique respect for women, he inevitably winds up consuming a lot of their spotlight. In late October, he appeared alongside Lana De l Rey for her performance of \u201cHow to Disappear\u201d at an Apple event in Brooklyn. After GQ interviewed him, their profile included the line, \u201cHe\u2019s still writing Jack Antonoff songs\u2014they just happen to be sung by people like Lorde now.\u201d Lorde took issue with the characterization: \u201cKnew there was a way to describe the personal and skillful work that I do turns out it\u2019s \u2018singing jack antonoff songs\u2019\u201d she wrote in a now-deleted tweet.\n\nThe history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure.\n\nThat\u2019s traditionally how it\u2019s worked. The history of pop music made by women but produced by men is often one of erasure. Women may be the stars of their music, their names alone listed on their songs, but the men who write, produce, or mix for them, even as a collaboration, are seen as the puppeteers who guide them (and, in the worst cases, svengalis); Phil Spector to The Ronettes, Max Martin to Britney Spears, Timbaland to Aaliyah, Dr. Luke to Kesha.\n\nThere\u2019s the long baked-in assumption, particularly in pop, that women are not responsible for their hits and have a team of pop songwriters behind them. Women artists, from Taylor Swift to Bj\u00f6rk to Missy Elliott, have had to fight for their role in their own music-making, as listeners and critics choose to attribute the bulk of the creative process to the men in the room. \u201cHow can one be a \u2018vocal muse\u2019 to their own melodies, story telling and words they wrote?\u201d Solange wrote in response to a 2013 review of her album True, co-produced and co-written largely by Dev Hynes, which likened Solange to a muse for Hynes (Solange is credited as a writer and producer on every track). And while Antonoff is far from the most egregious offender, he is still a male producer working primarily with women artists, and it\u2019s his touch as a producer that inevitably blankets the work of the women he works with.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLorde \u201cGreen Light\u201d music video\n\nA fair share of Antonoff\u2019s productions are great. Taylor Swift\u2019s \u201cI Wish You Would\u201d is supremely underrated, Fifth Harmony\u2019s \u201cDope\u201d should have been on the album rather than a B-side, and I still get excited when I hear \u201cGreen Light\u201d out in public. But I\u2019d argue that the unchanged nature of his production style leaves a lot of his music stuck, dated, in the glittering \u201980s nostalgia-wave of pop music several years ago. He tends, as well, to have a squeaky clean, piano-ballad approach, like he\u2019s willingly applying motion-smoothing technology to artists who might not need it. When Melodrama was set to come out, I steeled myself for a record built in the shadow of 1989, an erasure of Lorde, and was pleasantly surprised to find I could still hear her.\n\n\n\nI steeled myself for Lorde\u2019s erasure not because I thought she could easily disappear, but because it\u2019s happened so many times before with women artists. Antonoff has largely been pitched to the masses as a producer who cuts through that stereotype. He\u2019s a pop music \u201cNice Guy\u201d (someone your mother would love, New York Magazine once pointed out) in an industry just barely beginning to reckon publicly with how much misogyny is embedded into pop music-making. It\u2019s hard not to connect the recent infatuation with Antonoff\u2019s celebrity with Dr. Luke\u2019s fall and see him as a shred of male decency in a dark industry. More than being a nice guy, he\u2019s made it clear that he cares about women\u2019s artistry. \u201cI always want to hear women sing my songs. I just want to be around women,\u201d Antonoff told Pitchfork. \u201cIt\u2019s not a sex thing\u2014I\u2019m heterosexual, but it\u2019s not coming from any place like that. It\u2019s just a comfort thing.\u201d\n\nLast year, he told The Guardian, \u201cIn no way do I feel like a woman. I feel very male. But when I\u2019m writing I don\u2019t think about Lou Reed or Bowie. I think about Kate Bush, Bj\u00f6rk, Fiona Apple. I\u2019ve always been extremely drawn to female artists who are being brutally honest. That is so much more attractive to me than a lot of the weird paths certain male songwriters lead you down, that hide and mask emotions.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIn an interview with the New York Times promoting Melodrama, Lorde told the reporter that when she played \u201cGreen Light\u201d to producer Max Martin, who has an almost Renaissance-flare for technical perfection, Martin told her it was \u201cincorrect songwriting.\u201d Not an insult exactly for Lorde, but one that only underscored how much she perceived Antonoff as a looser musical partner who wasn\u2019t like the other guys.\n\nOr is he really not like the others? As much as I feel constantly pitched on the idea that Antonoff isn\u2019t a typical pop producer, the way music media treats him feels like just another fetishization of the old-school producer dynamic. You couldn\u2019t confidently write off Melodrama as a collection of Antonoff songs, just as you can\u2019t write off his collaborations with Lana Del Rey, St. Vincent, or other artists as women simply singing \u201chis songs\u201d\u2014but it\u2019s these kinds of assumptions that happen when a male producer chooses to be a celebrity. And when you consider the fact that successful women in this industry still struggle to establish their genius in the same ways men do (because, frankly, they\u2019re quickly rewarded the distinction in spades), you wonder if Antonoff\u2019s collaborators would benefit from him taking a bigger, less vocal step back.\n\nNo matter how nice he is, or respectful, or a good #ally\u2014and as much as he may be unaware\u2014Antonoff is assuming a historically authoritative position in pop music. Even if Antonoff is an unwitting participant, he exists in a system that will always inherently award him the position of being a pop mastermind when it comes to the collaborations he creates with women, who are ultimately the authors of their work but often treated as subjects. And the giddiness with which Antonoff speaks of his collaborations with Taylor Swift or Lorde or St. Vincent to a fawning press might come with the best of intentions, but his female collaborators ultimately have to work overtime to claim authorship.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/kqnkjlylkf7tymsqmoqr.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/52a29fe0001de9a08e76ea6d559528e9.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/u0939doeuioaqhspkjyc.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/j59upeyynundqjvbmcwj.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/v4sckews2f3bzf0ztbkf.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/aqhdzcldymb9mkltfhxh.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/rnxqtvv6advgidzfs6am.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f2b6295902a8e0a7c4d168840e7b3d51.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/eti2h1r4wg0bqxctxenl.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/muaaluj2wznfomol9ero.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://jezebel.com/jack-antonoff-and-the-unrelenting-shadow-of-the-male-pr-1829446847", "title": "Jack Antonoff and the Unrelenting Shadow of the Male Producer", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/muaaluj2wznfomol9ero.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/muaaluj2wznfomol9ero.png", "keywords": "Pop music, jack antonoff, producers, music, Lorde, Lana Del Rey, Carly Rae Jepsen, Jezebel", "news_keywords": "Pop music, jack antonoff, producers, music, Lorde, Lana Del Rey, Carly Rae Jepsen, Jezebel", "twitter": {"url": "https://jezebel.com/jack-antonoff-and-the-unrelenting-shadow-of-the-male-pr-1829446847", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "jezebel", "title": "Jack Antonoff and the Unrelenting Shadow of the Male Producer", "description": "When Taylor Swift transformed into a reigning pop princess on 2014's 1989, Jack Antonoff was there.
