Their relationship had been hanging by a thread for months before the staged photo scandals.\n\nThe surgery is the latest twist surrounding Mr Markle's attendance at Meghan's wedding\n\nMr Markle revealed he believes his heart attack was triggered by an open letter his son, Thomas Jr (pictured), wrote to Prince Harry trying to convince him not to marry Meghan\n\n'He had told friends that he wanted to come with the peace gesture for an appeasement before the wedding and his daughter's big day, but his recent actions have crushed that.'\n\nThe revelation over surgery was the latest twist on a rollercoaster of speculation surrounding whether Mr Markle would attend Saturday's royal wedding at Windsor Castle in Berkshire.\n\nIt came just hours after Meghan seemed to have convinced her father to change his mind and walk her down the aisle.\n\nHe pulled out on Monday, saying he didn't want to further embarrass his daughter after The Mail On Sunday revealed he had staged paparazzi photos for money.\n\nBut yesterday it seemed he had backtracked on his decision after the bride-to-be pleaded with him to come to England for the big day in Berkshire.\n\nHe told TMZ that Meghan tried calling him on Monday, but he wasn't near his phone. She later sent a text saying she loved him and was concerned about his health.\n\nMeghan, pictured with Harry on April 25, pleaded with her father to walk her down the aisle\n\nMr Markle has said he believed his ex-wife Doria Ragland would be a 'good choice' to give their daughter away at St George's Chapel, Windsor. Pictured: Doria with Meghan in March 2015\n\n'I hate the idea of missing one of the greatest moments in history and walking my daughter down the aisle,' Mr Markle said yesterday. 'Of course I'd walk her down the aisle. This is a historic moment. I'd like to be a part of history.'\n\nMr Markle, who had a heart attack a week ago, returned to the hospital yesterday after having chest pains. He said a series of tests found that the heart attack had done 'significant damage' and revealed he needed immediate surgery.\n\nMr Markle also blamed his recent health troubles on his son Thomas, who told Harry that marrying Meghan would be the 'biggest mistake in royal wedding history'.\n\n'It's not too late, Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you,' Thomas's letter, shared with InTouch, reads. 'I'm confused why you don't see the real Meghan that the whole world now sees.'\n\nThomas went on to call his half-sister a 'jaded, shallow, conceited woman, that will make a fool of you and the royal family heritage'.\n\nJust a week later, in another open letter, Thomas apologised for his words and begged Meghan to invite him to her wedding.\n\nQueen Elizabeth II talks with Major Peter Norton GC at a reception for the living recipients of the Victoria and George Cross medals, at Buckingham Palace in London today\n\nMr Markle said that he did not want to embarrass his daughter (pictured together, circa 2000)\n\nAsked what the Queen (pictured yesterday at Buckingham Palace) thought about his money grab, Mr Markle laughed and said: 'I don't think the Queen is thinking about what I'm doing'\n\nBut when it came to her father, Mr Markle revealed that Meghan held no hard feelings against him for setting up paparazzi photos for money.\n\nWhen asked what the Queen thought about his money grab, Mr Markle laughed and said: 'I don't think the Queen is thinking about what I'm doing.'\n\nWho will give Meghan away if her father isn't cleared by doctors?

It is thought she will ride with Meghan in the car to the chapel to Windsor Castle.\n\nShe is also expected to meet the Queen, Prince Philip, Prince Charles and Camilla and Prince William and his wife, Kate, before the big day.\n\nThe 73-year-old said Meghan tried calling him on Monday, but he wasn't near his phone. She later sent a text saying she loved him and was concerned about his health.

Queen Victoria gave away her youngest child Princess Beatrice at St Mildred's Church, Whippingham on the Isle of Wight in 1885. She wore black to remember her husband Prince Albert who had died 24 years earlier, although her outfit is believed to have been encrusted with diamonds. Royal historian Victoria Howard told the BBC: 'I think it would be a lovely touch for Meghan's mother Doria to walk her down the aisle. 'It would be unusual but it wouldn't be an unprecedented move. Queen Victoria walked two of her daughters down the aisle'. Advertisement\n\nThe friend said: 'This is not what she wants. She obviously wants her dad there. And the idea of contemplating him not being there now is not something that she wants to have to do.\n\n'She and Prince Harry are begging for people to give him some space. They have been saying this for weeks, while trying to offer him support and help.\n\n'He is clearly feeling under immense pressure. The concern for him is real and genuine. He is a proud man who wants to be a father and not be taken care of, but it's quite difficult.\n\n'Everyone needs to pause and think what this is doing to them and, more importantly, to him. It is a really worrying, scary situation. The couple have been doing everything they can to help him.'\n\nHarry, 33, is said to be distraught and could try to get Mr Markle to change his mind.\n\nThe friend said: 'Harry feels guilty that this has happened to someone he loves because they are in a relationship with him.\n\n'He is devastated. He feels like this is another thing in the wake of him... the problems he causes. He feels that anyone who gets associated with his life \u2013 this is the price they have to pay.\n\n'He wants to protect her and this is really difficult for him to swallow.'\n\nMeghan will now be accompanied by only mother at the wedding (Doria Ragland with Prince Harry and Meghan in September)\n\nThe couple issued an unprecedented official statement through Kensington Palace in the wake of the crisis.\n\nA spokesman said: 'This is a deeply personal moment for Ms Markle in the days before her wedding. She and Prince Harry ask again for understanding and respect to be extended to Mr Markle in this difficult situation.'\n\nUS gossip website TMZ claimed to have spoken 'on the record' to Miss Markle's father, who confirmed he had worked with the freelance photographer to set up images of him being measured for his wedding suit and searching online for articles about his daughter.\n\nHe said he did it to 'rehabilitate' his image but had been left looking 'stupid and hammy' \u2013 and would not be travelling to the UK to give her away in order to spare her further embarrassment.\n\nKensington Palace was clearly broadsided by the claims as aides had insisted on Sunday that Mr Markle would be by his daughter's side at Windsor Castle this weekend.\n\nTMZ further claimed that Mr Markle \u2013 a former award-winning Hollywood lighting director who lives a reclusive life in Mexico and has yet to meet his future son-in-law \u2013 confirmed he had been offered money by US-based freelance photographer Jeff Rayner.\n\nThomas Jr previously told DailyMail.com his father was 'struggling' ahead of the wedding\n\nThomas Markle admitted to staging paparazzi photos (pictured) with an agency for money\n\nBut he insisted the 'deal' was not 'principally' about money. Instead, he wanted to 'rehabilitate' his image after pictures had been published of him looking overweight and dishevelled.\n\nHOW MEGHAN'S BIG DAY WAS UPENDED: TIMELINE TO THOMAS MARKLE'S DECISION TO STAY AWAY TUESDAY MAY 8: On Monday May 14, Thomas Markle Sr claims he suffered a heart attack six days ago - making it either Tuesday or Wednesday May 8 or 9.

Markle remains in his Mexico home MONDAY May 14: Markle announces he will not attend his daughter's wedding or walk her down the aisle. According to TMZ, he admitted to staging paparazzi photos in the run up to the wedding. Sources say Kensington Palace was blindsided by the decision. In a statement they say is is a deeply personal matter for Ms Markle Advertisement\n\nThe website wrote: 'He says since his daughter started dating Prince Harry he's been offered anywhere between $50,000 and $100,000 for interviews and he's turned all of them down.\n\n'Thomas says the paparazzi agency approached him, offered him money \u2013 though nowhere near the reported $100,000 \u2013 and he figured there was no harm in it and it would help recast his image.\n\n'He admits the pics look 'stupid and hammy'. He says he was just going along with the paparazzi agency, which he now deeply regrets.'\n\nThe website continued: 'Meghan's father will not be walking her down the aisle on Saturday... he isn't going to the wedding at all because of the fallout over selling photos of himself.'\n\nMr Markle also told the website that he had suffered a heart attack six days ago but checked himself out of the hospital so he could attend the wedding.\n\nThere was no independent confirmation that Mr Markle had been ill, however.\n\nIndeed, last week he was seen leaving his home in the beachside community of Rosarito, Mexico, and driving to San Diego, just over the US border.\n\nAccording to reports, he stopped for a few hours' sleep and then carried onto LA where he was photographed putting a pot of flowers on the doorstep of his ex-wife, Miss Ragland.\n\nTo add to the confusion, Mr Markle's daughter - Meghan's estranged half-sister Samantha - claimed that she was 'the culprit' behind the humiliating photograph debacle.\n\nIn a bizarre intervention, Samantha said she had advised her father to co-operate with the photographer to show himself \u2013 and, strangely, the Royal Family \u2013 in a 'positive' light. She also insisted his motive hadn't been money.\n\nOne source told the Mail that Mr Markle was 'very unwell', adding: 'He is under significant stress.\n\n'There is genuine concern about his safety. His health and safety are paramount [to Meghan]. He is under a huge amount of pressure.'\n\nIf Miss Markle's father is not at the wedding, it is believed Miss Ragland will walk her down the aisle.\n\nRevealed: The 4 procedures Meghan Markle's father could undergo following his heart attack and why they will prevent him from giving his daughter away By Alexandra Thompson, Health Reporter For MailOnline Meghan Markle's father has confirmed he will not attend her wedding to Prince Harry in three days time after suffering a heart attack last week. Thomas Markle, 73, is due to have an operation at 3.30pm UK time today to 'go in and clear blockage, repair damage, and put a stent where it is needed', he is reported to have said. It is unclear where Mr Markle, who lives in Mexico, will have the procedure, however, heart attacks are treated using the same procedures throughout North America and in the UK. Mr Markle was admitted to hospital yesterday after suffering severe chest pains, with tests confirming the heart attack did 'significant damage' and requires immediate surgery. Despite Meghan reportedly working hard to convince her father to walk her down the aisle, the retired lighting director is not expected to be in a fit enough state to travel across the Atlantic to Windsor after a major operation. Mr Markle claims his heart attack was triggered by an open letter his son Thomas Jr wrote to Prince Harry saying marrying Meghan would be the 'biggest mistake in royal wedding history'. Although it is unclear exactly what his surgery will involve, the MailOnline has rounded up the most common heart-attack operations and when Mr Markle may be able to congratulate his newly-married daughter in person. Angioplasty What is it? An angioplasty involves making a small incision in a patient's arm or leg, through which a wire with an attached deflated balloon is thread through up to the coronary arteries. The balloon is then inflated to widen areas where blood flow to the heart muscle has been reduced or cut off by plaque build up. In some cases wires with laser tips are inserted to break up plaque. The balloon may also have a sharp rotating edge to cut away cholesterol build up. What does it do? Angioplasties open blocked arteries, which restores normal blood flow to the heart. This reduces chest pain and allows people to exercise if they were left immobile by their angina. Angioplasties also reduce patients' risk of suffering a heart attack. How long is the recovery? And what are the risks? For patients being treated for chest pain, most are usually able to go home the same day of the operation. They should avoid strenuous activities and driving for at least a a week. Heart-attack patients may need to stay in hospital for several days after their angioplasties. Angioplasties are considered relatively non-invasive due to them only requiring a small incision in the arm or leg. The procedure generally lasts between 30 minutes and one hour. Risks depending on people's age and overall health but may include excessive bleeding, heart attacks and stroke. An angioplasty involves inserting a wire with an attached deflated balloon through an artery in a patient's arm, which is then thread up to the heart. The balloon expands and opens the artery Stent placement What is it? A stent is a wire mesh tube that props open arteries during an angioplasty. It surrounds the deflated balloon and expands with it when the balloon is inflated. After the balloon has been deflated and removed, the stent stays in the artery permanently. The recovery process and risks are the same as they are for angioplasties. What does it do? Stents hold arteries open to help improve blood flow to the heart and relieve chest pain. Stent placements are inserted in the same way as angioplasties but involve a wire mesh around the balloon. Once the balloon is removed, the stent remains to keep the artery open Bypass What is it? Bypass surgery involves taking arteries or veins from other parts of the body and using them to reroute blood around the clogged artery. Depending on how narrowed people's arteries are, some patients may require several bypass grafts. In some cases, small incisions are made in the chest, through which arteries or veins from the leg are attached to the heart. This requires the heart to be stopped, with blood being pumped through an oxygenator, which is also known as a 'heart-lung' machine. What does it do? Bypasses are one of the most effective ways to restore blocked blood supplies to the heart. As well as improving blood and oxygen supplies to the organ, the procedure relieves chest pain, reduces the risk of a heart attack and often allows patients to be more mobile. How long is the recovery? Most patients need to stay in hospital for at least a week after having a coronary artery bypass. Patients are generally able to sit in a chair after one day, walk after three and use stairs after six. It takes around six weeks before people can resume their normal daily activities, such as working and driving, and three months before they make a full recovery. What are the risks? Up to one in every three patients will suffer an irregular or abnormally fast heart rate, which is usually not serious and treatable with medication. Around one in 25 develop infections at the site of the incision on the chest, arms or legs. Reduced kidney function affects less than one in 20, which is typically just temporary and resolves within a few weeks. Brain-related problems may also occur, which can affect people's abilities to concentrate. Although this can be permanent, it usually improves after a few months. Due to the heart and coronary arteries being vulnerable after a bypass, up to 10 per cent of patients suffer a heart attack within 30 days of the surgery. Risks depend on a patient's age, overall health, weight and the number of vessels grafted. Bypass surgery involves taking arteries or veins from other parts of the body and using them to reroute blood around the clogged artery. Some patients may require several grafts Heart transplant What is it? Heart transplants involve removing diseased organs and replacing them with a healthy donated heart from someone who has recently died. They are considered in patients with severe heart failure who have not responded to medication. This may include those with coronary heart disease, birth defects that affect the heart or abnormally large or shaped hearts that have become stiff. Heart transplants involve a cut being made in the middle of the chest while a patient is under general anaesthetic. Once the diseased heart is removed, the donor organ is connected to the main arteries and veins, and should begin beating normally. What does it do? Such procedures have been proven to restore heart health in patients with irreversible damage. Heart transplant can be life saving in patients whose organs no longer worked efficiently. How long is the recovery? Most patients stay in hospital for between two and three weeks after a heart transplant. It can take several months before they can return to their normal activities. Patients are required to take immune-system suppressing drugs for the rest of their lives to reduce the risk of their bodies rejecting the donated organ. They also require regular check ups with heart specialists. What are the risks? One of the most common complications is the donor heart being rejected, which occurs when the immune system recognises the organ as foreign and attacks it. Taking immunosuppressants to reduce the risk of rejection can cause side effects such as infections, weight gain and high blood pressure. In up to 10 per cent of surgeries, the heart transplant does not work properly, which can be lift threatening and requires medications, ventilators and bypass machines to keep circulation going. If the donated heart's function does not improve, a second transplant may be required. Narrowed and hardened arteries are common after a heart transplant. They tend to occur several years after the operation. These can restrict the heart's blood supply, leading to attacks and even failure. Medications can prevent this. Heart transplants involve removing diseased organs and replacing them with a healthy donated heart from someone who has recently died.

You are doing a book called the 'Diary of princess pushy's sister'.\n\nSamantha replied that a 'book cannot be judged by its cover or by its title'.\n\nPiers Morgan called Meghan Markle's estranged half-sister Samantha (right) a 'little vulture' and accused her grabbing money by trashing the Suits star for years\n\nSamantha Markle, pictured with her famous half-sister in 2008, has said it's her fault their father agreed to appear in staged photos on the eve of the royal wedding\n\nShe also confirmed that her father has pulled out of Saturday's wedding but she hopes he will change his mind.\n\nShe said: 'I spoke to him early in the morning and he was quite depressed'.\n\nWhen asked if he might change his mind she said: 'I hope so. I wanted to see him go [to the wedding].\n\n'I don't know as of today what his plans are but I want him to go. Clearly the priority is whether it's safe for him to do that.'\n\nYesterday the sister claimed she was 'the culprit' behind the embarrassing 'faked' photographs of their father taken in the run-up to this week's royal wedding.\n\nSamantha, Thomas Markle's daughter by his first marriage, said she advised him to co-operate with a US-based paparazzo photographer in order to show himself - and, strangely, the royal family - in a 'positive' light and insisted his motive had not been money.\n\nBut she could not confirm whether Mr Markle had actually accepted any payment for his collusion for the stunt. Mr Markle later told TMZ he had.\n\nMs Markle told GMB: 'He was unfairly present in the media as shabby, I think photographer looked for the most unflattering photographs.\n\n'My father has really suffered at the hands of the media. I think a person has a right to say 'enough is enough, I want to be shown how I really am'.'\n\nBut Piers hit back and said he was a 'grown man who knew what he was doing'.\n\nHe said: 'You say this is all the media's fault, because the media has been treating him in shabby way, viewers will look at the way you've treated you sister Meghan and think that you treated her in a shabby way.\n\n'You've spent the last two years criticising her, you called her narcissistic, selfish, that Hollywood has changed her and that Prince Harry shouldn't marry her, yet you have the gall to blame media vultures.\n\n'You've made loads of money off the back of a tenuous link to Meghan Markle, who you've spoken to once in 10 years. You've been trashing her for two years you vulture'.\n\nSamantha said she had not used those words to describe Meghan and Piers said 'we have all the transcripts'.\n\nHarry and Meghan are said to be heartbroken by his decision and will try to change his mind with just four days until their wedding\n\nYesterday she confirmed photographs taken of an apparently unwitting Mr Markle getting fitted up for his wedding suit and browsing pictures of his daughter on the internet had actually been taken in collaboration with a professional photographer, despite Kensington Palace issuing strongly worded requests for the media to protect his privacy.\n\nSpeaking from her home in Florida to ITV's Loose Women programme in London, his eldest daughter, Samantha, said: 'I have to say I am entirely the culprit.\n\n'As we know the media can take very unflattering photographs of people on their casual days and blow it way out of proportion.\n\n'I said, you know, [to him] the world has no idea you're getting in shape, doing healthy things.\n\n'They don't photograph you buying vegetables and PH water. They photograph you as unflattering ways as they can.\n\n'So I said, really you need to show the world that you're getting in shape and doing great healthy things. So I suggested it.\n\n'There's a lot of scrutiny that it was money motivated, it was not. It was my suggestion that to benefit him and to benefit the royal family that everyone looked good and they depict you as you are - in shape and doing healthy things.'\n\nAsked if she could categorically say he did not receive money for the photographs, Samantha floundered slightly, saying: 'I don't believe so and that was not the motive. I have no idea but if he did I'm going to assume it was a pittance. They don't pay that much. It was really so that the world could see him doing the healthy things he enjoys doing.'\n\nAsked whether she could understand how embarrassing the revelations were for Kensington Palace and her sister, particularly given their stance on protecting his privacy, she conceded that it would be 'awkward' but felt that his treatment by the media had been 'unjust' and 'somehow we could spin it...'\n\nShe also tweeted: 'The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault. The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family. We had no idea he would be taken advantage of. It was not for money'\n\nDespite posting a string of vitriolic tweets attacking her younger sister, Samantha also insisted that she was not bitter about Meghan's decision not to invite her to Saturday's wedding. The pair haven't actually seen each other for around a decade.\n\nHere come the in-laws! Meghan's nephews and their mother touch down in London with 13 SUITCASES ahead of royal wedding TV special - despite 'NOT being invited' to the event itself\n\nThere has been much speculation as to which members of Meghan's family will be attending her nuptials to Prince Harry in Windsor ion Saturday.\n\nAnd while her father has confirmed he will not attend it looks as though her nephews Tyler and Thomas Dooley along with their mother, Meghan's sister-in-law, Tracy Dooley seem determined to take part in the big day.\n\nDespite previously revealing they hadn't received an invite to the royal wedding the trio were seen making their way to the arrivals gate at the London airport on Monday.\n\nThe family have been enlisted as 'special correspondents' for Good Morning Britain and are expected to report from Windsor, though are thought not to be attending the ceremony.\n\nMeghan's sister-in-law Tracy Dooley was pictured arriving at Heathrow airport on Monday\n\nShe was joined by her sons and Meghan's nephews Tyler (pictured) and Thomas Dooley\n\nArmed with no less than 13 suitcases the family, including Tyler's girlfriend Sandra Bazan (left) made their way out of the international airport having flown in from their home in Oregon\n\nArmed with no less than 13 suitcases the family cut a casual figure as they made their way out of the international airport having flown in from their home in Oregon.\n\nA cheerful Tracy could even be seen flashing a peace sign to photographers as she made her way from security.\n\nAnd it's clear that the family couldn't be happier about making the trip across the pond; shortly after arriving in London, Tyler began posting image from London on his Facebook page, sharing snaps of a few landmarks, as well as an image showing the interior of his hotel room.\n\nThe family is thought to be staying at the H10 hotel in Waterloo, where rooms are available for as little as \u00a370, or $93, per night. The hotel is located just a short distance from Waterloo station, and is an hour's driving distance from St. George's Chapel at Windsor Castle, where Meghan and Harry are due to tie the knot.\n\nAlong with the images - which also showed the outside of another nearby landmark, the Imperial War Museum, seemingly captured from the back of a car - Tyler also shared an update about his travels with his Facebook friends, writing: 'Just touched down in London!!! Man what a journey so far. We're safe and sound!'\n\nThe images were met with a warm response from Tyler's Facebook friends, with many urging him to 'have a blast', while others reminded Meghan's nephew to 'take pics'.\n\nOthers, however, weren't quite so clued into the reason for the family's journey to London, with one person questioning, 'There for the wedding or other biz [sic]?'\n\nThey have of course previously appeared on the ITV show, when they claimed to have been snubbed from the wedding list.\n\nA cheerful Tracy could even be seen flashing a peace sign to photographers as she made her way from security\n\nThe family are expected to make an appearance on Good Morning Britain this week\n\nIn March Tracy and Tyler appeared via live video link from Oregon, and admitted that while they were still hopeful that invitations might be en route, it was looking extremely unlikely.\n\nTyler said on the show: 'We've not got anything yet.

The Profumo affair had it all - sex, lies and espionage. It broke at the height of the Cold War, when spying was rife and the threat of war was imminent with the outbreak of the Cuban Missile Crisis. Here we look back at how the scandal unfolded: April 1960: At the height of the Cold War, Christine Keeler, having left her home in Wraysbury, Berks, heads for London and begins working at Murray's Cabaret Club in Soho. It is there that she meets Dr Stephen Ward, a London osteopath. Within weeks she had moved into his Bayswater flat. She soon meets Mandy Rice-Davies at Murray's and the pair become party companions. July 1961: Ward introduces 19-year-old Keeler to Secretary of State for War, John Profumo, while at a party thrown by Lord and Lady Astor at their stately home in Cliveden at Taplow, Bucks. Keeler and Profumo embark on an affair lasting only a few weeks. At the same time, she becomes involved in an affair with Commander Eugene Ivanov, a Soviet naval attach\u00e9 at the Russian Embassy in London. March 1963: After months of speculation among MPs, Profumo is forced to face the Commons, where he says: 'There was no impropriety whatever in my acquaintance with Miss Keeler and I have made the statement because of what was said yesterday in the House by three honourable members whose remarks were protected by privilege.' June 5, 1963: Profumo resigns his Cabinet post after admitting lying to the House of Commons about the nature of his relationship with Keeler. December 1963: Keeler is found guilty of perjury in a related trial and imprisoned for nine months.

Advertisement\n\nIt will be Harry and Ms Markle's first official engagement as a married couple.\n\nThe couple spent their final weekend together before the big day at a hideaway cottage in the Cotswolds.\n\nThe pair hunkered down at the four-bedroom lodge, which is nestled in a wooded areas of the north Oxfordshire countryside.\n\nRefurbishments have been made to make the leased-out love nest fit for purpose, with motion alarms and cameras set up in the surrounding area.\n\nIt is believed that Meghan, 36, is a particular fan of the secret retreat and the picturesque views the couple can see from the kitchen's large window.\n\nA source told The Sun: 'The run-up to the wedding has been quite stressful for them and they just wanted to get away and relax before the big day.\n\n'They like to escape to the country for the weekend and the cottage is just perfect for them.\n\n'It's very private, has a vast open-plan kitchen and dining area for Meghan to cook in and lots of large windows for the stunning views.'\n\nSo if poor Mr Markle isn't going to give Meghan away, who will?\n\nby Richard Kay\n\nThere will be nothing but sympathy for Thomas Markle today. Certainly that will be the main emotion as the shock of his reported decision to pull out of the royal wedding and not give his daughter away at Windsor on Saturday is absorbed.\n\nEver since Meghan's relationship with Prince Harry first emerged to near universal delight, her father has conducted himself with a quiet dignity; unfamiliar with the relentless spotlight of publicity, he has been content to largely remain in the background.\n\nSamantha Markle claimed it was her idea for Thomas Markle to be photographed in a series of royal wedding shots to show him and the royal family in a positive light\n\nOther members of his family \u2013 his son and daughter by his first marriage for example \u2013 have seized the opportunity to speak of their younger half-sibling, often thoughtlessly and sometimes with cruelty.\n\nTom Markle did none of these things. But then, as the finishing line at St George's Chapel where he was due to walk Meghan up the aisle was visible, he chose to enter into a reckless arrangement that appears to have had shattering consequences.\n\nAt the weekend, it was reported that he had staged paparazzi photographs in exchange for money \u2013 though that was not his principal motive. He had, naively it must be said, hoped that choreographed pictures might rebalance the image the world had of him as some sort of bumbling semi-recluse.\n\nInstead the outcome has been one of humiliation for him.\n\nSamantha Markle said it was her idea for Thomas Markle to be photographed in a series of royal wedding shoots where he lives in Mexico\n\nQueen's stamps of approval Stamps featuring Harry and Meghan are going on sale to celebrate the wedding. The Royal Mail has produced a special set of four stamps showing two of the couple's engagement portraits and bearing Saturday's date. The images for the souvenir miniature sheet were taken by New York-based photographer Alexi Lubomirski at Frogmore House in Windsor in December. Lubomirski, who has described the couple as being 'so deliciously in love', has also been chosen as their official wedding photographer. The stamps will be released on Saturday morning. Harry and Meghan personally approved the set, while the Queen had the final say. The 1st class stamp shows the couple at Frogmore House where they will have their evening reception. The \u00a31.55 stamp is a more informal black and white image showing Meghan with her arm through Harry's as they walk through the grounds. She is wearing a gown by Ralph & Russo who are reported to have been chosen to make her wedding dress. Advertisement\n\nSo it must have been with an unbearably heavy heart that he made his sudden and totally unexpected announcement. He is reported to have said that he cannot embarrass the Royal Family or his beloved daughter on her wedding day and that the solution is to stay away.\n\nBut his decision to do so will strike a chord with people everywhere. Weddings are so often fraught affairs, even royal\n\nones. Days before she married Prince Charles, Lady Diana Spencer wanted to back out \u2013 only to be told by her sisters that it was too late because her face was already on the souvenir tea towels.\n\nEven so, Mr Markle's absence will cast an unfortunate and inevitably regrettable pall over this weekend's ceremony. Some will doubtless say that this sad outcome is of his own making.\n\nBut that would gratuitously misunderstand the intentions of a basically honourable man.\n\nIn fact, as tragic as it is for Meghan to be robbed of the reassuring presence of her father on Saturday, the overriding feeling is sorrow for the man himself.\n\nFor here is a man who suddenly found himself thrust into an alien world. An award-winning former Hollywood lighting director, but out of his depth when it came to handling publicity.\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle will marry on Saturday, May 19, in Windsor\n\nHe is not the first person to be seduced into a cosy arrangement with unscrupulous photographers. It is a well-practised gimmick among celebrities to have apparently spontaneous pictures taken in which they have conspired \u2013 and then shared the proceeds of the deception.\n\nQuite why Mr Markle decided to enter into such an arrangement is impossible to know.\n\nOn TV yesterday his elder daughter Samantha \u2013 when not lamenting her own absence from the wedding (she hasn't been invited) \u2013 was suggesting that she had put her father up to it, to paint him in a positive light.\n\nA noble enough sentiment, but in reality a doomed exercise that has left her father looking foolish, hurt and no longer participating on Saturday.\n\nBut that brings us to another vexed question. Who on earth is going to give Meghan away?\n\nFrom the moment Prince Harry acknowledged that he was in a relationship with Tom Markle's beautiful daughter, the world has tuned in.\n\nHer mixed-race background, her struggle to make it as an actress and her championing of the kind of causes Harry's late mother pioneered all caught our attention.\n\nAnd with that, the focus inevitably fell on her family. A broken home and the striving of her parents to give her the best chance in life were compelling aspects of her story.\n\nMaybe Mr Markle, living 'off grid' in a run-down neighbourhood of a Mexican border town, felt he could manage expectations by living low.\n\nThe demeaning contribution of his son Thomas Jr cannot have helped. In a letter to Prince Harry just a few weeks ago, he described his sister as a 'jaded, shallow, conceited woman' who would make a 'joke of the Royal Family.'\n\nYet with breath-taking nonchalance he followed that up a couple of days ago by writing that it was 'not too late' for him and other family members to receive an invitation to the wedding. Sitting in his small flat on the outskirts of Tijuana, Tom Markle senior cannot have failed to have taken this all on board.\n\nTomorrow night he should have been settling into a room at Windsor Castle. A valet would have unpacked his bag, laundered his clothes and drawn his bath. He would have taken tea with the Queen and met his daughter's future father-in-law Prince Charles.\n\nInstead, on the day he would have had the eyes of the world on him walking as proud as can be to give his daughter's hand in marriage in the majesty of St George's Chapel, he will be 5,000 miles away.\n\nUnless he has a change of heart. Nothing would please Harry, the Royal Family or Meghan more than for him to be there. The world would like it too.\n\nRoyally embarrassing: How Meghan Markle's relatives have shown her up ahead of her big day Meghan Markle's father Thomas Markle has announced he will not be walking his daughter down the aisle after admitting he staged paparazzi photos for cash And he is not the first relative to have left the actress red-faced HALF BROTHER: THOMAS MARKLE JR Meghan's estranged half-brother also named Thomas, 51, was arrested on January 12 for holding a gun to his girlfriend's head. The Oregon window fitter later admitted to having a drinking problem and said he was 'seeking help' He has repeatedly put himself back into the public light during his sister's engagement. Oh brother: Thomas Markle Jr has repeatedly embarrassed Meghan penning two open letters over the royal wedding On May 2, he provided In Touch magazine with a letter slamming his Suits actress sister and even telling Prince Harry to back out of the ceremony 'As more time passes to your royal wedding, it became very clear that this is the biggest mistake in royal wedding history, ' he wrote 'It's not to [sic] late, Meghan Markle is obviously not the right woman for you.' He also called his half-sister 'jaded, shallow and conceited' and accused her of using their father until he was 'bankrupt' from 'paying her way' On Friday, he penned another letter. Markle Jr lightened his tone and pleaded for an invite to the ceremony. 'Meg I know that I'm not perfect, nor is anyone else in our family, as I'm sure you have read by now,' he wrote. 'But good, bad, or perfect, we're the only family that you have. It does hurt my feelings not getting invited to your wedding, along with the rest of the family. 'But it's not too late to send me an invite along with your entire family. We should all be there to show our love and support on your wedding day because that's what families do. Not to mention, how long it's been since we all seen and have gotten together, that would be very nice.' The family: Thomas Markle's ex wife and her sons will appear on British TV to provide commentary despite having lost contact with Meghan years ago On Monday, Markle Jr's ex-wife Tracy Dooley and her two sons Tyler and Thomas arrived in london despite not being invited to the wedding The relatives have been invited to be 'special correspondent's for Good Morning Britain. Despite admitting they haven't seen Meghan for 20 years, they said they were supporting her and 'so proud of her' in an interview with the breakfast show last month HALF SISTER: SAMANTHA GRANT Thomas Markle Sr's eldest daughter Samantha Grant, 53, has been outspoken on Meghan ever since her half-sister's relationship with Prince Harry was revealed. Big sis: Samantha Grant nee Markle has been outspoken on social media about the royal wedding and has also written a memoir entitled Diary of a Princess Pushy's Sister On Monday, she took responsibility for advising her father to stage the photos which have led to his embarrassment and decision to avoid his younger daughter's wedding Speaking on British television, she said: 'I'm entirely the culprit. I suggested it to benefit him and the royal family'. She also tweeted the official Kensington Palace Twitter account and said: 'The bad press over my father doing staged photos is my fault. The media was unfairly making him look bad so I suggested he do positive photos for his benefit and the benefit of the royal family. We had no idea he would be taken advantage of. It was not for money'. However, this isn't the first time Samantha has hit headlines . The Multiple Sclerosis sufferer, who is wheelchair-bound, previously called on Prince Harry to 'man up' and accused the Queen's grandson of rank hypocrisy in offering 'shout outs about humanitarianism' while allowing 'Meg to ignore the Markles'.
