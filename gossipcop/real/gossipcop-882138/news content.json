The couple had been together on and off for years but tied the knot in November of last year.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nShe has now filed for divorce after an alleged domestic violence incident. Audrina's rep requests that people respect the star's privacy during this time and stressed that her main priority is to care for the couple's daughter.\n\nMeanwhile, E! News managed to chat to Audrina's ex Justin Bobby to see what he had to say on the matter.\n\nBobby, who appeared on The Hills as Audrina's on-again-off-again boyfriend, said:\n\n\"My first reaction is the thought of the child, obviously. Me, coming from a separated family at a young age, it had its perks and it had its hindrances. My second thought is if she's OK, because she's been a longtime friend. My thoughts and my heart go out to her and her little one at this time.\"\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHe then went on to speak about how he feels Audrina will deal with the situation:\n\n\"I don't feel good about it. The baby is so cute and beautiful. Thank God Audrina has such a strong foundation with her family. They just reap family values to the highest degree, is what I've learned over the years. She will be fine and the baby will be fine.\"", "images": ["https://www.her.ie/assets/images/her/main-logo.svg?id=5d83db2642088bed19e5&v=2", "https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtaGVyLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE3XFxcLzA5XFxcLzIyMTU0NzMwXFxcL2p1c3Rpbi1ib2JieS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1iNmY4NGQ2MjdiNDExNGYwMGY1MFwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJlODYxYzc2Y2VmMjI3MzVjYzQ0ODQ4Mjc4Y2Q0YjFkZTQwMzMxMzFmIn0=/justin-bobby.jpg", "https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwczpcXFwvXFxcL3d3dy5oZXIuaWVcXFwvYXNzZXRzXFxcL2ltYWdlc1xcXC9oZXJcXFwvbm8taW1hZ2UucG5nP2lkPWI2Zjg0ZDYyN2I0MTE0ZjAwZjUwXCIsXCJ3aWR0aFwiOjEzMyxcImhlaWdodFwiOjc3LFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1iNmY4NGQ2MjdiNDExNGYwMGY1MFwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiI1NWQ0ZTkwZTliNjcyMWMxMjlmMDU0MmNlYzc1NmM5MTAzZWJhYWI1In0=/no-image.png?id=b6f84d627b4114f00f50"], "top_img": "https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtaGVyLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE3XFxcLzA5XFxcLzIyMTU0NzMwXFxcL2p1c3Rpbi1ib2JieS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1iNmY4NGQ2MjdiNDExNGYwMGY1MFwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJlODYxYzc2Y2VmMjI3MzVjYzQ0ODQ4Mjc4Y2Q0YjFkZTQwMzMxMzFmIn0=/justin-bobby.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Holland"], "canonical_link": "https://www.her.ie/entertainment/justin-bobby-comments-audrina-patridges-divorce-365827", "title": "Justin Bobby comments on Audrina Patridge's divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "description": "He gave a lengthy response when asked about it.", "keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment, the hills, Audrina Patridge, Justin Bobby", "news_keywords": "Entertainment, Entertainment, the hills, Audrina Patridge, Justin Bobby", "fb": {"pages": 216248578492948}, "theme-color": "#fff", "og": {"title": "Justin Bobby comments on Audrina Patridge's divorce | Her.ie", "description": "He gave a lengthy response when asked about it.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.her.ie/entertainment/justin-bobby-comments-audrina-patridges-divorce-365827", "site_name": "Her.ie", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtaGVyLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE3XFxcLzA5XFxcLzIyMTU0NzMwXFxcL2p1c3Rpbi1ib2JieS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1iNmY4NGQ2MjdiNDExNGYwMGY1MFwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJlODYxYzc2Y2VmMjI3MzVjYzQ0ODQ4Mjc4Y2Q0YjFkZTQwMzMxMzFmIn0=/justin-bobby.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 647, "height": 340}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Herdotie", "creator": "http://twitter.com/laurholland", "url": "https://www.her.ie/entertainment/justin-bobby-comments-audrina-patridges-divorce-365827", "title": "Justin Bobby comments on Audrina Patridge's divorce | Her.ie", "description": "He gave a lengthy response when asked about it.", "image": "https://img.maximummedia.ie/her_ie/eyJkYXRhIjoie1widXJsXCI6XCJodHRwOlxcXC9cXFwvbWVkaWEtaGVyLm1heGltdW1tZWRpYS5pZS5zMy5hbWF6b25hd3MuY29tXFxcL3dwLWNvbnRlbnRcXFwvdXBsb2Fkc1xcXC8yMDE3XFxcLzA5XFxcLzIyMTU0NzMwXFxcL2p1c3Rpbi1ib2JieS5qcGdcIixcIndpZHRoXCI6NjQ3LFwiaGVpZ2h0XCI6MzQwLFwiZGVmYXVsdFwiOlwiaHR0cHM6XFxcL1xcXC93d3cuaGVyLmllXFxcL2Fzc2V0c1xcXC9pbWFnZXNcXFwvaGVyXFxcL25vLWltYWdlLnBuZz9pZD1iNmY4NGQ2MjdiNDExNGYwMGY1MFwiLFwib3B0aW9uc1wiOltdfSIsImhhc2giOiJlODYxYzc2Y2VmMjI3MzVjYzQ0ODQ4Mjc4Y2Q0YjFkZTQwMzMxMzFmIn0=/justin-bobby.jpg", "app": {"country": "IE", "name": {"iphone": "Her.ie", "android": "Her.ie", "googleplay": "Her.ie"}, "id": {"iphone": 1289435339, "ipad": 564477816, "googleplay": "ie.her.app"}}}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=1289435339", "google-play-app": "app-id=ie.her.app"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.her.ie", "summary": ""}
