She tells ET that before Jenna becomes a Chmerkovskiy, she should learn the following things:\n\n1. \"Say 'ichka' at the end of every word to make it cute. Like, babe-ichka, Peta-ichka, Maks-ichka. You do it with baby words, too.\"\n\n2. \"Learn how to make Russian salads. Key.\"\n\n3. \"And always have fruit in the fridge. A stocked fridge.\"\n\nAs for Maks and Peta, they are very much looking forward to Val and Jenna's bachelor and bachelorette parties, as the two never had their own before they tied the knot last July.\n\n\"We might go to Disneyland,\" teased Maks, who also told us that Val has yet to officially ask him to be best man. \"You know, mix it up a little bit!\"\n\n\"Maybe we should do a joint one,\" added Peta. \"Maybe Vegas?\"\n\nYes, please!\n\nET also spoke with Val at the event, who told us the two have finally locked down a wedding month.
