The actress, who stars in the upcoming female-centric Netflix series GLOW, recently opened up about an audition from her past that was wildly inappropriate, to say the least.\n\nFollowing a screening of her new series, in which Brie plays a struggling actress who, tired of the one-dimensional roles she's usually asked to read for, is ultimately cast in a league of female wrestlers, she got real about how different working on the show was from the industry sexism characteristic of the 1980s setting it depicts\u2014and how much of Hollywood is still pretty sexist. \"It has not changed that much,\" Brie told Entertainment Weekly. \"The audition process has not changed that much.\"\n\nBrie revealed that years ago, in an audition for the HBO series Entourage, the casting panel asked her to take her top off. She said, \"Early in my career, I auditioned for three lines on an episode of Entourage that I had to go on in a bikini! Or like shorts and the tiniest shorts. And they were like, 'OK, can you take your top off now?'\"\n\nJennifer Euston, the casting director for GLOW, later took to Twitter to share her disdain for the experience Brie had. She tweeted, \"...makes me sick there are producers who abuse their power & if there was a Casting Director present, they did nothing? Inexcusable.\"\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nHBO hasn't yet commented on Brie's claims, though her story isn't hard to believe, considering the hordes of naked women who appeared on the show over the years in roles that were hardly complex or, frankly, realistic.\n\nBetty Gilpin, Brie's GLOW costar, also recounted an audition before a room full of men in which she was asked to take down her hair. \"That\u2019s gross,\" Euston commented in response, according to EW.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632b4c84d35005622a70bc5c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632b0643c5b902b9cb6bbf17/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632218a3f8cff70c7e2a42e4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1497032916/glamour_the-11-most-shocking-moments-on-american-idol.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Chelsea Stone"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/alison-brie-entourage-audition", "title": "Alison Brie Says She Was Asked to Take Her Top Off During 'Entourage' Audition", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Alison Brie recently opened up about an audition from her past that was inappropriate, to say the least.", "id": "593e93abee96996f3f743913", "keywords": "alison brie,entourage,sexism", "news_keywords": "alison brie,entourage,sexism", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "593e93abee96996f3f743913", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Alison Brie recently opened up about an audition from her past that was inappropriate, to say the least.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "UGH.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "You'll Cringe When You Hear What Alison Brie Was Asked to During an 'Entourage' Audition", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/alison-brie-entourage-audition"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-06-12T14:08:42.293Z", "modified_time": "2017-06-12T14:15:00.000Z", "author": "Chelsea Stone"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "UGH.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/593e92f375eb7a0289a89e04/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-509501890.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "You'll Cringe When You Hear What Alison Brie Was Asked to During an 'Entourage' Audition"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497276522.293, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
