own right, but to a stranger she was falsely identified as a homeless person.\n\nWhile filming her new untitled series for Amazon Studios film, a crew member approached the Jackson and asked her to leave.\n\nThe 19-year-old shared the mistaken identity story on social media.\n\n\"One of the first people on set, sitting in the parking lot and this dude comes up to me and says homeless people aren't allowed in this area,\u201d she said on Twitter.\n\nPARIS JACKSON POSES TOPLESS ON INSTAGRAM\n\nShe snidely quipped to the man, \u201cI said oh sorry I'm waiting for hair and makeup should I wait elsewhere also why do you assume I'm homeless.\u201d\n\nOne fan wrote to in response to Jackson, \"How did he not know that your Paris Jackson Michael Jacksons daughter like do you not pay
