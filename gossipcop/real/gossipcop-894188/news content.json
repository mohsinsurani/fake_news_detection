The singer will be taking the stage for the first time since her kidney transplant, and Bracco said that it's bound to be \"a very emotional night for her.\"\n\nAnother highlight: Christina Aguilera will sing a medley of songs from Whitney Houston's \"The Bodyguard\" soundtrack, released 25 years ago this week.\n\nChristina Aguilera performs at the Kennedy Center in Washington DC, Sept. 23, 2016.

Other performers include Niall Horan, Alessia Cara, Demi Lovato, Lady Gaga, Shawn Mendes, Hailee Steinfeld, Nick Jonas and many more.\n\nNick Jonas performs in concert aboard the cruise ship Carnival Liberty, Nov. 16, 2017 in Cape Canaveral, Florida.
