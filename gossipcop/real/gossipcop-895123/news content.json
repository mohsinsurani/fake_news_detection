Its star, Emmy winner Jeffrey Tambor, was fired from his starring role after being accused of sexually harassing two women on the set (he has denied it).\n\nThe string of cancellations in 2018 comes as Amazon continues to clean house after a management shakeup.\n\nIn October, Amazon Studios head Roy Price resigned after allegations of sexual harassment surfaced, and CEO Jeff Bezos has reportedly directed a change in strategy at the company, which led to Amazon in November grabbing the rights to make a TV series based on \"The Lord of the Rings.\"\n\nHere are the shows Amazon has killed, along with their critic and audience ratings from Metacritic:", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E",
