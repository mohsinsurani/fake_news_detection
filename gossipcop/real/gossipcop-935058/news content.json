We\u2019re thinking all of them probably are owed guest spots.\u201d\n\nHe added, smiling into the camera, \u201cSo I would expect all of them to be on the show.\u201d\n\nFox decided last week to pull the plug on the cop comedy after five seasons.\n\n\u201cI ONLY WATCH LIKE 4 THINGS. THIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS #RenewB99,\u201d Miranda tweeted on Thursday. Hamill added, \u201cNOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! \ud83d\ude29\ud83d\ude2d\ud83d\ude2b\ud83d\ude22 I\u2019m SO not ready to say #ByeBye99.\u201d\n\nAstin also tweeted, \u201cHave nothing 2 do with the show. I\u2019m just a fan who deserves better.\u201d\n\nMiranda tweeted out a photo of himself with the \u201cBrooklyn Nine-Nine\u201d cast on Monday, so it doesn\u2019t seem to far-fetched to get him in for an episode.\n\nHe added, \u201cAlso: since Friday night, I\u2019m in the weirdest, best group chat with @HamillHimself @RealGDT @sethmeyers and @SeanAstin. Thanks again #Brooklyn99!\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/brooklyn-99.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/brooklyn-99.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/brooklyn-99.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["May"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/05/14/andy-samberg-wants-celeb-fans-to-guest-star-on-brooklyn-nine-nine/", "title": "Andy Samberg wants celeb fans to guest star on \u2018Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
