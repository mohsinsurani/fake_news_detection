And giving Sanjaya a little bit of fresh air. #AmericanIdol #IdolFinale pic.twitter.com/Gcl9V9cnxP \u2014 American Idol (@AmericanIdol) May 22, 2018\n\nThe Jimmy Kimmel Live! host brought out a giant time capsule for a sketch to help drag out the finale for two hours, and pulled out some mementos from Idol's long past. One of them included Malakar's hair.\n\nLater, Malakar himself came out! Kimmel said he thought Clay Aiken was supposed to be in there too, but Malakar said he ate him.\n\nAt the end of the sketch, Kimmel told Malakar to get back in and to put his hair back on \"so everyone will know who the hell you are.\"\n\nThe segment also included an appearance from Ashley Ferl, best known as the \"crying girl.\" Ferl famously broke into tears when Malakar performed \"You Really Got Me,\" and became an early viral video star in 2007.\n\nMalakar famously made it to seventh place on Idol's sixth season, much to the chagrin of Simon Cowell and the other judges. Still, he is a fan-favorite, as made clear by the reactions from viewers on Twitter.\n\n\"Other than the bald head, Sanjaya didn't look like he aged at all. And that crying girl still looks like a girl in spite of being a grown woman now,\" one fan wrote.\n\nOther than the bald head, Sanjaya didn't look like he aged at all.
