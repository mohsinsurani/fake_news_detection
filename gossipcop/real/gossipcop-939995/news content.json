Conner on \"Roseanne,\" said he \"condemned\" Barr's tweet about Jarrett and said he was \"devastated\" by the show's cancellation. He said he was especially disappointed because the show embraced inclusivity.\n\nBarr responded: \"i created the platform for that inclusivity and you know it.ME . You throw me under the bus. nice!\"\n\nFishman wrote back, \"You fought, built, and designed Roseanne for inclusiveness. That is why yesterday was so out of character with the last 30 years. It was in your hands from the beginning to the end. No one can deny that.\"\n\nBarr asked him to leave her alone.\n\ni created the platform for that inclusivity and you know https://t.co/hViHPX2ZUb. You throw me under the bus. nice! \u2014 Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018\n\nBarr also hit back at former co-star Sara Gilbert, who played her daughter Darlene Conner on the show.\n\nGilbert wrote that Barr's comments about Jarrett were \"abhorrent\" and \"do not reflect the beliefs of our cast and crew or anyone associated with our show. I am disappointed in her actions to say the least.\"\n\nBarr wrote back, \"Wow! unreal.\"\n\nWow! unreal. \u2014 Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018\n\nBut Barr also tweeted at a fan and said that she forgave Gilbert, writing: \"no, I understand her position and why she said what she said. i forgive her. It just shocked me a bit, but I indeed f**ked up.\" She told another fan, \"She's distancing herself from me and my tweet-she has to.\"\n\nBarr also responded to a Twitter user who criticized Wanda Sykes, saying that Sykes' tweet about walking away from \"Roseanne\" made ABC execs \"very nervous\" and caused them to cancel the show.\n\nBarr, who was apologetic Tuesday about her tweet about Jarrett, has become increasingly defiant, saying, \"you guys make me feel like fighting back. I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U.\"\n\nyou guys make me feel like fighting back. I will examine all of my options carefully and get back to U. \u2014 Roseanne Barr (@therealroseanne) May 30, 2018\n\nShe also retweeted President Trump's tweet in which he slammed Disney CEO Bob Iger, seemingly accusing him of being a hypocrite. Mr. Trump did not criticize Barr for her tweet but instead said, \"Bob Iger of ABC called Valerie Jarrett to let her know that 'ABC does not tolerate comments like those' made by Roseanne Barr. Gee, he never called President Donald J. Trump to apologize for the HORRIBLE statements made and said about me on ABC. Maybe I just didn't get the call?\"\n\nMr. Trump has praised Barr and \"Roseanne\" in the past.\n\nIn addition to ABC's cancellation of \"Roseanne,\" Viacom announced that it was pulling all reruns of the show.\n\nEditor's Note: This report has been edited for accuracy. A previous version stated that the May 30 edition of \"The Talk\" avoided the topic -- however that broadcast was pre-recorded before the offending tweets had been posted.", "images":
