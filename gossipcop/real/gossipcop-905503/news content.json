Later on Friday at 8 p.m. EST, NBC will air a \u201cfully-produced\u201d television broadcast of the opening ceremony, featuring interviews and commentary by hosts Katie Couric and Mike Tirico.\n\nWhere was the opening ceremony held?\n\nThe Olympics opening ceremony took place in the new PyeongChang Olympic Stadium, which seats 35,000 people. The venue will be used just four times \u2014 for the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2018 Olympics and Paralympics \u2014 before being torn down. Construction of the stadium was part of the roughly $13 billion that South Korea is spending on the Olympics, the Associated Press reported.\n\nBut amid severe winter weather warnings, organizers feared that the Olympic stadium, which has no roof, might make the opening ceremony too cold for spectators to endure. Temperatures in PyeongChang this month have been falling to -4 degrees Fahrenheit at night, Reuters reported.\n\nThe forecast prompted organizers to work on measures to prevent cases of hypothermia and prepare for no-shows. Spectators were given hot packs, seat warmers, blankets, hats and windbreakers to keep warm. But temperatures at the opening ceremony were warmer than expected at 28 degrees Fahrenheit, and some athletes appeared unfazed.\n\nWhat happened at the Olympics opening ceremony?\n\nAs in every Olympics opening ceremony since 1908, athletes marched into the stadium under their country\u2019s flag during the Parade of Nations. Olympic athletes from North and South Korea marched together under a single flag \u2014 a historic diplomatic decision that caused some controversy.\n\nEven before North and South Korea agreed to unite, organizers had planned for the Olympics opening ceremony to have a theme of peace. Korean musicians performed John Lennon\u2019s \u201cImagine,\u201d surrounded by lights in the shape of a dove.\n\n\u201cWe have worked on all of our scenarios under the theme of peace,\u201d Song Seung-whan, the executive creative director for the opening ceremony, said at a press conference in January, according to Reuters. \u201cAlthough North Korea\u2019s participation was decided belatedly, we think this will serve as a good opportunity for us to convey our message more clearly.\u201d\n\nMore than a thousand drones lit up the sky in the shape of the Olympics rings, above a show that featured 1,300 performers and 700 volunteers at one point, the New York Times reported. South Korean figure skater Yuna Kim lit the Olympic cauldron after performing a short skating routine.\n\nPita Taufatofua \u2014 the oiled-up Tongan flag-bearer who became a social media sensation during the opening ceremony of the 2016 Rio Olympics \u2014 is competing in PyeongChang as a cross-country skier. He carried his country\u2019s flag at Friday\u2019s opening ceremony, stealing the show once again with the same shirtless uniform despite freezing temperatures.\n\nTeam USA weathered those bitter temperatures by wearing heated parkas as they paraded into the Olympic stadium. The uniforms, which feature American flags made of heat-conductive ink, were designed by Polo Ralph Lauren, the official outfitter for the 2018 U.S. Olympic and Paralympic teams.\n\nWho attended the opening ceremony?\n\nThe U.S. delegation to the Olympics is led by Vice President Mike Pence, who attended the opening ceremony with his wife, Karen Pence. The delegation also includes California Rep. Ed Royce and 2002 Olympic figure skating gold medalist Sarah Hughes. Joining them are Gen. Vincent Brooks, who commands the United Nations Command and U.S. Forces Korea; his predecessor, Gen. James Thurman; and Marc Knapper, a diplomat currently leading the U.S. embassy in Seoul.\n\nEarlier in the day, Pence met with North Korean defectors and Fred Warmbier \u2014 the father of Otto Warmbier, an American college student who died last year after being imprisoned in North Korea. Fred Warmbier had also been scheduled to attend the opening ceremony as Pence\u2019s guest, the Washington Post reported. The Warmbiers attended this year\u2019s State of the Union address by President Trump, who pointed to them as \u201cpowerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world.\u201d\n\nKim Jong Un sent his younger sister, Kim Yo Jong, to the opening ceremony as part of the North Korean delegation, which is led by Kim Yong Nam, president of North Korea\u2019s parliament. The unprecedented visit marked the first time an immediate member of the Kim family has been to South Korea. It\u2019s not clear if any of the North Korean representatives will meet Pence or other U.S. officials at the Olympics, though they were seated near each other at the opening ceremony. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to see what happens,\u201d U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said when asked about it on Monday, according to Reuters.\n\nMeanwhile, President Trump and Kim Jong Un were represented at the opening ceremony by two impersonators in the stands, who caused a stir and were asked to leave.\n\nImpersonators of Donald Trump and Kim Jong Un pose during the Opening Ceremony of the PyeongChang 2018 Winter Olympic Games at PyeongChang Olympic Stadium on Feb. 9, 2018.
