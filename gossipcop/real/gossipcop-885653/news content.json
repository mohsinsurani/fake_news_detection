The due date is March 1st, [Robin\u2019s late father] Alan\u2019s birthday!\u201d\n\nGeary shared the message alongside a photo of her sonogram, which was dated Aug. 14.\n\nThicke, 40, is already dad to 7-year-old Julian Fuego, his son with ex-wife Paula Patton.\n\nThe parents-to-be started dating in the months following Thicke\u2019s separation from Patton in February 2014, and the couple made their first public appearance together at the Cannes Film Festival in May 2015, just over a year after they started dating.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Baby on the Way for Robin Thicke and April Love Geary \u2014 Due on Alan\u2019s Birthday!\n\nPatton, 41, filed for divorce from Thicke in October 2014 and in March 2015, their divorce was finalized. Earlier this year, the former couple were embroiled in a lengthy custody dispute, which has since been resolved.\n\nEarlier this summer, legal documents were filed stating Julian will spend Monday through Wednesday with Thicke and Wednesday through Friday with Patton during the school year. During the summer, they will alternate physical custody of Julian on a \u201cweek on/week off schedule.\u201d\n\nLester Cohen/WireImage\n\nJulian will also alternate weekends between his parents, and expenses \u2014 including fees for private school \u2014 will be shared between the former spouses.\n\n\u201cThe parties are ordered to share in all major decisions concerning the minor child\u2019s health, education and welfare including, but without limitation, schooling, religion, medical care and enrichment activities,\u201d stated the papers.", "images":
