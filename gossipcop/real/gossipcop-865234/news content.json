'The saga played out in front of the tens of millions who follow the pair on social media.\n\nChyna\u2019s lawyer has now said she may be preparing for a legal battle and is considering all options at her disposal.\n\n\u201cWe are considering all legal options and recourses at this time,\u201d Chyna\u2019s lawyer, Walter Mosley, told ABC.\n\nIn California, where Kardashian lives, revenge porn is a criminal offence and it is illegal to intentionally distribute \"the image of the intimate body part or parts of another identifiable person\u201d.\n\nThe penalty is up to six months in prison and a $1,000 (\u00a3770) fine. A number of legal experts have said Kardashian may have potentially violated the state's revenge porn laws.\n\nLisa Bloom, the women's rights lawyer who represented Mischa Barton in her recent successful civil suit against an ex to prevent revenge-porn images of her from being released, weighed in on the furore on Twitter, saying: \"Note to Rob Kardashian: revenge porn is a crime. And in my Mischa Barton case judge agreed it's a form of domestic violence. Knock it off\".\n\nIn October 2013, the California Governor signed a bill outlawing so-called revenge porn and levying possible prison time for those who post naked photos of their ex-partners. In 2014, the first person was convicted and sentenced to a year in prison for violating the law.\n\nAccess unlimited streaming of movies and TV shows with Amazon Prime Video Sign up now for a 30-day free trial Sign up\n\nThe former couple, who have a daughter called Dream, announced their engagement last April.\n\nKim Kardashian at Paris Fashion Week Show all 7 1 /7 Kim Kardashian at Paris Fashion Week Kim Kardashian at Paris Fashion Week Kim Kardashian in the front row Givenchy show, Spring Summer 2017, Paris Fashion Week, France - 02 Oct 2016 Rex Features Kim Kardashian at Paris Fashion Week Kim Kardashian and Kris Jenner attend the Givenchy show as part of the Paris Fashion Week Womenswear Spring/Summer 2017 on October 2, 2016 in Paris, France.
