It was perfect.\u201d\n\nThe bride wore two dresses for her big day: During the ceremony she opted for a Milady-designed mermaid gown, which featured bling everywhere, and for the reception, she changed into a Lena Bernisha-designed dress with a detachable train.\n\n\u201cI wanted to be able to dance the night away,\u201d Roberts told Us.\n\nTheir beach-glam wedding also featured lots of candles and gold touches.\n\n\u201cEverything is very formal beach glamour, it\u2019s a beach wedding, but still very glam,\u201d Roberts told Us of her vision. \u201cLots of bling, candles everywhere and gold touches.\u201d\n\nThe couple got engaged during a November 2016 episode of the hit E! show.\n\nSeason 2 of WAGS Miami premieres on E! on June 29.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/wags-miami-stars-ashley-nicole-roberts-and-philip-wheeler-are-married-w482173/", "title": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 Stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler Are Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler said \u2018I do\u2019 on Sunday, May 14 \u2014 all the exclusive wedding details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 Stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler Are Married!", "description": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler said \u2018I do\u2019 on Sunday, May 14 \u2014 all the exclusive wedding details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/wags-miami-stars-ashley-nicole-roberts-and-philip-wheeler-are-married-w482173/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:06:08+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-05-14T22:41:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:06:08+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 Stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler Are Married!", "description": "\u2018WAGS Miami\u2019 stars Ashley Nicole Roberts and Philip Wheeler said \u2018I do\u2019 on Sunday, May 14 \u2014 all the exclusive wedding details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/philip-wheeler-ashley-nicole-roberts-zoom-d7a5d342-6e91-44f2-8bf8-1266a017e6f2.jpg?crop=89px%2C1px%2C543px%2C285px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494801717.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
