The caption: \u201cTinder profile: Hi I\u2019m Lili. I\u2019m 21, a Virgo, Cali-Girl ???? And I have cystic acne. Hmu.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Ruby Rose Opens Up About Battling Adult Acne In Emotional Instagram Post\n\nLili Reinhart\n\nHer condition, cystic acne, is the most severe form of acne, according to the Mayo Clinic. It happens when oil and dead skin cells build up deep within hair follicles, causing large, festering bumps under the skin that can\u2019t be popped. They\u2019re generally caused by hormones and P.acnes, the bacteria that can cause acne. (And it can be painful AF). It sucks, but thankfully, Lili\u2019s got a sense of humour about it.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time Lili has opened up about her cystic acne. Last fall, the 21-year-old shared her skin-care routine on her Instagram stories, including her favourite go-to face mask (which is only $9 on Amazon!) and exfoliating peel.\n\nAnd she\u2019s not the only Hollywood star who has this struggle. Kendall Jenner told a fan to \u201cnever let that sh*t stop you!\u201d after appearing on the Golden Globes red carpet with acne in January. And in a recent Instagram Story, Justin Bieber declared that \u201cpimples are in\u201d with a photo of himself with a sprinkle of zits across his forehead.\n\nRELATED: Kendall Jenner Had The Perfect Response When Her Acne Was Attacked At The Golden Globes\n\nIt\u2019s refreshing to see a celeb share their not-so-perfect skin on social media (proof that in some ways, they\u2019re still just like us). Lili\u2019s post is a reminder that acne is a fact of life for many of us\u2014and it\u2019s nothing to be ashamed of.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Women\u2019s Health US", "images": ["https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/megan-thee-stallion-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/29093110_251525088723647_1640614577211179008_n.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lili-reinhart.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/kourtney-kardashian-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Tranquility-Awaits-All-About-Eden-Health-Retreat-1.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/LEAD-Womens_health_1500x1000_02-1080x675.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Elizabeth-Olsen-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/blonde-4-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=438578727656748&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Jesinta-Franklin-Announced-As-Seafollys-Newest-Global-Ambassador-1-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/selena-gomez-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Untitled-design-1-1080x675.png", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/10100655M006_AC_F_3-1080x675.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lili-reinhart-instagram-stories-tinder-1523288460.jpeg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/WH-Logo.png", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/kourtney-1080x675.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/blake-lively-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/and-just-like-that-1080x675.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/hailey-bieber-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Breast-Cancer-Genetics-3-1080x675.png", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/coffee-1080x675.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/shutterstock_592297733-copy-1080x675.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/maxresdefault-1024x683.jpg", "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Wellness-Boosting-Foods-That-Are-Perfect-For-Work-Day-Lunches-And-Snacks-1080x675.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lili-reinhart.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Wh Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/lili-reinhart-cystic-acne/", "title": "\u2018Riverdale\u2019 Star Lili Reinhart Just Shared A Hilarious Selfie Of Her Cystic Acne", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kudos for keeping it real.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Riverdale' Star Lili Reinhart Just Shared A Hilarious Selfie Of Her Cystic Acne", "description": "Kudos for keeping it real.", "url": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/lili-reinhart-cystic-acne/", "site_name": "Women's Health", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/lili-reinhart.jpg", "width": 150, "height": 150, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-10T11:17:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-09-02T02:25:01+00:00"}, "author": "WH Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "WH Staff"}, "generator": "Netamorphose v.4.17.4.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=2.0, user-scalable=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/cropped-WH_LOGO_SHORT-270x270.jpg"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523359043.0, "source": "https://www.womenshealth.com.au", "summary": ""}
