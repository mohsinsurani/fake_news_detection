In February 2018, Klum played a game of Who Would You Rather? on the Ellen DeGeneres Show, where she ultimately chose Drake over a handful of other celebrity heartthrobs. The \"In My Feelings\" rapper apparently took note, as Klum revealed on her next visit to the show in September that he later got her number through a mutual friend \u2014 but she had already met her now-husband, Tom Kaulitz. \"He was basically a week too late,\" she said at the time. \"I never texted him back because I found the love of my life.\" Klum later told DeGeneres in January 2019 that she did eventually apologize to Drake for ghosting him, but in response, \"he just made that face,\" Klum explained, mimicking a raised-eyebrow emoji.\n\n03 of 15 Bella Hadid ALBERTO PIZZOLI/AFP/Getty After the rapper released his album, Scorpion, rumors began swirling that Drake and Hadid had a secret relationship, thanks to lyrics on his song \"Finesse,\" which reference flying to New York to see a special someone, as \"Fashion weeks is more your thing than mine.\" Later in the song, he raps, \"You stay on my mind/You and your sister too hot to handle.\" (Drake also name-drops Hadid's father, Mohammed, on another track, \"Sandra's Rose.\") However, after a Twitter user commented that Hadid had \"probably\" hooked up with the rapper, she shot down the rumors, tweeting, \"Not me!!! That's disrespectful. WHY CANT PPL BE FRIENDS W/o all the insinuation.\"\n\n04 of 15 Sophie Brussaux Sophie Brussaux/Instagram Drake confirmed that Brussaux \u2014 a French artist and former adult film star \u2014 was the mother of his son, Adonis, on the track \"March 14.\" The rapper implied that he had only seen Brussaux \"two times\" on the song \u2014 the pair were spotted out in November 2016 and then January 2017 in Europe \u2014 before she got pregnant, and that they are not together. He also revealed that their relationship was strained, rapping, \"They said that in two weeks you\u2019re supposed to come in town/Hopefully \u2026 Me and your mother will have come around/Instead of always cuttin\u2019 each other down.\" Brussaux has remained mostly silent on her relationship with Drake, though she recently changed her Instagram bio in the wake of the news. It previously read \"Mother of Adonis <3 Would love my privacy in this moment.\"\n\n05 of 15 Rosalyn Gold-Onwude Kristina Bumphrey/StarPix/REX/Shutterstock While they never confirmed or denied their status, Drake arrived at the June 2017 NBA Awards alongside Rosalyn \"Ros\" Gold-Onwude, an NBA sideline reporter most recently with the Golden State Warriors. The two bonded over basketball in late 2015 but \"the first thing was the connection because we\u2019re both black and Jewish,\u201d she told Respect Mag. \"We have that in common.\"\n\n06 of 15 Nicki Minaj John Shearer/BBMA2017/Getty Romance rumors have swirled around the two for as long as they've been collaborating, which is to say: a long time. (How could you not think there was something there after that \"Anaconda\" lap dance??) Their friendship was strained since the Drake/Meek Mill beef of 2015, but the pair reunited in February 2017 and made up completely in May 2017. \"I\u2019m so glad we found our way back because I love you,\" Drake told Minaj from the Billboard Awards stage. In October 2019, Minaj announced she'd married boyfriend Kenneth Petty.\n\n07 of 15 Jennifer Lopez Source: Drake Instagram Back when they were rumored to be a thing, the singers took to their respective Instagram accounts to post the same cuddly pic \u2014 sans caption. \"They seem to really like and respect each other, but it's early,\" an insider told PEOPLE. \"Where it goes, we shall see. Friends of them both are hoping it becomes something, but it's too early to say more than that.\" Lopez has long moved on from the apparent fling, though \u2014 the Hustlers star began dating Alex Rodriguez in March 2017, and the pair are now engaged.\n\n08 of 15 Taylor Swift Source: Drake/Instagram Collaboration rumors were at an all-time high when the \"Style\" singer attended Drake's 30th birthday party in late October 2016. While the pair stressed they were just friends, they did come together once more when the rapper debuted his Apple Music commercial of himself lip synching to Swift's \"Bad Blood\" while at the gym.\n\n09 of 15 Hailey Baldwin Jacopo Raule/GC Images 'Belieb' it or not ... Drake and Baldwin were spotted at Los Angeles hotspot The Nice Guy back in the day, a source told PEOPLE. \"Drake and Hailey are dating super casually, but he is really into her. They met through mutual friends and are taking things slow,\" the source said back in June 2016. (Baldwin does have a thing for vocally gifted Canadians \u2014 she even married one, in case you missed it.)\n\n10 of 15 Rihanna Splash News In May 2016, sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Rihanna and Drake had been \"secretly dating for months.\" The longtime friends and collaborators have always fueled romance rumors (because their chemistry is an actual crime), so this was a massive victory for Drihanna shippers. Two years later, however, Rihanna told Vogue the pair were no longer involved romantically ... or platonically, really. \"We don\u2019t have a friendship now, but we\u2019re not enemies either,\" the hitmaker said. \"It is what it is.\"\n\n11 of 15 Serena Williams Getty(2) Despite months of romance rumors and reports, a rep for Williams told PEOPLE that the tennis star and Drake were \"simply longtime friends.\" The two were first rumored to be involved romantically after they were spotted dining together at a Cincinnati restaurant, and then Drake was seen cheering Williams on at the Western & Southern Open. When asked at a July 2015 press conference whether Drake was her \"lucky charm,\" Williams replied, \"We've been friends for, like, so many years ... Just like family.\" Williams is now happily married to Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian and mom to the couple's adorable daughter, Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr.\n\n12 of 15 Tyra Banks Anthony Behar/Sipa \"I went on a date with her one time, yeah,\" Drake told Ellen DeGeneres in 2013. \"We went to Disneyland in disguise actually, which was fun. I don't know if it was a date. It was a get-together. We're close as well.\" They're so close, in fact, that the supermodel starred as Drake's girlfriend in the music video for his single \"Child's Play,\" which gave us this gratifyingly explosive scene.\n\n13 of 15 Kat Dennings Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic The rapper also told DeGeneres about his feelings for Dennings, who most recently dated Josh Groban. \"I just always had a huge crush on Kat Dennings, and she was kind enough one night to oblige me and we went out for dinner,\" he revealed in 2013.\n\n14 of 15 Zo\u00eb Kravitz Michael Loccisano/Getty When asked by Complex in 2015 if she and Drake were dating, Kravitz said they were just very good friends \u2026 then added, \"I'm very flirtatious. [But] he's family to me. He's a really, really awesome dude.\" (The feeling is mutual: Drake has said, \"Zo\u00eb Kravitz is like one of my favorite people in the world.\")", "images":
