'Oh Gabe Kaplan was here.' 'You guys! I cultivate my look to look like him!'\"\n\nAs for why you have absolutely no memory of the sketch in question, \"It got zero laughs,\" explained Ferrell.", "images": ["https://www.tvguide.com/a/img/hub/2017/06/30/5b7da22b-8862-4513-87ef-008592bcaa39/willferrell-news.png", "https://www.tvguide.com/a/img/resize/dac11cd2640f3874cb11cc475031222f3e6e111e/hub/2017/10/09/2e307b7c-e939-4e19-8acd-859a42614342/unnamed.jpg?auto=webp&height=84&width=84"], "top_img": "https://www.tvguide.com/a/img/hub/2017/06/30/5b7da22b-8862-4513-87ef-008592bcaa39/willferrell-news.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sadie Gennis", "June", "A.M.
