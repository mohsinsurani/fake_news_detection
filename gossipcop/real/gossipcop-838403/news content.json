Gwendoline Christie, Riki Lindhome, Jamie McShane, and Percy Hynes White also star, while Catherine Zeta-Jones and Luis Guzm\u00e1n will recur as Morticia and Gomez Addams, respectively.

(It was later remade in America by Stephen King, but not successfully.) But if Lynch could bring Peaks back for another round, why can't von Trier do the same with The Kingdom? And so we have Exodus, a third (and said to be final) set of five episodes, all directed by von Trier and featuring a mix of old and new faces (including, respectively, Udo Kier and Alexander Skarsgard), with the latter group mostly replacements for actors who have died since the prior miniseries. This time, the director gets, well, \"meta\" as he opens the series with a woman angered by watching that previous Kingdom season and winds up entering the hellish hospital herself. Episodes tream weekly, and if you have yet to see the original two seasons, those hard-to-find episodes will also begin streaming on MUBI on November 13 (for season 1) and November 20 (for the second season).\n\n\u25a3 Krapopolis Clip Animation/Comedy tbd\n\nSpecial sneak preview of the new Dan Harmon animated series (set in the world of Greek mythology) that will make its proper series debut in early 2023.\n\nTUE / November 29\n\nReindeer in Here Animation/Family 9p\n\nWED / November 30\n\nIrreverent Drama Peacock\n\nThis 10-episode Australian drama (actually a co-production with Netflix, though it's a Peacock exclusive in America) centers on a Chicago criminal played by Colin Donnell (Chicago Med).
