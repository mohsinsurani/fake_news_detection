From her natural complexion to her perfectly Parisian-chic strands, there\u2019s very little the beauty can\u2019t teach us in the way of beauty mastery.\n\nIn an interview with Into The Gloss, Wilde shares her skincare and beauty routine and it\u2019s as raw and real as she is in the best way possible. From confessing she\u2019s an eyebrow perfectionist after \u201c15 years of baldness\u201d to sharing her love for girly-girl clich\u00e9s, Wilde is totally relatable and just like us. Below, every skincare and beauty tip we\u2019re pocking (and purchasing) from the It-girl herself.\n\n1. Her skincare routine is a ritual\n\nWhen Olivia Wilde says your skincare routine needs to be more than just a routine and rather, a ritual \u2013 you nod and take note. Wilde shared, \u201cMy skincare routine is like a ritual \u2013 one that gives me as much emotional comfort as physical.\u201d\n\nShe continues, \u201cI was my face with [face wash] to keep acne at bay. Then I follow with face oil. I apply my face oil in a way that actually feels more like a face massage than anything else.\u201d\n\n2. Skin care is a non-negotiable, no matter how pushed for time you may be.\n\nWhile easily pushed down (read: completely discarded) on the priority list when in a rush, Wilde preaches the importance of skin care \u2013 even if it means making switches that work for an on-the-go lifestyle. \u201cOverall, my beauty approach is low key, but thoughtful,\u201d Wilde says. She continues, \u201cIf I\u2019m leaving a workout, and am too lazy to shower, I used face wipes to clean my skin as I hop on the subway. They clean and moisturise, which is very helpful.\u201d\n\n3 .Beauty isn\u2019t about striving for perfection, it\u2019s about having fun with it.\n\nTrying new products and playing with make-up should be both fun and enjoyable. If there\u2019s anyone who uses make-up to enhance her features without taking away from her natural beauty, it\u2019s Wilde.\n\n\u201cWhether I'm going to a meeting or a bar, I feel like a superhero changing in a phone booth. I don\u2019t strive for perfection, but I have gotten to know my face well enough that I don't need to spend lots of time on my make-up routine. I just have fun with it. It's amazing what a little eyeliner and some good lipstick can do.\u201d\n\nCheck and check \u2013 a little eyeliner and some good lipstick it is, then.\n\n4. Be kind and conscious of what you put on and in your body.\n\n\u201cSince having kids, my relationship to health and beauty has become much more thoughtful. I used to slather anything on my skin and not care what it was made out of. I've always loved the decadence of beauty products, but at the point when I first started having children\u2014when I was suddenly responsible for another living being\u2014I became conscious of what I was putting on and in my body. I wish we would be more conscious when it's just for ourselves,\u201d Olivia shares. And duly noted.\n\n5. Treat yourself from time to time \u2013 whether it be a manicure or an Epsom salt-filled bath.\n\n\u201cI also love a good mani-pedi as much as the next gal\u2014unless the next gal is Kim Kardashian, because in my imagination she sleeps with her fingers in individual silk pillowcases. I also love baths. I don't care how clich\u00e9 it is. I am a woman who loves a hot, Epsom salt-filled bath.\u201d\n\nBe right back, we\u2019re just taking time out to practice our new ritual.", "images":
