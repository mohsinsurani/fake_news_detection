She was then taken through the property by the gang as they proceeded to steal the rapper\u2019s possessions.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBefore making their getaway, the gang attempted to take a locked safe from the residence. However, they decided not to take it, and instead left it on a nearby pavement before fleeing the scene.\n\nThe rapper\u2019s relative is not believed to have been physically harmed by the gang, but it is thought that the gang deliberately targeted Rocky\u2019s house for the raid.\n\nRocky has yet to publicly respond to the robbery.\n\nEarlier this week, a new A$AP Rocky track was premiered on Frank Ocean\u2019s Beats 1 radio show, \u2018Blonded\u2019. Entitled \u2018RAF\u2019, the song \u2013 which debuted in two different versions \u2013 features contributions from Migos MC Quavo, Lil Uzi Vert, Playboi Carti and Ocean himself.", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-672054176-696x442.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-672054176.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-672054176.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sam Moore"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/aap-rocky-home-burgled-1-million-robbery-2073249", "title": "A$AP Rocky\u2019s home reportedly burgled in $1 million robbery", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Harlem rapper's residence in LA was the target of the crime, which occurred last night (May 16)", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "A$AP Rocky's home reportedly burgled in $1 million robbery", "description": "The Harlem rapper's residence in LA was the target of the crime, which occurred last night (May 16)", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/aap-rocky-home-burgled-1-million-robbery-2073249", "site_name": "NME", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-672054176.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "published_time": "2017-05-17T18:23:42+00:00"}, "author": "Sam Moore", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nme", "site": "@nme", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Sam Moore", "label2": "Estimated reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495045422.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
