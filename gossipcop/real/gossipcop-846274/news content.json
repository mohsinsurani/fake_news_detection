Following Jolie's divorce filing in September, the two engaged in a bitter custody battle before eventually smoothing things out. How did they go from enemies to friends in such a short time?\n\nAccording to E! News, things went downhill after Pitt was accused of child abuse stemming from an incident on a private plane with his oldest son, Maddox. The allegations created a lot of buzz in the media and led to an investigation by the FBI and the Los Angeles Department of Children and Family Services. Pitt was also accused of having a drinking problem and cheating on Jolie with Marion Cotillard, his co-star on the film Allied.\n\nAlthough the failed marriage appeared shockingly sudden, inside sources claimed the couple had been experiencing issues for a long time.\n\n\"Things had been volatile in their relationship for a little while. They had crazy fights and wouldn't speak for a bit. They would take some time apart, go on location, calm down and miss each other,\" an insider shared. \"But, no matter how bad it got, Brad, especially, was never planning on walking away. Every so often, Angelina threatened divorce, but in Brad's eyes, their lives were stressful because they were raising six kids, things were always going to work out.\"\n\nPitt was eventually cleared of the abuse allegations, but not before suffering significant damage to his public image. To make matters worse, the two were fighting a nasty custody battle that granted Pitt only supervised visits with his six children. The situation didn't turn around until 2016 came to a close.\n\nJolie was spotted in Cambodia promoting her film, First They Killed My Father, in February. The actress took all six children for the trip and finally talked about the split for the first time. In her emotional interview, Jolie admitted that the breakup had been hard on the family but assured everyone that they were working things out.\n\n\"We are and forever will be a family. And so that is how I'm coping. I'm coping with finding a way through to make sure this somehow makes us stronger and closer,\" she said.\n\nFollowing Jolie's telling interview, insiders revealed that Brad Pitt was actually in Cambodia with the kids while Jolie was promoting the film. The actor secretly traveled to the country so that he could spend time with the brood, signaling a major shift in his relationship with Jolie.\n\n\"They have made some progress and are taking small steps in the right direction. Both are in agreement on putting the kids first. So that part of the equation is better,\" an insider revealed.\n\nPitt's relationship with Jolie is far from perfect, but it has come a long way since September. Although he was accused of abusing his oldest son, sources claim that Pitt has patched up they relationship and things couldn't be better.\n\n\"The kids have always adored Brad and have a very solid relationship with him,\" a source explained.", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/5ed34468ceaaad942f0b4277ee61d2b2?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/570c1285-665e-4cb1-ab3e-2c7358094af1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e494db4a-e9aa-4be6-a73c-2041f4691eb1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5d5cf9e5-a519-4c4c-a12e-46eff7aecb30.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4200803/how-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-went-from-volatile-enemies-to-working-it-out/", "title": "How Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Went From 'Volatile' Enemies To 'Working It Out'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Went From 'Volatile' Enemies To 'Working It Out'", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4200803/how-brad-pitt-and-angelina-jolie-went-from-volatile-enemies-to-working-it-out/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "How Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Went From 'Volatile' Enemies To 'Working It Out'", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-05-07 09:42:44Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "How Brad Pitt And Angelina Jolie Went From 'Volatile' Enemies To 'Working It Out'", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494150164.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
