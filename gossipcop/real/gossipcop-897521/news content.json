She left Washington in an all-black outfit with pieces from Chanel and Dolce & Gabbana, marking the formal end of her FLOTUS fashion.\n\nBut her post-Washington style was equally as strong. When she hopped on a plane that same day to head to Florida, she had a mid-flight outfit change. On board, Melania slipped into a $3,700 hexagon-print Gucci dress, which she paired with black pumps and her go-to black sunglasses.\n\nHere at Stylish, we kept tabs on Melania\u2019s most fashion-forward moments both at home and abroad through her term as FLOTUS and beyond. Keep scrolling to see her best looks!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Melania-Trump-Rings-in-the-New-Year-Wearing-Givenchy-Dress-FB.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/Melania-Trump-Belted-Trench-Dress-Promo.jpg?w=1300&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Melania-Trump-Rings-in-the-New-Year-Wearing-Givenchy-Dress-FB.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meg Storm", "Roxanne Adamiyatt", "Cristina Gibson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/melania-trumps-most-stylish-first-lady-moments-w498714/", "title": "Melania Trump\u2019s Most Stylish First Lady Moments", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "gallery", "post-tags": "Celebrity Fashion,Celebrity Style,stylish", "post-cats": "Stylish", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "First Lady Melania Trump made an appearance in a Delpozo midi dress on Sunday, August 20 \u2014 see more of her most stylish looks here", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Melania Trump Rings in the New Year Wearing a $4,740 Givenchy Dress", "description": "See the fresh look the former model opted for and more of her most fashionable milestones as First Lady!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/pictures/melania-trumps-most-stylish-first-lady-moments-w498714/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-04-29T13:18:41+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Melania-Trump-Rings-in-the-New-Year-Wearing-Givenchy-Dress-FB.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Melania-Trump-Rings-in-the-New-Year-Wearing-Givenchy-Dress-FB.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2021-04-28T21:00:56+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-04-29T13:18:41+00:00"}, "author": "Meg Storm", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Melania Trump Rings in the New Year Wearing a $4,740 Givenchy Dress", "description": "See the fresh look the former model opted for and more of her most fashionable milestones as First Lady!", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Melania-Trump-Rings-in-the-New-Year-Wearing-Givenchy-Dress-T.jpg?w=1024&h=512&crop=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1619643656.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
