He made it to the front of her house when Kris' private security detail pounced on the guy and held him until cops arrived.\n\nWe're told Jacobs has repeatedly busted into the development to get at Kris since he was fired from his security job with the gated community.\n\nAnd our sources say when Jacobs was apprehended cops say he had a sign-in sheet that security uses. They believe he stole it and we're told it's likely he'll also be charged with theft.", "images": ["https://imagez.tmz.com/image/3f/4by3/2022/10/07/3f3c92b2700643b9bd01f19f529b56da_md.jpg",
