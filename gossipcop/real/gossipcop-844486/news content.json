His latest trick? Calling his favorite frenemy Matt Damon to make another farcical ad about United. This time, Damon provides the voice-over, which goes well until he goes off-script.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re United Airlines. We work hard to get you safely to your destination, and that\u2019s why we\u2014you know what, no. I can\u2019t do this anymore. Because I know what it\u2019s like to get bumped. Trust me, I\u2019ve been getting bumped from Jimmy\u2019s show for the last year, and it takes a toll.\u201d\n\nDamon starts delivering a righteous speech about treating people with dignity, when all of a sudden his voice-over stops. He\u2019s being pulled off the plane where he chose to record his speech. And he\u2019s being bumped by none other than Kimmel himself.\n\nDamon and Kimmel\u2019s feud goes back more than a decade\u2014to a time when Kimmel first ended a disappointing show by saying, facetiously, that he hadn\u2019t had time to welcome Matt Damon that night, because \u201cwe ran out of time.\u201d As Kimmel works to wring the last bit of juice out of the United fiasco\u2014which he had the privilege of mocking almost exclusively last week, as all the daily late-night hosts but him and Conan O\u2019Brien were in reruns\u2014it only makes sense that he\u2019d bring out the big guns.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63345fe8aecc7e6debb40b59/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined",
