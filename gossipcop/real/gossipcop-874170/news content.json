News for the Reunion Road Trip: Return to the Jersey Shore airing Aug. 20, Snooki reveals the two got into a fight the last time they saw each other.\n\n\"He was an a--hole. But Mike was like, 'I'm going to do a reunion with the cast, are you down?' You can't pass that up. You gotta go,\" she said.\n\nWith their first time back together in nearly half a decade, it doesn't take long for the two to descend into some awkward territory when Polizzi remembers to take her birth control \u2014 except, she gets her days mixed up.\n\n\"No, today is Friday,\" Sorrentino reminds her as she realizes her error.\n\n\"Oh s--t! Then I took an extra pill out,\" she complains. \"Oh my God! I'm gonna lose the pill and I'm gonna have a baby.\"\n\nIn an interview segment for the series, Sorrentino says his co-star has not changed one bit and fans will realize, he's right.\n\nCheekily, Polizzi says she will have to hide her pills somewhere, quipping, \"Where did you used to hide your pills?\"\n\nWith a cut to his interview, Sorrentino scoffs that \"she has no filter.\"\n\nBack in the car, Polizzi reminiscences with her co-star about a time that he might not have wanted to recall.\n\n\"Remember you drank so much that your penis was out and you didn't even know it?\" she said. \"How many women do you think you've slept with?\"\n\nBut Sorrentino isn't one to kiss and tell, at least anymore and sneakily dodges the question, but replies, \"It was just a lot...It was a lot.\"\n\nHowever, Polizzi is definitely not letting him off the hook, asking, \"Over a thousand, you think?\"\n\nWatch Reunion Road Trip: Return To the Jersey Shore Sunday, Aug. 20 at 9:30 p.m., only on E!", "images": ["https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"], "top_img": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/nicole-snooki-polizzi-mike-situation-sorrentino-mtv-reunion/", "title": "Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi Creates an Awkward Situation for Mike Sorrentino on 'Reunion Road Trip'", "meta_data": {"description": "It\u2019s not a Jersey Shore reunion without an awkward moment between Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d [...]", "keywords": "MTV,Jersey Shore,Mike The Situation Sorrentino,Snooki", "news_keywords": "MTV,Jersey Shore,Mike The Situation Sorrentino,Snooki", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "PopCulture", "creator": "PopCulture", "title": "Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi Creates an Awkward Situation for Mike Sorrentino on 'Reunion Road Trip'", "description": "It\u2019s not a Jersey Shore reunion without an awkward moment between Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d [...]", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"}, "og": {"title": "Nicole 'Snooki' Polizzi Creates an Awkward Situation for Mike Sorrentino on 'Reunion Road Trip'", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/reality-tv/news/nicole-snooki-polizzi-mike-situation-sorrentino-mtv-reunion/", "image": {"identifier": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Reality TV", "description": "It\u2019s not a Jersey Shore reunion without an awkward moment between Mike \u201cThe Situation\u201d [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#263240", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503097200.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
