Located in south-central Houston, the neighborhood was notorious for crime and had an impact on a young Webster, \"Growing up, my grandmother stayed in the 'hood so I seen random crazy shit. [I saw] mad bums and crazy spazzed out motherfuckers, I saw people looking weird, hungry, and grimey [sic]. I was always like, 'I gotta get the fuck out this shit.' It gave me my edge\u2014[it made me] who I am right now.\"[12] Webster moved to Missouri City, a middle-class suburban area bordering southwest Houston, to live with his parents. His mother worked for Apple and his father ran his own business.[13] Webster's father is also a soul musician and his grandfather was a jazz composer.[14] Webster attended Elkins High School and graduated at seventeen.[15] During high school, he participated in musical theater.[16] Webster then attended the University of Texas at San Antonio, before dropping out his second year to fully pursue his music career.[17][18]\n\nCareer\n\n2008\u20132012: Career beginnings and record deals\n\nWebster formed a duo with his longtime friend Chris Holloway known as The Graduates.

His parents cut him off financially and he eventually was forced to relocate back to Houston, where his parents kicked him out of their home.

At Lollapalooza in 2015, Scott was charged and arrested for disorderly conduct after inciting concertgoers to ignore security and rush the stage.[155] That same year, at the Openair Festival in Switzerland, he encouraged fans to attack a man who took his shoe while he was crowd-surfing, by stopping the concert and repeatedly telling the crowd to \"fuck him up\", while also spitting on him.[156]\n\nIn 2017, he was arrested for similar conduct to his Lollapalooza behavior after a performance in Northwest Arkansas.[157] That same year, a fan sued Scott and the organizers of a 2017 concert at Terminal 5 in Manhattan after falling from a balcony and being dragged on stage, blaming the fall on a crowd surge.[158] In 2019, three people were trampled and injured as a crowd rushed to enter the compound at Astroworld.[159][160]\n\nAstroworld Festival crowd crush\n\nOn November 5, 2021, at least ten people died and hundreds were injured in a crowd crush moving toward the stage during Scott's performance at the Astroworld Festival in NRG Park in his hometown of Houston, Texas.[9] On the first night, a crowd crush occurred, resulting in the deaths of at least nine people and the cancellation of the second night of the festival.[8][161][7] In video footage of the incident, Scott is seen doing the following: continuing to perform despite chants from the crowd pleading for him to stop; observing at least one audience member had been hurt, then ordering security for a brief moment to \"help, jump in real quick, keep going\", only to continue with the rest of the show for the following hour; encouraging people to \"get wild\" and \"crazy\", despite an ambulance passing through the crowd that was pulling out lifeless bodies.[162][163] Victims killed range from 9 to 27 years old.[164]\n\nIn the aftermath of the crush, news outlets highlighted Scott's history of dangerous disregard for audience safety. Rolling Stone featured a statement from a fan who had been paralyzed during a 2017 show;[165] The New York Times took note of Scott's 2015 guilty plea for reckless endangerment after he encouraged fans to climb security barricades;[166] a Los Angeles Times article contained analysis by safety experts arguing that the deaths were preventable.[167] Among other points of criticism was the fact that Scott halted his performance in 2015 when an audience member stole his shoe, ordering the crowd to beat up the person responsible.[168] Shortly after, a lawsuit was announced by the concertgoers. It was started by Kristian Paredes, who filed for $1,000,000 due to the injuries he received.\n\nDiscography\n\nStudio albums\n\nFilmography\n\nAwards and nominations\n\nGrammy Awards\n\nThe Grammy Awards are awarded annually by the National Academy of Recording Arts and Sciences.
