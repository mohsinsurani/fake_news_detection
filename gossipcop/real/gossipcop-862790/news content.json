(The sweet caption also refers to the online fitness business Giancola and Biscardi launched together in January, The Strength Spot.)\n\nGiancola, 31, recently revealed she opted out of the MTV reboot to focus on her businesses and her relationship \u2014 and avoid \u201cpotentially toxic situations,\u201d presumably referring to her ex and former costar Ronnie Ortiz-Magro, 32. (Their tumultuous on-again, off-again relationship lasted eight years, three of which were captured on the original run of Jersey Shore from 2009-12)\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jersey Shore Cast Reveals Why Night Out with Snooki Might Just \u2018Kill You\u2019\n\nOf course, much of last week\u2019s two-hour season premiere focused on her absence, with quite a few jokes being made at her expense \u2014 mostly stemming from the fact that Pauly \u201cDJ Pauly D\u201d DelVecchio brought in a custom, life-size doll wearing an \u201cI\u2019m in a really good place\u201d shirt and designed to look and talk just like her. (\u201cRahhhhhnnnn! Staaaaahhhhp!\u201c)\n\nDuring the premiere, Ortiz-Magro also admitted to cheating on Giancola after they moved in together after Jersey Shore.\n\nBut Biscardi has his girlfriend\u2019s back. Last Thursday, he took to Instagram to dedicate a sweet, supportive post in her honor ahead of the premiere.\n\n\u201cIn today\u2019s world, it\u2019s nearly impossible to come across someone with the elegance and class that this person does (not me, the pretty one on the left),\u201d he captioned a selfie of the two. \u201cShe truly has the biggest heart out of anyone I have ever met and deserves all of the good things in life. So, here\u2019s a #tbt of my hair and my best friend.\u201d\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays (8 p.m. ET) on MTV.", "images":
