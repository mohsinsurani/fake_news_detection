For all their enduring love, respect and friendship, Jen and Ben have not yet reached the \u201cwhy don\u2019t you bring your girlfriend to Thanksgiving\u201d stage of their partnership. Not many exes have, or ever do.\n\nGwyneth and Chris, however, are just one big, growing happy family.\n\nPhotos\n\nStars Celebrate Thanksgiving 2018\n\nWhile they have spent Thanksgiving together in one form or another since their split, last year Paltrow\u2019s then-rumored fianc\u00e9 (and now husband) Brad Falchuk joined the party\u2014and this year, Martin\u2019s girlfriend, Dakota Johnson, made for another plate around the immaculately set table.\n\nInstagram\n\n\u201cGwyneth thinks she is lovely,\u201d a source tells E! News. \u201cShe gets on very well with her and is happy for Chris\u2026Especially on holidays, Gwyneth wants nothing more than to be one big happy family and for her kids to be able to celebrate with both of their parents.\u201d\n\nThat\u2019s a far cry from the old trope of backbiting exes who can\u2019t be in the same room together, let alone warmly embrace and break bread with the current person in their former person\u2019s life. But don\u2019t worry, in case you\u2019re wondering why you\u2019d rather tell your ex he can stuff if than share stuffing with his new girlfriend, it\u2019s not as if these families arrived at this happy place overnight.\n\nIt\u2019s understandable that Paltrow\u2014whose bread is buttered with gratitude and open-mindedness\u2014might be more open to this scenario than some others, but going by her and other famous celebrity exes\u2019 behavior when it comes to large gatherings, certain parameters do apply.\n\nPhotos\n\nFriendly Celebrity Exes\n\nFor instance, most parents don\u2019t just bring anyone around their kids\u2014or their exes, for that matter.\n\nNeither Garner nor Affleck, who will be spending at least part of the holidays together with their three kids in Montana, have been in a relationship that was serious enough to prompt a melding of the families. Affleck ex Lindsay Shookus, the only S.O. he dated for a significant amount of time, had a daughter of her own to spend time with, and Garner only recently started dating John Miller\u2014whom she hopes to steal away with at some point next month. As yet, there\u2019s been no talk of him participating in any Garner-Affleck Christmas traditions this year.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s excited to have some down time over the holidays and to have someone new to spend time with,\u201d a source said of Garner\u2019s promising-sounding romance.\n\nPhotos\n\nCeleb Exes Who Worked Together After Breakups\n\nJennifer Lawrence didn\u2019t have a goop-approved Thanksgiving when she and Martin were dating, though Paltrow seemingly would have been open to it if it had come to that. The Coldplay singer is simply in a more serious place with Johnson, whom he\u2019s been seeing for about a year now.\n\nThere was no evidence that Paltrow ever met Lawrence, while she and Johnson have \u201cspent a good amount of time together and have a very nice friendship,\u201d a source told us.\n\nMariah Carey\u2018s engagement to James Packer fizzled out, but back when she thought she\u2019d be spending forever with him, obviously she wanted him to get along with her ex-husband Nick Cannon, the father of her twins, Monroe and Moroccan. Some months they all came together to celebrate one of Carey\u2019s favorite holidays, Halloween, a source told E! News that Cannon felt that \u201cas long as his kids are in good hands\u201d, he would \u201csupport any decision Mariah makes\u201d as far as future partners go.\n\nRead\n\nThe Art of Living Near Your Ex: How Stars Navigate a Shared Neighborhood\n\nIt understandably took Kourtney Kardashian a good long while before she was comfortable hanging out with Sofia Richie, Scott Disick\u2018s girlfriend. She finally had dinner earlier this month with the two of them at Nobu, once she was ready. (Nobu\u2014a safe haven for the whole fam\u2014is also where Scott took Sofia for her first public outing with his kids.)\n\n\u201cScott and Sofia are very serious and Scott felt it was important that Sofia and Kourtney interact and bond,\u201d a source told E! News. \u201cThey have kept things separate for over a year now, and Kourtney is now more open and willing to have a surface level relationship with Sofia.\u201d\n\nThat being said, though the Kardashian-Jenner Thanksgiving is always a sprawling affair, Sofia did not make a cameo in any of Kourtney\u2019s photos featuring her, Scott, Mason, Penelope and Reign.\n\nBaby steps, you know?\n\nREUTERS/Fred Prouser\n\nOn the other hand, while the kids can be a reason why new significant others come into the picture at a glacial pace, they also tend to be the reason for all the cozy closeness once that level of comfort has been achieved.\n\nEven the seeming originators of the divorced-BFFs standard\u2014Bruce Willis and Demi Moore\u2014needed some time before life started resembling the beach in Turks and Caicos where Willis remarried, with his ex and her third husband among the guests.\n\nFor starters, Moore and Willis (her second husband) split up in 2000, when their daughters were still quite young. Their eldest, Rumer Willis, was only 12. So it was imperative that they figured out the co-parenting thing, long before that term was in fashion (though it\u2019s often used retroactively to describe what couples ranging from Bruce and Demi to Prince Charles and Princess Diana were already doing after their divorces).\n\nRead\n\nThe Art of Avoiding\u2014or Embracing\u2014an Ex at the Met Gala\n\nWillis attended Moore and Ashton Kutcher\u2018s wedding in 2005, and those two returned the favor in 2009, when Willis married Emma Heming. All very civil, which has seemingly helped Rumer, Scout and Tallulah maintain close relationships with both parents. Moore and Kutcher split up in 2011 and, while they didn\u2019t have children together, they did start a foundation, which would bring them back into each other\u2019s orbit from time to time. Being only 10 years older than her, Kutcher has also reportedly maintained a friendship with former stepdaughter Rumer, but he and Mila Kunisdon\u2019t generally hang out as a familiy with the evidence of his past life.\n\nBut it\u2019s Bruce and Demi who really set the bar for being able to expand the fam organically, the two of them and Heming showing up time and again in support of whatever the kids are up to, Rumer\u2019s 30th birthday in August being yet another occasion for them to celebrate all together.\n\n\u201cI have to say our daughters are incredibly well adjusted considering two of them are half Bruce Willis,\u201d Moore said in poking fun at her ex during the Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis earlier this year.\n\nIt would seem as if Bruce and Demi entered their \u201clike siblings\u201d phase awhile ago then.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s really like my brother,\u201d Paltrow said of Martin, whom she was married to for 10 years, on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert earlier this year. \u201cWe\u2019re very familial. It\u2019s nice, it\u2019s great.\u201d\n\nAnd when one\u2019s brother wants to bring his girlfriend home for Thanksgiving, who is his sister to deny her a seat at the table?\n\nSource: Read Full Article", "images": ["https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Disputing-Irans-version-mother-of-Nika-Shakarami-says-16-year-old-was-beaten-to-death.jpg", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018619/rs_600x600-180719083629-600-Amanda-Seyfried-Dominic-Cooper-JR-071918.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201826/rs_600x600-180306091951-600-GwynethApple.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20800%20450'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dua-Lipa-Confirms-Relationship-Status-Amid-Trevor-Noah-Dating-Rumors.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ccelebritiesfotors_600x600-180306091951-600-GwynethApple-600x280.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/New-Documentary-To-Examine-Making-Of-Michael-Jacksons-Thriller.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201200%20630'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201280%20800'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201848/rs_600x600-180508103628-600.2-met-gala-couples-exes.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20636%20382'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20700%20500'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20600%20280'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cropped-5-32x32.gif", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2015825/rs_300x300-150925091910-5600-kate-bosworth-orlando-bloom.ls.92515.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/20181026/rs_600x600-181126125548-Chris-Martin-Brad-Falchuk-Instagram-600-NF-11-26-18.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/20181022/rs_600x600-181122122312-600.jimmy-kimmel.112218.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Danielle-Lloyd-quits-OnlyFans-amid-rumours-she039s-joined-Celebrity-SAS.jpg", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/China-has-secret-station-in-NYC-as-part-of-network-to-track-dissidents.jpg", "http://c.statcounter.com/11691185/0/36067258/1/", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/2018623/rs_600x600-180723155958-1024-CelebNeighbors.jpg?fit=inside|192:192&output-quality=90", "https://akns-images.eonline.com/eol_images/Entire_Site/201674/rs_1024x759-160804141453-1024-ashton-demi-bruce-emma.jpg?fit=inside|900:auto&output-quality=90", "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Dogs-that-fatally-mauled-TN-toddlers-injured-mom-were-never-violent.jpg"], "top_img": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cropped-5-32x32.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/lifestyle/celebrity-exes-the-art-of-hanging-out-with-the-new-significant-other/", "title": "Celebrity Exes & the Art of Hanging Out With the New Significant Other", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Celebrity Exes & the Art of Hanging Out With the New Significant Other - Hot Lifestyle News", "description": "Instagram Spending Thanksgiving with your boyfriend\u2019s family for the first [...]", "url": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/lifestyle/celebrity-exes-the-art-of-hanging-out-with-the-new-significant-other/", "site_name": "Hot Lifestyle News"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-11-27T03:50:55+00:00"}, "author": "mediabest", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/ccelebritiesfotors_600x600-180306091951-600-GwynethApple.jpg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "mediabest", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "7 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hotlifestylenews.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/cropped-5-270x270.gif"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543290655.0, "source": "http://hotlifestylenews.com", "summary": ""}
