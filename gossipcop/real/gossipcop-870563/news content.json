The caption, idiomatically rendered, runs something akin to this: (Napoleon Bonaparte to Mme. the Marchioness de Pompadour) ''My dear Marchioness, you must be perished with the cold. Do, pray, alight from your carriage and take a glass of Dubonnet. If, at the time, I had but had a few thousand bottles my retreat from Russia would have been metamorphosed into a triumphal procession!'' The scene is set during Fat Tuesday of carnival ; hence the characters are disguised people roleplaying.\n\nDubonnet ( , ,[1][2] French: [dyb\u0254n\u025b]) is a sweet, aromatised wine-based quinquina, often enjoyed as an aperitif.[3] It is a blend of fortified wine, herbs, and spices (including a small amount of quinine),[4] with fermentation being stopped by the addition of alcohol. It is currently produced in France by Pernod Ricard, and in the United States by Heaven Hill Distilleries of Bardstown, Kentucky. The French made version is 14.8% alcohol by volume and the US version 19%.[3] The beverage is famous in the UK for having been the favourite drink of Queen Elizabeth II and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother as well.[5]\n\nIn November 2021, Dubonnet was awarded a Royal Warrant by Queen Elizabeth II.[6]\n\nIngredients [ edit ]\n\nFour main ingredients are used:\n\nHistory [ edit ]\n\nDubonnet was first sold in 1846 by Joseph Dubonnet, in response to a competition run by the French Government to find a way of persuading French Foreign Legionnaires in North Africa to drink quinine.[4] Quinine combats malaria but is very bitter.\n\nOwnership was taken over by Pernod Ricard in 1976. It was re-popularised in the late 1970s by an advertising campaign starring Pia Zadora. It is available in Rouge, Blanc and Gold (vanilla and orange) varieties. Dubonnet is also widely known by the advertisement slogan of the French graphic designer Cassandre \"Dubo, Dubon, Dubonnet\" (a play on words roughly meaning \"It's nice; it's good; it's Dubonnet\"), which still can be found on the walls of houses in France. The brand later became owned by Heaven Hill.[3]\n\nDubonnet is commonly mixed with lemonade or bitter lemon, and forms part of many cocktails.\n\nReputedly Dubonnet is a favourite beverage of:\n\nCocktails [ edit ]\n\nThe following include Dubonnet as one of their ingredients:\n\nThe Alfonso\n\nApple Dubonnet\n\nArnaud's Special (New Orleans)\n\nBartender\n\nBentley\n\nBlackthorn Cocktail\n\nDot-Roy\n\nDubonnet Cassis\n\nDubonnet Cocktail\n\nDubonnet Daniella\n\nDubonnet Delight\n\nDubonnet Fizz\n\nDubonnet Helado\n\nDubonnet Highball\n\nDubonnet Kiss\n\nDubonnet Manhattan\n\nDubonnet Negroni\n\nDubonnet Royal\n\nDubonnet TT\n\nJack London Martini\n\nOpera Cocktail\n\nPhoebe Snow [12]\n\nRed Moonlight\n\nRum Dubonnet\n\nSan Diego Cocktail\n\nSavoy Hotel Special\n\nTrois Rivieres\n\nMummy Love\n\nMarble Hill\n\nNapoleon\n\nKarl-Gerhard\n\nBossunova Belt\n\nMagic Juice\n\nThe Queen Mother\n\nThe Mexican\n\nSee also [ edit ]\n\nGin and tonic, another drink invented to encourage European colonial soldiers in South Asian tropical climates to take quinine.", "images": ["https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/9/96/Symbol_category_class.svg/16px-Symbol_category_class.svg.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f7/Echo_du_Mardi_Gras_-_Publicit%C3%A9_pour_Dubonnet.jpg/220px-Echo_du_Mardi_Gras_-_Publicit%C3%A9_pour_Dubonnet.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Plakat_Cheret_95.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/4/49/Plakat_Cheret_95.jpg/220px-Plakat_Cheret_95.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/e/e2/Symbol_portal_class.svg/16px-Symbol_portal_class.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/f2/Lautrec_-_Publicit%C3%A9_Dubonnet.jpg/220px-Lautrec_-_Publicit%C3%A9_Dubonnet.jpg", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/d/db/Dubonnet_wine_ad_1915.png/220px-Dubonnet_wine_ad_1915.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Plakat_Cheret_95.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dubonnet", "title": "Wikipedia", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/4/49/Plakat_Cheret_95.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 926}, "title": "Dubonnet - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
