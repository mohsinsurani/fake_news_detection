Aiko reportedly filed for divorce in August 2016, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for the split.\n\nThe split became ugly early on, as many fans assumed Aiko had cheated on Dot, while others assumed Dot had abused the singer. Aiko denied cheating on the producer, tweeting, \"Never let a man disrespect u in any way... I only cheated myself. so glad to be free from all the drugs, depression and confrontation.\"\n\nDot also shot down any notions that he had harmed Aiko, writing on Instagram, \u201cIn light of public threats, false allegations and attempts to slander my name and character, I am compelled to speak up.\"\n\nHe continued, \u201cBecause my nature is peaceful, I\u2019ve been silent out of respect for all involved, and to maintain my privacy. However, I believe the truth must be heard, which is that I\u2019ve never been violent or abusive towards any woman in my life. Such behavior is abhorrent to me and far from how I conduct myself. Moving forward, I will continue to focus on my family, friends and music, and soon enough the entire truth shall come to light.\u201d\n\nSince splitting from Dot Da Genius, Aiko and Big Sean have been happily dating and continue to collaborate on songs, including some from her new album Trip.", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2017/10/xxl-trimmed-spacing.png", "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2016/12/Dot-Da-Genius-Jhene-Aiko.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2016/12/Dot-Da-Genius-Jhene-Aiko.jpg?w=630&amp;h=420&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89&w=980&q=75"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/812/files/2016/12/Dot-Da-Genius-Jhene-Aiko.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Mojica"], "canonical_link": "https://www.xxlmag.com/jhene-aiko-finalizes-divorce-dot-da-genius/", "title": "Jhene Aiko Finalizes Divorce From Dot Da Genius", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "xxl", "description": "Jhene Aiko's divorce from Dot Da Genius is finally official.
