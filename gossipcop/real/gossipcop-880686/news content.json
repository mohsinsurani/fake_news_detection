(Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times)\n\nNominated Thursday morning for outstanding lead actress in a comedy series, Tracee Ellis Ross of ABC\u2019s \u201cblack-ish\u201d spoke exclusively to the Los Angeles Times about her second Emmy nod.\n\nCongratulations! Where were you when you got the news?\n\nWhat a fun morning! I was sitting on my meditation pillows in my meditation room listening to the birds with a moisture mask on my face. (Laughs.) I decided that watching the live feeds was making me too nervous and uncomfortable, so I wanted to do something that felt better. I opened my eyes and said, \u201cI\u2019ll look and see if I get texts. If I get texts, then it means something good and then I can sort of tune in to what\u2019s happening.\u201d And I looked at, like 8:36 a.m., and there was one text and then as I was about to open it, more started to come in, and I was like, \u201cI think this is a good thing, I think this is a good thing.\u201d\n\nSo how quickly did your mood change from serenity to excitement?\n\nIt was pretty quick. And so I started making phone calls to all my loved ones. I called my parents and then I called my sisters and my brothers, there\u2019s so many of us. And then I called my best friends and Kenya [Barris, the show\u2019s creator]. It was actually really funny. So I texted Kenya and said, \u201cCongratulations\u201d and I meant to touch the cartwheel emoji, but I accidentally touched the broken heart, and I was like, \u201cOh, God! No! I don\u2019t mean that!\u201d [Laughs].\n\nI\u2019m so excited because these moments are made so much sweeter when you get to share them with your family. And the fact that [co-star] Anthony [Anderson] is nominated for the third time makes it so extra special. And I have to say that I am blown away by the other women in this category! These are women who have not only influenced my personal career, but my life. Jane Fonda and Lily Tomlin are two women that I have revered for so many years of my life.\n\nWhat\u2019s it like working with someone you have such a close relationship with?\n\nAnthony and I both, I think, are great on our own, but there\u2019s something extra special that happens when we\u2019re together. But the more that we have this time under our belts, the more that the respect and the love and the safety with each other grows. And I feel like there is something that comes out of me in collaboration with him that I\u2019ve never seen in myself or my work anywhere else and I love it.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so excited because these moments are made so much sweeter when you get to share them with your family,\u201d says Tracee Ellis Ross. (Kirk McKoy / Los Angeles Times)\n\nWere you surprised by your nomination?\n\nIf you\u2019re not surprised, I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re thinking! (Laughs.) I was surprised and I was nervous. As a kid, as soon as I decided I wanted to be an actor, and even before I decided I wanted to be an actor, I always watched award shows, and I always thought to myself, \u201cMy goodness. What an extraordinary moment for that person.\u201d And when I became an actor, the idea of winning an Oscar or an Emmy or a Golden Globe, that\u2019s the moment, that\u2019s the thing. And, of course, my life and my career and who I am as a person is not validated by those things, but the acknowledgment and the excitement of that \u2014 particularly for me in the context of the historical aspect as a black woman in this category, the weight and the meaning within that \u2014 is extremely special. There\u2019s a lot to it that I don\u2019t take lightly.\n\nI am blown away by the other women in this category! These are women who have not only influenced my personal career, but my life. \u2014 Tracee Ellis Ross\n\nWhy do you think people connect with this show?\n\nI think people see themselves in this family both in the love and in the limitations of this family. The willingness on the part of our writers to courageously dive into subject matters that all of us are chomping on and trying to make sense of in this world, this country that we\u2019re living in. The fact that it is a multigenerational comedy that touches on so many different kinds of points of view, the writers\u2019 amazing ability to unpack the heavier subject matter but in a comedic way, the chemistry between our cast. I feel like there a lot of pieces that work.\n\nHow do you plan on celebrating?\n\nMy favorite thing to do to celebrate is to enjoy my favorite part of my life, which is cooking, having beautiful food, watching some television and going to bed early. So that is probably what will happen. I did discover I\u2019m not a big drinker in any way, shape or form. I\u2019m more interested in the stemware and the glasses that I drink from than the alcohol that is in them. However, on Instagram I did see a beautiful cocktail in a friend\u2019s post that was tequila with rose water and lime. And yesterday I went and bought the ingredients, so perhaps tonight I will make one of those cocktails and celebrate with two or three sips because I\u2019m such a lightweight that I don\u2019t know that I could drink a whole glass of tequila.", "images":
