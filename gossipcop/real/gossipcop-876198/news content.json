If we were to all put our voices together, imagine the difference we would make. If we were to all stand up, united, as one, our impact \u2014 it would be Huge. Believe me. Huge.\"\n\nThe \"huge\", of course, was pronounced in Trump's trademark \"yuuuge\" style.\n\n\"That's not fake news,\" she continued. \"So let's leave here tonight remembering that we must show these Nazi, white supremacists jerks in Charlottesville and all over the country that a nation, with liberty as our slogan, has zero tolerance for their violence, their hatred and their discrimination. We must resist.\"\n\nAs the daughter of late pop icon Michael Jackson, Paris, 19, recently revealed to Teen Vogue that activism has helped her reckon with her life in the public eye.\n\n\"I honestly used to have no motivation whatsoever to be in the public eye; it scared me,\" she stated. \"I\u2019ve seen what it can do to people, [and] plenty get hurt. But after a long time of thinking, I started to really see the kind of impact I already have on people, how I was born with a platform, and I didn\u2019t want to waste it.\"\n\n\"There are so many people who work their entire lives to create a platform and mine was just handed to me.... Why not use it for something important?\"\n\nFollow Independent Culture on Facebook for more news, features and video on TV, Music, Film and Art.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://www.independent.co.uk/img/pixels-player-logo.svg", "https://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clarisse Loughrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/paris-jackson-vmas-2017-speech-donald-trump-white-supremacist-nazis-charlottesville-a7916081.html", "title": "VMAs 2017: Paris Jackson denounces \u2018Nazi white supremacist jerks\u2019 in speech", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "'If we were to all put our voices together, imagine the difference we would make'", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-08-28T08:00:33.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Paris Jackson made a subtle dig at Trump during the VMAs", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/paris-jackson-vmas-2017-speech-donald-trump-white-supremacist-nazis-charlottesville-a7916081.html", "type": "article", "description": "'If we were to all put our voices together, imagine the difference we would make'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-28T08:00:33.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-28T08:00:33.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 509, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 4, "external_link_count": 2}, "date": "2017-08-28T08:00:33.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "Paris Jackson made a subtle dig at Trump during the VMAs", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'If we were to all put our voices together, imagine the difference we would make'", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/08/28/08/paris-jackson.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "VMAs 2017,paris jackson,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503907233.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
