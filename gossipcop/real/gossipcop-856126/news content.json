There's a situation,\" Perry said. \"Honestly, it's really like she started it, and it's time for her to finish it.\"\n\nSpeculation about the years-long feud has been circulating since Taylor Swift released the hit single \"Bad Blood,\" rumored to be about Perry.\n\nBut the conflict came back into the public eye after Perry performed a song believed to be inspired by her beef with Swift, \"Swish Swish,\" on this past weekend's \"Saturday Night Live.\" Perry didn't confirm that the song was inspired by Swift, but she was clear that it would make perfect sense.\n\nPerry said it all started over three of her backup dancers going to work on Swift's tour with Perry's blessing. But when Perry was getting ready to launch her tour, they approached Swift's tour management about being able to go back on tour with Perry when she needed it. According to Perry. the dancers were then fired. The \"Roar\" singer also said she had tried to reach out to Swift to discuss the situation, but hasn't gotten a response.\n\n\u201cI tried to talk to her about it, and she wouldn\u2019t speak to me,\u201d Perry said. \u201cI do the right thing any time that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me, and I\u2019m like, okay, cool, cool, cool, that\u2019s how you want to deal with it? Karma!\"\n\nPerry also says she would love to squash the conflict.\n\n\"What I want to say is that I\u2019m ready for that B.S. to be done,\" she said. \"Now, there is the law of cause and effect. You do something, there\u2019s going to be a reaction, and trust me, daddy, there\u2019s going to be a reaction.\"", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0
