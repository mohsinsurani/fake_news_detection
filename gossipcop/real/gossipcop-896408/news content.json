But before she married into the famous family, she received \u201cprincess-in-training\u201d lessons consisting of everything from learning how to curtsy to life-saving tactics she can use in the event that she is ever kidnapped.\n\nHere\u2019s more on the special hostage training Markle received, plus a look at some of the rules she must follow and the things she had to give up.\n\nNo selfies with fans\n\nThis rule may not be set in stone, but taking selfies with fans is something the royals typically do not do. Therefore, Markle may have to turn down any picture requests she gets from the public.\n\nLainey Gossip noted that the new royal already explained to some fans that she is unable to take any snaps. During a walk at Nottingham, a fan asked for a photo with her and she said, \u201cWe\u2019re not allowed.\u201d\n\nThe same goes for autographs, mainly because the royals simply wouldn\u2019t have the time to get to everyone.\n\nNo more acting\n\nShortly after their engagement announcement was made, Markle revealed in the couple\u2019s first joint interview that she was retiring from acting. This didn\u2019t come as much of a surprise since everyone figured that she wouldn\u2019t be returning to film Suits after marrying a prince.\n\nMarkle said about leaving the USA network show:\n\nI see it is a new change, a new chapter. I\u2019ve been working on my show seven years, we were so fortunate to have that longevity on a series. For me, once we hit the 100 episode marker, I thought, I have ticked this box and I feel really proud of the work we\u2019ve done there and now it\u2019s time to work as a team with [Harry].\n\nVIP hostage training\n\nThe downside to marrying such a recognizable member of the royal family is that you then can become a target. This is the case for Markle and the reason she had to undergo special training from elite military ops in case she is ever taken hostage.\n\n\u201cWhen you are part of the royal family, suddenly, you become a victim for ISIS, for a terrorist group, for a kidnapping,\u201d terrorism expert Robert Strang told Inside Edition and Markle being an American makes her even more of a target. Some of what she learned included how to cope mentally and physically, how to alert authorities and loved ones, and how to stay alive in such a situation.\n\nThis training is nothing new for the royals, but the news that Markle received it came after a chilling report that ISIS had targeted Prince George\u2019s preschool recently.\n\nRoyal fashion do\u2019s and don\u2019ts\n\nMarkle committed her first royal fashion faux pas when she and Harry appeared together in the Sunken Garden at Kensington Palace following the news of their engagement, and she didn\u2019t wearing pantyhose. That\u2019s a big no-no in the royal family. For example, the queen and Kate Middleton almost always wear sheer hose in public.\n\nIt\u2019s also safe to say that we won\u2019t see Markle in revealing outfits. Black dresses are also not acceptable to wear during royal enagaements. Even though Princess Diana once broke this rule at an affair with Princess Grace. Black dresses are usually only worn to funerals.\n\nIt\u2019s a learning curve for Markle, but she\u2019s still getting adjusted to the do\u2019s and don\u2019ts of royal fashioN and can always call the Duchess of Cambridge for some expert advice.\n\nProper table etiquette\n\nLearning how the table is set and which fork to use WAS important for Markle to learn. Before you start drawing Julia Roberts in Pretty Woman comparisons here, no matter how good Markle\u2019s table mannerisms were she had to learn the British etiquette which is different from how Americans dine.\n\nShe was prepped on other things too, like what appropriate conversations are to be discussed at the dinner table.\n\nHow to address other royals\n\nMarkle has also learned how to address and behave around the queen and other members of the royal family.\n\nShe was taught how to properly address dignitaries abroad as well. In addition, she\u2019ll be expected to have a firm grasp on the workings of the state.\n\nHow to curtsy\n\nFinally, Markle had to master the proper way to curtsy. The act is done by tucking one leg back with a slight bend in the knee, while also nodding the head.\n\nMarkle needs to do this when greeting those with higher royal rankings, including Queen Elizabeth II, Prince Philip, and Prince Charles.\n\nFollow Michelle Kapusta on Twitter @philamichelle.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Markle-taking-a-selfie-640x455.png?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-and-Prince-Harry.jpg?w=640&h=461", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-pushing-her-hair-back.jpg?w=640&h=427", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-in-a-dressing-room.png?w=640&h=458", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Meghan-Markle-Close-Up.jpg?w=622&h=500", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Markle-taking-a-selfie.png?w=640&h=455", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-without-pantyhose.png?w=640&h=474", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Meghan-Markle-close-up.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/Markle-taking-a-selfie-640x455.png?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Kapusta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/how-meghan-markle-is-getting-ready-for-life-as-a-royal.html/", "title": "How Meghan Markle Prepared for Life as a Royal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Meghan Markle must undergo royal training now that she's engaged to Prince Harry.
