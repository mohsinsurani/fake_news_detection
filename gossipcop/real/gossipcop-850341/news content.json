{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/lowriders-review-demian-bichir-eva-longoria/", "text": "It\u2019s not a great sign that \u201cLowriders\u201d begins with mumbled, sullen narration from our protagonist, teenage tagger Danny Alvarez (Gabriel Chavarria, \u201cEast Los High\u201d). Nor are we likely to empathize much with the kid when the camera pulls out and we see the aspiring graffiti artist racing to redecorate L.A.\u2019s Sixth Street Bridge \u2014 and then use it as an open-air urinal \u2014 while his friends worry about the approaching sirens.\n\nClaudia (Yvette Monreal, \u201cFaking It\u201d) has a college scholarship to protect, so she drives off just in time, leaving Danny and his best friend Chuy (Tony Revolori, far from the lobby of \u201cThe Grand Budapest Hotel\u201d) literally holding the bag. A couple of spray paint cans are enough to land the boys in jail, though they get bailed out soon enough by Danny\u2019s father, Miguel (Demi\u00e1n Bichir).\n\nMiguel has finally built himself a quiet life, with devoted girlfriend Gloria (Eva Longoria) and an adorable stepdaughter (Montse Hernandez, \u201cJane the Virgin\u201d) who\u2019s avidly planning her quincea\u00f1era. When he\u2019s not with them, Miguel can be found at his car repair shop in Boyle Heights, working on the revered, pristine 1961 Impala he lovingly calls Green Poison.\n\nAlso Read: LA Film Festival Embraces Diversity With 'Lowriders' Opener, Ava DuVernay Award\n\nMiguel \u2014 who doesn\u2019t want Danny to join his other son, Francisco (Theo Rossi,\u201dSons of Anarchy\u201d), behind bars \u2014 is intimidating enough to keep Danny on track for a while. But as a recovering alcoholic with lingering anger management issues and a general disdain for human communication, he\u2019s not exactly the easiest guy to connect with. So it\u2019s no surprise that Danny\u2019s an easy mark for Francisco, who gets out of jail nursing a massive, eight-year grudge against his father.\n\nThe fact that this furious family feud takes place against the backdrop of utterly sincere, earnestly competitive car worship inevitably undermines the tension Pervuian director Ricardo de Montreuil intends. He and screenwriters Elgin James and Cheo Hodari Coker fumble intermittently, plotting a straight (and predictable) line of heavily-telegraphed revelations and sentimental interactions. And Danny is neither compelling nor complex enough to shoulder this kind of heavy drama.\n\nAlso Read: Demian Bichir Joins Cast of 'Conjuring' Spinoff 'The Nun'\n\nBut as the movie pulls back from Danny\u2019s typical teenage resentments, de Montreuil wisely allows the other actors to fill more of the frame. Francisco is thinly-written, but the intensely charismatic Rossi \u2014 expect to see much more of him \u2014 fleshes the character out in fascinating ways. With his wide grins and narrowed eyes, he keeps us constantly on guard, unsure of Francisco\u2019s motives but worried for Danny\u2019s innocence.\n\nBichir, an Oscar nominee for 2011\u2019s \u201cA Better Life,\u201d is just as impactful. Granted, there are no new insights to be found here about the generational conflict between an artistically wayward son and his old-fashioned, disapproving dad, but the understated Bichir infuses real poignancy into Miguel\u2019s struggles with himself, his history, and his fractured family.\n\nThe film\u2019s women don\u2019t fare quite as well. Longoria deepens her brief scenes with warmth and intelligence, but there\u2019s just not much for her to grab hold of. Similarly, though Monreal and Hernandez pull us in with their sweetly-open presences, neither gets a chance to do anything interesting. And as Danny\u2019s hipster girlfriend Lorelei, Melissa Benoist \u2014 who ably carries TV\u2019s \u201cSupergirl\u201d \u2014 is reduced to a caricature, a superficial symbol of ignorant gentrification.\n\nAlso Read: Eva Longoria to Star in Fox Comedy Pilot 'Type-A'\n\nWhere de Montreuil excels, though, is in his passionate pushback against that gentrification. Mexican-American culture isn\u2019t merely draped over the story as an added element but woven throughout with a casual practicality that respects both the primary characters and their shot-on-location East L.A. setting.\n\nAs for the cars, the movie\u2019s true infatuation, they\u2019re filmed with a contagious rapture; we fully believe that de Montreuil and cinematographer Andres Sanchez appreciate the high-gloss detail on every vintage GTO and hydraulically-enhanced Chevy as much as the chrome-obsessed characters do. And \u201cLowriders\u201d gives us plenty of opportunity to ogle the objects of his desire: the packed weekend car clubs that Danny and Miguel frequent are shot with such relaxed intimacy, it feels as though we\u2019re watching documentary footage.\n\nSo yes, as long as de Montreuil races down the plot\u2019s well-worn path, the story sputters. But when he pulls off to indulge in his real passion, the movie rides just as it should \u2014 low and slow.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png",
