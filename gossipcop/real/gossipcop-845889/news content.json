Queen Maxima of the Netherlands was also a participant on the W20 Summit panel, which Ivanka Trump attended at Merkel\u2019s invitation.\n\n\u201cCertainly not the latter,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI\u2019m rather unfamiliar with this role as well. ... It has been a little under 100 days, and it has just been a remarkable and incredible journey.\u201d\n\nShe did not define what her new role as a senior White House official entailed but said she cares \u201cvery much about empowering women in the workplace\u201d and defined her goal as enacting \u201cincremental positive change. That is my goal. This is very early for me; I\u2019m listening, learning.\u201d\n\nThe questions asked of Trump seemed more direct than those about women in the workforce posed to other panelists. But there was a deep curiosity in Europe, ahead of her visit here, about the first daughter\u2019s new role in her father\u2019s administration.\n\nIvanka Trump, who was deeply involved with her father\u2019s campaign and has been instrumental in his administration in the first three months in office, positioned herself as someone who is still in humbling listening-tour mode. \u201cI\u2019m striving to think about how best to empower women in the economy,\u201d she said, at one point calling herself a feminist. \u201cI have no doubt that coming out of this trip I\u2019ll be more informed.\u201d\n\nBut she was booed and hissed at by the majority-women audience at the conference when she lauded her father for supporting paid-leave policies. \u201cI\u2019m very proud of my father\u2019s advocacy,\u201d she said, calling him \u201ca tremendous champion of supporting families and enabling them to thrive.\u201d\n\nMeckel, the moderator, pushed her to address the vocal disapproval from the audience.\n\n\u201cYou hear the reaction from the audience,\u201d she said. \u201cI need to address one more point \u2014 some attitudes toward women your father has displayed might leave one questioning whether he\u2019s such an empowerer for women.\u201d\n\nDuring the campaign, more than a dozen women went public to accuse Donald Trump of sexual misconduct, unwanted advances and assault. Ivanka Trump did not comment on those accusations during the campaign, and on Tuesday she dismissed the criticism via her father\u2019s favorite enemy \u2014 the press.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve certainly heard the criticism from the media, that\u2019s been perpetuated,\u201d she said, drawing laughs from the audience.\n\nAnd despite being invited to attend the panel by Merkel in her role as a senior White House official, she defended her father from her vantage point of loyal daughter \u2014 in what appeared to be muscle memory from when she was confronted by uncomfortable questions about her father on the campaign.\n\n\u201cAs a daughter, I can speak on a very personal level,\u201d Ivanka Trump said. \u201cI grew up in a house where there was no barrier to what I could accomplish beyond my own perseverance and tenacity. That\u2019s not an easy thing to do; he provided that for us.\u201d She said that her father treated her exactly the same way he treated her two brothers, who now run the family business. \u201cThere was no difference,\u201d she said.\n\nTrump also credited her father\u2019s administration for hiring women in important roles.\n\n\u201cThe team basically going through the vetting and hiring process \u2014 six out of eight of those people are women,\u201d she said.\n\nIvanka Trump and her team touted the summit as a political win, in a question-and-answer session with reporters following the panel, noting that Merkel had announced from the stage her support to work together on a fund to support women entrepreneurs.\n\n\u201cPolitics is politics, as I\u2019m learning,\u201d Ivanka Trump said, shrugging off the reaction to her comments at the panel. \u201cMy father is a champion for all Americans \u2014 women, of course.... I think the fact that he\u2019s embraced my interest in taking on this role shows that he aligns with the interests I most deeply care about and advocate for. Otherwise it wouldn\u2019t make for a very good family dynamic.\u201d\n\nShe insisted that the president has been a \u201cchampion of women\u201d throughout his career.\n\nAs for the pointed questions from the moderator, she shrugged: \u201cI\u2019m used to it.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/4ce785a/2147483647/strip/true/crop/2865x2292+681+0/resize/250x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F7b%2F22%2Ffb53b9664316b31b444094c77e1a%2Fap-408895950036.jpg", "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/08e8481/2147483647/strip/true/crop/786x629+187+0/resize/250x200!/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.politico.com%2F92%2F3f%2F78def1e64fec8b2ec5aebf54c616%2F170424-donald-trump-ap-17111721492475.jpg", "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/1155968404/49dcfeaa-c170-4a50-a81b-c6518ba1a0fa/7a0204bd-6f2a-4888-8d68-cee05b6353dd/1280x720/match/image.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/1155968404/49dcfeaa-c170-4a50-a81b-c6518ba1a0fa/7a0204bd-6f2a-4888-8d68-cee05b6353dd/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/25/ivanka-trump-booed-berlin-237569", "title": "Ivanka Trump gets booed, hissed at during Berlin event", "meta_data": {"description": "The first daughter was put on the spot during her first trip abroad as a representative of America.", "brightspot.contentId": "0000015b-a518-de92-a17b-add850b80000", "brightspot.cached": "false", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Ivanka Trump gets booed, hissed at during Berlin event", "description": "The first daughter was put on the spot during her first trip abroad as a representative of America.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.politico.com/story/2017/04/25/ivanka-trump-booed-berlin-237569", "image": "https://cf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net/v1/static/1155968404/49dcfeaa-c170-4a50-a81b-c6518ba1a0fa/7a0204bd-6f2a-4888-8d68-cee05b6353dd/1280x720/match/image.jpg", "fb_appid": 114037015331397, "site_name": "POLITICO"}, "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"pages": 62317591679}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/politico"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ivanka Trump gets booed, hissed at during Berlin event", "description": "The first daughter was put on the spot during her first trip abroad as a representative of America.", "image": "https://www.politico.com/dims4/default/94c466e/2147483647/legacy_thumbnail/1200x800%3E/quality/90/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcf-images.us-east-1.prod.boltdns.net%2Fv1%2Fstatic%2F1155968404%2F49dcfeaa-c170-4a50-a81b-c6518ba1a0fa%2F7a0204bd-6f2a-4888-8d68-cee05b6353dd%2F1280x720%2Fmatch%2Fimage.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@politico", "creator": "@politico"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#da532c", "msapplication-TileImage": "/mstile-144x144.png", "host": "www.politico.com", "build": "1.0.0-SNAPSHOT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493074800.0, "source": "https://www.politico.com", "summary": ""}
