Because if we come across [one another], I think he\u2019ll be lying on the floor somehow, magically,\u201d Sorvino, 78, told TMZ on Tuesday.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s gonna go to jail,\u201d the \u201cGoodfellas\u201d star said. \u201cThat son of a bitch, good for him if he goes, because if not, then he has to meet me, and I\u2019ll kill that motherf\u2014ker.\u201d\n\nWeinstein, 65, was accused of blacklisting Paul\u2019s daughter, Mira Sorvino, after she refused his sexual advances. Directors Terry Zwigoff and Peter Jackson corroborated Mira\u2019s claims, alleging that Weinstein\u2019s interference cost Mira roles in \u201cBad Santa\u201d and \u201cLord of the Rings.\u201d\n\nPaul claims he only learned about the seemingly endless sexual harassment and assault and blacklisting allegations against Weinstein when the public did, noting, \u201cIf I had known it, he would not be walking. He\u2019d be in a wheelchair.\u201d\n\n\u201cMy daughter is a wonderful person,\u201d Paul said. \u201cA courageous and wonderful human being and doesn\u2019t deserve to have been treated that way by this pig. This pig will get his comeuppance. The law will get him. He\u2019s going to go to jail and die in jail. But if he doesn\u2019t \u2026 I\u2019ll just slap him around. I won\u2019t do anything terrible.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/paul-sorvino-mira-sorvino-harvey-weinstein.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/01/paul-sorvino-mira-sorvino-harvey-weinstein.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["January"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/01/03/paul-sorvino-on-weinstein-ill-kill-that-motherf-ker/", "title": "Paul Sorvino threatens to kill Harvey Weinstein", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
