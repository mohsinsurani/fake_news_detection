We live in a culture that is so increasingly intrusive... the more you give\u2014and frankly, even if you don't give it\u2014something will be taken.\"[54] Commenting on rumors about alleged engagement with Swift, Alwyn told The Wall Street Journal: \"If I had a pound for every time I think I've been told I've been engaged, then I'd have a lot of pound coins. I mean, the truth is, if the answer was yes, I wouldn't say, and if the answer was no, I wouldn't say.\"[7]\n\nFilmography\n\nKey Denotes productions that have not yet been released\n\nFilm\n\nTelevision\n\nYear Title Role Notes 2019 A Christmas Carol Bob Cratchit Miniseries; 3 episodes 2022 Conversations with Friends Nick Conway Main role; 12 episodes\n\nDiscography\n\nAccolades\n\nAlwyn has won 12 awards from 16 nominations.
