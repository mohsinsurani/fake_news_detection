After Sunday night's 2017 Video Music Awards, music's hottest stars descended on a slew of star-studded after parties, and most of them made quick outfit changes that they felt more comfortable letting loose in.\n\nSEE ALSO: Cardi B suffers nip slip live at the 2017 VMAs\n\nHailey Baldwin slipped into an oversized vintage t-shirt, while Hailee Steinfeld rocked a spaghetti strap white dress with a pink accent and over-the-knee boots. She posed with \"Stranger Things\" actress Millie Bobby Brown, who rocked a metallic top tucked into high-waisted black slacks.\n\nSocial media star Chantel Jeffries came this close to suffering a wardrobe malfunction at the Republic Records/Cadillac party, where she rocked a black ensemble that featured a thigh-high slit and a cleavage-baring neckline that plunged past her bellybutton.\n\nDNCE coordinated in black-and-white outfits, while \"America's Got Talent\" judges Heidi Klum and Mel B opted to stay in their respective looks from the VMAs red carpet. Katy Perry, Calvin Harris and Khalid were spotted sharing a laugh, while Steinfeld hung out with Shawn Mendes.\n\nSee more photos from inside the 2017 VMAs after parties:\n\n\n\nMore from
