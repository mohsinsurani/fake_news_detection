The actress, who is also the face of Gemfields, has designed an 18-karat yellow-gold ring set with a Zambian emerald in Marina B\u2019s signature cut, with all profits from the $4,800 (around \u00a32,970) price tag donated to support the upgrade of the Gemfields Nkana Health Centre in Zambia.\n\n\u201cWe are very excited about the new Mila ring, as it will introduce the iconic Marina B style to a new generation,\u201d said Paul Lubetsky, the CEO of Marina B. \u201cWhile we created it for Mila in celebration of Wyatt\u2019s arrival, this is the kind of ring any woman can wear.\u201d\n\n\u201cHaving worked with Marina B on a previous collection of emerald jewellery, it was only natural that we would collaborate on a piece for our brand ambassador, Mila Kunis, as she starts her journey into motherhood,\u201d continued Ian Harebottle, the CEO of Gemfields. \u201cNot only is the ring beautiful, but it furthers our commitment to social responsibility.\u201d\n\nKunis and her fianc\u00e9 Ashton Kutcher welcomed their first child together, daughter Wyatt Isabelle Kutcher, on 30 September. They confirmed their engagement back in February.\n\nThe \u2018Mila\u2019 Motherhood ring is available to reserve at marinab.com/mila", "images": ["https://media.harpersbazaar.com.sg/2015/03/mila-kunis-prtrt_500_750_90.jpg", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/wp-content/plugins/gumlet/assets/images/pixel.png"], "top_img": "https://media.harpersbazaar.com.sg/2015/03/mila-kunis-prtrt_500_750_90.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Harper'S Bazaar Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/watches-jewels/mila-kunis-designs-for-her-daughter/", "title": "Mila Kunis Designs for her Daughter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The actress has partnered with Gemfields to mark the birth of her first child  By Zoe Dickens", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mila Kunis Designs for her Daughter", "description": "The actress has partnered with Gemfields to mark the birth of her first child  By Zoe Dickens", "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg/watches-jewels/mila-kunis-designs-for-her-daughter/", "site_name": "Harper's Bazaar Singapore", "image": {"identifier": "https://media.harpersbazaar.com.sg/2015/03/mila-kunis-prtrt_500_750_90.jpg", "width": 500, "height": 750, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/harpersbazaarsingapore", "published_time": "2015-03-18T05:14:08+00:00"}, "author": "Harper's BAZAAR Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@harpersbazaarsg", "site": "@harpersbazaarsg", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Harper's BAZAAR Staff", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "facebook-domain-verification": "fg1ecox2pdr0xfiu60g50yem4fny5d", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://media.harpersbazaar.com.sg/2020/08/favicon.ico"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1426655648.0, "source": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com.sg", "summary": ""}
