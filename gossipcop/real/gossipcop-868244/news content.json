It was published in 1996 and re-released in 2016.\n\nO.J. Simpson will soon be a free man. Again. A four-member parole board in Carson City, Nev., voted unanimously Thursday to curtail his 33-year prison sentence for kidnapping and armed robbery, stemming from a confrontation over sports memorabilia in Las Vegas in 2007.\n\nThe football legend, now 70 years old, could be released as soon as Oct. 1 into a world that\u2019s still fascinated by his plummet from grace.\n\nAs the proceedings got underway, a smiling Simpson entered the hearing room at the Lovelock Correctional Center dressed in a light blue shirt with billowy sleeves, his hair splotched with white, his voice gravelly. Seated at a desk with his attorney, Simpson was by turns affable and testy, humbled and defiant.\n\n\u201cI always thought I\u2019ve been pretty good with people,\u201d Simpson told the board by video link, \u201cand have basically spent a conflict-free life.\u201d\n\nThe board did not press him on that assertion, despite allegations of domestic abuse against Simpson (he pleaded no contest to spousal abuse in 1989), and its members made clear that they were not re-litigating his trial and acquittal for the 1994 killings of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ronald Goldman.\n\n(Nicki DeMarco/The Washington Post)\n\nSimpson\u2019s eldest daughter, Arnelle Simpson, and one of Simpson\u2019s victims from the Vegas case testified in support of his release.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve known O.J. for a long time,\u201d said Bruce Fromong, a memorabilia dealer whom Simpson confronted with five other men, two of whom were armed. \u201cI don\u2019t feel that he\u2019s a threat to anyone out there. He\u2019s a good man. . . . I feel that it\u2019s time to give him a second chance.\u201d\n\nThe networks and cable-news stations devoted live coverage to the case throughout the day, enlisting key players from Simpson\u2019s murder trial.\n\n[O.J.\u2019s last defender \u2014 F. Lee Bailey \u2014 is broke, disbarred and working above a hair salon]\n\n\u201cThe circus is back in town,\u201d declared Mark Fuhrman, the former Los Angeles detective whose racist remarks were weaponized in 1995 by Simpson\u2019s defense team, in an essay for FoxNews.com. \u201cO.J.

Nevada Department of Corrections/AFP/Getty Images Wait 1 second to continue.\n\nOn the \u201cToday\u201d show Thursday morning, Christopher Darden, one of the prosecutors for Simpson\u2019s murder trial, was asked what he would say to Simpson if he was on the Nevada parole board.\n\n\u201cWell, \u2018Did you kill Ron and Nicole?\u2019 \u201d said Darden, illustrating how Simpson remains inextricably linked to the earlier crime.\n\n\u201cBut of course that\u2019s not legally relevant\u201d to the Las Vegas case, said NBC host Savannah Guthrie.\n\n\u201cWell that\u2019s the one question I\u2019d like to ask,\u201d Darden said. \u201cI think that\u2019s the one question everybody would like to ask.\u201d\n\nIt probably is. O.J. Simpson is perhaps the only story that could force cable news to cut away from merry-go-round coverage of President Trump, Russia and the health-care meltdown in Congress.\n\nSex, violence, wealth, power, hubris, race, fame, Kardashians, law and order \u2014 the Simpson case had it all in 1994 and 1995, and still does.\n\n\u201cIt is one whale of a good story,\u201d ABC\u2019s Ted Koppel said at the time. The murder trial, broadcast by courtroom cameras and covered gavel to gavel by CNN, would come to represent a coarsening of public debate and an acceleration of the 24-hour news cycle.\n\n\u201cWhen a tabloid tornado begins to spin . . . even the best among us tend to get caught up in it,\u201d CBS anchor Dan Rather told the Los Angeles Times after the verdict, which polarized blacks and whites anew after the 1992 Los Angeles riots. \u201cBefore you know it . . . your standards have just broken open and you\u2019re not applying the same rules that you do to other stories.\u201d\n\nPeople born between Simpson\u2019s arrest and acquittal are old enough to drink legally, and the \u201990s have receded far enough to trigger waves of nostalgia. American culture was due for a reminder and a reckoning, and television provided two major rehashings of the saga just last year: a 10-episode FX miniseries starring Cuba Gooding Jr., and a 7\u00bd-hour, Oscar-winning documentary \u2014 in which erstwhile confidants professed their belief in Simpson\u2019s guilt, defense attorneys admitted to hoodwinking the jury, and one juror stated that the verdict was payback for the police beating of Rodney King.\n\nSimpson, meanwhile, was where many people thought he should\u2019ve been in the first place: prison. Public perception of Simpson\u2019s guilt has increased over time. A majority of both black and white people now agree that he was at least \u201cprobably guilty\u201d of the murders, according to a Washington Post-ABC News poll conducted last year.\n\nNevada's Lovelock Correctional Center, where Simpson has been incarcerated since 2008. (Terry Chea/AP)\n\nSimpson participated in Thursday\u2019s hearing by video conference from the medium-security Lovelock Correctional Center, a cropping of white buildings in the vast beigeness of northwestern Nevada. He\u2019s lived there as Inmate 1027820 since he was convicted and sentenced in 2008. The families of Nicole Brown Simpson and Ron Goldman drew a direct connection between their 1994 killings and the incident at the Palace Station hotel in Vegas.\n\n\u201cAllowing wealth, power and control to consume himself, he made a horrific choice on June 12, 1994, which has spiraled into where he is today,\u201d Nicole\u2019s sister Denise Brown said in a statement after the conviction, which came 13 years to the day after Simpson was acquitted for the murders. The Goldmans had already won a $33.5 million wrongful-death lawsuit against Simpson, which they believed drove him to reclaim valuable memorabilia.\n\nWhen he began his time at Lovelock, Simpson told the warden that he would try to be \u201cthe best prisoner they\u2019ve ever had\u201d \u2014 a sad echo of his bygone athletic prowess. During the ensuing nine years, Simpson mopped floors, disinfected gym equipment, coached inmate sports teams and led Bible study. He missed his children's\u2019 graduations. He missed his sister\u2019s funeral. He was commissioner of the prison\u2019s softball league. He was wait-listed for a prison course called \u201cCommitment to Change,\u201d which he didn\u2019t end up taking, and never enrolled in Alcoholics Anonymous, though he admitted the Vegas incident was fueled by booze. Other younger inmates came to him for advice, Simpson claimed, and he has mediated and defused conflicts. His favorite course was called \u201cAlternative to Violence.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am sorry that things turned out the way they did,\u201d Simpson said during the hearing, as the parole board weighed his risk to the public. \u201cI had no intent to commit a crime. . . . I\u2019ve done my time. I\u2019d just like to get back to my family and friends \u2014 and believe it or not I do have some real friends.\u201d\n\nAmericans now have Twitter and Facebook to offer their own armchair testimony in a cultural inquisition that may never end.\n\nPhotos of a battered Nicole Brown Simpson circulated on Twitter with the ironic quotation \u201cconflict free life.\u201d\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t feel sympathy for O.J. Simpson,\u201d former NFL tight end Shannon Sharpe wrote on Facebook. \u201cHe left the black community a long time ago. If he gets out, I never want to hear his name mentioned again.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought his statements were self-justifying, self-pitying, showing no remorse, no understanding, no sense of reality about his own life,\u201d said CNN legal analyst Jeffrey Toobin during the network\u2019s breathless coverage. Simpson \u201cis a deeply delusional and self-obsessed narcissist, and good luck to America once he\u2019s out.\u201d\n\nSimpson was paroled on one set of charges in 2013, after apologizing to the board for the Vegas incident; the other set required an additional four-year term, at minimum, which ends this year. His maximum sentence of 33 years was viewed by some as retribution for his acquittal in 1995.\n\n\u201cIt really made us all aware that, despite our best efforts, it\u2019s very difficult to separate the California case from the Nevada case,\u201d Simpson\u2019s lawyer Yale Galanter said at the time.\n\nNow, this chapter of the saga is ending. Simpson, who plans to move to Florida to be near family, could be golfing by the autumn. Darden published a best-selling memoir in 1996 titled \u201cIn Contempt.\u201d Defense attorneys Johnnie Cochran and Robert Kardashian are dead. F. Lee Bailey, who famously cross-examined Fuhrman, is mostly broke and working above a hair salon in Maine. In September, the maligned lead prosecutor Marcia Clark was at the Emmy Awards ceremony in support of \u201cThe People vs. O.J. Simpson\u201d; her eyes welled with tears when the actor Sarah Paulson took the stage and apologized on behalf of a judgmental nation.\n\nBut at the root of it all, still, is a double murder. On \u201cGood Morning America\u201d Thursday, the family of Ron Goldman vowed to continue pursuing Simpson\u2019s assets, as a form of perpetual punishment.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s troubling to me is [that] the whole system gives second chances to violent felons,\u201d said Fred Goldman, Ron\u2019s father. \u201cRon doesn\u2019t get a second chance.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/20/Production/Daily/Style/Images/315738022_0-13.jpg?t=20170517", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_480w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/20/Production/Daily/Style/Images/OJ_Simpson_Parole_17761-6dcfd.jpg?uuid=V_JSyG1nEeecFRd3QGNegw", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_606w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/20/National-Enterprise/Images/OJ_Simpson_Parole_38923-913a1.jpg", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer-gray.png&w=1&h=1"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2017/07/20/Production/Daily/Style/Images/315738022_0-13.jpg?t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Zak", "Feature Writer", "July", "Dan Zak Is A Reporter For The Washington Post.
