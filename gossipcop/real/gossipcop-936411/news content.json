The beaming bride-to-be showed no pre-wedding jitters as she stunned in a $2,165 navy dress from the Roland Mouret resort 2018 collection.\n\nThe nipped-at-the-waist, off-the-shoulder dress by the Parisian designer includes a pretty flutter detail on the skirt and asymmetric hemline. The duchess-to-be paired the double wool crepe frock with light gray suede Manolo Blahnik BB pumps and a bouncy blowout that calls to mind her soon-to-be-sister-in-law Kate Middleton\u2019s go-to style.\n\nThe bride\u2019s mom, meanwhile, looked simply chic in an ivory knee-length sheath dress the she topped with a cropped black jacket and matching pumps. She accessorized with a printed headscarf and simple clutch. She appeared at ease as she chatted with hotel staff at Cliveden House.\n\nWhile this is the first time we have seen the former Suits actress wear a piece by the French-born, London-based Mouret since getting engaged to Prince Harry in November 2017, the two are known to be friends. In fact, British press has recently speculated that the designer may even be in the running to design Meg\u2019s dress for the reception. He joins a long list of other fashion houses like Ralph & Russo (the British design team behind her engagement gown), Burberry, Stella McCartney and others rumored to be involved in the big day.\n\nHere\u2019s hoping the bride-to-be, who announced this morning that she asked Harry\u2019s dad, Prince Charles, to walk her down part of the aisle on Saturday, is able to get a bit of beauty rest!", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle01.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C2275px%2C1195px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle01.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C2275px%2C1195px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meg Storm"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/meghan-markles-2200-roland-mouret-dress-before-royal-wedding/", "title": "Meghan Markle\u2019s $2,200 Roland Mouret Dress Before Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Royal Wedding", "post-cats": "Stylish", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "With just hours to go before walking down the aisle, Meghan Markle wore a $2,200 Roland Mouret dress to have tea with Queen Elizabeth II and her mom Doria Ragland \u2014 pics", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Meghan Markle Stuns in $2,200 Dress for Tea With the Queen", "description": "With just hours to go before walking down the aisle, Meghan Markle wore a $2,200 Roland Mouret dress to have tea with Queen Elizabeth II and her mom Doria Ragland \u2014 pics", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/stylish/news/meghan-markles-2200-roland-mouret-dress-before-royal-wedding/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-18T20:41:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle01.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C2275px%2C1195px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle01.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C2275px%2C1195px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-05-18T18:29:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-18T20:41:16+00:00"}, "author": "Meg Storm", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Meghan Markle Stuns in $2,200 Dress for Tea With the Queen", "description": "With just hours to go before walking down the aisle, Meghan Markle wore a $2,200 Roland Mouret dress to have tea with Queen Elizabeth II and her mom Doria Ragland \u2014 pics", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/meghan-markle01.jpg?crop=0px%2C130px%2C2275px%2C1195px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526668199.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
