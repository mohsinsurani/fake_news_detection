They did not appear in the official portraits.\n\nLouis' famous great-grandparents, the Queen and Prince Philip, were missing in action from the ceremony. The decision was not made on health grounds. The Duke of Edinburgh stayed behind in Norfolk while Her Majesty traveled to London yesterday.\n\nPrince Louis, who was born on April 23, was christened at the Chapel Royal in St. James' Palace in London. The ceremony was private, but some familiar faces were seen arriving for the occasion, including Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Duchess Camilla, Pippa Middleton, and her husband James Matthews.\n\nAfter the ceremony, the guests gathered at Clarence House (Charles and Camilla's residence) for afternoon tea hosted by the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge. The couple served slices from a tier of their wedding cake (yes, from 2011) at the celebration.\n\nThe christening marked the first time all five Cambridges were photographed together, and now, they have official portraits to commemorate the occasion.\n\nThis post has been updated.\n\n\n\nRelated Story Meghan and Kate Compared to Diana and Sarah", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665062756.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0.0252xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/crown-prince-frederik-of-denmark-prince-vincent-of-denmark-news-photo-1664899080.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.170xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/christening-windsors-1531693277.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4x9br-1664984071.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.185xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-kate-middleton-princess-diana-1531678757.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/christening-windsors-1531693277.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-louis-christening-family-portrait-1531743240.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fekixdhxgaapvq7-1664823960.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0406xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4m769-1664893662.jpg?crop=0.644xw:0.957xh;0.0962xw,0.0430xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664976504.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.691xh;0,0.0431xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meghan-markle-wimbledon-compared-1531674192.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664895878.jpg?crop=0.527xw:1.00xh;0.237xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-louis-christening-family-portrait-1-1531744183.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-louis-christening-kate-middleton-1531744158.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664889898.jpg?crop=0.684xw:1.00xh;0.146xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-prince-louis-christening-cambridges-1531743174.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/christening-windsors-1531693277.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a22094923/prince-louis-christening-royal-family-portraits/", "title": "Prince Louis' Official Christening Portraits Are Here, and They're Gorgeous", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Prince Louis Christening Official Royal Family Portraits Released - Prince Louis Christened", "description": "Kate Middleton, Prince William, Meghan Markle, Prince Harry, Prince George, and Princess Charlotte appear in the official portraits for Prince Louis' christening, which took place on Monday July 9.
