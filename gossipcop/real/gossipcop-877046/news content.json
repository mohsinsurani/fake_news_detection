Aaron Rodgers opened up about his high-profile split from Olivia Munn in a new interview.\n\nThe NFL quarterback, 33, blamed the price of fame for placing \u201cincreased strain\u201d on his romance with the X-Men: Apocalypse actress, 37. \u201cWhen you are living out a relationship in the public eye, it\u2019s definitely \u2026 it\u2019s difficult,\u201d he explained to ESPN The Magazine in a profile published on Wednesday, August 30 \u2014 though he didn\u2019t mention her by name. \u201cIt has some extra constraints because you have other opinions abut your relationship, how it affects your work and, you know, just some inappropriate connections.\u201d\n\nThe Green Bay Packers player and The Predator star began dating in early 2014 and split in April. A source told Us Weekly exclusively at the time that complicated family dynamics likely contributed to the split. \u201cOlivia doesn\u2019t get along with his family,\u201d the insider revealed. \u201cThey think she\u2019s controlling.\u201d\n\nRodgers\u2019 family was thrust into the limelight in 2016 when his brother Jordan competed on \u2014 and won \u2014 JoJo Fletcher\u2019s season of The Bachelorette. The athlete has avoided commenting on how the ABC dating series\u2019 depicted his family and feels that such a private matter should not have been broadcasted on national television. \u201cA lot of people have family issues,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m not the only one that does. It needs to be handled the right way\u201d and not in the public eye. \u201cI think there should be a separation between your public life and your personal life. I\u2019ve always just felt like there should be a time when you don\u2019t have to be on.\u201d\n\nJust one day before the former flames\u2019 split went public, Fletcher, 26, reflected on Rodgers\u2019 family rift. \u201cI love Jordan. I love his family and I really think those topics now should be discussed within the family,\u201d the Dallas-based real estate developed told Us Weekly exclusively of her future brother-in-law. \u201cBut he has a wonderful family, they love us so much and they\u2019ve ben so supportive through everything. So I mean, I love his family.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/512955818_olivia-munn-aaron-rodgers-zoom-9dee59d0-cd2c-497e-95bf-d60dbd0d7335.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/512955818_olivia-munn-aaron-rodgers-zoom-9dee59d0-cd2c-497e-95bf-d60dbd0d7335.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aaron-rodgers-opens-up-about-olivia-munn-split-w500442/", "title": "Aaron Rodgers Opens Up About Olivia Munn Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Aaron Rodgers opened up about the difficulties he faced as a public figure trying to balance a romantic relationship \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Aaron Rodgers on Why His Relationship With Olivia Munn Was \u2018Difficult\u2019", "description": "Aaron Rodgers opened up about the difficulties he faced as a public figure trying to balance a romantic relationship \u2014 find out more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/aaron-rodgers-opens-up-about-olivia-munn-split-w500442/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:36:27+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/512955818_olivia-munn-aaron-rodgers-zoom-9dee59d0-cd2c-497e-95bf-d60dbd0d7335.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/512955818_olivia-munn-aaron-rodgers-zoom-9dee59d0-cd2c-497e-95bf-d60dbd0d7335.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-08-30T20:32:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:36:27+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Aaron Rodgers on Why His Relationship With Olivia Munn Was \u2018Difficult\u2019", "description": "Aaron Rodgers opened up about the difficulties he faced as a public figure trying to balance a romantic relationship \u2014 find out more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/512955818_olivia-munn-aaron-rodgers-zoom-9dee59d0-cd2c-497e-95bf-d60dbd0d7335.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1504125158.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
