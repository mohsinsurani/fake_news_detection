Lo / A Rotterdam trip had me on front page, though,\u201d the 31-year-old raps, possibly addressing a Jan. 2017 report that included photos of him having a meal with a woman identified as former porn star Sophie Brussaux, in the Netherlands. Brussaux claimed she was pregnant with Drake\u2019s child months later, which his rep strongly denied.\n\nLopez and Drake first sparked romance rumors back in December 2016 after the rapper was spotted (twice!) at the singer\u2019s Las Vegas show. They fueled gossip of a relationship by posting cuddly photos together on Instagram.\n\nAfter reports claimed the duo had called it quits, a source who knows them both, exclusively told PEOPLE the entertainers were never in an official relationship. \u201cIt was never very serious,\u201d said an insider close to the rapper. \u201cThey like one another and had fun together.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was and is fun when they see each other,\u201d the source added. \u201cThey love hanging out and making music together. [Jennifer] has great respect for him and his talent and he does for her as well.\u201d\n\nAppearing on The Daily Show with Trevor Noah in March, Lopez officially put the nail in the coffin, saying, \u201cLet me clear this up. I am not with Drake.\u201d The same month, a source confirmed to PEOPLE that Lopez was dating retired MLB pro Alex \u201cA-Rod\u201d Rodriguez, a romance that\u2019s been going strong ever since.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jennifer Lopez Slyly Addresses Her Rumored Romance With Drake on The Ellen DeGeneres Show\n\nDrake\u2019s new single also appeared to reference another ex \u2014 Rihanna.\n\n\u201cCaterin\u2019 is from Giorgio Baldi, Robyn\u2019s favorite,\u201d Drake says, referencing Rihanna\u2019s real name, Robyn Fenty. \u201cS\u2014 is nice, but I prefer Madeo.\u201d\n\nA source told PEOPLE the pair made their relationship official in July 2016, but were believed to be secretly dating for months before that.\n\nHowever, another insider told PEOPLE the duo \u201cspent a lot of time together and were really close but never considered themselves to be \u2018dating.\u2019 \u201d The relationship fizzled out in fall 2016.\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nThe \u201cHotline Bling\u201d singer has never shied away from showing his adoration of the Barbados-native, publicly proclaiming his love for Rihanna at the 2016 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s someone I\u2019ve been in love with since I was 22 years old,\u201d he said, before embracing the singer with a kiss. \u201cShe\u2019s one of my best friends in the world. She\u2019s a living breathing legend in our industry.\u201d", "images":
