The footage has been widely shared on social media since it was uploaded to Twitter on Thursday.\n\nIn the clip, Mr Momoa is heard to say: \u201cBut as far as sci-fi and fantasy, I love that genre.\n\n\"There's so many things you can do, like rip someone's tongue out of their throat and get away with it...rape a beautiful woman, you know?\"\n\nAfter these comments, the audience laughs while several of the actor\u2019s fellow panel members look uncomfortable.\n\nMr Momoa quickly says, \u201cnext question?\u201d and covers his face with his jacket.\n\nMany took to social media to condemn the joke. One Twitter user, Meg Ahsens, said: \u201cEveryone laughing after Jason Momoa jokes about rape IS rape culture. That laughter is why victims don't come forward.\u201d\n\nThe actor has since apologised for the remarks. In a statement posted to his Instagram account, he said: \u201cI awoke in Australia to the justified reactions by many people to a distasteful joke I made years ago in Hall H for which I am sorry. I am still severely disappointed in myself at the insensitivity of my remarks that day.\n\n\u201cI know my sincerest apology won\u2019t take away those hurtful words. Rape and sexual harassment can reach anyone and I have seen first-hand its painful torment among members of my own family and friends.\"\n\nThis footage has emerged after a flurry of allegations of rape and sexual assault made against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein.\n\n\u2715 Gwyneth Paltrow alludes to Harvey Weinstein coercion in old Letterman interview\n\nOn Thursday, Kate Beckinsale became the latest actress to accuse Mr Weinstein of harassment, saying he had made inappropriate advances when she was just 17.\n\nThe number of actresses who have come forward to accuse the producer of harassment and assault continues to grow, and now includes Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Ashley Judd.\n\nThe New York Police Department and Metropolitan Police have opened investigations into further historical allegations of assault against the mogul, whose films have been nominated for more than 300 Oscars.", "images": ["https://www.independent.co.uk/img/pixels-player-logo.svg", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/08/jason-momoa-new.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/08/jason-momoa-new.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Niamh Mcintyre"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/game-of-thrones-jason-momoa-raping-beautiful-women-joke-video-actor-comic-con-a7998056.html", "title": "Game of Thrones actor Jason Momoa joked about 'raping beautiful women' on TV show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Old footage of Jason Momoa\u00a0making\u00a0rape joke resurfaces on social media", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Americas", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/world/americas", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-10-13T09:08:16.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Game of Thrones actor said: 'I love my job so I can rape beautiful women'", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/game-of-thrones-jason-momoa-raping-beautiful-women-joke-video-actor-comic-con-a7998056.html", "type": "article", "description": "Old footage of Jason Momoa\u00a0making\u00a0rape joke resurfaces on social media", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/08/jason-momoa-new.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/08/jason-momoa-new.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-13T09:08:16.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-13T09:08:16.000Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "World", "author_name": "Niamh McIntyre", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 524, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 3, "video_count": 2, "internal_link_count": 0, "external_link_count": 3}, "date": "2017-10-13T09:08:16.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Game of Thrones actor said: 'I love my job so I can rape beautiful women'", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Old footage of Jason Momoa\u00a0making\u00a0rape joke resurfaces on social media", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/13/08/jason-momoa-new.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Jason Momoa,Game of Thrones,rape,sexual assault,Harvey Weinstein,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507885696.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
