After returning from a European book tour (that Julius Pepperwood novel must have really taken off!), Nick and Jess begin contemplating marriage. Potentially complicating matters is Jess\u2019 decision to take a job working for ex-boyfriend Russell (again played by Dermot Mulroney).\n\nIn addition, Cece and Schmidt are now parents to three-year-old daughter Ruth, with Schmidt having made the transition to stay-at-home dad. Last but not least are Winston and Aly (recurring guest star Nasim Pedrad), who are now married and expecting their first child. Winston will also be reunited with his estranged father (Curb Your Enthusiasm\u2018s J.B. Smoove).\n\nNew Girl\u2018s farewell run will feature no shortage of guest stars. In addition to those mentioned above, One Mississippi\u2018s Tig Notaro has been cast in an as-yet specified role. Returning faces include Damon Wayans Jr. (Coach), David Walton (Sam), Nelson Franklin (Robby), Sam Richardson (Dunston), and Jamie Lee Curtis and Rob Reiner (as Jess\u2019 parents).\n\nAre you looking forward to the final season of New Girl?
