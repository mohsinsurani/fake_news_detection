While delicious, those lattes aren't quite as eye-catching as the Unicorn Frappe, the neon concoction of the spring.\n\nNever fear, Starbs isn't letting a season go by without giving you something to 'gram. Halloween's creepiest drink, the Vampire Frappuccino, is officially back in at least four countries. Sadly, the bloody-looking treat hasn't been spotted in the U.S. yet, but the U.K., Singapore, Norway and Sweden all have it in stores, E! Online reports.\n\nIn case you need a refresher, the drink starts with mocha sauce, then layers a mocha frappe with strawberry puree to create a blood effect. Most also have whipped cream and more \"blood\" drizzled on top.\n\nSingapore's stores are offering two slightly different versions this year: Mr. and Mrs. Vampire Frappuccino. The Mr. version has chocolatey cereal layered on top, while the Mrs. has a pump of vanilla syrup added.\n\nFor the first time ever, Mr and Mrs #VampireFrappuccino makes a special daytime appearance. \ud83c\udf83 Click link in bio for more info.

Last year, American Starbucks' locations brought back the Frappula a few days before Halloween, but only for a few days. And since the ingredients are available year round, you can technically order it any time you want. Just ask nicely, or the barista's fangs might come out.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=700", "https://i.insider.com/5b082f545e48ec1e008b4599?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.thisisinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Madison Flager"], "canonical_link": "http://www.delish.com/food-news/news/a56187/vampire-frappucino-starbucks/", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "datePublished": "2017-10-19T17:12:42Z", "dateModified": "2017-10-19T17:12:46Z", "news_keywords": "Contributor, Food, Delish, Starbucks, Frappuccino, Halloween, Dessert, Food Contributor, Madison Flager", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "author": "Madison Flager", "article": {"publisher": "insider", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "tbi-vertical": "Food", "og": {"title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.insider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10", "image": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d69149e1cf39008b469c?width=1200&format=jpeg", "site_name": "Insider"}, "sailthru.title": "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween", "sailthru.date": "2017-10-19", "sailthru.tags": "Contributor, Food, Delish, Starbucks, Frappuccino, Halloween, Dessert, Food Contributor, Madison Flager", "sailthru.description": "Starbucks fans now have something to look forward to this Halloween with the release of Vampire Frappuccinos.", "sailthru.author": "Madison Flager", "sailthru.verticals": "food", "sailthru.image.full": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=1200&format=jpeg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://i.insider.com/59e8d6a224e30a4c008b46a0?width=160&format=jpeg", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@thisisinsider"}, "Insider": "Snapchat", "Starbucks is releasing Vampire Frappuccinos for Halloween": "The Fastest Way to Share a Moment!", "cXenseParse": {"recs": {"bii-imgalt": "starbucks vampire frappuccino"}}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"pages": 1413475698959824}, "ia": {"markup_url": "https://www.insider.com/starbucks-vampire-frappuccinos-halloween-2017-10?fbia"}, "linkedin": {"owner": "mid:1d5f7b"}, "ii-ab-test": {"newsletter-email-input": "control"}, "viking-id": "59e8d70a2f2d9241008b46b8", "env": "prod", "msapplication-config": "/public/assets/INSIDER/US/favicons/browserconfig.xml?v=2021-08", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Insider"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508367600.0, "source": "https://www.thisisinsider.com", "summary": ""}
