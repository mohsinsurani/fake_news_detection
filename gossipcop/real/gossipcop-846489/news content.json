Real Housewives of New York's Bethenny Frankel is joining forces with Million Dollar Listing New York's Fredrik Eklund for a new series that puts their love for real estate in the spotlight. Can you even contain your excitement? Because we sure can't!\n\nIf you're a true Bravo devotee, you're probably well aware this isn't the first time Frankel and Eklund have worked together, as the real estate agent notably helped the RHONY star sell the luxurious Tribeca apartment she formerly shared with her ex, Jason Hoppy. But it wasn't just any ol' real estate sell \u2014 the glamorous apartment was on and off the market in just one day, as Eklund helped find a buyer willing to cough up nearly $7 million in cash in a matter of 24 hours. That's gotta be some sort of record, right?\n\nIf the lightning-fast selling of her apartment was any indication, their teamwork is sure to make this upcoming show a real winner. The Bethenny and Frederik Project (a working title) will feature the two stars as they team up to scope out, buy, and redesign multi-million dollar properties, according to Bravo. Not only will it present tons of juicy New York real estate porn, but it'll also highlight the duo's entertaining dynamic. Frankel's wit and sharp tongue are sure to be in full force, and we're itching to see the magic unfold.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=258101201039378&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/gbKmpcDfy6k5TVU4nQD3GXufXUQ/150x150/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:sharpen-!1,0,true!-/2018/05/04/704/n/44344577/d63580195aec824b0fe5f5.54759467_19801003_1626824660661379_7533900210708487712_o/i/VictoriaMessina-avatar.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/plRjPVeKWm72h5-M7Afp9Inu8P0/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2017/04/27/837/n/1922794/f5e1905359024128810795.70680405_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_18019874_1493315519.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/docs/exit_2020_generic.jpg", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/v4773/themes/onsugar_themes/lightspeed/imgs/push_notification_icon.png", "https://www.popsugar.com/static/ck.php?nids[]=43477144&p=&u=0", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/3SG268N5ze-tTbHWXNKgIg3A6CM/75x75/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:sharpen-!1,0,true!-/2016/10/04/006/n/1922794/789bc170_edit_img_image_42484002_1475450153/i/Bethenny-Frankel-Interior-Design.png", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/soDB91lR9-RIbb6qEtRxnrN3fjY/0x214:2091x1076/fit-in/550x550/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2022/07/25/028/n/1922283/232a5cdd62df2a00058cb0.90984547_/i/britney-spears-elton-john-tiny-dancer.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035900&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=1", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/v4773/static/imgs/Download_on_the_App_Store_Badge_US-UK_135x40.svg", "https://ts.popsugar.com/b/ss/popsugarglobalprod/1/H.26--NS/?v1=casa%3Aus:nojs", "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/hqXEyRJqUtk04AHGrqzz84aDscM/fit-in/2048xorig/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-/2017/04/27/843/n/1922794/719a4126139eab85_GettyImages-457622136.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media1.popsugar-assets.com/files/thumbor/plRjPVeKWm72h5-M7Afp9Inu8P0/fit-in/1200x630/filters:format_auto-!!-:strip_icc-!!-:fill-!white!-/2017/04/27/837/n/1922794/f5e1905359024128810795.70680405_edit_img_facebook_post_image_file_18019874_1493315519.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Victoria Messina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.popsugar.com/home/Bethenny-Frankel-Fredrik-Eklund-Show-Bravo-43477144", "title": "Bethenny Frankel + Fredrik Eklund = the New Bravo Series of Your F*cking Dreams", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=1120, maximum-scale=1.0", "article": {"author": "Victoria Messina", "published_time": "2017-04-29T12:50:00-07:00"}, "author": "Victoria Messina", "description": "Brace yourself, Bravo fans, because you're about to be graced with the most glorious mashup series you've been waiting for.
