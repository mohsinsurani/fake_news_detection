To be fair it seemed like a decently accurate representation of a small-town high school (what kind of city high school only has two or three gay students?) all things considered, but newly released scenes that were cut from the final version of the film show just how much gayer it could have been.\n\nRelated | The Cast of Love, Simon Talks the Film\u2019s Emotional Coming Out Scene\n\nIn one scene Simon (Nick Robinson) has snuck into a club with his friend Nick (Jorge Lendeborg Jr.) and are approached by Colton Haynes\u2019 character when he mistakes Simon for someone else. After a brief flirtation and some prompting from Nick, Simon heads to the dancefloor with Haynes and things seems to be going well. That is, at least until he gets asked for his ID.\n\nNew video Deleted Bar Scene from #LoveSimon starring Nick Robinson. pic.twitter.com/5qLJxCDSBQ \u2014 Nick Robinson Updates (@dailynickrob) May 29, 2018\n\nIn another clip, Simon seems depressed about something and where else does one get dragged to by friends when they need cheering up but the local Eagle? Neither Simon nor Nick have any idea about the kind of crowd that frequents the Eagle, so when they freeze at the door the bouncer gives them a bit of advice.", "images": ["https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/tumblr-Out.png", "https://www.out.com/sites/all/modules/custom/heremedia_fb/images/facebook-share-button.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1586530151593576&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=259124211325942&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/Out-Logo300x107.svg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/search.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/fb-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/hulu-hellraiser-jamie-clayton-cast-interview.jpg?itok=lnjF0Axx&timestamp=1665167685", "https://www.out.com/sites/all/modules/custom/heremedia_fb/images/twitter-share-button.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/house-of-hammer.jpg?itok=4nQLCLt9&timestamp=1665166295", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/mail-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/outbanner_300x250_lilnasx_may2022.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/themes/out/logo.png", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/tw-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/outbanner_300x250_rickymartin_may2022.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/jb.jpg?itok=zx51rgWr&timestamp=1665159920", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/00_out305_covers_bros_digital_sm.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/darrenhayesstairsalindsayadler_1.jpg?itok=cXDADFHA&timestamp=1665164396", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2018/05/30/love_simon_trailer_still.jpg", "https://www.out.com/sites/out.com/themes/out/images/intgm-button.gif", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/pixie-polite.jpg?itok=b_xKp1TB&timestamp=1665157336", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/youtuber-charlie-mcdonnell-comes-out-as-transgender.jpg?itok=UpSXXIhy&timestamp=1665165744", "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/styles/image_style_360x203_1x/public/the-white-lotus-hbo-max-season-2-trailer.jpg?itok=w-BYU-BE&timestamp=1665165473"], "top_img": "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2018/05/30/love_simon_trailer_still.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.out.com/entertainment/2018/5/30/nick-robinson-meets-colton-haynes-tries-get-eagle-deleted-love-simon-scenes", "title": "Nick Robinson Tries To Go to the Eagle In Deleted \u2018Love, Simon\u2019 Scenes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Out", "fb": {"app_id": 705953026218815, "page_id": 19799718480, "pages": 19799718480}, "description": "\u201cI think you twinks want next door.\u201d", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.out.com/entertainment/2018/5/30/nick-robinson-meets-colton-haynes-tries-get-eagle-deleted-love-simon-scenes", "title": "Nick Robinson Tries To Go to the Eagle In Deleted \u2018Love, Simon\u2019 Scenes", "updated_time": "2020-04-21T16:41:57-04:00", "image": "https://www.out.com/sites/default/files/2018/05/30/love_simon_trailer_still.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": {"identifier": "outmagazine", "id": 21692297}, "title": "Nick Robinson Tries To Go to the Eagle In Deleted \u2018Love, Simon\u2019 Scenes", "description": "\u201cI think you twinks want next door.\u201d"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-30T15:25:56-04:00", "modified_time": "2020-04-21T16:41:57-04:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1527634800.0, "source": "https://www.out.com", "summary": ""}
