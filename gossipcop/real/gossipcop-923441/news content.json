I worked so hard for my home,\u201d she added.\n\nWilkinson and Basket share two kids together: son Hank IV and daughter Alijah Mary.\n\nWhile things between the former couple were rocky at first, they\u2019re now \u201cin a better place mentally,\u201d a source told PEOPLE earlier this month.\n\nRELATED ARTICLE: Kendra Wilkinson Vows to Find Her \u2018Sexy Side\u2019 Again as She Turns 33: \u2018Let\u2019s Have Some Fun\u2019\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re still finalizing the divorce and it\u2019s a whole process. But they\u2019re in communication and are in a healthier space. It\u2019s no longer toxic,\u201d the source continued. \u201cThe marriage is definitely over though and they\u2019re just trying to work through things as parents and act appropriately for their kids.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s definitely still lingering animosity and hurt feelings but that\u2019s just how they are too,\u201d said the source. \u201cThey can both be irrational and don\u2019t think before they put everything out there.\u201d", "images":
