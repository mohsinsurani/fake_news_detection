Mahoney is herself already an established filmmaker who has spent the past few years working inside the television space, including stints on DuVernay\u2019s \u201cQueen Sugar,\u201d plus \u201cGypsy,\u201d \u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy,\u201d and more. She just completed directing a pilot for CBS entitled \u201cRed Line,\u201d which was executive produced by DuVernay and fellow heavy-hitter Greg Berlanti.
