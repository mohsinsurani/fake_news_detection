But there were many more tearjerkers throughout the three-hour show, including the heroes of the Marjory Stoneman Douglas High school shooting \u2014 Aaron Feis, Scott Beigel and Chris Hixon \u2014 being posthumously named Best Coach.\n\nWhile millions of viewers watched the 2018 ESPYS live on ABC, TheWrap was inside the Microsoft Theater in downtown Los Angeles.\n\nAlso Read: Danica Patrick's ESPYs Monologue Called 'Awkward, 'Cringey' (Video)\n\nHere\u2019s what you didn\u2019t see on TV.\n\nSexual abuse survivors make a lasting impact\n\nThe Arthur Ashe Courage Award is usually presented in the middle of the show but ESPN producers wisely moved it to the end of the night, knowing the importance of the 150 sexual abuse survivors taking to the stage together. The \u201csister survivors\u201d of Nassar\u2019s abuse over the past 30 years got the entire auditorium on their feet cheering them on. \u201cThe greatest tragedy of this is that it could have been avoided \u2026 all we needed was just one adult to stand between us and Larry Nassar,\u201d Aly Raisman said in what would be the most impactful words of the night. All of the survivors stayed on the stage long after the end of the show, sharing their historic moment.\n\nCleveland fans aren\u2019t laughing\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s true that the ESPYS have never had a host like me before,\u201d Danica Patrick said to open the show as the first female host. Danica\u2019s jab at Cleveland soon sparked a groan from much of the audience \u2014 we guess there are some Browns and Cavaliers fans in the house after all. At least Odell Beckham Jr. found her joke about his hair being \u201cquestionable\u201d funny.\n\nFew Fergie fans either \u2026\n\nThe \u201creal national anthem controversy\u201d this year wasn\u2019t about NFL players kneeling, Patrick said, as a picture of Fergie butchering the anthem at the NBA All-Star game appeared on the big screen. Oops.\n\nAlex Ovechkin or Putin?\n\nThere weren\u2019t many Trump supporters in the crowd, however. The night\u2019s first political joke from Patrick \u2013 \u201cI haven\u2019t seen a Russian this pleased with Washington since \u2026 at least two days ago\u201d \u2013 was tied to the Stanley Cup Finals but we all know who it was really about. And it sparked the first big cheer of the evening.\n\nAlso Read: ESPYS Parties 2018: Snoop Dogg, Aly Raisman Kick Off Biggest Week in Sports (Updating Photos)\n\nWelcome to L.A., LeBron\n\nEveryone is on Team LeBron, it seems. When Patrick said James was the biggest off- season acquisition the crowd went wild \u2026 but there was deadly silence when she made fun of his thinning hair.\n\nOBJ\u2019s calf flash\n\nOBJ was co-presenter for Biggest Breakout Athlete but it was his legs that had the real breakout moment in a very dashing pair of designer shorts. (The actual recipient was Donovan Mitchell, who joins the realm of past winners like Tom Brady, LeBron James and Dak Prescott.) Antonio Brown later showed off his legs in shorts too, these ESPYS veterans clearly know how hot it gets on the red carpet.\n\nQuiz time\n\nThe game played in the first commercial break to entertain attendees picked on random members of the audience. First up was none other than \u201cBlack Panther\u201d star Chadwick Boseman, who thankfully knew the name of the biggest NBA scorer in league history. Seattle Seahawks QB Russell Wilson got thrown some movie trivia next but luckily he knew that Boseman starred in \u201cDraft Day.\u201d\n\nHug it out\n\nThe 27-strong US Women\u2019s Hockey team took some time to gather on stage after they won for Best Game because \u201cwe\u2019re a hugging team,\u201d admitted one of the Olympic gold medal-winning players.\n\nNational karaoke champions?\n\nThe Notre Dame women\u2019s basketball champions proved that they\u2019re not only good at scoring, they\u2019re also pretty good at karaoke. It was a little of a bumpy start when two of the players took to the stage to show off their singing skills, but like all the best teams, they had a miraculous comeback. In the next ad break however, the warmup host mistakenly said they were from Villanova.\n\nLeBron dominates the red carpet without even being there\n\nIn case you\u2019ve been living under a rock, LeBron James has signed with the LA Lakers. While the former NBA champion wasn\u2019t actually at the ESPYS, that didn\u2019t stop every athlete on the red carpet from being asked what they thought about him coming to Los Angeles.\n\nKing James was also on the mind of one audience member who called out his name when any category was announced. No. 23 for Best College Athlete? No, we don\u2019t think so. Biggest Breakthrough? Not this year.\n\nAlso Read: Tom Brady, LeBron James Lead 2018 ESPYS Nominations\n\nTop names miss TV spots\n\nThough they\u2019re arguably the best athletes in the world, Tom Brady, LeBron James and Roger Federer won categories that weren\u2019t deemed important enough to be featured on TV \u2014 possibly because they weren\u2019t able to attend the show \u2014 and their victories were announced during a TV time out.\n\nEagles fans at it again\n\nPhiladelphia Eagles fans are known for being crazy and outspoken (to politely put it), and one middle-aged fanatic in a tuxedo proved that by screaming \u201cPHILADELPHIA\u201d when QB Nick Foles won the Championship Award for his Super Bowl LII win \u2026 but it was his young son who looked really embarrassed by the outburst.\n\nJon Stewart fires up the audience\n\nJon Stewart complained about the audience\u2019s lack of response when presenting the Pat Tillman Award for Service to Jake Wood. \u201cOne cheer for the Marines? Really?\u201d which woke the crowd up to the impact of what former college football player Wood has done in countries like Haiti and for the relief effort in the wake of Hurricane Harvey with Team Rubicon, a non-profit where military veterans lead humanitarian missions to disaster areas.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s also super tall and annoyingly handsome. Last night I saw him making his pregnant wife a hot coffee. I really don\u2019t like this guy,\u201d Stewart said bitterly.\n\nThe former \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d host\u2019s kick up the ass of the crowd \u2014 plus a very moving video of Team Rubicon\u2019s work \u2014 earned Wood the first standing ovation of the night. And yes, he really did make Stewart look short.\n\nAlso Read: WWE Superstars, US Women's Ice Hockey Team Among ESPN Sports Humanitarian Awards Winners\n\nLaila Ali can throw a punch and hold a high note\n\nMuhammad Ali will go down in history as the best boxer ever, but who knew his daughter Laili Ali could belt out a song like Whitney Houston? When passed the mic in a break, Laili showed off her knockout singing chops and some hot dance moves. Oh, and she can box too. In related news, the NFL\u2019s top rookies cannot sing \u2026\n\nAlso Read: Jim Kelly to Receive Jimmy V Perseverance Award at ESPYS\n\nKelly Tough\n\nESPN named Wednesday the official Jimmy V Day in honor of the legendary college basketball coach who made a historic speech about battling cancer. Many athletes including NFL defensive end Calais Campbell wore Jimmy V pins on the red carpet in their support of cancer research. Former Buffalo Bills QB Jim Kelly was later honored with the 2018 Jimmy V Award for Perseverance \u2013 and his heartbreaking story of fighting adversity and \u201cnever giving up\u201d brought many in the audience to tears. Kelly, whose cancer of the jaw returned this year, delivered another historical speech despite his struggling to speak and needing help to the stage from his two daughters. ESPN host Cari Champion went on to announce that $1.8 million has been raised in the past two days that will go directly to the Stuart Scott Memorial Cancer Research Fund.", "images":
