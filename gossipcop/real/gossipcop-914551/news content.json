When the star failed to return, the venue's lights came on and security officials told the crowd to head towards the doors.\n\nMarilyn Manson in the press room during The Fashion Awards 2016 at the Royal Albert Hall, London\n\nOne concert-goer told Newsday, \"He was too messed up and couldn't perform. It was disappointing,\" while another vented on Twitter, \"Marilyn Manson put on the WORST show I have ever seen. Played 5 songs, b**ched about people not saying 'I Love You' and walked off\". Many attendees are now calling on promoters to issue a refund for the gig, which had originally been due to take place in October but had to be postponed after Manson broke his leg in an onstage mishap in New York in late September.\n\nThe star returned to the stage in November and has been performing with a cast on his leg ever since. Representatives for Manson have yet to comment on the status of the Heaven Upside Down Tour, which had been due to continue in New Jersey on Friday night.\n\nOnline Editors", "images":
