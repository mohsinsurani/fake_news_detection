Originally set for June 15th, it\u2019s now been delayed until August 10th.\n\nThe rapper made the announcement during an Instagram live stream today. \u201cThe label wanted me to put my album since 10,000 years ago, of course,\u201d Minaj said (via SPIN). \u201cI love my label, but I\u2019m happy that I\u2019ve always been blessed to have the freedom and creativity to do what I want, how I want it, when I want.\u201d\n\n\u201cTrust me, it\u2019s the better choice,\u201d Minaj continued, adding that the delay was due to \u201cperfectionism\u201d on her part. \u201cI can\u2019t give y\u2019all half-ass shit, I just refuse to.\u201d\n\nWhile fans have to wait an extra two months, Minaj said she has a few reveals planned in the coming weeks, including the album artwork.\n\nQueen is Minaj\u2019s fourth album overall, serving as the follow-up to 2014\u2019s The Pinkprint. Thus far, she\u2019s teased the LP with two singles, \u201cBarbie Tingz\u201d and \u201cChun-Li\u201d. She also recently appeared on Saturday Night Live, though it wasn\u2019t without controversy.\n\nRevisit the video for \u201cChun-Li\u201d:", "images": ["https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dan-harmon-chevy-chase-community-movie-i-dont-even-know-if-its-legal.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/IMG_5626.png?quality=80&resize=330,330", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1753966171496536&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8c8765d55590578836979964bab89c3?s=48&d=identicon&r=g", "https://developer.apple.com/app-store/marketing/guidelines/images/badge-example-preferred_2x.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mike-Patton.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicki-minaj-2018-new-songs.png?w=1000&h=580&crop=1&resize=1031%2C580&quality=80&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Mike-Patton.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicki-minaj-2018-new-songs.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/derry-girls-netflix.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://play.google.com/intl/en_us/badges/static/images/badges/en_badge_web_generic.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/right-said-fred-beyonce-im-too-sexy.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21854097&c3=&c4=https://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-queen-release-delay/&c5=News&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://consequenceofsound.net/wp-content/themes/cosv2/images/c15.png", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/right-said-fred-beyonce-im-too-sexy.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Hans-Zimmer-photo-by-Lee-Kirby.jpg?quality=80&w=278&h=156&crop=1&resize=278%2C156&strip", "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/dan-harmon-chevy-chase-community-movie-i-dont-even-know-if-its-legal.jpg?quality=80&w=79&h=79&crop=1&resize=79%2C79&strip"], "top_img": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicki-minaj-2018-new-songs.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lake Schatz"], "canonical_link": "https://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-queen-release-delay/", "title": "Nicki Minaj pushes back release date for new album Queen", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "msapplication-TileColor": "#2f2e2a", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "fb": {"app_id": 434175690014}, "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "msvalidate.01": "8CABEAF0C9CE91FCEDBFB11C38206EE5", "description": "Originally due next month, her fourth LP is now arriving in August.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Nicki Minaj pushes back release date for new album Queen", "description": "Originally due next month, her fourth LP is now arriving in August.", "url": "https://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-queen-release-delay/", "site_name": "Consequence", "image": {"identifier": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicki-minaj-2018-new-songs.png", "width": 1000, "height": 711, "type": "image/png"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/consequence/", "published_time": "2018-05-24T19:38:43+00:00"}, "author": "Lake Schatz", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@consequence", "site": "@consequence"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.9.4", "parsely-title": "Nicki Minaj pushes back release date for new album Queen", "parsely-link": "http://consequence.net/2018/05/nicki-minaj-queen-release-delay/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nicki-minaj-2018-new-songs.png?w=150", "parsely-pub-date": "<span class=\"localtime\" data-ltformat=\"Y-m-d\\TH:i:s\\Z\" data-lttime=\"2018-05-24T19:38:43+00:00\">2018-05-24T19:38:43Z</span>", "parsely-section": "News", "parsely-tags": "album delay,album release dates,hip-hop,rap,rap music news", "parsely-author": "Lake Schatz", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://consequence.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/cropped-correct-blue.jpg?quality=80&w=270"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wpm07-BGJnE?version=3&rel=1&showsearch=0&showinfo=1&iv_load_policy=1&fs=1&hl=en-US&autohide=2&wmode=transparent"], "publish_date": 1527190723.0, "source": "https://consequenceofsound.net", "summary": ""}
