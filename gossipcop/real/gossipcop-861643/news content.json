She also had a buildup of fatty tissue in the walls of her arteries.\n\nThe coroner said Fisher\u2019s manner of death would be listed as undetermined.\n\nIn a statement to the AP, the late movie star\u2019s brother, Todd Fisher, said he was not surprised by the findings. \u201cWe\u2019re not enlightened. There\u2019s nothing about this that is enlightening,\u201d he said. \u201cI would tell you, from my perspective that there\u2019s certainly no news that Carrie did drugs. I am not shocked that part of her health was affected by drugs.\u201d\n\nCarrie battled drug addiction and mental illness for many years. In her books and live performances, she candidly opened up about smoking marijuana at age 13, using LSD by 21 and being diagnosed with bipolar disorder at 24.\n\n\u201c[She] battled drug addiction and mental illness her entire life,\u201d the Wishful Drinking author\u2019s daughter, actress Billie Lourd, said in a statement to Us after the coroner\u2019s results were released. \u201cShe ultimately died of it. She was purposefully open in all of her work about the social stigmas surrounding these diseases. \u2026 I know my Mom, she\u2019d want her death to encourage people to be open about their struggles. Seek help, fight for government funding for mental health programs. Shame and those social stigmas are the enemies of progress to solutions and ultimately a cure. Love you Momby.\u201d\n\nJust one day after Carrie\u2019s death, her mother, movie icon Debbie Reynolds, died at age 84.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carrie-fisher-7610d05b-ed7f-47d7-8bbf-c8ac55eb22f6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3026px%2C1588px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carrie-fisher-7610d05b-ed7f-47d7-8bbf-c8ac55eb22f6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3026px%2C1588px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/carrie-fisher-cause-of-death-actress-died-of-sleep-apnea-w488443/", "title": "Carrie Fisher Cause of Death: Actress Died of Sleep Apnea", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Carrie Fisher died from sleep apnea and a combination of other undetermined factors, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Carrie Fisher Died of Sleep Apnea, Coroner Says", "description": "Carrie Fisher died from sleep apnea and a combination of other undetermined factors, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/carrie-fisher-cause-of-death-actress-died-of-sleep-apnea-w488443/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:57:57+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carrie-fisher-7610d05b-ed7f-47d7-8bbf-c8ac55eb22f6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3026px%2C1588px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carrie-fisher-7610d05b-ed7f-47d7-8bbf-c8ac55eb22f6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3026px%2C1588px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-06-17T13:52:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:57:57+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Carrie Fisher Died of Sleep Apnea, Coroner Says", "description": "Carrie Fisher died from sleep apnea and a combination of other undetermined factors, the Los Angeles County coroner's office said \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/carrie-fisher-7610d05b-ed7f-47d7-8bbf-c8ac55eb22f6.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C3026px%2C1588px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497707520.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
