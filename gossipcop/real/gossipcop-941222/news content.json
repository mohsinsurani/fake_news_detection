Photo: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nNearly a week after ABC canceled Roseanne following the star\u2019s racist tweet, co-star Sara Gilbert spoke on her other show, The Talk, about the sitcom\u2019s end. Gilbert was an executive producer on the revival and one of the driving forces to get it to happen. She was one of the first to speak out on Twitter against Barr\u2019s tweet last Tuesday, before ABC canceled the series. \u201cIn addition to my statement, I would like to say this has been a very difficult week,\u201d Gilbert said. \u201cA lot of people have been hurt by this. I will say I\u2019m proud of the show we made. This show has always been about diversity, love, and inclusion. And it\u2019s sad to see it end in this way. I\u2019m sad for the people who lost their jobs in the process. However, I do stand behind the decision ABC made.\u201d\n\nABC is reportedly looking into ways to reformat Roseanne without its star, including a show possibly centered on Gilbert\u2019s character Darlene, though Gilbert and the network haven\u2019t commented on those reports.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/177/b51/209993c1cf2dd03bd588eb1597d2e0f682-04-sara-gilbert.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/177/b51/209993c1cf2dd03bd588eb1597d2e0f682-04-sara-gilbert.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/177/b51/209993c1cf2dd03bd588eb1597d2e0f682-04-sara-gilbert.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackson Mchenry"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/sara-gilbert-i-do-stand-behind-roseanne-cancellation.html", "title": "Sara Gilbert: \u2018I Do Stand Behind\u2019 \u2018Roseanne\u2019 Cancellation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "sara gilbert, roseanne, roseanne barr, tv, cancellations, top story, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Sara Gilbert on Roseanne Cancellation: \u2018I Do Stand Behind the Decision\u2019", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/06/sara-gilbert-i-do-stand-behind-roseanne-cancellation.html", "description": "\u201cA lot of people have been hurt by this.
