Entourage Spotted at Los Angeles Hospital with Two Car Seats \u2014 Report\n\nby 0 Shares\n\nAdvertisement\n\nRumors have circulated over the past few weeks that Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay Z are going the extra mile when it comes to the birth to their twins, even building their own maternity ward in-house. A new report claims, however, that the couple are ready to welcome the newest Carter kids just as they did Blue Ivy, as friends and family of the celebrity couple have been spotted at a Los Angeles hospital.\n\nFriends of Bey and Hov were reportedly seen at an L.A. medical facility last night, June 13, according to sources at HollywoodLife. Those same close friends were reportedly seen carrying evidence that proves the 35-year-old songstress may literally be in labor as we speak.\n\nCredit: Instagram\n\n\u201cBeyonce\u2019s security was seen leaving her Beverly Hills home this morning carrying two baby seats to the same hospital in West LA.\n\n\u201cBey and Jay\u2019s large security team, including three well-staffed Escalades, are now waiting outside the hospital for the arrival of the twins.\u201d\n\nWhile all signs point to the twins arriving any minute now, Queen Bey and hubby Jay are pros when it comes to keeping things under wraps.\n\nSome believe the hospital trip could have been a false alarm, a common occurrence for women in their third trimester.\n\nCredit: Tidal\n\nStill, Beyonce\u2019s official due date was June 12, just one day before her crew was spotted on the scene.\n\nCredit: Beyonce.com", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/katy-perry-taylor-swift-320x223-1448466511.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/18513979_127033501197412_8486791630991392768_n-1024x759.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/GettyImages-635001998.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/carly-waddell-evan-bass-wedding-date-320x223-1496951680.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-zoom-55a7c33d-705a-429c-bdf8-a799cb1eb7f1.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/jenelle-evans-book-cover-320x223.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/kenya-320x223-1497386136.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/18947586_107960249809740_8163809231338733568_n-320x223.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-zoom-55a7c33d-705a-429c-bdf8-a799cb1eb7f1-640x480-1497449741.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-wearable-art-683x1024.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/corinne-demario-320x223-1497292239.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/loading.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-blue-ivy-zoom-0fbd5eef-e788-4476-9236-9ff5cd5e84af.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/themes/wetpaint4/library/images/wetpaint.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712im_/http://www.wetpaint.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/beyonce-zoom-55a7c33d-705a-429c-bdf8-a799cb1eb7f1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170614155712/http://www.wetpaint.com/beyonce-in-labor-la-hospital-1597794/", "title": "Is Beyonce in Labor?!
