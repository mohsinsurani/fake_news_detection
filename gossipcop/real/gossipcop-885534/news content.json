This video makes it seem that way. This weekend, Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz posted a video of Brooklyn Beckham giving her a pretty long kiss on the cheek. That might seem somewhat innocent, but if you think about their backstory, it could be a very big clue.\n\nMoretz and Beckham first sparked interest when they were linked together back in 2016. However, the relationship didn\u2019t last too long \u2014 they broke up, and Beckham had a few interviews where he mentioned he was single. But even if they\u2019re nothing but friends these days, it seems like they parted on excellent terms.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZ8sNULAZGl\n\nBut, let\u2019s get real here. While they haven\u2019t openly admitted it, we\u2019re under the impression that it\u2019s more than friendship. The most important thing is that they seem to be incredibly happy.\n\nRumors sparked that the two had reunited back in August, when they were both spotted out together in New York City.\n\nJust a few days ago, Beckham posted a sweet photo of their matching checkered Vans on Instagram, which is simply sweet.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BZ1HBkKDT_B\n\nThe video of the kiss looks like it happened in Dublin. Both Beckham and Moretz were in town to check out a rugby match, and Beckham posted this photo celebrating the occasion on Instagram.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BaASVrkj8h9\n\nWhile it looks like Moretz took the photo in question, Beckham\u2019s account has a ton of gorgeously shot photos, many which include both of them. It could be because he\u2019s a photographer who just recently released his very first book called What I See.\n\nSo, it\u2019s good to follow Beckham\u2019s account for the beautiful photos, but it\u2019s an added bonus to get even more clues about his mysterious love life.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/09/brooklyn-beckham-chloe-grace-moretz-couple.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/happy-woman-smiling-fall-leaves-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/09/brooklyn-beckham-chloe-grace-moretz-couple.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/09/brooklyn-beckham-chloe-grace-moretz-couple.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/chloe-grace-moretz-posted-an-adorable-video-of-brooklyn-beckham-giving-her-a-kiss-on-the-cheek/", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz posted an adorable video of Brooklyn Beckham giving her a kiss on the cheek - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham may or may not be back \"on,\" but they look happy no matter what.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz posted an adorable video of Brooklyn Beckham giving her a kiss on the cheek - HelloGiggles", "description": "Chlo\u00eb Grace Moretz and Brooklyn Beckham may or may not be back \"on,\" but they look happy no matter what.", "url": "https://hellogiggles.com/chloe-grace-moretz-posted-an-adorable-video-of-brooklyn-beckham-giving-her-a-kiss-on-the-cheek/", "site_name": "HelloGiggles", "image": {"identifier": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/10/09/brooklyn-beckham-chloe-grace-moretz-couple.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "width": 893, "height": 890, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-09T11:42:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-17T22:08:52+00:00"}, "author": "karen belz", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "karen belz", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#b58c2c", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/ms-icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/themes/hello-giggles/favicon/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507549368.0, "source": "https://hellogiggles.com", "summary": ""}
