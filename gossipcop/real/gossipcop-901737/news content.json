Looking like an Olympian, however, takes just a few hours.\n\nAfter proving their ability on the ice or the slopes, athletes must tackle one final hurdle. It\u2019s what Team USA calls \u201cteam processing\u201d or what every kid knows as a game of dress-up.\n\nTODAY got a close, behind-the-scenes look at the U.S. Olympic wardrobe in Seoul, South Korea, where athletes \u2014 including Shaun White and Kelly Clark \u2014 dress to impress.\n\nChecklist in hand, athletes complete the fitting with the same impressive determination as they practice in sport.\n\nFor the opening ceremony, athletes geared up in Ralph Lauren parkas and bomber jackets. The all-American brand amped up the tech with heating components embedded in an American flag design on every jacket. For non-Olympians, the coat costs more than $2,000.\n\nThe Ralph Lauren coat boasts a heating system made from electronic-printed conductive inks, pressed in the shape of an American flag with a carbon and silver solution. TODAY\n\nOther hot \u2014 while not necessarily heated \u2014 items included a vintage-inspired wool sweater in red, white and blue color-blocking, fringed suede gloves and, Alexa Knierim\u2019s favorite, the hoodie-footie pajamas.\n\n\u201cOkay so this is the hottest thing around right now, it is the team USA onesie,\u201d the figure skater told TODAY while she modeled the adorably cozy gear. \u201cYou can dance, you can go to the cafeteria in it, I can do whatever I want.\u201d\n\n\"I've never had gloves that would give me bangs,\" laughed figure skater Adam Rippon of the boldly fringed design. TODAY\n\nWhen it came time to shop for less practical items \u2014 like diamond-encrusted Olympic rings \u2014 teammates Kelly Clark and Maddie Mastro helped each other abandon their buyer\u2019s remorse.\n\n\u201cIs it worth it?\u201d Mastro asked Clark, a seasoned Olympian with five rings of her own. \u201cIt\u2019s worth it,\u201d Clark answered definitively.\n\nSnowboarder Kelly Clark showed off her Olympic rings for the camera. TODAY\n\nA few hours later, athletes left with two big bags filled with more than 50 pieces of clothing, all \"processed\" and finally ready for Pyeongchang.\n\nLike the wrapping paper on a special gift, the Olympic gear makes the games all the more surreal for its dedicated athletes.\n\n\"It kinda hits you when you start putting on this stuff and looking in the mirror. Like, 'Oh my God, I'm actually here and doing it!'\" half-pipe star Mastro told TODAY.", "images":
