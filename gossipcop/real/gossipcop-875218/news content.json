She landed a six-figure deal for that book. The film rights were optioned and it is being adapted into a television series. She is working on a political humor book as well as a scripted TV series based on her life in New York City.\n\nPersonal Life\n\nCarole Radziwill married Prince Anthony Radziwill on August 27, 1994, in East Hampton, New York.

His mother, Caroline Lee Bouvier Radziwill is the youngest sister of former first lady Jackie Kennedy. His cousins are Caroline Kennedy Schlossberg and John F. Kennedy Jr.\n\nAnthony Radziwell died after a battle with cancer. He was originally diagnosed with testicular cancer in 1989. Then, shortly before his wedding, new tumors appeared. He battled metastasizing cancer throughout the five years of his marriage. Carole was his primary caregiver at this time. He died on August 10, 1999. He was 40 years old.\n\nCarolyn Bessette Kennedy was her best friend.

Radziwill has said she was friendly with Maxwell in the early 2000s but hasn't talked to her in more than a decade. She said she never knew Epstein.\n\nIn August 2020, Radziwill took to Twitter to weigh in on the exit of Dorinda Medley from \"The Real Housewives of New York City.\" She said: \"Dorinda was only 'real' HW. So no more truth-telling too. Trust me that's a main reason cast is let go. Telling the truth & exposing fake cast members & their story-lines & how it's all manipulated by production.\"\n\nReal Estate\n\nCarole Radziwill owns a two-bedroom townhouse in the SoHo neighborhood of New York City. She's lived in the townhouse since 2002, having purchased it for $975,000.\n\nPreviously, she and her late husband lived in an apartment on Park Avenue.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1471602713096627&ev=NoScript", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cr.jpg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=7516694&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cr2.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://vz.cnwimg.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/cr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.celebritynetworth.com/richest-celebrities/authors/carole-radziwill-net-worth/", "title": "Carole Radziwill Net Worth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Carole Radziwill is a journalist, author, and reality television star who has a net worth of $5 million.
