Chris, why don\u2019t you pick the first box,\u201d said Fallon, as Pratt took suggestions from the audience on which box to pick.\n\nAfter selecting his first box, Fallon asked how much it weighs. Pratt shrugged and said, \u201c125 pounds.\u201d\n\nPratt showed the inside of his box to the audience, which was a diorama of Snow White\u2019s seven dwarves doing yoga. \u201cIs this real,\u201d began Pratt. \u201cThis is a small diorama of little people- dwarves- engaging in stretching, yoga, and they\u2019re all wearing hats.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re telling me that what is in front of you,\u201d said Fallon while laughing, \u201cis a diorama of sorts, which is something I normally would make in a shoebox, perhaps maybe when I was growing up, which is maybe why you thought of that because we have a box and you thought of a shoebox and you made up a lie about a diorama which makes me think Chris Pratt, you lie!\u201d\n\nPratt showed Fallon the diorama and exclaimed, \u201cSucka!\u201d\n\nFallon then selected his box and pretended that he was struggling to move it on the table. \u201cWow, that must be very heavy,\u201d said Pratt. \u201cYou\u2019re trying to hide how heavy it is.\u201d\n\nThe host reveled his mystery item to the audience, which was a \u201cvibrating Jell-O mold of Jeff Goldblum.\u201d Fallon joked, \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be surprised if you had one of these at home.\u201d\n\n\u201cI think you\u2019re telling the truth,\u201d said Pratt. \u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d shouted Fallon as he showed the Jell-O mold to Pratt.\n\n\u201cI do have one of those at home,\u201d said Pratt. Fallon responded, \u201cI have two of them cause they\u2019re just so much fun.\u201d\n\nPratt closed his eyes while removing his last mystery object from the box. After making a disgusted sound, he asked, \u201cIs that real?\u201d The object in question was a toy dinosaur dressed as a ballerina while spinning on a platform.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s very nice to do this to this thing,\u201d said Pratt. \u201cMaybe it\u2019s an omnivorous uhh creature, but it\u2019s,\u201d he said as he struggled to put his description into words.\n\n\u201cAre you trying to use big words to trick me?\u201d asked Fallon.\n\nPratt continued, \u201cIt\u2019s a skull and it\u2019s bedazzled. I think it might be a raccoon or it could be maybe a fox.\u201d\n\nFallon asked if the object is a herbivore or carnivore. Pratt responded, \u201cIt\u2019s got pointy teeth, so I think it\u2019s maybe a predator or maybe it\u2019s something that eats a bunch of stuff like a raccoon or like a possum or something.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s interesting because last time you lied to me. No, you told the truth but you acted like you were lying. Like you didn\u2019t know,\u201d said Fallon. \u201cNow you\u2019re acting like you don\u2019t know. Like, \u2018I don\u2019t know. It could be a thing. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019ve never seen teeth before.\u2019 You\u2019ve never seen teeth before? That\u2019s the most ridiculous thing I\u2019ve ever heard of. You have teeth. You brush them everyday in the morning and at night.\u201d Fallon concluded, \u201cChris Pratt, you are telling the truth!\u201d\n\n\u201cNo I\u2019m not!\u201d said Pratt as she showed Fallon the ballerina dinosaur.\n\n\u201cYou are a master!
