He doesn\u2019t have a lot of time,\ufffd? Patti said. \u201cThis is not something to play around with. Network antics aside, me and Andy [Cohen] have been texting and emailing, and this last week, Bethenny did send a basket of goodies to Bobby.\ufffd?\n\nPatti added, \u201cAt the end of the day, if you get sick\u2014like Bobby\u2014you need support, and we can all get sick.\ufffd?\n\nPatti also says she hopes that Bethenny and Jill can reconcile and move forward with their problems.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sick of the feud. I hope it ends,\ufffd? Patti admitted. \u201c[Bethenny and I] have a lot in common. She\u2019s single. It\u2019s not easy being a single woman. I don\u2019t care how much money you have.\ufffd?\n\nMeanwhile, Jill\u2019s husband Bobby continues to battle thyroid cancer and a brain tumor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a difficult year since his brain tumor diagnosis but ironically that\u2019s not even the issue,\ufffd? Jill previously told E! News. \u201cHis papillary thyroid cancer has morphed into something called anaplastic thyroid cancer. It\u2019s very, very rare.\ufffd?\n\nAdding, \u201cRight now Bobby\u2019s okay, he\u2019s stable. Our friends have been unbelievable in rallying around us.\ufffd?\n\nI\u2019m so happy to hear that Bethenny sent Bobby and Jill a gift. I\u2019m sure that the couple appreciates it so much. Perhaps this is the first step in Bethenny and Jill ending their feud.\n\nAre you surprised Bethenny sent Bobby and Jill a gift? Do you think Jill and Bethenny can end their feud and be friends? Does Jill need all the support she can get as Bobby\u2019s health deteriorates?\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Instagram.\n\nFollow AllAboutTRH On Twitter.\n\nLike AllAboutTRH On Facebook.\n\nFollow the AllAboutTRH Podcast on iTunes & Soundcloud \u2013 Remember to Rate, Comment & Subscribe!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/peggy-sulahian.png?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/RHONJ-Season-8-Cast-All-About-the-Tea.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-140x140.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Lisa-Rinna-.gif?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/RHOBH-Season-7-cast.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/danielle-staub-jacqueline-laurita-feud-rhonj-season-7-return.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rs_1024x759-170816084417-1024-bethenny-frankel-jill-bobby-zarin.jpg?fit=990%2C734", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i1.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/JacquelineChris.png?resize=300%2C168", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/plugins/jetpack/modules/sharedaddy/images/loading.gif?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/dish-071216-siggy-teresa.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/all-about-trh-logo.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://blog-cdn.feedspot.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Celebrity-Gossip-100-transparent_216px.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i2.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/Siggy.jpg?resize=150%2C150", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-logo-lips-small.png?x85829", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rs_1024x759-170816084417-1024-bethenny-frankel-jill-bobby-zarin.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/https://i0.wp.com/www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/aatrh-white.png?w=1320", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/lara-112x112.png?x85829"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406im_/http://www.allabouttrh.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/rs_1024x759-170816084417-1024-bethenny-frankel-jill-bobby-zarin.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lara Sophia", "Hw Junkie"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170820091406/http://www.allabouttrh.com/2017/08/17/bethenny-frankel-extends-support-jill-zarins-husband-bobby-amid-cancer-battle/", "title": "Bethenny Frankel Extends Support to Jill Zarin's Husband Bobby Amid Cancer Battle - The Real Housewives", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bethenny Frankel Extends Support to Jill Zarin's Husband Bobby Amid Cancer Battle - The Real Housewives | News.
