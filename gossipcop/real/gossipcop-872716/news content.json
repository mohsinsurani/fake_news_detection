In a video obtained by TMZ, Spears engaged the crowd, initially unaware that a man had climbed onto the stage, attempting to get her attention. Quick-thinking dancers encircled the crasher until security agents arrived onstage and surrounded the headliner.\n\nX17Online/YouTube\n\n\u201cIs something OK?\u201d Spears asked. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on? What\u2019s wrong?\u201d Then \u2014 visibly frightened \u2014 she gasped, \u201cHe\u2019s got a gun?\u201d Her mic was switched off as she was rushed to safety offstage. Loyal fans voiced their support, chanting, \u201cWe love you!\u201d\n\n(Warning: The video above contains graphic language.)\n\nThe man (who did not have a gun) struggled with security, even kicking a member of the force as he executed a cartwheel. Muscular members of her dance squad gathered to subdue the man until more security guards arrived, at which point the intruder was restrained and escorted offstage to chants of \u201cA\u2013hole! from the crowd. Before he was ejected from the theater, the man succeeded in kneeing one of the guards.\n\nLas Vegas law enforcement officials told PEOPLE that the intruder was 37-year-old Jess Webb, who apparently had been acting disorderly during the performance. After allegedly being asked to leave, Webb leapt to the stage. He was arrested for trespassing after the incident.\n\n\u201cOn Aug. 9, 2017, officers from the LVMPD arrested 37-year-old Jesse Webb for trespassing during a Britney Spears concert. Webb was asked to leave the concert by security prior to him jumping on stage and dancing,\u201d the statement read. \u201cWebb was transported to the Clark County Detention Center.\u201d\n\nLas Vegas Metropolitan Police Department\n\nJust before the show, Spears had tweeted a warm message to her Vegas audience.\n\nShe\u2019s scheduled to return to the stage on Friday. A rep for Spears did not immediately return PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.", "images":
