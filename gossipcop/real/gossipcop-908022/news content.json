The first instalment of the campaign saw Solange, Kelela and Dev Hynes model both denim and underwear into one whilst the second instalment saw A$AP Rocky and his A$AP Mob swag their way through a barn in the famous jeans. The most recent edition saw supermodel Cindy Crawford\u2019s children Kaia and Presley Gerber show us what it means to be family \u2013 the main focus of the campaign.\n\nWhen it comes to famous families there probably isn\u2019t one that stands out more than the Kardashians (even if it is just because you love to hate them), making them the perfect choice to front the latest set of images. Fronted by the Kardashian and Jenner sisters (Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kendall and Kylie if you needed reminding), it sees them in white underwear lounging on a giant blanket from the SS18 show.\n\nElsewhere, Kim wears a Canadian Tux (double denim if you\u2019re not familiar) and Kylie sports a matching black and white set from the runway show. Although Khloe and Kourtney have not been the faces of any high fashion campaigns before, Kim starred in Balmain\u2019s AW16 campaign alongside husband Kanye. Kylie and Kendall also fronted the AW15 season for the Parisian house. Not to mention Marc Jacobs, Fendi, Givenchy under Kendall\u2019s belt too.\n\nThe campaign drops at a time where rumours are circling as to whether Kylie is pregnant or not. Eagle-eyed fans will note that she is pictured artfully covering her stomach with a CK blanket. Conspiracy?! No doubt Kris\u2019s plan for the family (and new baby \u2013 hi Chicago!) will be unveiled soon. Meanwhile, the campaign will continue to run throughout the season. Keep an eye out for who will front it next.", "images": ["https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/900/azure/dazed-prod/1230/1/1231728.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAwACAPcAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAACH5BAEAAP8ALAAAAAADAAIAAAgGAP8JHBgQADs=", "https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/900/0-21-900-600/azure/dazed-prod/1230/1/1231728.jpg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=357833301087547&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/png;base64,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", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/900/0-21-900-600/azure/dazed-prod/1230/1/1231728.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/38751/1/calvin-klein-kim-kourtney-khloe-kardashian-kylie-kendall-jenner-campaign", "title": "Calvin Klein cast the Kardashian (and Jenner) sisters for its new campaign", "meta_data": {"author": "Dazed", "keywords": "art,fashion,film,music,ideas,ideas sharing network,dazed & confused, dazed, dazed & confused magazine, dazed and confused, dazed and confused magazine,dazed+confused,dazeddigital", "description": "Kim, Khloe, Kourtney, Kylie and Kendall are the latest to front the #MYCALVINS series", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 249814310818, "pages": 23596074088}, "ahrefs-site-verification": "debf75f21fc4e16fb832e869976daffd1a5752328ffd454d8f64fb19173c449e", "og": {"site_name": "Dazed", "title": "Calvin Klein cast the Kardashian (and Jenner) sisters for its new campaign", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/38751/1/calvin-klein-kim-kourtney-khloe-kardashian-kylie-kendall-jenner-campaign", "image": "https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/900/0-21-900-600/azure/dazed-prod/1230/1/1231728.jpg"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-22T19:53:00+00:00", "section": "Fashion"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Dazed", "url": "https://www.dazeddigital.com/fashion/article/38751/1/calvin-klein-kim-kourtney-khloe-kardashian-kylie-kendall-jenner-campaign", "title": "Calvin Klein cast the Kardashian (and Jenner) sisters for its new campaign", "image": "https://dazedimg-dazedgroup.netdna-ssl.com/600/0-21-900-600/azure/dazed-prod/1230/1/1231728.jpg", "description": "Kim, Khloe, Kourtney, Kylie and Kendall are the latest to front the #MYCALVINS series"}, "theme-color": "#222222"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516650780.0, "source": "http://www.dazeddigital.com", "summary": ""}
