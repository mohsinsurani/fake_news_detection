All season long I've partnered with Cheerios to encourage people to do One Million Acts of Good, and if you're here in my audience, you helped us reach that goal.\"\n\nEllen then told the audience to check under their seats to see if they had a box of the breakfast snack, as every lucky chair would be winning a prize. When every person in the 400 capacity studio lifted up a box, Ellen revealed they would be getting an equal share of a whopping $1 million.\n\nShe continued: \"Thanks to every single person in this audience, it is filled with goodness and we have reached one million acts of good because of all of you. So, I wanna do something that we've never done before. This is big, okay?\n\n\"If you have a box of Cheerios under your seat, I'm going to give you a special surprise gift. So check and see if you have a box of Cheerios under your seat. What a coincidence that all of you would get a box of Cheerios.\n\n\"You're all going to share this gift. It's the biggest gift I've ever given anybody, ever. And I hope you continue to pay it forward and share all the good. Hold onto your Cheerios because all of you are splitting one million dollars! That's a lot of money!\"\n\nAmong the people in the audience were a teacher who donated a kidney to a student's mother, a couple who drive 800 miles to deliver supplies during Hurricane Harvey, and a man who quit his job to start a sanctuary for farm animals.\n\nEllen's studio holds 400 people, so if the venue was full at the time, each person walked away with $2,500.\n\n- Bang!
