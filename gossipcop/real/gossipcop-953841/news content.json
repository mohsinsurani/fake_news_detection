But I\u2019m scared so for now it\u2019s all about contour.\u201d\n\nKhloe Kardashian/Instagram\n\nKardashian, who became a first-time mom to daughter True Thompson in April, has been open with her opinions about plastic surgery in the past.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s this misconception that I\u2019m not into plastic surgery, but I\u2019m into it and I don\u2019t care if you have it,\u201d the reality star told Cosmopolitan in 2016.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all putting on a f\u2014\u2014 mask basically every day anyway,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen you dye your hair, you\u2019re changing who you are, and I don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything wrong with that.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s when women choose to go under the knife for their significant other that Kardashian has a problem with it.\n\n\u201cI just don\u2019t like when someone else is like, \u2018Man, I only want to date a girl if they have big tits,\u2019 and then a girl\u2019s like, \u2018I gotta get double-Ds,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cIf you want them, great. If you\u2019re doing that for your man, that\u2019s when it bothers me.\u201d\n\nJB Lacroix/WireImage\n\nShe also prefers to exhaust all other options before depending on plastic surgery.\n\n\u201cI just have a lot of friends that just go to get liposuction when not once have they tried to go to the gym or tried to change their diet,\u201d said Kardashian. \u201cThat I disagree with. But if you\u2019re working out, and you have a trouble area, and it\u2019s still bothering you, then go fix it if you want.\u201d\n\nShe additionally set the record straight on her nose.\n\n\u201cEveryone says I\u2019ve had a nose job because my nose is smaller now and I swear I haven\u2019t,\u201d she said. Plastic surgeon Terry Dubrow explained to Kardashian that weight loss can play a role in the size of your nose.\n\n\u201cHe was like, \u2018No, but when you were bigger, your nose can get wider.\u2019 It\u2019s like when you\u2019re pregnant, your nose spreads because there\u2019s fat pockets in there, I guess,\u201d she shared. \u201cSo when I lost weight, my nose did get smaller, and also I now know about contouring. Like when I wash my face, my nose is wider.\u201d", "images":
