Tuesday's episode will mark Perrette's last appearance on the police procedural.\n\n\"I'm so worried about you guys for Tuesday's episode of the #GoodbyeAbby,\" Perrette told her 757,000 followers.\n\n\"It's sad, But I hope hope hope you will all watch,\" she said. \"I Want the world to watch. I did my best work for you. And TONS of flashbacks. Everyone is there. Love you! Get everyone to watch please.\"\n\nI'm so worried about you guys for Tuesdays episode of the #GoodbyeAbby\n\nIt's sad, But I hope hope hope you will all watch. I Want the world to watch.

Get everyone to watch please. \u2014 Pauley Perrette (@PauleyP) May 7, 2018\n\nPerrette, whose character was mugged during last week's episode, told USA Today fans will need \"a couple boxes of tissues\" Tuesday.\n\n\"It's a heavy episode,\" the star said. \"I gave it all I had emotionally, but I really wanted to give respect to the fans and to Abby and her legacy.\"\n\nPerrette announced in October that she would be leaving NCIS after 15 seasons. She explained in an interview with TV Insider in April that she felt it was the right time to move on.\n\n\"I believe in God and the universe so firmly, and it just suddenly became blindingly apparent that now was the time,\" the actress said.\n\nNCIS was renewed for a 16th season in April. The series co-stars Mark Harmon, David McCallum, Rocky Carroll, Brian Dietzen and Emily Wickersham.", "images":
