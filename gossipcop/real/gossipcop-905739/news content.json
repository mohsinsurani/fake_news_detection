Best known as Kit Harington\u2019s character\u2019s wildling love interest and fellow fighter Ygritte in the popular HBO show, Leslie and Harington first sparked dating rumors back in 2012 before appearing publicly together for the first time in spring of 2016.\n\nNow, however, PEOPLE reports that a source has confirmed the two are engaged.\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re already attracted to someone, and then they play your love interest in the show, it becomes very easy to fall in love,\u201d Harington told L\u2019Uomo Vogue back in 2016. Leslie moved in with him this year according to a June appearance on James Corden\u2019s show. At that time, fellow guest Nicole Kidman prodded Harington about his proposal plans \u2014 but he said he was taking things \u201cstep by step.\u201d\n\nHarington and Leslie are major fan favorites, thanks to some seriously memorable (and steamy) scenes they\u2019ve shared in the fantasy show. While Daenerys Targaryen may have caught Jon Snow\u2019s eye onscreen for now, it\u2019s clear that Ygritte has been the one for him all along.\n\nGame of Thrones returns with its final season next year. Until then, we\u2019ll have to satisfy ourselves with the real-life drama these actors are happily playing out.\n\nPeople are already excited about it.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-history-movies-01.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-19-at-11-20-31-am.png?w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kit-harington-rose-leslie.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kit-harington-rose-leslie.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4957955/kit-harington-engaged-rose-leslie/", "title": "Kit Harington Engaged to Girlfriend Rose Leslie", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The real-life couple, who have been dating for years, are tying the knot.
