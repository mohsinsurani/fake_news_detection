He continued: \"Coming from a split home myself, I know it's not easy on youngsters, but in todays world sadly, it's pretty common. So Christina and I will always remain unfazed by any outside noise and save the kids from any unnecessary trauma.\" He then praised his wife as a working mom, calling her \"very driven\" and a \"positive influence\" in her children's lives \"while achieving success in anything she does.\" \"There is a lot that goes on in personal lives that isn't for public consumption, therefore not shared, kept private,\" he added. \"So trust me as someone who likes to keep a low profile, no one except those directly involved knows jack about any situation more than them. 2 sides and the truth.\" He concluded, \"I will always protect her, keep her safe and no one will hurt her with me in the picture. She doesn't bother anyone, she deserves the same in return. I will ensure that's the case.\"\n\n23 of 24 September 27, 2022: Christina Hall responds to Ant Anstead's exploitation accusations regarding their son Hudson In April 2022, Anstead requested that Hall not film paid social media campaigns with their son Hudson. He even went as far as to file a request with the court that would restrain both him and Hall \"from using Hudson or Hudson's likeness or image in any commercial endeavor, social media paid promotion, television or streaming program, or which might otherwise commodify Hudson without the express advanced written consent of both parents in writing.\" Hall's legal team filed a response to Anstead's accusations that the HGTV star was \"exploiting\" their son on social media. \"He appeared in a few of my own Instagram ads that each took less than 5 minutes to film,\" Hall said in the response. \"I have all the footage and they were all fun activities that he enjoyed doing, such as playing with toys or making cookies.\" She added: \"Hudson has not appeared in any of my Instagram endorsements since April 2022, when Ant asked me not to have him in them. I did not have a problem stopping, nor do I care to feature Hudson in any further endorsements.\"", "images":
