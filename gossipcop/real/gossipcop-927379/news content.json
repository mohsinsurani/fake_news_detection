The good news came just days after news surfaced that Thompson, a Cleveland Cavaliers basketball player, was spotted kissing another woman while he was out at New York City rooftop bar. The news went viral, and fans are finding creative ways to show their support. Cardi B, however, has a message for all the fans and haters out there who have been making the relationship drama their primary business.\n\nThe rapper, who just revealed her own pregnancy and dropped her debut album, made an appearance on a radio show this week. When the host asked for her thoughts on the rumors about Kardashian and Thompson, she dished out wisdom in her signature candid way.\n\n\"Do what your heart feel like doing,\" Cardi B said. \"At the end of the day, everybody wanna act like they date deacons and pastors and their relationship is perfect.\"\n\nShe also advised that the world let the couple handle things privately. \"You don't know what type of things going on in their relationship,\" she said. \"People make it seem like this happened two weeks ago. Let them work things out.\"\n\nCardi B has been in Khlo\u00e9's shoes before herself, when she dealt with a similar situation. At one point, her fianc\u00e9, Offset, was accused of cheating, too: \"In the beginning of our relationship we had our doubts about each other, things weren't perfect,\" she said on the show. \"I had my suspicions but we kept stuff private between us. We just worked it out.\"\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n-Kris Jenner Basically Just Confirmed That Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Gave Birth\n\n-Watch Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Tell Her Entire Family She's Pregnant\n\n-Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Producing a New Show About Killer Sisters Just Feels Right", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632c71fec483d7bad7b405c2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6331ad4816dae576aaf97bd8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ad224b13669952a3f1c4014/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cardi-b.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ad224b13669952a3f1c4014/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/cardi-b.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6336e8ee49f9a667e4ae5140/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6331f4e791774a27eec4cfdc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ad224b13669952a3f1c4014/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cardi-b.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Erin Reimel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/cardi-b-khloe-kardashians-relationship-drama", "title": "Cardi B Has Some Advice for Everyone Wrapped Up in Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's Relationship Drama", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Cardi B has a message for all the fans who are making the  Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson relationship drama their business.", "id": "5ad215751745711bddb87bbe", "keywords": "cardi b,khloe kardashian", "news_keywords": "cardi b,khloe kardashian", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ad215751745711bddb87bbe", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Cardi B has a message for all the fans who are making the  Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian and Tristan Thompson relationship drama their business.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ad224b13669952a3f1c4014/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/cardi-b.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ad224b13669952a3f1c4014/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/cardi-b.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Never change, Cardi B.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ad224b13669952a3f1c4014/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cardi-b.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Cardi B Has Some Advice for Everyone Wrapped Up in Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's Relationship Drama", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/cardi-b-khloe-kardashians-relationship-drama"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-04-14T16:48:52.400Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-14T16:48:52.400Z", "author": "Erin Reimel"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Never change, Cardi B.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5ad224b13669952a3f1c4014/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/cardi-b.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Cardi B Has Some Advice for Everyone Wrapped Up in Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian's Relationship Drama"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523724532.4, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
