Please stop being mean to him. The song I wrote was about a past relationship. \u2764.\"\n\nThe song in question is Haynes' new acoustic demo, \"Man It Sucks,\" which a number of fans assumed was about his alleged relationship problems with Leatham. \"Man it sucks / When someone figures out your games and don't wanna play 'em no more / We're crying in our bed and making our way to the floor / Man it sucks,\" the actor sings on the track. \"And I don't like when you're staying out all night and never answer your phone / I follow you around the world just to be left alone / And man it sucks.\"\n\nRumors that the couple had called it quits began to circulate earlier in the week after the two notably unfollowed one another on Instagram. Additionally, Haynes deleted photos of himself with Leatham on the social media platform, removed \"husband\" from his bio, and changed his username from \"Colton Haynes-Leatham\" to \"Colton Haynes.\"\n\n\"Jeff and Colton have been having relationship issues since a couple months after the wedding,\" an Us Weekly source said at the time. \"Since Colton stopped talking to a lot of his old friends, he was getting really depressed and didn't feel like himself.\"\n\nHaynes, 29, and Leatham, 46, married in a star-studded ceremony officiated by Kris Jenner in Palm Springs, Calif. in October 2017. As Nicki Swift previously reported, Haynes proposed to Leatham in May of that year \u2014 just a few months after the celebrity florist had popped the question himself. The duo first went public with their romance that February.\n\nAt the time of this writing, nether party has publicly commented on their current relationship status.", "images": ["https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/colton-haynes-breaks-his-silence-on-reported-jeff-leatham-split/intro-1525626852.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/colton-haynes-breaks-his-silence-on-reported-jeff-leatham-split/intro-1525626852.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dianne Gebauer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/120974/colton-haynes-breaks-silence-cheating-rumors-amid-jeff-leatham-split/", "title": "Colton Haynes Breaks Silence On Rumored Jeff Leatham Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/colton-haynes-breaks-his-silence-on-reported-jeff-leatham-split/intro-1525626852.jpg", "title": "Colton Haynes Breaks Silence On Rumored Jeff Leatham Split - Nicki Swift", "description": "Colton Haynes is addressing recent breakup rumors.
