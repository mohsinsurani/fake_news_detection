The third season was won by Fantasia Barrino , who defeated Diana DeGarmo by an approximate margin of 2% (1.3 million votes); the vote total (65 million votes) was the highest recorded vote total in the show's history until the May 23, 2007 finale of American Idol 6. This season also featured Academy Award-winner Jennifer Hudson\n\nThe third season is the only season where both the winner and the runner-up ended up in the bottom 2 or 3 prior to the finale. It is the first season to have a finale with two female contestants, while the second and seventh seasons had a finale with two male contestants.\n\nAuditions Edit\n\nAuditions were held in New York, Los Angeles, San Francisco, Houston, Atlanta, and Honolulu.\n\nThe early part of the season became well-known for the introduction of William Hung, a University of California, Berkeley student, who became popular following his rendition of Ricky Martin's \"She Bangs\". His performance as well as his attitude facing judge Simon Cowell's criticisms (which was a stark contrast to other contestants' confrontational, angry reactions) made him instantly popular, and landed him a record deal with Koch Records.\n\nDuring the audition round in Houston, Texas, auditioner Jonathan Rey threw a cup of water at Simon, who moments earlier commented that he was terrible and \"there's not a song in the world you could sing.\" Security quickly escorted Jonathan out, and Houston police questioned him, but released him after Simon decided against pressing assault charges on him. The entire incident was caught on tape and was broadcast.\n\nHollywood rounds contestant Taryn Southern later appeared on the Project My World series and wrote and performed the 2007 \"Hott4Hill\" viral video.\n\nThis is the first time that two contestants who previously tried out for American Idol (Matthew Metzger and Lisa Leuschner) made it to the top 3 of their semifinals group. Both contestants were eliminated during Hollywood round in the previous season.\n\nMatthew Metzger, a semi-finalist who competed in the Wild Card episode, played the part of Demarest \"Duke\" Buchanan on the ABC soap opera One Life to Live from August 2004 to May 2006.\n\nLisa Wilson, a semi-finalist on American Idol, later became Miss Georgia USA 2006.\n\nTop 12 Edit\n\nScorecard Edit\n\nSemi-final Group 1 Edit\n\nDiana DeGarmo -
