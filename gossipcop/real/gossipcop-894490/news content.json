But as the series began to hit its stride, \u201cS.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d didn\u2019t need to rely on its cinematic cousins to bolster its storytelling and cred anymore. Season 4 was one of the show\u2019s strongest in storytelling but lowest in ratings, and Variety reported that ABC wanted to end the series \u2014 but that Disney demanded more. \u201cS.H.I.E.L.D.\u201d will return for a fifth season, shifting from Tuesdays to Fridays, after \u201cInhumans\u201d (see below) vacates its slot.\n\nABC\n\n\u201dInhumans\u201d: As the title indicates, this show is about the descendants of alien beings who look humanoid (but aren\u2019t!) and live on the moon. Despite a big push, including a limited IMAX premiere ahead of its actual debut on Friday (8 p.m. ET, ABC), the series earned low critical marks \u2014 perhaps the worst yet of any Marvel show. It\u2019s perhaps no coincidence that \u201cInhumans\u201d was created by Scott Buck, who was also behind the equally panned \u201cIron Fist.\u201d In \u201cInhumans,\u201d Buck came up wiht a show that IndieWire deemed \u201clegitimately the worst Marvel adaptation of the year.\u201d ABC canceled \u201cAgent Carter,\u201d and instead we got this?!\n\nNetflix\n\n\u201dDaredevil\u201d: As the elder statesman of the Netflix bunch, \u201cDaredevil\u201d set the bar high for Marvel on the streaming service, thanks to a stellar first season kickstarted by Drew Goddard and finished by \u201cSpartacus\u201d mastermind Steven S. DeKnight. While its second season, showrun by Marco Ramirez and Douglas Petrie, lost some of the show\u2019s narrative oomph, \u201cDaredevil\u201d still introduced viewers to the intriguing Frank Castle. The blind lawyer-by-day, vigilante-by-night still has meaning for fans, and already has a Season 3 in the works.\n\n\u201dJessica Jones\u201d: Melissa Rosenberg brought this series to life, a show some would argue is perhaps the strongest Marvel series so far, thanks to its confident voice and storytelling. The show\u2019s intensely feminist story involves Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter) dealing with trauma from her time with the fiendish and yet charismatic Kilgrave (David Tennant), making for nuanced and compelling viewing. All episodes of Season 2 of will be directed by women.\n\n\u201dLuke Cage\u201d: Cheo Hodari Coker was the showrunner with vision who gave this series its unique flavor, setting the action and heart in Harlem. Lots of action, tons of Easter eggs, a killer soundtrack, and plenty of humor made this a joy to watch, although it did slip in later episodes as storytelling had to stretch in order to fill all 13 episodes. A second season will premiere in 2018.\n\n\u201dIron Fist\u201d: This is the first of the Netflix Marvel series to really falter and draw significant criticism. Although Asian communities had hoped that the series would race-bend the original story to make the protagonist Asian, Danny Rand remained a white dude who would outdo Asians at their own game \u2014 whether it was through martial arts, speaking Mandarin or walking barefoot through the city. Scott Buck ultimately subjected \u201cIron Fist\u201d to cliched and cartoonish storytelling.\n\n\u201dThe Defenders\u201d: The miniseries brought all four previously introduced Netflix Marvel heroes together, but according to Variety, it was Netflix\u2019s least-viewed Marvel series in its debut month. Filled with the heroes and supporting characters from each of their respective shows, the eight-episode series was perhaps a bit too bloated with players. Viewers may have also faced superhero fatigue, as the disappointing \u201cIron Fist\u201d had debuted only a few months before.\n\n\u201dThe Punisher\u201d: After blasting his way into \u201cDaredevil\u201d Season 2, Frank Castle made such an impression that he earned himself his very own spinoff series. \u201cHannibal\u201d executive producer and writer Steve Lightfoot was named showrunner, which bodes well for the series that should delve deeper into The Punisher\u2019s dark psyche. \u201cThe Punisher\u201d will be released sometime in Fall 2017.\n\nFX\n\nFX\n\n\u201dLegion\u201d: Although this isn\u2019t supposed to necessarily be a part of the bigger MCU, it\u2019s worth pointing to as an example of how to do a Marvel series that doesn\u2019t feel like everything else out there. This is owed to Noah Hawley, who was able to do justice to the Coen Bros. with his take on \u201cFargo.\u201d Translating the trippy interior of a man\u2019s chaotic psyche is ambitious and daunting, but against all odds, it worked. Dan Stevens led a criminally under-recognized cast which embodied plenty of kookiness while not skimping on depth and heart. The critics have been on board, but it\u2019s about time the rest of the world tuned in. \u201cLegion\u201d will return for a second season in 2018.\n\n\u201dDeadpool\u201d: Can Donald Glover do it all? So far, the answer has been \u201cyes.\u201d The \u201cAtlanta\u201d Emmy winner and hip-hop superstar, a.k.a. Childish Gambino, will adapt the foul-mouthed superhero property as an animated project for FXX along with his brother Stephen Glover, who had also nabbed an Emmy nom for writing on \u201cAtlanta.\u201d It\u2019s still too early to get any sort of idea how this will turn out, but judging by Glover\u2019s track record and how well this sensibility fits his brand, there\u2019s reason to be optimistic.\n\nHulu\n\nHulu\n\n\u201dRunaways\u201d: Hot off of winning Emmys for \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale,\u201d Hulu is hoping to take some of that must-see magic to its latest adaptation, based on this complex yet young-skewing Marvel franchise. \u201cRunaways,\u201d about a bunch of teens who discover that their parents are supervillains, comes from \u201cThe O.C.\u2019s\u201d Josh Schwartz and Stephanie Savage, who know a thing or two about finding young and compelling ensemble casts.

Stephen Moyer and Amy Acker play parents who discover that their two kids are mutants, and therefore must join the Mutant Underground to evade the government, while Jamie Chung, Emma Dumont, Sean Teale, and Blair Redford are just a few of the stars who will portray the mutants on the run. Early critical reaction for the show, from creator Matt Nix, has been encouraging.\n\nFox\n\nFreeform\n\nCloak and Dagger: Based on the Bill Mantlo and Ed Hannigan comics, the Joe Pokaski-led series will focus on two runaways who gain powers when a criminal chemist tests a drug on them.
