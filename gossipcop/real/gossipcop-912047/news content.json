And judging by a new behind the scenes video released by Marvel, Thor: Ragnarok looks every bit as good as we expected.\n\n\u201cRagnarok is a new cycle; new realms, new universe,\u201d explains Waititi. \u201cIt\u2019s the destruction of the old and the rebirth of the new, and that\u2019s really exciting to me. The way that I\u2019ve approached this is to rebuild it in a new way.\u201d\n\nAs we\u2019ve seen from the posters and trailers, the tone of Thor: Ragnarok is completely different from the first two Thor movies, which were dark and brooding. It was a conscious choice by the cast and crew, one that mixes action and humor\u2014sort of using the Guardians of the Galaxy approach.\n\nIf you\u2019ve ever seen Waititi\u2019s other work\u2014I highly recommend Hunt for the Wilderpeople\u2014the director seems like the perfect person to usher in this new version of Thor. If you want a taste of Waititi\u2019s brand of humor, look no further than the \u201cTeam Thor\u201d shorts he made about what Thor was up to during the events of Captain America: Civil War.\n\n\u201cWhat are the odds we survive this trip,\u201d Thor asks Bruce Banner.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d say the odds are a million to fun,\u201d Banner retorts.\n\nThor: Ragnarok hits theaters on November 3.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171002010935im_/https://www.technobuffalo.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Thor-Ragnarok-Official-Photos-32-200x200.jpg",
