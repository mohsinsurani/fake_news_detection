One Facebook commenter put it best when she said, \u201cI just want Reese Witherspoon sitting on my shoulder whispering ambition into my ear for the rest of my life.\u201d\n\nTwo years later Witherspoon has doubled down on her ambition to create work that moves the needle for women. Big Little Lies, the HBO miniseries she produced and starred in, racked up 16 Emmy nominations. She\u2019s starring in two movies, Home Again, in theaters now, and A Wrinkle in Time, out next year, both directed by women. With her production company, Pacific Standard, and new multimedia company, Hello Sunshine, Wither\u00adspoon wants to capitalize on the demand for women\u2019s stories and tell them in every single medium: TV, film, and online.\n\nThat energy? It\u2019s infectious\u2014and needed right now. We asked Witherspoon to give us all another pep talk on the power of female ambition. She delivered with this heartfelt essay.\n\nI worked for a long time on my speech for Women of the Year. At the time, I was reading a lot of articles about how people find ambition in women to be a negative trait. There was a Columbia University study that concluded that a woman with ambitious traits seemed selfish and less worthy of being hired than a man with the same traits, which made me wonder, What the heck is wrong with being ambitious? I have been ambitious all my life. In fact, I vividly remember telling my third-grade teacher that I wanted to be the first female president of the United States. Ambition is simply a drive inside of you\u2014it\u2019s having a curiosity or a new idea and the desire to pursue it. I asked the audience a question that night in Carnegie Hall: What if all women were encouraged to be a bit more ambitious?", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42fa46746a8222b26ffea/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2d.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/634032bd34549efe5239f0ac/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/63405db925b3dbe92f29e4fe/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42edc27c2f9352e015997/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-1.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4382b27c2f9352e0159a5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-3.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4817d22e1ec7be19705e2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-social.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42f846746a8222b26ffe8/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2c.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42f399845bb5caf043188/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2a.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a42f695fdabb483b05c6b2/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-2b.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6329f8caa78f29f95d9150b6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a43cab9845bb5caf043194/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-4.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/631fce7af8cff70c7e2a42c2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4817d22e1ec7be19705e2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-social.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Reese Witherspoon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/reese-witherspoon-october-2017-cover-interview", "title": "Reese Witherspoon Has Something to Say to Women About Ambition", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Reese Witherspoon covers 'Glamour' magazine's September 2017 issue and talks about capitalizing on the demand for women\u2019s stories and how to tell them in single medium.", "id": "599f164912565a2d1b2a4fb0", "keywords": "reese witherspoon", "news_keywords": "reese witherspoon", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "599f164912565a2d1b2a4fb0", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Reese Witherspoon covers 'Glamour' magazine's September 2017 issue and talks about capitalizing on the demand for women\u2019s stories and how to tell them in single medium.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4386a9845bb5caf043192/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-lede.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4386a9845bb5caf043192/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-lede.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The superstar gets candid about what it means to be a driven woman in a powerful new essay.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59a4817d22e1ec7be19705e2/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/reese-witherspoon-oct-17-cover-social.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Reese Witherspoon: 'Run Away From a Man Who Can't Handle Your Ambition.
