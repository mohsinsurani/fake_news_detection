The iconic '90s rom-com 10 Things I Hate About You is leaving the streaming service on August 1st. We must cancel all plans and schedule as many viewings as possible before it's gone forever.\n\nBefore we get too upset about its departure (along with other streams like Superbad, The Lizzie McGuire Movie, and the Revenge series), it\u2019s important to note that August will also have a ton of binge-worthy new releases that hopefully will fill the void. Remember Amy Poehler's iconic cameo in Netflix's reboot of Wet Hot American Summer? The show's coming back this month!\n\nCurious what else is in our queue? Scroll down to find out. Then, check out the full list of Netflix's additions and subtractions below.\n\nTHE ADDAMS FAMILY\n\nMGM\n\nThe 1991 remake of the fantasy comedy became an instant classic thanks to iconic performances by Anjelica Hoston (as Morticia Addams), Christopher Lloyd (as Gordon Craven, Uncle Fester Addams), Christina Ricci (as Wednesday Addams), and more. It hits the streaming service on Aug. 1.\n\nSING\n\nUniversal Pictures\n\nIf you missed out on this animated flick in theaters, now is your chance to schedule a viewing (for both kids and adults!). Humanized animals compete in an American Idol-type singing competition, and you'll find yourself rooting for your favorites. Plus, the voice cast is incredible: Reese Witherspoon, Matthew McConaughey, Scarlett Johansson, Seth MacFarlane, John C. Reilly, Tori Kelly, Jennifer Hudson, Leslie Jones, and more. It debuts on Aug. 3.\n\nWET HOT AMERICAN SUMMER: TEN YEARS LATER\n\nSaeed Adyani/Netflix\n\nAs a follow-up to Netflix's reboot of the franchise, this season finds the camp counselors ten years older. Bonus: you'll still get to see your favorite cameos from stars like Amy Poehler, Paul Rudd, Kristen Wiig, and Elizabeth Banks. Watch it on Aug. 4.\n\nMARVEL'S THE DEFENDERS\n\nSarah Shatz/Netflix\n\nIf you watch Netflix's other Marvel series, then this is right up your alley. Daredevil (Charlie Cox), Luke Cage (Mike Colter), Jessica Jones (Krysten Ritter), and Iron Fist (Finn Jones) team up to fight crime in New York City. The new series debuts on Aug. 18.\n\nVIDEO: Could '90s Families Afford Their Lifestyles in 2017?\n\nNETFLIX AUGUST ADDITIONS\n\nAug. 1\n\nA Cinderella Story\n\nBad Santa\n\nCloud Atlas\n\nCrematorium:
