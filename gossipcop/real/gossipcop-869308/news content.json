Now they are complaining they are unemployed.\u201d (during the 1981 recession)\n\n\u2022 \u201cIf it has got four legs and it is not a chair, if it has got two wings and it flies but is not an aeroplane, and if it swims and it is not a submarine, the Cantonese will eat it.\u201d (at a 1986 World Wildlife Fund meeting)\n\n\u2022 \u201cIt looks like a tart\u2019s bedroom.\u201d (on seeing plans for the Duke and Duchess of York\u2019s house at Sunninghill Park in 1988)\n\n\u2022 \u201cYak, yak, yak; come on, get a move on.\u201d (shouted from the deck of Britannia in Belize in 1994 to the Queen, who was chatting to her hosts on the quayside)\n\n\u2022 \u201cHow do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to get them through the test?\u201d (to a driving instructor in Oban, Scotland, during a 1995 walkabout)\n\n\u2022 \u201cBloody silly fool!\u201d (in 1997, referring to a Cambridge University car park attendant who did not recognise him)\n\n\u2022 \u201cIt looks as if it was put in by an Indian.\u201d (pointing at an old-fashioned fusebox in a factory near Edinburgh in 1999)\n\n\u2022 \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t fart or eat hay, she\u2019s not interested.\u201d (on the Princess Royal)\n\nWas this helpful? Thank you for your feedback.\n\nThe weather failed to dampen the enthusiasm of an umbrella-wielding crowd who had gathered outside Buckingham Palace, and whose applause was rewarded with a wave of acknowledgement by the duke as he walked off the palace forecourt and into retirement.\n\n\n\nPhilip, who announced that he was stepping down in May, had chosen the forecourt of Buckingham Palace and a Royal Marines military parade to stage his final solo act.\n\n\n\nAs Captain General of the Royal Marines, he took the royal salute and inspected an honour guard to mark the finale of the 1664 Global Challenge, a series of endurance feats by marines to raise awareness of and funds for the Royal Marines Charity.\n\n\n\nThe Duke of Edinburgh attending the Captain General\u2019s Parade as his final individual public engagement, at Buckingham Palace in London. Photograph: Yui Mok/PA\n\nAmong those he met were Cpl Will Gingell, 33, and Cpl Jamie Thompson, 31, who had run 1,664 miles over 100 days, and Sgt Matt Burley, a physical training instructor, who swam 1,664 lengths underwater over 10 days.\n\n\n\n\u201cYou all should be locked up,\u201d Philip joked in characteristic fashion.\n\nIt was the 22,219th solo engagement carried out by the duke since his wife became Queen in 1952. As far as Buckingham Palace could ascertain, his very first had been on 2 March 1948, a few months after his marriage to Princess Elizabeth, when he attended the London Federation of Boys\u2019 Club Boxing finals at the Royal Albert Hall. The Court Circular recorded that the prince, then aged 26, presented the prizes.\n\nA Royal Navy man to the core who was mentioned in dispatches during the second world war, Philip\u2019s choice of a Royal Navy and Marine Corps engagement as his last was described as \u201can honour\u201d and \u201cbrilliant\u201d by Lt Col Gary Green, who devised the 1664 Global Challenge.\n\n\n\nOf having the duke as the head of the Corps, he said: \u201cIt makes the Corps exceptional, it builds our Commando spirit and he\u2019s a wonderful figurehead for all Royal Marines to look up to.\u201d\n\n\n\nPhilip, who may still accompany the Queen at times, has been among the most active of the royals right up to retirement. This year he has spent 52 days carrying out public engagements, more than the Queen and the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, at 49, 45, and 39 days respectively, but not as many as his daughter, the Princess Royal, who has clocked up 111 days so far, or his eldest son, Charles, at 89 days.\n\nLady Myra Butter, who has known Prince Philip since childhood, told Radio 4\u2019s Today: \u201cI\u2019m sure that he won\u2019t disappear; he will be greatly missed by everybody. He\u2019s been such a stable character in all our lives \u2013 he\u2019s always there and he\u2019s always been there for the Queen and I think we\u2019re very, very lucky to have him.\u201d\n\nThe prime minister, Theresa May, tweeted a tribute to the duke, saying: \u201cAs he carries out his final public engagement, I thank the Duke of Edinburgh for a remarkable lifetime of service.\n\n\u201cI hope the Duke, after 22,219 solo engagements since 1952, can now enjoy a well-earned retirement!\u201d\n\nHe may be bowing out of public life, but not as dramatically as readers of the Daily Telegraph\u2019s website were informed on Wednesday when an accidental slip of the keyboard resulted in the headline: \u201cHOLD HOLD HOLD, Prince Philip, Duke of Edinburgh, dies aged XX\u201d, announcing his death and publishing details of his funeral. The Telegraph swiftly pulled the article and apologised, saying it would be \u201creviewing its publishing processes as a matter of urgency\u201d. In May, when his retirement was announced, the Sun\u2019s website also erroneously announced his death.", "images":
