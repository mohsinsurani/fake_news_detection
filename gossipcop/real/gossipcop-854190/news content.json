In season 1, Kimmy \u2013 a kidnap victim freed after years of imprisonment \u2013 picked apart Katy Perry\u2018s \u2018Firework\u2019 after hearing it for the first time. In season 2 the show imagined the creation of \u2018Pizza Rat Boulevard\u2019 in New York City, to honour the rat that went viral for its pizza-carrying abilities. 2017\u2019s season 3 had Kimmy\u2019s roomie Titus Andromedon re-enacting scenes from Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s \u2018Lemonade\u2019 after discovering his boyfriend might be cheating on him. But what about the other jokes \u2013 the obscure ones designed to go over your head? Here are 17 you might have missed.\n\n1. \u201cThe Reverend claimed he came up with the \u2018I\u2019d like to buy the world a Coke\u2019 commercial\u201d\n\nFrom: S2E4 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Kidnaps Gretchen!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Kimmy\n\nWhat it means: It\u2019s a play on the fact that John Hamm, who plays the Reverend, was also Mad Men\u2018s Don Draper. In the last episode of Mad Men, Draper comes up with the \u201970s Coca-Cola tagline.\n\n2. \u201cD\u2019Fwan broke up with me!\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: S3E6 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Is a Feminist!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Titus Andromedon\n\nWhat it means: Tituss Burgess (Kimmy\u2018s Titus) was briefly in 30 Rock as a reality TV star called D\u2019Fwan \u2013 so it\u2019s weird for 30 Rock fans when, in the third season of Kimmy, Titus talks about his ex-boyfriend D\u2019Fwan, because Burgess played both characters.\n\n3. \u201cThis is a real apartment\u201d\n\nFrom: Various\n\nWho says it: Various\n\nWhat it means: If you\u2019re not paying attention you\u2019ll probably miss the running joke that the house shared by Kimmy and Titus is actually a tugboat turned on its end. It was recently highlighted at the end of season 3 in a throwaway line made by Kimmy\u2019s new boss Zach (who\u2019s basically Back To The Future\u2018s Marty McFly, by the way).\n\n4. \u201cLet me explain how the internet works. It\u2019s not a big truck \u2013 it\u2019s a series of tubes\u201d\n\nFrom: S2E6 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Drives a Car!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Titus\n\nWhat it means: The phrase \u2018series of tubes\u2018 is famous enough in the US that it has its own Wikipedia page. It was an analysis of the internet made in 2006 by Alaska\u2019s then-Senator Ted Stevens. His simple approach to the subject was widely ridiculed and is now something of a marker for technical improficiency.\n\n5. Dong as Ghostbusters\u2018 Rick Moranis\n\nAdvertisement\n\nFrom: S1E8 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Is Bad At Math!\u2019\n\nWho does it: Dong\n\nWhat it means: The final scene of this season 1 episode is almost a shot-for-shot recreation of the below scene from Ghostbusters, in which Rick Moranis is being chased and is desperately trying to get inside a restaurant. Dong, one of Kimmy\u2019s love interests, does the same, only he\u2019s trying to get inside because Kimmy is on a date with another man.\n\n6. \u201cShe has returned in full like Alcibiades to Athens, and I have become her Eupolis\u201d\n\nFrom: S2E2 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Goes On a Playdate!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Deirdre Robespierre\n\nWhat it means: Jacqueline\u2019s highbrow nemesis goes full-on Classics scholar in this analogy comparing their relationship to the famous rivalry between two fifth-century BC Athenians, (which Alcibiades won by having Eupolis drowned).\n\n7. Xanthippe\n\nFrom: The whole series\n\nWhat it means: Jacqueline\u2019s daughter Xanthippe is named in honour of Socrates\u2019 wife. In Xenophon\u2019s Symposium he describes her as \u201cthe hardest to get along with of all the women there are,\u201d and Socrates says he married her because \u201cI know full well, if I can tolerate her spirit, I can with ease attach myself to every human being else.\u201d A similar relationship is presented between the ultra-positive Kimmy and the grumpy teenage Xan.\n\n8. \u201cMikey told me Shark Week is now a union holiday\u201d\n\nFrom: S2E11 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Meets a Celebrity!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Titus\n\nWhat it means: In a memorable scene of 30 Rock, the uncontrollable comic Tracy Jordan tells NBC employee Kenneth: \u201cLive every week like it\u2019s Shark Week\u201d. In Fey\u2019s universe, it seems to have developed into a public holiday.\n\n9. \u201cLumiere\u2026 Belle\u2026 Gaston!\u201d\n\nFrom: S1E7 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Goes To a Party!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Kimmy\n\nWhat it means: While in a fancy restaurant with Titus, Kimmy pretends to speak French, but the only words she can say are names of Beauty and the Beast characters.\n\n10. \u201cWhen is Deblasio gonna put an end to these senseless shorty fires burning on the dance floor?\u201d\n\nFrom: S2E4 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Kidnaps Gretchen!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Lillian\n\nWhat it means: This throwaway line from Kimmy\u2019s landlord is of course a reference to the lyrics of Sean Kingston \u2018Fire Burning\u2019.\n\n11. \u201cI\u2019m really glad you\u2019re not a giant crab\u201d\n\nFrom: S2E12\n\nWho says it: Mikey\n\nWhat it means: Speaking to Titus, Mikey subtly references the fact that actor Tituss Burgess played Sebastian the crab in a Broadway version of The Little Mermaid.\n\n12. \u201cWelcome to the singing laundromat / We are not responsible for theft\u201d\n\nFrom: S3 \u2013 various\n\nWho says it: Titus, Dionne Warwick\n\nWhat it means: When you first hear this vocal warmup, Titus is preparing to record backing vocals. In episode 8, featuring the hilarious Maya Rudolph as Dionne Warwick, there\u2019s a blink-and-you-miss-it callback, where it\u2019s revealed that her character taught Titus the warmup lines.\n\n13. \u201cAll day long he biddy-biddy bums\u201d\n\nFrom: S3E13\n\nWho says it: Lillian, Artie\n\nWhat it means: When asked if her bf Artie is rich, Lillian says yes, adding the above phrase. It\u2019s taken from Fiddler on the Roof\u2018s \u2018If I Were A Rich Man\u2019, and you later see Artie singing \u201cBiddy biddy bum\u201d to himself.\n\n14. Michael Torpey\u2019s stupid names\n\nFrom: S3E7 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Learns About The Weather!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Drench Thunderman\n\nWhat it means: Actor Michael Torpey\u2019s work with Tina Fey has become something of a running joke, because of the silly names of his characters. In 30 Rock he played NBC\u2019s head of standards and practices called Gaylord Felcher. In Kimmy Schmidt he plays a weatherman called Drench Thunderman.\n\n15. \u201cIf he wasn\u2019t my son, perhaps I\u2019d be dating him\u201d\n\nFrom: S3E5 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Steps On a Crack!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Orson Snyder\n\nWhat it means: The oligarchic dad of Jacqueline\u2019s boyfriend Russ is a parody of Donald Trump. Trump actually once said: \u201cIf Ivanka weren\u2019t my daughter, perhaps I\u2019d be dating her\u201d, and that\u2019s what\u2019s being parodied with Orson Snyder\u2019s comments about his awful sons.\n\n16. LaDonica/\u201dBitch, I don\u2019t know your life\u201d\n\nFrom: S2E4 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Kidnaps Gretchen!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Jacqueline\n\nWhat it means: In this clip, Jacqueline recalls going into a pharmacy and being told the above phrase by a woman called LaDonica. The moment combines various aspects of Fey\u2019s other work \u2013 in Baby Mama the phrase itself is used; in 30 Rock, Kenneth encounters an unhelpful pharmacist called LaDonica.\n\n17. \u201cAnd she stepped on the ball!\u201d\n\nFrom: S1E6 \u2013 \u2018Kimmy Goes to School!\u2019\n\nWho says it: Xan\u2019s friend.\n\nWhat it means: This episode recalls a line from Trading Places and Auntie Mame. In all of them a privileged person tells a story about stepping on a ball \u2013 in this case it\u2019s one of Xanthippe\u2019s terrible friends.\n\nHave you spotted any other obscure Kimmy Schmidt references?
