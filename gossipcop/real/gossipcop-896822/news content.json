But one important question has remained unanswered: How did these two lovebirds meet in the first place?\n\nWe already know that a \u201cmutual friend\u201d introduced the pair, as Harry revealed in their first post-engagement interview with the BBC. Since neither of them knew much about the other before their first blind date, \u201cit was just a really authentic and organic way to get to know each other,\u201d Meghan said. (Believe it or not, the royal couple may be cousins.)\n\nBut now, we can finally put a name to the mystery matchmaker: Violet von Westenholz. The daughter of a baron, von Westenholz is a childhood friend of Harry\u2019s who also works in public relations with Ralph Lauren, which eventually led her to connect with Meghan.\n\nClarence House announced the couple's engagement on November 27, 2017. Alexi Lubomirski/Getty Images\n\n\u201cMeghan had been a part of the London social scene for a while and had slotted into the high society set really easily,\u201d a \u201cwell-placed source\u201d told \"E! News.\" \u201cAnd so when Harry told Violet he was having trouble finding someone, Violet said she might just have the perfect girl for him.\u201d\n\nFor months, people have speculated that celebrity stylist Jessica Mulroney, fashion designer Misha Nonoo, or friend Markus Anderson might have introduced the couple. While Violet has not confirmed the rumor yet, it can\u2019t hurt to give her a preemptive round of applause for orchestrating this fairy tale ending.\n\n\u201cWe are all just really happy that he finally met a woman he wants to spend the rest of his life with,\u201d a friend told \"E!.\"\n\nWe feel the same way. To prep for Harry and Meghan\u2019s big day in May, brush up on the royal wedding etiquette rules every member of the royal family must follow.\n\nSign up here to get INSIDER's favorite stories
