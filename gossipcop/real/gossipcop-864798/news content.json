The golf posted the update via Twitter on Monday, July 3.\n\n\u201cI recently completed an out of state private intensive program,\u201d the 41-year-old wrote to his more than six million followers. \u201cI will continue to tackle this going forward with my doctors, family and friends. I am so very thankful for all of the support I\u2019ve received.\u201d\n\nWoods went on to celebrate the Fourth of July the following day. \u201cHappy Birthday America and thank you to all who defend it!! \u2013 By TW,\u201d he wrote.\n\nAs previously reported, the athlete was arrested on suspicion of driving under the influence in Jupiter, Florida. According to a police report obtained by Us Weekly, Woods was asleep at the wheel of his 2015 black Mercedes-Benz, which was stopped in the right lane of Military Trail south of Indian Creek Parkway at the time. Authorities had to wake him up and he later struggled through a breathalyzer test.\n\nWoods, who has had multiple back surgeries over the years, released a statement about the incident later that day. \u201cI understand the severity of what I did and I take full responsibility for my actions,\u201d he said on May 29. \u201cI want the public to know that alcohol was not involved. What happened was an unexpected reaction to prescribed medications. I didn\u2019t realize the mix of medications had affected me so strongly.\u201d\n\nWoods shares daughter Sam, 9, and son Charlie, 8, with ex-wife Elin Nordegren.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/tiger-woods-d7fdc4fa-488b-49b0-a4df-67ebe24714bd.jpg?crop=432px%2C1px%2C917px%2C481px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/tiger-woods-d7fdc4fa-488b-49b0-a4df-67ebe24714bd.jpg?crop=432px%2C1px%2C917px%2C481px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tiger-woods-says-hes-completed-intensive-program-after-dui-arrest-w490887/", "title": "Tiger Woods Says He\u2019s Completed \u2018Intensive Program\u2019 After DUI Arrest", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Tiger Woods has completed an 'intensive program' following his DUI arrest \u2014 find out what else he said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tiger Woods Says He's Completed 'Intensive Program' After DUI Arrest", "description": "Tiger Woods has completed an 'intensive program' following his DUI arrest \u2014 find out what else he said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tiger-woods-says-hes-completed-intensive-program-after-dui-arrest-w490887/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T19:56:27+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/tiger-woods-d7fdc4fa-488b-49b0-a4df-67ebe24714bd.jpg?crop=432px%2C1px%2C917px%2C481px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/tiger-woods-d7fdc4fa-488b-49b0-a4df-67ebe24714bd.jpg?crop=432px%2C1px%2C917px%2C481px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-07-05T12:25:57+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T19:56:27+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tiger Woods Says He's Completed 'Intensive Program' After DUI Arrest", "description": "Tiger Woods has completed an 'intensive program' following his DUI arrest \u2014 find out what else he said", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/tiger-woods-d7fdc4fa-488b-49b0-a4df-67ebe24714bd.jpg?crop=432px%2C1px%2C917px%2C481px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499257557.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
