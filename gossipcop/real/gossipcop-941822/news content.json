But just two months before he died last November, Cassidy admitted that he never had dementia, but was struggling with alcoholism throughout the end of his life.\n\n\u201cThere is no sign of me having dementia at this stage of my life. It was complete alcohol poisoning,\u201d Cassidy explained to A&E producer Saralena Weinfield in a recorded conversation that is now part of a documentary called David Cassidy: The Last Session, which will air on June 11.\n\nAccording to People, Cassidy went on: \u201cThe fact is that I lied about my drinking,\u201d he said. \u201cI did this to myself to cover up the sadness and the emptiness.\u201d\n\nIt was no secret that Cassidy battled alcoholism. He was arrested for driving under the influence three times in five years. However, after he went to inpatient rehab in 2014 he told friends and family that he was sober.\n\n\u201cIf I take another drink, I\u2019m going to die, physically, mentally, emotionally, spiritually. I\u2019m dead,\u201d Cassidy told Piers Morgan during an interview following that rehab stay. \u201cYou know, they say it\u2019s a slippery slope\u2026 It\u2019s not a slippery slope. It\u2019s from 12:00 to 6:00 on the clock and the whole face is ice. One sip, one drink, because there is no such thing, not to an alcoholic. You have one and you\u2019re done. I\u2019d be done.\u201d\n\nIn 2017, footage of Cassidy during a live performance appeared to show that he was drunk. It was after that performance that he said he was suffering from a major medical issue\u2014dementia.\n\nHowever, just before his death Cassidy revealed that this was never the case.\n\n\u201cI have a liver disease,\u201d he told Weinfield after he was rushed to the hospital after falling. Two months later Cassidy died of organ failure at the age of 67. Not even his two children knew that he was still problematically drinking alcohol, according to People. However, not everyone was shocked.\n\n\u201cPart of alcoholism is lying,\u201d Partridge Family costar Danny Bonaduce said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re an addict, you know you can\u2019t be honest with people. You say what you want them to hear. I can\u2019t be mad at David for that, but it\u2019s still a tragedy.\u201d\n\nUltimately, documentary producers said that they decided to use the confession because they felt that Cassidy wanted it made public.\n\n\u201cHe wanted to share this very private part of his life, and to be honest once and for all. And I think he succeeded in doing that,\u201d said producer John Marks.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/DavidCassidy.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/styles/sc50x50/public/visionstreatment.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/lazyloader/image_placeholder.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1454120888203161&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/all/themes/thefixv2/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/styles/medium/public/Kelly%20Burch%20Contrib.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/styles/article/public/DavidCassidy.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/styles/sc50x50/public/1%20Method%20Center.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw=="], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/DavidCassidy.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107/https://www.thefix.com/david-cassidy-revealed-he-was-still-drinking-didnt-have-dementia-prior-death", "title": "David Cassidy Revealed He Was Still Drinking, Didn't Have Dementia Prior To Death", "meta_data": {"referrer": "unsafe-url", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Cassidy made the confession to a producer in a recorded conversation, which will air as part of an upcoming documentary about his life.", "keywords": "David Cassidy, Partridge Family, documentary, alcoholism, alcohol use disorder, problematic drinking, celebs & addiction, confession,", "news_keywords": "David Cassidy, Partridge Family, documentary, alcoholism, alcohol use disorder, problematic drinking, celebs & addiction, confession,", "fb": {"app_id": 104762786600092}, "og": {"site_name": "The Fix", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107/https://www.thefix.com/david-cassidy-revealed-he-was-still-drinking-didnt-have-dementia-prior-death", "title": "David Cassidy Revealed He Was Still Drinking, Didn't Have Dementia Prior To Death | The Fix", "description": "Cassidy made the confession to a producer in a recorded conversation, which will air as part of an upcoming documentary about his life.", "updated_time": "2018-06-08T13:58:50-04:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20190624221107im_/https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/DavidCassidy.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thefix.com/sites/default/files/DavidCassidy.jpg"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-08T13:00:00-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-08T13:58:50-04:00"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528477200.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
