While Katie Cazorla has been focused on maintaining her new business that has seen a set off, Shiva Safai is seen playing the matchmaker to find a girl for her younger brother in the last episode. These women have had their hands full this episode around. Let us find out more on this Second Wives Club recap!\n\nBusiness owner Katie Cazorla was very happy with her new caf\u00e9, Hi SocieTea opening. Unfortunately, she has a leak in the kitchen on the day of the opening. Katie freaks out about the \u201cheath inspection coming up\u201d and seeing all of the leaks! Katie Cazorla faces setoffs and desperately asks for a \u201cday drink\u201d out of frustration that she will have to lose \u201chundreds of thousands of dollars\u201d and two years of her life!\n\nKatie goes on to share that she \u201cdoes not have a fear of commitment to business\u201d but to \u201chuman beings\u201d when Walter talks about how them getting married is a \u201creally really big deal\u201d for him.\n\nWhile Katie freaks out about her caf\u00e9 opening setbacks, we see Veronika Obeng finally opening up about her husband\u2019s extramarital affair with Katie. Veronika reveals that she was \u201cpregnant the whole time it was happening\u201d!\n\nShiva Safai has been going bonkers by setting herself as the matchmaker for her younger brother Shanin and it has been pretty awkward till date. Shiva joins hands with Mohamed Hadid to find an elite girl so they head to the streets of Beverly Hills for the task!\n\nThe task is that both Mohamed Hadid and Shiva Safai have to find \u201cone girl each\u201d! Hadid and Safai closed the bet with a handshake and a \u201cdeal\u201d! While Shiva shows pictures of her younger brother to some single girls in the street, Mohmed has a calm informal interview with women about the kind of men they like!\n\nThe bet ends with Shiva winning since Shanin liked her pick the best. Shiva was euphoric with her win and went on to share that she does not \u201ccare if he has a girlfriend, a wife\u201d and cares only that she \u201cwon this bet\u201d! Not to forget that Shanin is already in a relationship with another girl at present!", "images":
