For these women, shopping Ivanka\u2019s clothing line and visiting Trump Towers just won\u2019t cut it.\n\nIvanka\u2019s features have sparked a fairly recent plastic surgery trend that has surgeons and the media alike taking notice. In fact, there\u2019s only one celebrity whose features are arguably more sought-after (page 6). Here\u2019s everything you need to know about the thousand-dollar trend that the first daughter inspired.\n\n1. People started requesting \u2018the Ivanka\u2019 in 2016\n\nNew York plastic surgeon Norman Rowe noted that since the 2016 Republic primaries, he\u2019s seen an influx of patients request to look like Ivanka Trump. \u201cI never saw [anyone drawing inspiration from Ivanka\u2019s face] before the primary,\u201d said Dr. Rowe, \u201csince the summer of \u201916 . . . [it\u2019s been] maybe four a month; one a week.\u201d\n\nSince the summer of 2016, nearly 50 clients have asked Dr. Rowe to give them the Ivanka look. Rowe has a theory on what draws his clients to Ivanka\u2019s elegant features. \u201cMaybe they just like the look, but also that [Ivanka\u2019s] a powerful woman, self-confident, part of the first family. Do they want to be her? Yes, deep down, maybe.\u201d\n\nNext: Party lines are irrelevant on this matter\n\n2. Both Democrats and Republicans want to look like the first daughter\n\nPolitical affiliation seems to have little influence when it comes to plastic surgery. While New Yorkers notoriously vote blue, that doesn\u2019t stop them from going for Ivanka\u2019s look. \u201cI don\u2019t think it plays a role in the least,\u201d Dr. Rowe said. \u201cI think it has to do with somebody who you respect the way they look, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s anything to do with whether you\u2019re blue or red.\u201d\n\nJenny Stuart, an IT headhunter in Texas, admitted to the irony behind her $30,000 Ivanka transformation. \u201c\u2026 I\u2019ve spent all this time and money to try and look like Ivanka, who I still adore \u2026 but I don\u2019t associate her with father,\u201d Stuart told ABC\u2019s Nightline, \u201c\u2026 so I voted for Hillary.\u201d\n\nNext: You won\u2019t believe how long it took one person to look like Ivanka.\n\n3. It took this woman 13 surgeries to get her look\n\nRowe described Ivanka\u2019s look to Page Six as widened cheekbones, a slender nose, and large eyes. Achieving these features takes clients multiple surgeries, depending on their original facial structure.\n\nThe procedures can include Botox, cheek implants, and rhinoplasty, the medical term for a nose job. To achieve what Dr. Rowe calls the \u201cPermanent Ivanka,\u201d patients will likely need all three. Botched patient Tiffany Taylor had 13 surgeries in one year before appearing on the show and asking the doctors to make her look more like her idol.\n\nNext: It costs thousands to look like the millionaire.\n\n4. It costs $50,000 to look like Ivanka\n\nThe surgeries can cost anywhere between $30,000 and $50,000. Clients who spend between $30-40,000 can achieve the look with temporary fillers and Botox, while others throw down $45-50,000 for a permanent Ivanka appearance.\n\nTaylor told ABC\u2019s Nightline that she\u2019d already had breast augmentation, a nose job, cheek injections, a \u201cmini\u201d eye lift, liposuction, and fat grafts added to her cheeks and planned to continue her surgeries. She had spent around $60,000 by the time she talked with Nightline.\n\nNext: There are tons of health risks associated with the surgeries.\n\n5. Some people risked everything just to get the surgery\n\nWhile these women had fairly successful Ivanka transformations (we \u2014 sort of \u2014 see the resemblance), going under the knife isn\u2019t something to take likely. There are plenty of health risks associated with plastic surgeries including hematomas, nerve damage, and infection.\n\nSurgical procedures like breast augmentation commonly lead to numbness, which can be a sign of nerve damage. Fifteen percent of women permanently lose nipple sensation. While relatively uncommon, you still face the risk of developing a pulmonary embolism, or blood clot, which can be fatal.\n\nNext: The only celebrity with a more popular face than Ivanka\n\n6. Kylie Jenner is the only celebrity face more popular than Ivanka\u2019s\n\nKing Kylie still holds the crown as the most sought-after celebrity face. Dr. Rowe told Page Six that Ivanka\u2019s look is beginning to rival Kylie Jenner\u2019s, the 20-year-old makeup mogul with noticeably enviable lips.\n\nDr. Simon Ourian, who performed Kylie Jenner\u2019s lip implants, told Entertainment Tonight that most people request her lips when they\u2019re looking to get something done. Jenner\u2019s pout sparked the \u201cKylie Jenner lip challenge,\u201d where people suctioned their lips to create a swollen, heavier lip look. Dr. Ourian warned against the challenge, saying, \u201d It could cause infections. It could cause bleeding. It could cause bruising that could be permanent.\u201d\n\nNext: The Ivanka Trump surgery trend didn\u2019t extend to her father.\n\n7. No one has requested to look like Donald\n\nAccording to Vanity Fair, In 1990, Ivana Trump said under oath that Donald flew into a fit of rage due to the pain from a scalp reduction surgery he\u2019d had performed in 1989. The surgery was intended to correct balding. While our current president has allegedly gone under the knife, he doesn\u2019t have many people vying for his look.\n\nDr. Rowe confirmed this, saying, \u201cNo, I\u2019ve never had anybody come in and say, \u2018Make me into a Donald!'\u201d\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/GettyImages-642093036-640x473.jpg?x50157", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/wallstcheatsheet-v2/images/logo/showbiz_2x.png?x50157", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ivanka-trump-phone-640x427.jpg?x50157", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kylie-Jenner-1024x682.jpg?x50157", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Ivanka-Trump-surgery-640x430.jpeg?x50157", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Jenny-stuart-640x282.png?x50157", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/ivanka-trump-plastic-surgery.png?x50157", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ivanka-trump-clapping-640x427.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ivanka-trump-clapping-640x427.jpg?x50157"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/10/ivanka-trump-clapping-640x427.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Bleznak"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20200919100220/https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ivanka-trump-plastic-surgery-trend.html/", "title": "Here\u2019s Everything You Need to Know About the Ivanka Trump Plastic Surgery Trend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/health-fitness/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-ivanka-trump-plastic-surgery-trend.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Requests for plastic surgery to look more like Ivanka Trump have skyrocketed since Donald Trump became president.
