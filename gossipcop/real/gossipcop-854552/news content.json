Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. Anyone. And that\u2019s not to any one person and don\u2019t quote me that it is, because it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nIt bears mentioning that Perry tapped Nicki Minaj as a collaborator, who had a public disagreement with Swift on Twitter following the MTV Video Music Awards nominations in 2015, an incident that prompted Perry to post the following tweet.\n\nThere was one person who appears to have read Perry\u2019s lyrics as shots fired and that was Ruby Rose, Orange Is the New Black star, DJ, and a friend of Taylor Swift\u2019s.\n\nRose took to her Twitter on early Friday morning to slam Perry and her song.\n\nRose did have compliments for collaborator Nicki Minaj, however.\n\nPreviously, Rose has publicly criticized Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian after a series of tweets related to Kim Kardashian West\u2019s Snapchat reveal of Swift\u2019s telephone conversation with Kanye West about his song \u201cFamous.\u201d\n\nListen to the song below.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/katy.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ruby-rose-katy-perry-taylor-swift-swish-swish.jpg?quality=85&w=2000", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ruby-rose-katy-perry-taylor-swift-swish-swish.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jesse-Bryant-skiing-at-JHMR-e1612191790559.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ruby-rose-katy-perry-taylor-swift-swish-swish.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4785868/ruby-rose-on-katy-perry-swish-swish/", "title": "Ruby Rose on the New Katy Perry Swish Swish Revenge Song", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Ruby Rose took to Twitter to slam Katy Perry for her new song 'Swish Swish' which Rose seems to believe was a diss directed at Taylor Swift.", "og": {"title": "Ruby Rose Criticizes Katy Perry's Revenge Song 'Swish Swish'", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4785868/ruby-rose-on-katy-perry-swish-swish/", "description": "\"To go from rebranding as political activist..to ditch it and go low is a bummer\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ruby-rose-katy-perry-taylor-swift-swish-swish.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4785868/ruby-rose-on-katy-perry-swish-swish/", "description": "Ruby Rose took to Twitter to slam Katy Perry for her new song 'Swish Swish' which Rose seems to believe was a diss directed at Taylor Swift.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ruby-rose-katy-perry-taylor-swift-swish-swish.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4785868/ruby-rose-on-katy-perry-swish-swish/", "title": "Ruby Rose Criticizes Katy Perry's Revenge Song 'Swish Swish'", "description": "\"To go from rebranding as political activist..to ditch it and go low is a bummer\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ruby-rose-katy-perry-taylor-swift-swish-swish.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z18eMqK9BMM"], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
