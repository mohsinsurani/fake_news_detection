Actually, several of the big winners in the 2018 Taste of Country Fan Choice Awards didn't get to sniff the ACM or CMA podiums.\n\nSo we make it right here. Fan vote is the only criteria used to decide the winners of this year's categories, including Song of the Year, Album of the Year and #RelationshipGoals Couple of the Year. Kane Brown didn't win the biggest prize, but he did win the most prizes. Lauren Alaina also had a strong showing with two wins. Brett Young, Cassadee Pope and \"Blank Stares\" singer Jay Allen took important categories, too, thanks to their fans.\n\nBlake Shelton is this year's Entertainer of the Year. This category was heavily voted-on, but the singer and The Voice coach pulled ahead with one-third of the total votes, topping Brown and Keith Urban.\n\nThe most-voted-on category was Album of the Year. It was a close race, but when the clock hit 11:59ET, Brown's Experiment album had edged out Urban's Graffiti U by a very narrow margin. Likewise, Alaina and Alex Hopkins edged Brown and Katelyn Jae in the almost too-close-to-call Couple of 2018 category.\n\n2018 Taste of Country Fan Choice Awards Winners:\n\n#RelationshipGoals Couple
