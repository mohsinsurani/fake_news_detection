I\u2019m having a hard time forgiving myself, but I\u2019m working on it. It was incredibly, incredibly embarrassing,\u201d Platten told People. \u201cI\u2019ve been trying to retrace steps of what happened \u2026 it has just been hanging over me.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI have done it a bunch of times, but I stepped in front of the people and I felt the expectation. I was ready to open up and do it, and my mind just went blank. I was trying to explain it to my husband: It was like a test that you know all the material to, you study so much and you get in there, and your mind doesn\u2019t cooperate.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: Fergie 'Butchers' National Anthem at NBA All-Star Game, Internet Kneels to Laugh\n\nPlatten, who is married to Kevin Lazan, performed the national anthem before Game 1 of the 2016 World Series.\n\n\u201cI was so nervous going into it. The anthem is such a big deal; it\u2019s probably the most important song for our country,\u201d she said. \u201cI always get nervous because it means so much because it is so powerful. I always want to do it justice, do a good job and give people the exact version they expect and they want.\u201d\n\nOn Saturday, the 36-year-old singer, best known for \u201cFight Song,\u201d was set to perform \u201cThe Star-Spangled Banner\u201d at the Rio Tinto Stadium in Sandy, Utah before the NWSL soccer game between the Utah Royals and the Chicago Red Stars.\n\nSee Video: Jimmy Kimmel Has the Perfect Excuse for His Reaction to Fergie's National Anthem\n\nHowever, she had to restart the anthem twice because she forgot the words, according to multiple media reports.
