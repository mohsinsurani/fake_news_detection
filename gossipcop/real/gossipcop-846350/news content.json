We are like repeaters,\u201d she told Vanity Fair then. \u201cRepeaters are the towers that you see at the top of mountains that pick up signals from the valley and carry them over the mountains to a broader audience. And that\u2019s what celebrities do, if we\u2019re doing our job right. We\u2019re picking up the voices of people who can\u2019t be heard and broadcasting their story.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_320%2Cc_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb67c22ac258e4f47aa/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss09.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbae6048371b41b51330/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbbaa0285a3db395c90e/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss10.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbbc0c2c5233a346e7ec/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss12.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbba85bd6441b19cf5b3/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss11.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbae01f7253cf1a1807b/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb1a0285a3db395c90c/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss05.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbaea0285a3db395c90a/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63349ccbb02ed9e1f657fa18/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb46048371b41b51332/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss07.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633f44b672fe11ef3849c439/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb65c7670327c1e55f7/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss08.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb0037376305a00f894/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss04.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63346d4bde6ed352605cedc3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5accbbb5037376305a00f896/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/celebrity-turned-activists-ss06.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6336052ab02ed9e1f657fa3b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5acd063b85bd6441b19cf5e9/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/t-celebrity-turned-activists-ss-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Hilary Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/photos/2018/04/celebrity-activists", "title": "Celebrities-Turned-Activists Throughout the Years", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Audrey Hepburn was an ambassador for UNICEF, Elizabeth Taylor fought for AIDS research, and Jane Fonda caused an uproar on her way to making change.
