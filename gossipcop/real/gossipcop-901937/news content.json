I don\u2019t know why.\u201d #elfonthesamedamnshelf,\u201d Pink wrote in the caption.\n\nThe \u201cWhat About Us\u201d singer might not be winning trophies for best \u201cElf on the Shelf\u201d positioning, but she wins at giving her daughter the best advice.\n\nPink recently told Cosmopolitan for their January 2018 issue about Willow\u2019s curiosity about dating and boys.\n\n\u201cShe said to me the other day, \u2018How many boys can I have at once?\u2019 And I said, \u2018Excuse me?\u2019 I said, \u2018Probably none of them because they won\u2019t deserve you,\u2019\u201d she explained.\n\nAs for teaching Willow how to choose partners, Pink\u2019s advice to her daughter was heartwarming.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Pink Gives Daughter Willow Touching & Empowering Dating Advice After 6-Year-Old Asks About Boys\n\n\u201cThey have to kind, respectful. They have to be chivalrous, they have to be good to their moms,\u201d she told her daughter of what to look for in a partner. \u201cThey have to be good-looking, they have to be funny.\u201d\n\nThe star shares Willow with husband, Carey Hart. The couple is also parents to 11-month-old son Jameson Moon. While raising two children may not be easy, that hasn\u2019t stopped the singer from dedicating time to teaching her daughter how to stand up for herself.\n\n\u201cI want her to speak her truth and I want her to practice it now with me so that she can be good at it later,\u201d Pink said. \u201cI think one of the most helpful things to remember in life to be true to herself.\u201d", "images":
