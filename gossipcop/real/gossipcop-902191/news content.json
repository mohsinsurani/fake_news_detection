But after trying tons of different remedies, Kardashian finally found something that's working.\n\nThis morning, Kardashian woke up to the best gift she could receive and showed fans her near-perfect skin on her Instagram story.\n\n\"OMG my psoriasis is almost gone! Best Christmas present!\" she captioned the shot of her legs.\n\nDonato Sardella/Getty Images for The Tot\n\nLooking for more style content?

Sometimes I just feel like it's my big flaw and everyone knows about it, so why cover it? After this many years, I've really learned to live with it.\"\n\nWhen Kardashian first discovered the psoriasis appearing on her legs in 2011 captured on an episode of KUWTK, she wasn't as accepting of the diagnosis.\n\nThe star visited Dr. Harold Lancer and once he confirmed she had psoriasis, Kardashian said, \"When the doctor tells me I have psoriasis I have heard of it before because my mom has always had it. But my mom didn't have red, flaky dots all over her.\"\n\nShe immediately worried about how psoriasis would affect her career in the spotlight.\n\n\"My career is doing ad campaigns and swimsuit photo shoots. People don't understand the pressure on me to look perfect,\" Kardashian said. \"Imagine what the tabloids would do to me if they saw all these spots.\"", "images":
