{"url": "http://screencrush.com/doctor-strange-thor-ragnarok-trailer/", "text": "If you stayed for the credits after Doctor Strange last year (of course you did) you saw the titular Sorcerer Supreme have a little sit down with Chris Hemsworth\u2018s Thor over some beer. So it only makes sense that Benedict Cumberbatch\u2018s Doctor will drop by Thor: Ragnarok.\n\nThe latest trailer for the Taika Waititi movie doesn\u2019t feature a ton of new footage, but does give us a look at Doctor Strange dropping in. The Japanese trailer opens with Thor in the Sanctum Sanctorum as the sorcerer flaunts his Cloak of Levitation and telling the God of Thunder that he senses \u201ca great change\u201d in Thor\u2019s future. You may notice that Hemsworth is sporting the same clothing he wore in the Doctor Strange post-credits scene, so it\u2019s safe to assume that conversation will place right after Thor arrives. Here\u2019s a refresher if you forgot:\n\nThe rest of the trailer jumps right into some of the familiar shots of Cate Blanchett\u2018s Hela, Thor and Mark Ruffalo\u2018s the Hulk fist-bumping, Tom Hiddleston\u2018s Loki all chained up, and Tessa Thompson\u2018s Valkyrie stealing the show. The trailer also sports a different title; the official Japanese title for the Waititi movie is Thor: Battle Royale, which sounds pretty awesome.", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2016/10/Doctor-Strange-spoilers.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2018/04/screencrush-high-rez.png"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2016/10/Doctor-Strange-spoilers.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["E.
