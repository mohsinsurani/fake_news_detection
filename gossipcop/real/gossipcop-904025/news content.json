{"url": "https://hellogiggles.com/news/logan-pauls-offensive-japan-videos/", "text": "This week, YouTuber Logan Paul received national attention for posting a wildly insensitive video of a victim of suicide in Japan\u2019s \u201cSuicide Forest.\u201d The internet celebrity has since removed and apologized for the video \u2014 but it now appears as though Logan Paul\u2019s trip to Japan was even more offensive than many of us realized, and we\u2019re not sure any amount of apologizing can undo the damage (or treacherous behavior).\n\nBefore the controversial forest video was posted, Paul shared several other videos of his time abroad, which largely serve as a compilation of his disrespectful and racist antics throughout the trip.\n\nAt one point Paul dons a traditional kimono while making stereotypical \u201cAsian\u201d hand and facial gestures. At other times he tosses eels and fish at moving cars, throws stuffed animals at store owners and local police as if he\u2019s \u201cplaying Pok\u00e9mon,\u201d and mocks an elderly woman who does not speak English. He does all of this while sarcastically saying that he must be \u201crespectful\u201d while in another culture.\n\nPaul\u2019s behavior was both juvenile and offensive, and showcases an unapologetic display of white privilege and ignorance. As one of the video\u2019s commenters, Sam M. wrote, \u201cInstead of being respectful and taking the time to learn something, Logan Paul squandered the opportunity. Surprise, surprise.\u201d Others noted that Paul is an \u201cembarrassment\u201d to his own culture by having so little regard for the culture of others.\n\nHere\u2019s an abbreviated version of the videos posted:\n\nAnd here\u2019s one of the full posts:\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bCsVKbha2EU?feature=oembed\n\nPaul has yet to comment on or apologize for his actions in these specific videos, but one thing is clear: An apology is necessary, and we sincerely hope Paul is held accountable. For our own part, let\u2019s use this as a crucial reminder to be respectful, kind, and self-aware, no matter where we are or who we\u2019re dealing with.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/05/Logan-Paul.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Woman-Reading-Outside.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/05/Logan-Paul.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/01/05/Logan-Paul.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Toria Sheffield"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/logan-pauls-offensive-japan-videos/", "title": "Logan Paul's trip to Japan was far more offensive than we realized", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "YouTube star Logan Paul has posted even more offensive videos of his trip to Japan, and this is absolutely unacceptable.
