Eagle-eyed fans spotted all sorts of butterfly references in the 11-minute long announcement video, and it all seemed very plausible.\n\n\n\nThere were all sorts of butterflies featured in the video YouTube/ELLE\n\nExcept, the theory was actually pretty flawed. Because Kylie Jenner hates butterflies, it turns out. And fans who watched Life of Kylie might remember the episode that proves it.\n\nWhen Kylie, Victoria and Jordyn took a trip to the London Zoo, they stopped off for a visit at the butterfly exhibit. But it quickly became clear that Kylie was scared shitless of butterflies.\n\nThis content is imported from YouTube. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\n\"It's kind of ironic because I'm terrified...terrified of butterflies,\" she told the camera later. \"This is how I think of them: cut the wings off and if you just look at their bodies, it's not that pretty.\"\n\nYeah, so that Butterfly/Mariposa name theory wasn't quite as on the mark as we first thought. But we've got Stormi instead, and that's pretty damn cute.\n\nFollow Cat on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?crop=1xw:0.9301566579634465xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/sites/cosmopolitan/assets/images/logos/ipso_regulated_hires.png", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kylie-stormi-1518093464.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=300:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?crop=1xw:0.9301566579634465xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Catriona Harvey-Jenner", "Features Editor", "Cat Is Cosmopolitan Uk'S Features Editor Covering Women'S Issues", "Health", "Current Affairs."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a17005125/kylie-jenner-actually-terrified-of-butterflies/", "title": "Kylie Jenner is actually terrified of butterflies", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Kylie Jenner is actually terrified of butterflies", "description": "In hindsight, that name theory was never going to be right.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/uk/entertainment/a17005125/kylie-jenner-actually-terrified-of-butterflies/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?crop=1xw:0.9301566579634465xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 211620818858710}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/cosmopolitanuk", "modified_time": "2018-03-27T17:12:46Z", "published_time": "2018-02-10T10:17:00Z", "section": "Entertainment", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@CosmopolitanUK", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?crop=1xw:0.9301566579634465xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Kylie Jenner is actually terrified of butterflies", "description": "In hindsight, that name theory was never going to be right.", "keywords": "Kylie Jenner hates butterflies, Kylie Jenner fears, Stormi Webster, Kylie Jenner baby name theory, butterfly theory Kylie baby name, Travis Scott, Kylie Jenner daughter, Kylie Jenner Travis Scott baby", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?crop=0.5375438596491228xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Entertainment,entertainment", "sailthru.date": "2018-02-10T10:17:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?crop=1xw:0.9301566579634465xh;center,top", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2018-02-10-at-10-05-21-1518257556.png?crop=0.5375438596491228xw:1xh;center,top", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kylie Jenner is actually terrified of butterflies", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518257820.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
