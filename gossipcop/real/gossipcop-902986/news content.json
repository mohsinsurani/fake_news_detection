That's what I would say.\"\n\nThings became a bit more awkward when Urban lost his ear piece while trying to show Cohen and Cooper the crowd in Nashville, where Urban was performing for the city's New Year's Eve celebration, and couldn't hear the interviewers.\n\nLuckily, the interview ended on an amicable note with everyone wishing each other a happy New Year. After the call ended, Cohen realized Kidman had given him a little jab.\n\n\"That was amazing. That was so cool that Nicole Kidman joined in,\" Cohen said. \"I think she just shaded me a little bit.\"\n\n\"Well yeah, she did. Yes,\" Cooper agreed.\n\n\"I guess she's not coming on my show,\" the Watch What Happens Live host concluded.\n\nCooper seemed to understand Kidman's viewpoint. In a tweet, he described her comments as \"some well deserved shade.\"\n\nThe CNN anchor then mentioned that Cohen has lots of celebrity guests on his Bravo talk show.\n\n\"Not Nicole Kidman,\" Cohen responded.", "images": ["https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"], "top_img": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-andy-cohen-new-years-eve/", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Throw Some Shade at Andy Cohen", "meta_data": {"description": "Watch @NicoleKidman cast some well-deserved shade at @Andy Cohen after he asks her a seriously [...]", "keywords": "Anderson Cooper,Nicole Kidman,New Years Eve,CNN,Keith Urban,Andy Cohen", "news_keywords": "Anderson Cooper,Nicole Kidman,New Years Eve,CNN,Keith Urban,Andy Cohen", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "PopCulture", "creator": "PopCulture", "title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Throw Some Shade at Andy Cohen", "description": "Watch @NicoleKidman cast some well-deserved shade at @Andy Cohen after he asks her a seriously [...]", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"}, "og": {"title": "Nicole Kidman and Keith Urban Throw Some Shade at Andy Cohen", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/nicole-kidman-keith-urban-andy-cohen-new-years-eve/", "image": {"identifier": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "Watch @NicoleKidman cast some well-deserved shade at @Andy Cohen after he asks her a seriously [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#263240", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514764800.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
