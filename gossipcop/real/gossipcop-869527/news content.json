According to TMZ, the couple has been fielding absurd offers to supply photos of the newborn months before the birth, but they have continually refused.\n\nVarious outlets were offering more than a million dollars, and even $2-5 million, for the photos. In the past, Kim and Kanye waited until North and Saint were two months old before posting their first photos online.\n\nTMZ also reports that Kim was in the hospital room during the delivery, and was the first person to have skin-to-skin contact with the baby. Kanye was in the delivery room as well, but remained behind a curtain as to give the surrogate some privacy during birth. He held the baby after she was born.\n\nKim made the announcement on her website shortly after the baby's arrival. \"Kanye and I are happy to announce the arrival of our healthy, beautiful baby girl,\" she wrote. \"We are incredibly grateful to our surrogate who made our dreams come true with the greatest gift one could give and to our wonderful doctors and nurses for their special care. North and Saint are especially thrilled to welcome their baby sister.\u200b\"\n\nA source told People that Kanye is a \"hands-on\" dad. \u201cKanye says that his children have saved his life,\u201d the insider further explained. \u201cThis one in particular came along after a very dark time.

But it seems that with the arrival of the new baby, the two are bouncing back.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 203 115\"%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/p8gxgafnal3ygamdfx73/kim-kanye", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6685975&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/p8gxgafnal3ygamdfx73/kim-kanye", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tara C.
