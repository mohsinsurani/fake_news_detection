Long after the Earth is swallowed up by the sun, Chuck Berry\u2019s record will still be floating in space.

I\u2019m not Tupac, or this prophetic dude or anything like that, I just want to make music and have fun. However, I have a power that a a lot of people in this world don\u2019t, and I\u2019ve been given a stage that the one percent get. I thought if I was going to have this power, I\u2019d use it for positivity \u2014 peace love and positivity to spread a positive message. Everyone is beautiful, and the world isn\u2019t equal \u2014 and we need to fight towards that.\u201d\n\n11:12 p.m. Donald Glover, aka Childish Gambino, comes to the press room post-show and addresses his 2017 comments about bringing Childish Gambino to an end \u2014 even despite winning a Grammy for best traditional R&B performance (\u201cRedbone\u201d) earlier in the night. \u201cI stand by that,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019m really appreciative of this and I\u2019m making another project, but I like endings. I think they\u2019re important to progress. If a lot of things had death notes or clauses we\u2019d have less problems. Endings are good, they force things to get better.\u201d\n\n11: 55 p.m. Grammys executive producer Ken Ehrlich talks to reporters in the press room in a late post-show appearance (the final press room appearance of the night), briefly discussing Taylor Swift\u2019s absence at this year\u2019s awards \u2014 and hinted that she may be invited to perform in 2019: \u201cHopefully we\u2019ll see her next year, we\u2019d like her on the show.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/grammys-2018-recirc-billboard.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alessia-cara-backstage-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alessia-cara-backstage-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Taylor Weatherby"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/grammys-2018-what-fans-didnt-see-on-tv-behind-the-scenes-8096794/", "title": "41 Things You Didn\u2019t See on TV at Grammys 2018", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "From red carpet interactions to press room commentary, Grammys given out early to behind-the-scenes moments inside the official show, here's a glimpse of what doesn't get caught on camera on music's biggest night.", "news_keywords": "Grammys", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "billboard", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 8096794, "author": "Taylor Weatherby", "pmc-category": "Awards,Music", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-01-29T00:13:10"}, "pmc-tag": "Grammys", "title": "41 Things You Didn\u2019t See on TV at Grammys 2018", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-always-paywall": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-exclusive": "no", "pmc-breaking-news": "no", "pmc-prime": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Taylor Weatherby", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Billboard", "application-name": "Billboard", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 8096794, "title": "41 Things You Didn't See on TV at Grammys 2018", "published_at": "2018-01-29 00:13:10", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/alessia-cara-backstage-grammys-show-2018-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Grammys", "topics": "Music", "body": "Music fans tuning into the Grammy Awards got to see all of the action live from Madison Square Garden starting at 7:30 p.m. ET Sunday night (Jan. 28), but the day started long before that for many of the night's nominees.

A mi equipo de trabajo; Polo, Pepo, Isaac Lee, Afo, Jorge. A los genios musicales que viajan conmigo y hacen que los temas del disco suenen igual de cabron en vivo. Agradezco tambi\u00e9n a toda la gente en @electricladystudios donde estuve metido esos 2 a\u00f1os. A @philjolygram y a Tom Elmhirst. \u00a1Gracias! ---- \u2022 I want to thank all the musicians from 4 different continents and more than 10 countries that worked in this album. From Hanura Fati in Tamale, Ghana to Duan Ya Wen in Beijing. It was 2 years of creation. For me it\u2019s the most precise album in my career and I did it with the intention of making art; to reflect in music and lyrics what I experienced in each of the countries I visited. I never thought of \u201chits\u201d, radio or awards. I just wanted to make an honest album with great musicians unknown by the industry. I also want to thank @trooko and @rafhaellarcaute. My work team, the music geniuses that travel with me and make the songs sound as good live. Im thankful for everyone in @electricladystudios where I spent 2 years; and @philjolygram and Tom Elmhirst, @isaacleep , @brandon_bost @pepoferradas .
