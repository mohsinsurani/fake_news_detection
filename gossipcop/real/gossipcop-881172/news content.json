The actor posted a rainbow flag on Instagram that says \u201cEquality\u201d in the middle of it. In his caption, he explained why seeing this was upsetting for anyone to see, especially members of the LGBTQ community, including himself.\n\n\u201cJust saw the \u201cvote no\u201d message in the sky, looming over Sydney. Thank you for raising money and hiring on a plane to write your lack of support amongst the clouds. I hope your hate and lack of understanding fades, just like those words will. Too many of my friends have been kicked out of their homes, kept in the closet, beat up, killed, ridiculed by church and state, institutionalized\u2026 and you are scared that if we vote YES, you won\u2019t be able to show your hate for Us,\u201d Justin wrote. \u201cF\u2014k that. We\u2019ve been scared s\u2014tless our whole lives thanks to all the stigmas that surround Us, stigmas that were set in place by the same kind of people who flew that plane over Sydney. We\u2019ve fought, we\u2019ve come out bravely even in our fear, and you wrote a message in the sky because you\u2019re scared. Equality takes courage, it worries me that too many people in this world lack the balls to stand up for what is right. #f\u2014khate.\u201d\n\nNow that is a truly powerful message anyone can learn from. Brandon subtly writing \u201cUs\u201d confirms that he not only supports LGBTQ rights but also identifies as someone who has dealt with the stigma that unfortunately still exists for people who are in the community. The actor was rumored to be dating his 13 Reasons Why co-star Miles Heizer, who plays Alex Standall, but Miles\u2019 rep confirmed that they are just friends.\n\n\u201cThis is a false report. Miles and Brandon are friends from the show but are not dating,\u201d the rep said to Page Six. And since then, the actor has been spotted getting cozy with singer Sam Smith, and the pair looked as happy as ever walking arm in arm, sharing a kiss. So while Brandon didn\u2019t blatantly comment on his own sexuality in that heartfelt IG post, it\u2019s clear he\u2019s sharing his own experiences all in the hopes that equality for everyone will become a reality very soon. And that is beyond commendable.\n\nWatch: Check Out Behind-the-Scenes Photos From Season One of *13 Reasons Why*\n\nLove J-14?
