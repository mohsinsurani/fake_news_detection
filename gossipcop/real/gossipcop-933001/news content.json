It is The Last Judgement. This is the painting I am wearing. I am so excited about my dress. I just love it!\u201d Grande said in an interview with E!. \u201cI am honored to be here. It is my first Met so I am really excited.\u201d\n\nThe famed fresco covers the altar wall of the Sistine Chapel and depicts humanity awaiting their eternal judgment by God.
