night, removing her heels seemingly in protest at the strict dress code.\n\nThe Cannes red carpet has become infamous in recent years for its high heels only policy, with actresses speaking out against it.\n\nMs Stewart kicked off her black Louboutins on the \"BlacKkKlansman\", turning heads and causing some to wonder whether it was done as a show against the footwear rule.\n\nAfter taking off her shoes on the red carpet in front of photographers, she proceeded to climb the stairs barefoot.\n\nIt does not appear she was sanctioned for her rebellious act - although she took them off, she did wear her high heels for part of the red carpet and was photographed in them.\n\nThe controversial dress code caused many to speak out in fury in 2015 after a group of women wearing flat shoes were reportedly turned away from seeing a screening of Carol.", "images":
