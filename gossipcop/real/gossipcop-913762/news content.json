The two are said to have met when Gibson was acting on Chicago Hope, and Dorfman, first representing Gibson as a talent agent, says he convinced Gibson to audition for Dharma & Greg.\n\n\u201cThe only constant in GIbson\u2019s life and career has been Dorfman, and now Gibson has decided to burn Dorfman as well, and not pay him for his years of work,\u201d states the lawsuit (read here).\n\nThe lawsuit attempts to burn Gibson right back with the revelation that he makes $200,000 per episode for CBS\u2019 Criminal Minds and word that he\u2019s known as \u201cCaptain Vanilla\u201d among industry professionals thanks to his \u201clack of professionalism.\u201d\n\nDorfman claims credit for doing stuff like cajoling network execs and angry producers after Gibson sparred with co-workers and making up excuses for last-minute cancellations of press tours. The manager says he picked the actor up from jail one time after being arrested for drunk driving and defended his client after the \u201csending [of] lewd videos and messages to a stranger he met online.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s all setup to the primary allegation that Gibson has breached an agreement by failing to pay 10 percent of his salary to Dorfman, not only for Criminal Minds but for such independent films as Come Away Home, Berkeley and I\u2019ll Believe You. The contract is said to be an oral one, agreed to in January 2003.\n\nThe end of the relationship between the two is described as coming after Gibson demanded earlier this year that the commissions be reduced to 7.5 percent, and when Dorfman refused, he was terminated. The plaintiffs are now seeking at least $480,000 in damages.\n\nThe lawsuit was first reported by Deadline Hollywood.\n\nEmail: Eriq.Gardner@THR.com\n\nTwitter: @eriqgardner", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/thomas.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/thomas.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/thomas.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eriq Gardner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/criminal-minds-actor-thomas-gibson-726614/", "title": "\u2018Criminal Minds\u2019 Actor Thomas Gibson Sued Over Manager\u2019s Commissions", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Frontline's Craig Dorfman demands 10 percent of the actor's $4.8 million annual salary for the CBS series", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Eriq Gardner", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 726614, "title": "'Criminal Minds' Actor Thomas Gibson Sued Over Manager's Commissions", "published_at": "2014-08-20 13:40:09", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/thomas.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "topics": "Business News", "body": "Frontline Entertainment Management is taking Criminal Minds actor Thomas Gibson to court over money allegedly owed to the firm's Craig Dorfman.\r\nAccording to a complaint filed in Los Angeles Superior Court, Dorfman has represented Gibson since 1996 \u2014 through five different publicists, three business managers and three talent agencies.
