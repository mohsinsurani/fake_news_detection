Cailee Spaeny, Lewis Pullman, and Nick Offerman also star, with Drew Goddard directing from his own script. Goddard also produced \u201cBad Times.\u201d\n\nBridges is warned by the clerk, \u201cThis is not a place for a priest, father,\u201d and admits later in the trailer, \u201cCan I confess something to you?
