Braided Weft hair extensions are sewn into your natural hair which is braided to cover your whole head and the wefts of hair are sewn in to the braided rows. Those with thin hair usually do not have enough hair to make the small braid to hold the hair extension.\n\nIt is important to consider how much weight, stress and tension is placed on your natural hair by the hair extensions. For fine or thin hair, you should look for the lightest density for hair extensions.\n\nIt may seem that strand by strand application would be the lightest weight in applying extensions to your hair. But you must consider the potential damage to your hair that can be caused by bonding individual pieces of hair to natural thin hair.\n\nWith tape in hair extensions, the extensions are light weight and require no glue, tools or fusion type of bond to stay in your hair. With the single method application, the extension is bonded with a piece of tape rather than sandwiching two extensions together. By doing so, the weight is reduced by half which is best for causing the least amount of strain and possible damage to thin hair.\n\nMicro bead hair extensions vs. Tape Extensions: Tape Ins Cause Less Damage\n\nThere are also micro tape in hair extensions that are very small pieces of individual hair that can be taped in hair to add volume and highlights without changing the natural structure of your hair, minimizing any risk of damage to your hair.\n\nFor the most natural, non-damaging hair extension method for thin hair, you should consider the tape in hair extension option to add volume and length to thin hair.
