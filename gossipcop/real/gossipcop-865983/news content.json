We were together all the time. I don't know if there's anything you see ... the way he died, how do you go living your life one day with him every single day, then all of a sudden you don't, you live life without them?\"\n\n\"I don't talk to anybody about this,\" he added, \"I'm a public figure but I'm private in that aspect of him.\"\n\n\"There is a visual that's going through, the feeling is, 'If I weren't turning, I would be fine, but I'm up straight,'\" Tyler Henry says. \"And this is the weird thing that's coming across, 'I don't have enough time to be able to correct anything that would have gone wrong.' The feeling is, 'The center of balance isn't the center of the vehicle' ... the focus is almost like, 'I don't have the balance.'\"\n\n\"I'm shaking right now hearing you say that,\" DelVecchio says in reaction. \"That's exactly what happened.\"\n\nPauly previously gave tribute to Iannotti by getting a tattoo reading \"RIP Billy\" in his honor.\n\n\"Hollywood Medium with Tyler Henry\" airs Wednesdays at 9am PT.", "images": ["https://images.toofab.com/image/3f/3by2/2022/10/05/3ffae1c2aa4b4ae08bba9ca0ffca7702_md.jpg",
