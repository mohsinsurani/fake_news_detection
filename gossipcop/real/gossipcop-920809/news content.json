Though Hollywood relationships are notoriously short-lived (blame the pressures of fame and red carpet-worthy egos,) some stars are undeniably terrible partners. From Gwyneth Paltrow, who's totally willing to admit she's hard to date, to Chris Brown, who was put on probation for his disturbing crimes against Rihanna, the spectrum of inconsiderate partners is notably vast. There are hundreds of ways to hurt the one you love \u2014 and even more if you've got money.\n\nNot every celebrity bad boy (or girl) stays that way, though. Some regretful partners actually do change. Take Adam Levine, for example, who allegedly apologized to his exes before settling down, or Justin Bieber, whose plea for forgiveness infected airwaves in 2015. Then there's John Mayer, who still seems sort of bitter about that one Taylor Swift song (yeah, we're still waiting on the world to change, too.)\n\nIf the bad press is true, these celebrities are notoriously inconsiderate partners that you wouldn't want to date.", "images": ["https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/celebrities-who-treat-their-significant-others-like-trash/intro-1524001111.jpg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/celebrities-who-treat-their-significant-others-like-trash/intro-1524001111.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mariel Loveland"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/118465/celebrities-treat-significant-others-like-trash/", "title": "Celebrities Who Treat Their Significant Others Like Trash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/celebrities-who-treat-their-significant-others-like-trash/intro-1524001111.jpg", "title": "Celebrities Who Treat Their Significant Others Like Trash - Nicki Swift", "description": "Love isn't easy, but it's harder when your significant other treats you like trash.
