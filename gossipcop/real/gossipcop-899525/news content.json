Troy Bolton was good at two things during his reign as the superstar athlete in High School Musical \u2014 basketball and singing. Yet, Zac Efron, who is known for playing the role of Troy, didn\u2019t actually sing in the first High School Musical movie. Basically, he just lip-synced to another singer\u2019s voice and the world took it as his own.\n\nZac has since owned up to the fact that it was a singer by the name of Drew Seeley whose voice HSM fanatics fell in love with and not his. In an old interview, he explained that he had to actually \u201cfight\u201d to get his vocals on the second and third movies\u2019 soundtracks. \u201cIn the first movie, after everything was recorded, my voice was not on them.
