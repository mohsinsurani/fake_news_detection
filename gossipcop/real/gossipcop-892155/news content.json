All of the pressing issues are addressed here.\n\nIt should therefore come as no surprise that I am going to attempt to answer the question which is on everybody\u2019s lips:\n\nIs Lethal Weapon a Christmas Movie?\n\nThe internet has established that Die Hard is a seasonal movie. That one is buried. The next one to consider must be the 1986 Richard Donner classic, starring Mel Gibson & Danny Glover.\n\nIt certainly opens the right way, to the sounds of \u2018Jingle Bell Rock\u2019 by Bobby Helms. Some nae-sayers might point out that this festive favourite fades out into some tense music which culminates in the death of a drugged-out prostitute, but don\u2019t let that put you off thinking it\u2019s a Christmas movie. After all, Home Alone begins with a young child being left while his parents go abroad and White Christmas starts in a war zone. It\u2019s just a starting point.\n\nShortly afterwards, we meet the person who\u2019s journey brings the Christmas Spirit, recently widowed cop Martin Riggs (Mel Gibson). He\u2019s at a low, toying with thoughts of suicide and acting without caution during his day job. It\u2019s typical of a Christmas movie that the hero hits a low before being saved. Why, wasn\u2019t it thoughts of suicide that led George Bailey to be visited by old Clarence the angel in It\u2019s a Wonderful Life?\n\nThe Christmas songs keep coming. I\u2019ll Be Home for Christmas, Silent Night, Jingle Bells, The First Noel.\n\nThe storyline is one of hope and salvation. Roger Murtaugh (Danny Glover) may be too old for this shit, but his growing friendship and camaraderie with Riggs in chasing lunatic merc Joshua (Gary Busey) brings him back from the edge. In their common bonds of wanting to rescue Rog\u2019s daughter, avoid Trish\u2019s (Roger\u2019s wife\u2019s) cooking and get through a day without killing another bad guy, a strong friendship is formed.\n\nThe movie ends with Riggs outside Murtaugh\u2019s house on Christmas Day, being invited in for a terribly cooked Christmas dinner, and there\u2019s not a dry eye in the house.\n\nIs it a Christmas movie? Well, it\u2019s set at Christmas. It has Christmas throughout the movie. It has Christmas music at every turn. Some of the bad guys are shot while wearing Santa hats. Is that enough?\n\nNo, it isn\u2019t. But that\u2019s fine because it isn\u2019t those things that make it a Christmas movie. It\u2019s the saving of Riggs. Murtaugh is his Clarence, providing him with validation, support and a reason to be here. Riggs tells Murtaugh that it\u2019s only the job that\u2019s prevented him from topping himself so far, but by the end, we see that it\u2019s being part of a family that\u2019s made his eyes light up. Now, isn\u2019t that the same journey taken by George Bailey?", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/97a90e53e5016cce10194bc5f7bbd1c6?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lwc-3.jpg", "https://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lwc-2.jpg", "https://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lwc-1.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3f59e06e4d26f745d1b82125aeda35ac?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fdc8955a5eb3ff16b038b58af51ec379?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/lftpside2.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/254505df1d87777d4f5aa16c4fcd3190?s=24&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa4ceeda020a2d8362806b67b6ec0e4d?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/10/large800logo.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/369eb38097b550f3f4a20527239b23d7?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/254505df1d87777d4f5aa16c4fcd3190?s=16&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4aa0a0aa2bb5e692a5eb2c1cd725d5f9?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/53e514ccced6d7f9f9d07b52ff4de935?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/jenny-sidebar.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a3d81285c722c97cbdfc018daebd80d8?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/a8492f30ea4901dc081863376b7f655d?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "http://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/dadhood-widget.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/cb8e30d2d963bb253b23ccd875e489ba?s=50&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lwc-tw.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.lookingforthepostman.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/lwc-tw.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.lookingforthepostman.com/is-lethal-weapon-christmas-movie/", "title": "Is Lethal Weapon a Christmas Movie?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1.0,user-scalable=yes", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Yes, of course it is.
