Oh man y\u2019all are delusional. The girl is a piece of trash x.\u201d\n\nClara went on to share in the interview that \u201cthere had been a lot building up to it and a lot to deal with \u2014 not to make excuses or anything \u2014 but, yeah, it wasn\u2019t my finest moment.\u201d\n\nInstagram\n\nExplaining how she came to leave the comment, the model and actress said that she was repeatedly being tagged in that same photograph of her father\u2019s new girlfriend.\n\n\u201cI kept being tagged in this photograph and I was seeing negative things about my mom,\u201d she shared. \u201cI said how I felt and I didn\u2019t want to apologise for it. It wasn\u2019t the right way to go about things, but it\u2019s a hard thing to wrap your head around when you feel you had this idea of what the family unit is and then to have that shift. It\u2019s very weird.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ewan Mcgregor Splits From Wife Of 22 Years \u2014 As He\u2019s Spotted Kissing Costar Mary Elizabeth Winstead\n\nMcGregor and Mavrakis split last October, and at the time a family source revealed to PEOPLE that the couple had been separated since May 2017. The announcement came amid news that McGregor was spotted kissing his Fargo costar.\n\nMcGregor officially filed for divorce on Jan. 19, citing irreconcilable differences as the reason for their split\n\nBen Gabbe/Getty Images\n\nIn the interview, Clara also shared that although she already knew about the realities of her parents relationship before news of their split broke, she was still shocked when photographs of her father together with Winstead were first published.\n\n\u201cWe had already started dealing with it and trying to cope. It was incredibly surprising to me that they had gone out in public,\u201d she said, adding that \u201cthe picture surfaced on my little sister\u2019s birthday.\u201d\n\nRob Kim/Getty Images\n\n\u201cBut my dad didn\u2019t know it was going to come out. He didn\u2019t want us to see that, but, you know, there were paparazzi following them around,\u201d Clara shared, defending her father.\n\nWhile the model and actress went on to share \u201cthat I have my mom\u2019s back in this \u2014 fully,\u201d she made it clear that she\u2019s \u201cstill very close to my dad.\u201d\n\n\u201cI love him and I always will,\u201d she added. \u201cThe relationship\u2019s not going to end because of this. We are incredibly close and despite me strongly disagreeing with how he\u2019s gone about things, I\u2019ll always love him, and I hope he\u2019s happy, you know?\u201d", "images":
