The dress was similar to the Brandon Maxwell dress her sister-in-law, Meghan Markle, wore at an event in London last week.\n\nKate, who is the patron of the All England Lawn Tennis & Croquet Club, seemed keen on catching all the action \u2014 staring intently at the court as Novak stormed to his fourth Wimbledon title.\n\nLeaving kids George, Charlotte and Louis at home, Kate and William, 36, appeared to be enjoying their afternoon out together for the game.\n\nThis afternoon\u2019s match brought out all the big names, including Prime Minister Theresa May, and actors Benedict Cumberbatch, Eddie Redmayne and Emma Watson.\n\nThe stars all seemed eager to chat as they sat in the prestigious box \u2014 with Sherlock star Cumberbatch spotted sharing a joke with Redmayne.\n\nHugh Grant also made an appearance, along with Spiderman\u2019s Tom Holland.\n\nThe Sunday afternoon match also saw Prime Minister Theresa May appearing relaxed, despite having had a big week that included meeting with US President Donald Trump. The politician didn\u2019t seem to mind as she stood to give room for Kate and William to squeeze past to their seats ahead of the game.\n\nIt comes after mum-of-three Kate was joined by sister-in-law Meghan for the women\u2019s singles final on Saturday.\n\nThe Duchesses exuded Wimbledon chic with Meghan, 36, teaming a loose-fitted blue and white-striped shirt with wide-legged, high-waisted white trousers and a white straw boater hat.\n\nMeanwhile, Kate sported a black and white patterned midi dress with ruffle detail, teamed with nude heels and drop earrings.\n\nThe pair appeared to get along smashingly \u2014 exchanging jokes and smiles as they watched Serena Williams lose in straight sets to Germany\u2019s Angelique Kerber.\n\nMeghan appeared disheartened after Serena lost the match, with the athlete telling fellow mums: \u201cI was playing for you today.\u201d\n\nThe top tennis player gave birth to her first child in September last year \u2014 returning to her beloved sport in less than a year.\n\nMeghan and Kate managed to stay cool during the match, shown around Wimbledon by chairman of the AELTC Philip Brook and his wife Gill.\n\nThey then greeted an excited line of ball boys and ball girls at the club and chatted to some junior tennis players.\n\nThis article originally appeared on The Sun and has been republished with permission.", "images":
