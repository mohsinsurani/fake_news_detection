Another year, an incredible year, one we will surely never forget.\"\n\nThe Twilight star continued by writing down everything that she loves about her husband and father of their child.\n\n\"It\u2019s hearing your sweet voice singing silly songs with me in the morning.

It\u2019s driving across the country listening to you tell stories from another life,\" she added.\n\nReed also noted that the secret to their long and happy marriage is: \"I need to be in bed by 930, and you need to start manifesting all your dreams at 10.
