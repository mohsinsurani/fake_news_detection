If anyone is going to end my career, okay, it\u2019s going to be me,\u201d he added. He then launched into a 10-minute segment in which he and his friends pick up his $150,000-plus custom Mercedes SUV.\n\nThe move comes after widespread criticism of Paul for his insensitivity and poor behavior in multiple incidents, including a vlog from late December where he filmed the body of an apparent suicide victim in a Japanese forest. During the same trip to Japan, Paul had earlier released vlogs where he \u201cwav[ed] raw fish in Japanese people\u2019s faces, dress[ed] up like Pikachu and [threw] a plush Pokeball at random people in the street, including a police officer.\u201d\n\nAlthough he later apologized, YouTube temporarily suspended ad revenue on his channels and put his YouTube Red projects on hold, citing a \u201crecent pattern of behavior.\u201d After taking several weeks away from vlogging to \u201creflect,\u201d Paul returned in late January with a video titled \u201cSuicide: Be Here Tomorrow,\u201d where he spoke with the director of the National Suicide Prevention Hotline and said, \u201cIt\u2019s time to start a new chapter in my life.\u201d\n\nThis new chapter soon included jokes about swallowing Tide Pods and a vlog in which he pulled a koi fish out of a pond and pretended to give it CPR and tased a dead rat, indicating that he had learned very little. Once again, YouTube temporarily suspended ads on his channel.", "images": ["https://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FofUnwKW5LfuaSHgoKUN8za9ruE8%3D%2F0x0%3A2040x1360%2F100x100%2Ffilters%3Afocal(1020x680%3A1021x681)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24078801%2F226332_Ava_smart_home_controller_JTuohy_0001.jpg&w=2400&q=75", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fn-xKFM0whqX936EfFb3y_0lkEeM%3D%2F0x0%3A1920x1080%2F100x100%2Ffilters%3Afocal(586x418%3A587x419)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24078778%2F03_horizon_zero_dawn.jpg&w=2400&q=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2FqWelI6d3MtzTAhURhh0U-4Jltoc%3D%2F0x0%3A1440x960%2F100x100%2Ffilters%3Afocal(734x342%3A735x343)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F24029492%2Fhouseofthedragon.jpg&w=2400&q=75"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Devon Maloney", "Laura Hudson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17303330/logan-paul-daily-vlog-ending", "title": "YouTube star Logan Paul is ending his daily vlogs", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@verge"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "og": {"site_name": "The Verge", "title": "YouTube star Logan Paul is ending his daily vlogs", "description": "The YouTube star wants to \u201cdiversify, bro\u201d", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17303330/logan-paul-daily-vlog-ending", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large", "description": "After a series of incidents where he was criticized for insensitivity and bad behavior, the popular vlogger is stepping back from regular content.", "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-30T19:15:19.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-30T19:15:19.000Z"}, "author": "Laura Hudson", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Logan Paul is ending his daily vlogs", "parsely-link": "https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/30/17303330/logan-paul-daily-vlog-ending", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/Pk7JZzGd7Utk9-CXiMDsO7b-ef4=/0x118:3360x1994/1200x628/filters:focal(1344x301:1345x302)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10752423/Screen_Shot_2018_04_30_at_11.56.49_AM.png", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-04-30T19:15:19.000Z", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-tags": "verge,front-page,tech,youtube", "parsely-author": "Laura Hudson", "next-head-count": 31}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525042800.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
