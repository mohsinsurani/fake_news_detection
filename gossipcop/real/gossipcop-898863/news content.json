Jason George revealed in September that he is sadly leaving the medical drama after seven years, but that\u2019s not the end of Ben! He will be joining a still-unnamed spin-off. Scroll down to learn everything we know about his exit!\n\nWhat is the Grey\u2019s Anatomy spin-off about?\n\nThe spin-off is set to be about a group of Seattle firefighters, and will focus on both their professional and their home lives. If you remember from the Season 13 finale, Ben ran inside the fire to try and save his fellow doctor Stephanie Edwards \u2014 who also left the show for another TV opportunity \u2014 so this role sounds totally fitting for him.\n\nJason on Grey\u2019s Anatomy.\n\nJason also opened up about the upcoming show. \u201cI think the fun thing about firefight spin-off is that firefighters are on for 24-hour shifts and they become like a family. They eat together, they\u2019re sleeping there \u2013 it\u2019s like the Grey\u2018s family, except for when the Grey\u2019s family makes mistakes, a patient dies,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen these guys make mistakes your partner dies, your friend dies, your lover, whatever, dies. That\u2019s an interesting new level and new twist to the work-family kind of thing.\u201d\n\nWill there be crossover episodes of Grey\u2019s Anatomy and the spin-off?\n\nYou bet! On Dec. 7 Jason revealed that the two worlds will be much more closely connected than Private Practice was! \u201cMy understanding is, Ben will be popping up in Grey\u2019s Anatomy some and some of your favorite Grey\u2019s Anatomy folks will be popping up in the spin-off,\u201d Jason told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cWhen it was Private Practice, the show was located in Los Angeles, so by definition, it had to be an event when they came up to Seattle or vice versa. This one can be an event, but it also doesn\u2019t have to be. The fun part is, the writers have an embarrassment of riches, they can play it any way they want it at any given time. They could have a mega event that goes across both shows, or they could just drop off a person for a little bit and go have a beer. \u2018Hey Avery, this is my friend from the firehouse.'\u201d So cool!\n\nWhen can we expect to see Jason George on the Grey\u2019s Anatomy spin-off?\n\nThe new series has yet to be named (any suggestions?), is officially airing on Thursday, March 22! Jason previously shared that they had already started filming as well. \u201cWe\u2019ve been training and we\u2019ve been shooting,\u201d he told Variety in November. \u201cI was out with two of the guys last night, hanging out. They\u2019re a fantastic cast I think people are going to fall in love with!\u201d We can\u2019t wait!\n\nWhat does Jason George\u2019s departure mean for Chandra Wilson?\n\nWe don\u2019t know, but we\u2019re really hoping Miranda Bailey stays around Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital for a while. However, when Ben did admit that he didn\u2019t tell his wife, she wasn\u2019t very happy!\n\nAfter the news, it sort of hasn\u2019t been brought up again. Will they divorce? Will she go with him? Will he die in the show? We\u2019re not saying that\u2019s out of the question knowing the show\u2019s creator Shonda Rhimes. We\u2019re dying to find out! Jason admitted to Variety, \u201cI love testing the Ben and Bailey relationship, so we\u2019ll see if it breaks, if this is the straw that breaks that back.\u201d\n\nHas Jason George left Grey\u2019s Anatomy yet?\n\nNot yet, but his character, Dr. Ben Warren, finally brought it up for the first time during Grey\u2019s earlier in Season 14. While hanging out on Jackson Avery\u2019s (Jesse William) new yacht drinking beers with Owen Hunt (Kevin McKidd), Andrew DeLuca (Giacomo Gianniotti), and Alex Karev (Justin Chambers), Ben spilled the beans! \u201cI applied to the fire training academy and I got in,\u201d he revealed, which was followed by disbelief from all the men. He later told Miranda.\n\nHe also opened up about his changing role. \u201cIt\u2019s exhausting and exhilarating at the same time. I\u2019ve always been like the Energizer bunny. I can just keep going for days and days, but I realized there is a wall. I\u2019m tired, but I\u2019m ecstatic,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I just go to bed and wake up the next day excited because every actor is always looking for new challenges. What I love about playing Ben is that Ben\u2019s always looking for new challenges. He was an anesthesiologist, became a surgeon, and now he\u2019s a surgeon who\u2019s looking for new challenges. He applied to the firefighting academy.\u201d\n\nHow long has Jason George been on Grey\u2019s Anatomy?\n\nJason has appeared on the hit medical drama since its sixth season in 2010. He became a series regular during Season 12 of the ABC series.\n\nJoin our Facebook group for the latest news and updates on Grey\u2019s Anatomy!", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jason-george-leaving-greys-anatomy.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jason-george-leaving-greys-anatomy.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TITANIC_300x490_7_11r.gif?fit=300%2C490&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jason-george-greys-anatomy.jpg?fit=400%2C533&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C533"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/jason-george-leaving-greys-anatomy.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Faragalli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/jason-george-leaving-greys-anatomy-141654/", "title": "Jason George Is Leaving Grey's Anatomy to Join Show's Spin-Off", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Don't go, Dr. Ben Warren!
