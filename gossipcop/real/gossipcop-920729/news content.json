From her role on All My Children to her current position as a talk show host on Live! with Kelly and Ryan, she\u2019s been a boss. Therefore, the mother of three probably thought nothing of taking some pics during a family getaway.\n\nWhen Ripa\u2019s husband, Riverdale actor Mark Consuelos, posted a photo of his beautiful bikini-clad wife, the internet was immediately abuzz. Apparently, some haters were offended by a 47-year-old woman wearing a bikini, while others simply just had nasty things to say. Luckily Ripa and Consuelos are the queen and king of clapbacks.\n\nFrom the controversial bikini shot (page 5) to their family\u2019s antics on social media (page 7) and everything in between, here are all of the hilarious times they let trolls have it.\n\nTrolling the trolls\n\nWhile many celebritiess simply ignore any negative comments on their social media pages, Ripa delights in making her trolls feel uncomfortable. In fact, it\u2019s one of her favorite activities.\n\nIn an Instagram video, she revealed, \u201cI like trolling. I love trolling a troll. It is my favorite thing to do.\u201d\n\nNext: A swift comeback times two\n\nDon\u2019t come for her man\n\nRecently, Ripa shared a cute throwback photo of herself and Consuelos with the caption, \u201cThat other time we got fancy.\u201d Unfortunately, some poor troll was deeply offended by the photo and rudely responded by saying, \u201cToo bad he\u2019s short when he tries to look taller. It looks funny. Just be who you are.\u201d\n\nEver quick with the comeback, Ripa responded cheekily, \u201cHe\u2019s tall where it counts, babe.\u201d Meanwhile, Consuelos asked the important questions, \u201cPlease tell me how it is I can try to look taller? I\u2019m dying to know.\u201d\n\nNext: A lesson in spelling and grammar\n\nHey big head\n\nJust because you\u2019re a public figure, people think it\u2019s OK to say any rude thing to you. Luckily, Ripa won\u2019t let anyone walk over her. In an Instagram video captioned, \u201cKelly reads mean IG comments,\u201d an IG user said, \u201cHer head looks [sic]to big for her tiny body.\u201d\n\nPer usual, Ripa was quick to quip, \u201cto is spelled too FYI.\u201d Grammer and spelling are fundamental.\n\nNext: A quick history lesson\n\nBackground checks\n\nIt seems scary to be in the public eye, especially when people think they know who you are. In fact, one bold troll tried to claim that Ripa lies about her husband\u2019s heritage. The rude hater claimed that she \u201clies about her husband being Italian.\u201d\n\nRipa was having none of it. She quickly clapped back saying,\n\nOMG, please get help, you are making yourself look like a complete fool. Please stop shouting and do your research. A quick google search is all you need. @instasuelous father is from Mexico (Oaxaca) his mother is from Lago Majorie, Italy. Not that I feel the need to justify this to you, but since you called me a liar and I\u2019m bored I felt the need to straighten you out.\n\nNext: The bikini photo that broke the internet\n\nBikini drama\n\nStill, Consuelos and Ripa\u2019s most recent snappy reply to IG trolls has to be our favorite. Consuelos posted a stunning photo of his bikini-clad wife in crystal blue waters with the caption \u201cSultry Sundays with the sexy one are my fave\u2026\u201d\n\nThe innocent photo sent haters into a tizzy, and many of them suggested that at her age, Ripa shouldn\u2019t be caught dead in a bikini. Consuelos wasn\u2019t having it. In a lengthy response, he said,\n\nI wanted to take a couple of days to weigh in. Probably should\u2019ve earlier arguably. But I wanted to be above it. Well, not I\u2019m not. I posted this pic of the women I most admire As a playful tribute to my wife who I\u2019m proud of in endless ways. She works extremely hard in her professional life and her commitment to exercise, a healthy diet is admirable and the benefits show. Yes, she\u2019s wearing a bikini at age 47 and will no doubt wear one for many years to come. If that offends you in some way, if it triggers you, or some other psychosis you\u2019re suffering from, I suggest you get over it and get used to it. To all the males that had something negative to say. I suggest you bring it up with me if ever I\u2019m lucky enough to run into you. I\u2019m going to get back to my vacation now.. thanks for allowing me to express myself. I love you @kellyripa\u2026 keep killing it.\n\nBloop.\n\nNext: The slyest response\n\nShowing them better than she can tell them\n\nRipa also dragged her bikini haters across the internet, and she did it all without saying anything at all. Instead of a witty remark, Ripa posted her workout routine on IG. In the video, Ripa is wearing workout gear and running as fast as she can while her husband holds a resistance band around her waist.\n\nIn a brilliant and hilarious clap back, Ripa suggested that instead of sitting around hating people ought to get healthy and active.\n\nNext: Passing it on to the next generation\n\nKeeping it in the family\n\nIt looks like Ripa and Consuelos aren\u2019t the only clapback masters in their family. Their teenage daughter, Lola, also knows a thing or two about a snarky remark. Ripa posted a photo of Consuelos in a scene from Riverdale with the caption, \u201cWhere\u2019s the beef? #daddy knows. Find out tonight on all new #Riverdale on the CW 8 EST.\u201d\n\nLola was probably horrified by the suggestive caption and quickly replied on her mother\u2019s page, \u201cStop posting Riverdale photos, we get it.\u201d Ripa quickly quipped back, \u201cImma block you in a minute.\u201d\n\nBasically just don\u2019t come for the Ripa/Consuelos clan.\n\nFollow Aramide on Twitter @midnightrami.\n\nCheck out The Cheat Sheet on Facebook!", "images": ["https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos-family.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kelly-Ripa-on-the-beach.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kelly-ripa-phone.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/twitter_icon.png", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73816c7sp-TNg.gif", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/Kelly-Ripa-working-out-in-a-gym.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kelly-ripa-mark-consuelos.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=27134408&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/showbiz_2x.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/f_logo_RGB-Blue_58.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/kelly-ripa-and-mark-consuelos.jpg", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kelly-ripa-phone.jpg?w=1200", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/youtube.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/remoter/images/instagram.png", "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kelly-ripa.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kelly-ripa-phone.jpg?w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aramide Tinubu"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/all-of-the-hilarious-clapbacks-kelly-ripa-had-for-her-bikini-photo-haters.html/", "title": "Every Hilarious Clapback Kelly Ripa Has Had For Her Haters", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Kelly Ripa is a master of shutting down her haters on social media.
