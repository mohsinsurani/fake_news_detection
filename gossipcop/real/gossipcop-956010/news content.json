Getty Images\n\n\"I don\u2019t know anything about her personally,\u201d Urban revealed, but said he'd tell Lovato, \u201cJust (to have) good people around her and a willingness to want to live a different way if that\u2019s what she wants to do. It\u2019s all up to her.\u201d\n\nUrban, who checked into rehab for substance abuse in 2006, opened up about his addiction struggle in a 2016 Rolling Stone interview, revealing he once considered suicide.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t seem able to stop. There was no stopping this time. I\u2019d go to sleep, wake up a couple hours later, go at it again, drinking to take the edge off. I remember thinking, \u2018I\u2019m probably not going to make it until tomorrow,\u2019\u201d he recalled, adding, \u201cAnd then I thought, \u2018F--k it, I don\u2019t care. It\u2019ll be a relief to not have to. I\u2019ll take an Ambien and at some point I\u2019ll pass.\u201d\n\nThe singer and dad \u2014 Urban has two daughters, Sunday, 10, and Faith, 7, with wife Nicole Kidman \u2014 said it used to pain him that drugs and alcohol had \"sucked up so much creative time,\" which he could have devoted to music.\n\nBut now he wonders if those dark days helped make him the man he is today.\n\n\"I don\u2019t know what came from that time, other than that I\u2019m where I am,\" said the star. \"Because of, or in spite of, nobody knows and never will.\"\n\nLovato, who's also been candid about her battle with drug and alcohol addiction, was rushed from her home to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles last Tuesday following a suspected drug overdose. Sources revealed to NBC News that the Grammy-nominated singer was immediately given Narcan to reverse the effects of the overdose.\n\nA rep for Lovato revealed last Wednesday that the singer was \"awake and with her family.\"", "images":
