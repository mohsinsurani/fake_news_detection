In fact, according to an eyewitness, they even had a family outing after the sporting events at Menchie\u2019s in Calabasas.\n\n\"Kendra and Hank took the kids to Menchie\u2019s in Calabasas on Sunday afternoon. They were with Hank\u2019s parents and the kids seemed excited and happy go lucky. They stopped to throw pennies in to the fountain and make wishes. Kendra seemed a little bit somber and had her head down. But she was chatting with Hank and smiling when the kids talked to her. When it was time to go, Kendra and Hank discussed their plans for a minute and then said goodbye casually. Kendra took the kids and Hank left with his parents,\" a source told E! News about the family\u2019s outing.\n\nKendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett\u2019s relationship has definitely been put to the test over the years. Once again they find themselves in unchartered territory as they learn to co-parent amidst their divorce.
