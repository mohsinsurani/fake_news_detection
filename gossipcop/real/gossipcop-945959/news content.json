{"url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/daria-reboot", "text": "Today on Sick, Sad World: \u201cHollywood has run out of new ideas.\u201d That\u2019s one way of saying that Daria, the beloved MTV cartoon that ran from 1997 to 2002, is being rebooted.\n\nMTV network president Chris McCarthy confirmed the news, revealing that iconoclast Doria Morgendorffer will be reappearing in a new spinoff show dubbed Daria & Jodie, which costars one of the few other reasonable and intelligent people at Lawndale High School, Jodie Landon. At least one thing that will be different from the original is the fact that Grace Edwards, who\u2019s served as a story editor on Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt and a writers assistant for Broad City and Inside Amy Schumer, will be leading the production.\n\n\u201cThe story [Edwards] wants to tell of Daria is different, it\u2019s about Daria and Jodie and two close friends taking on the world today and what\u2019s happening in our culture at large,\u201d McCarthy told The Hollywood Reporter, adding that \u201cEdwards is a huge fan of Daria\u2026. What made Daria pop for us is because we love the franchise and Grace Edwards has a point of view and angle she wants to tell.\u201d McCarthy also addressed Daria\u2019s skeptical disciples, many of whom are no doubt rolling their eyes at this very moment.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s less about the monetization and more about telling great stories,\u201d he said. \u201cOf course, we\u2019re going to make money, but it\u2019s about taking this IP and bringing it into the future and doing these shows on platforms where audiences make the most sense.\u201d Interestingly, that most likely will not be on the show\u2019s original home network, MTV.\n\nInstead, McCarthy says the new Daria could land on a streaming service\u2014like Queer Eye or Arrested Development: Fateful Consequences. \u201cThe best place for it isn\u2019t necessarily cable but more with an SVOD partner where we can have better storytelling and allow more flexibility and be able to go deeper than traditional cable may allow,\u201d he said.\n\nOne thing that will remain the same is that Daria & Jodie will still be told through Morgendorrfer\u2019s perspective, as well as Landon\u2019s, \u201cwhile deconstructing popular culture, social classes, gender, and race,\u201d as The Hollywood Reporter notes.\n\nWhile the idea of anyone touching the perfect show is cause for shuddering, this Daria fan can\u2019t help but think that there is a mine of modern-day material that Daria would have the perfect quips for. Not to mention that since the show aired, it\u2019s become harder and harder to separate real-life from an episode of Sick, Sad World.\n\nRelated: Daria Turns 20: A Fall 2017 Style Update For Your Favorite Misanthropic Cartoon", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/03/03/58b9ff1275b3e14ae8673e9a_daria-copy.png?w=414&h=181&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/6/764827f4-df1b-4787-84b7-37c43c4e6a6f-3cd82bb3-acc7-49da-bffb-7f7faa24f636-theidolhero.webp?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.7573&fp-y=0.6398", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/03/03/58b9ff1275b3e14ae8673e9a_daria-copy.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/5/5231dd56-93b4-439a-84d5-464b5353756d-image001-8.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4107&fp-y=0.2996"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/03/03/58b9ff1275b3e14ae8673e9a_daria-copy.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/daria-reboot", "title": "Daria Is Being Rebooted With a Few Big Twists", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marissagmuller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/daria-reboot", "type": "article", "title": "Daria Is Being Rebooted With a Few Big Twists", "description": "Never mind that we basically all live in \"Sick, Sad World\" now.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/03/03/58b9ff1275b3e14ae8673e9a_daria-copy.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "Never mind that we basically all live in \"Sick, Sad World\" now."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
