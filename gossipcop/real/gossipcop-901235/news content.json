Only a month before the film was released, director Ridley Scott replaced Kevin Spacey, after multiple allegations of sexual misconduct made against the actor, with Christopher Plummer.\n\nBoth Plummer and Williams ultimately earned Golden Globe nominations for their roles in the film, which is based on the true story of the kidnapping of J. Paul Getty III, the grandson of the wealthy oil tycoon J. Paul Getty, and was released on time after all. Here, Williams talks about the reshoot, the surprising reason she was so excited to work with Plummer, and more.\n\nTell me about your new film, All the Money in the World. What is your character like?\n\nI play Gail Getty, who was a mother of four children, one of whom was kidnapped when they were living in Rome and there was a ransom price set on his head, which would\u2019ve been easy to come up with, given that his grandfather was John Paul Getty, but the man said no. And so I play a woman fighting to get her child back.\n\nAnd this is based on a true story.\n\nSadly, yes.\n\nDid you do a lot of research?\n\nI did, although there wasn\u2019t that much available material. There\u2019s a few clips on YouTube of her, and she has a very distinctive way of speaking that I spent a lot of time with and then I read a few books. The rest of it was really just a collaboration between the words on the page and the guy in charge, Ridley \u201cThe Boss\u201d Scott. He and I had a ball together. It was actually like having a ball that he and I would just toss back and forth and sometimes the ball was slippery and sometimes the ball would go over my head \u2013 there would be multiples of them. He just keeps you on your toes in this really fun way. I really went to work every day thinking, \u201cI don\u2019t know? What\u2019s he gonna do today?\u201d It was exciting.\n\nHow did you first read the script?\n\nI was sent the script and told to read it within the next 12 hours and have an answer by the time I woke up in the morning, so I read it and I said yes and now here I am.\n\nAnd then you have the reshoots, too.\n\nIf it was anyone else other than Ridley I would say there\u2019s no way, and it\u2019s not going to happen, but that man lives off of excitement and he works well under pressure. Look, there\u2019s no mountain I wouldn\u2019t climb for Ridley. I [gave] him my Thanksgiving day, which was a hard thing to break to the family but when you\u2019re able to tell your daughter that Captain Von Trapp is coming to save the day in real life you know they \u2013 everybody makes an exception.\n\nI have to say, I think this is such an optimistic time. It\u2019s been so difficult to go through, ever since the election, especially to be a woman and to be raising a young woman, but I actually something has just turned around for me in like the past couple of weeks and I feel like I\u2019m so glad to be alive right now. I feel like we\u2019re going to create a whole new landscape for a generation of young girls like my daughter that are growing up right now.\n\nLet\u2019s hope.\n\nI really hope.\n\nWhat is that like for you to have to go back and do a character that you said goodbye to? Because you say goodbye to these characters, right?\n\nIn some way I suppose you do, but in some way I feel all of my girls, all of my women, still sort of bubbling up inside of me. Sometimes I feel them and I\u2019ll think like, \u201cOh god, Marilyn came out a little bit then,\u201d and I\u2019m like, \u201cThere she is. There\u2019s Gail still kicking around inside of me.\u201d\n\nGal Gadot, Emma Stone, Margot Robbie, and More Are the Best Performances of the Year Jennifer Lawrence wears Dior dress; Dior Fine Jewelry earrings, and ring.

Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cThis year on Halloween, my daughter and I went trick-or-treating, and I had on this huge mask so I could see everyone but they couldn\u2019t see me. Whenever I saw a Wonder Woman costume on a girl or a boy, it was so exciting. My daughter, who was dressed as a unicorn zombie, would run up to me and say, \u201cDid you see that Wonder Woman?\u201d They were everywhere!\u201d Gal Gadot wears Moschino Couture dress; Faberg\u00e9 ring; Off-White c/o Jimmy Choo shoes. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201c[Jennifer Lawrence] came to see Cabaret and both of my contacts popped out of my eyes at the same time and my prescription is -900, which, if you know what that means, is like\u2026I cannot see. So, they had to drag me off the stage in the dark and she came backstage afterwards and I was like, \u2018I couldn\u2019t see anything! It was garbage! It was a disaster!\u2019 And she was like, \u2018Enough, enough. I\u2019m your dance mom. You need to calm down.\u2019\u201d Emma Stone wears a Louis Vuitton dress; Cartier earrings. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI am Vietnamese, and we don\u2019t celebrate birthdays. My parents don\u2019t actually know their birth dates\u2014they just go by their signs. When somebody asks you how old you are, you say, \u2018I\u2019m born this month in the Year of the\u2026\u2019 I was born in the Year of the Sheep. Sheep don\u2019t like to be the center of attention, and they don\u2019t like being told what to do. That pretty much sums me up.\u201d Hong Chau wears an Etro dress; Chanel Fine Jewelry earrings; Tiffany & Co. ring. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI\u2019ve had a flirtation with Winston Churchill for years; there\u2019s been a book of famous Churchill quotes on my bookshelf since childhood. To me, he was the man who won the war. And yet, when I was first asked to play the part, I thought, Don\u2019t be ridiculous, and turned it down. But they came back, and it felt right. My wife said, \u2018Look, you get to stand in Parliament and say these great words. What have you got to lose?\u2019\u201d Gary Oldman wears a Canali suit; Boss shirt and tie. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI always joke that Jason Dixon, the character I play in Three Billboards, is Barney Fife meets Travis Bickle. I spent a lot of time trying to perfect his southern Missouri accent. I did ride-alongs with a cop down there\u2014he had a great twang. Accents should be practiced as if you\u2019re drunk. Actors get a little tense when they have to do an accent. Drunkenness relaxes everything.\u201d Sam Rockwell wears a Marni trench; Editions M.R shirt; Simon Miller T-shirt; Huntsman pants; Rolex watch; Church\u2019s shoes. \u201cMy character in The Meyerowitz Stories is a sweet family girl, but when she sends films she makes in school to her family, you see her wild side. I\u2019m naked in most of those films. I sat next to my dad at the premiere, and that was probably the most uncomfortable thing in my life. To see myself 75 feet tall and naked was not easy. I sank into my chair and heard my dad kind of laugh nervously. We pretended those scenes never happened.\u201d Grace Van Patten wears an Alberta Ferretti dress; her own jewelry. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cBeing an actress, for me, is about my own transition. It\u2019s about looking for answers. It\u2019s about trying to survive in my life and also for the lives of others who face similar challenges. Life is scary, but art is not scary.\u201d Daniela Vega wears a Max Mara dress; David Webb earrings; Piaget necklace; Chanel Fine Jewelry ring (right hand); Tiffany & Co. bracelet and ring (left hand); Gianvito Rossi shoes. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cMy husband is an artist, but he still has a hard time watching me sometimes. During The Killing of a Sacred Deer at the Cannes Film Festival, he was both hypnotized and shattered. When he hears me scream or cry from a certain place in my soul, it\u2019s almost like it goes straight into him. His brain and heart don\u2019t discern between acting and real life.\u201d Nicole Kidman wears a Prada top and skirt; Chanel Fine Jewelry ring; Jimmy Choo pumps. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful Where was your first kiss? This is going to sound like a murder story, but it was in the woods, outside of a baseball park. I had lost my turtle. Curtis, the guy I kissed, found it. Was that your first pet? No, it was a schnauzer named Ozzie. He hated us so much. He never wanted to be in the same room with us. So what\u2019s your porno name\u2014first pet plus first street name? Ozzie Ormond. What was your favorite Halloween costume? A picnic table. My mom wouldn\u2019t let me be a witch or a ghost or anything demonic, so I cut a hole in a plastic cloth and went as a picnic table. The problem was I had a crush on this guy named John, and I was so pumped for Halloween because it was our chance to interact. And then I put my face in the tablecloth and was like, \u201cHi, John. Are you my boyfriend?\u201d Jennifer Lawrence wears a Dior dress; Dior Fine Jewelry earrings and ring. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cWhen I first read the script for Get Out, I thought, Are you allowed to do this? Are they really going to let this black guy kill all these white people? I think the most fascinating art pieces come at a price to the person making them. And this movie took a risk. On opening night, I went to see it in a theater in the hood in Atlanta. The crowd clapped, they cheered, they yelled, \u2018Get out, man! Yo\u2014get out!\u2019 It was all the stuff that we hoped the audience would say.\u201d Daniel Kaluuya wears a Gosha Rubchinskiy x Adidas Football sweatshirt and sweatpants; \u201947 hat; Gucci socks; Kaluuya\u2019s own sneakers. \u201cI booked The Florida Project when I was 6. I\u2019m 7 now. It was really fun because during shooting I got to eat ice cream! I want to start my own YouTube channel, and the name of it will be I Am Crazy for Ice Cream because I am crazy for ice cream. I\u2019m also so into fashion. I wear shorts in the movie, and they were so short. It was a struggle getting them on. Now, I\u2019m like, \u2018Mom! Where are my skirts? No more shorts!\u2019\u201d Brooklynn Prince wears a Baby Dior dress; La Coqueta shoes. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI\u2019m naked quite a lot in Beach Rats, and it\u2019s a little strange to act when you\u2019re naked. When the boom operator is standing over you, and you\u2019re not wearing anything, it\u2019s awkward. But, in the end, I didn\u2019t find it difficult. I\u2019m pretty comfortable with my body. Not in an \u2018I\u2019m happy to flaunt it for \u00a35\u2019 kind of way, but it does go deep into the psychology of someone trying to figure out their own sexuality, and their identity.\u201d Harris Dickinson wears a Calvin Klein 205W39NYC shirt, pants, and boots. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cAs an actor, people put you in categories. It\u2019s \u2018Oh, she has an accent,\u2019 or \u2018She doesn\u2019t have an accent,\u2019 or \u2018She can do this accent,\u2019 or \u2018No, she can\u2019t.\u2019 They\u2019ll say, \u2018She\u2019s a pretty blonde, so I don\u2019t know if we can see her in a comedy.\u2019 So I know that for Fatih Akin to pick me was a big risk because he\u2019s very well known in Germany as a director who casts unknowns or people he discovers who are not actors at all. In the beginning, he got a lot of backlash for it. And, in truth, I don\u2019t think I could have played this character five years ago. Now I\u2019m ready to shed any beauty look. I want to be stripped of any pretense, of any glamour.\u201d Diane Kruger wears a Rosamosario romper; Christian Louboutin shoes. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cWhen I was 14, I auditioned for an Off Broadway play. The scene was about a bris, the Jewish tradition of a child having the tip of his penis snipped off. Being the nice Jewish kid that I was, I did not know what a bris was, and I decided to pronounce it brie. Bris as brie. So I did the monologue, and, at the end, the director said, \u2018Thank you very much, and it\u2019s pronounced bris.\u2019 I did not get the part.\u201d Ben Stiller wears a Gucci coat; Olatz pajamas. Photograph by Juergen Teller; styled by Edward Enninful \u201cWhen I was 6, my favorite film was Robin Hood: Men in Tights. It\u2019s got a lot of adult jokes, and it was really inappropriate for a child to see. In school, they asked us, \u2018If you were to make a potion, what would you put in it?\u2019 Even then, I could recall lines of movies, and I said, \u2018The testicles of a newt!\u2019 I got called up to the front of the class and was asked why I put testicles in my potion. I had no idea what testicles were\u2014I just loved the film.\u201d Margot Robbie wears a Dolce & Gabbana top, shorts, and shoes. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI was late to the game on The Room, which is considered by many to be the worst movie of all time. For years, I would see this billboard in L.A. that Tommy Wiseau, the actor and star of the movie, had paid to have up on Highland Avenue. It was a picture of him, sort of glaring down at you, with the words THE ROOM and a phone number. I was like, \u2018What is this? Do you call the number and this crazy, weird, vampirelike guy can be in your movie?\u2019 But then I started reading The Disaster Artist, which was written by one of the other actors in the movie, and before I was halfway through, I just knew it was such an incredible, bizarre story, unlike any other in Hollywood, about outsider artists trying to achieve their dreams. I was instantly drawn to Tommy. It\u2019s almost like we were made for each other.\u201d James Franco wears a Balenciaga shirt; his own pants. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cTo play Molly Bloom, I thought about what women have to become in order to find power in a society where men are making all of the rules. I was like, \u2018Oh, my gosh\u2014the Kardashians are an incredible example of women who have their own sense of entrepreneurial power.\u2019 And in real life, Molly looked a lot like them. For research, I actually watched Kim\u2019s tutorial on face shading and contouring. As the movie goes on, Molly transforms into this idea of what a woman has to be in order to be heard: The heels get higher, the necklines are lower, the hair is longer. It was quite a departure for me, physically. And the strange thing is, I don\u2019t look like myself at all in this film, and so many people have said to me that I\u2019ve never looked better.\u201d Jessica Chastain wears an Oscar de la Renta dress; Sophie Buhai earrings. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cUntil I read the script for Lady Bird, I had never encountered a female heroine who very much sees herself as a female heroine. In films, you rarely see young girls who love themselves. Lady Bird takes the self-confidence thing to a new level. She knows she\u2019s going to be someone. And she has something to say, even if she doesn\u2019t quite know what it is yet.\u201d Saoirse Ronan wears a Chanel dress. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful Did you have an audition outfit back when you were starting out? I had multiple outfits. Much like a costume box. I would change between auditions. I remember changing in the car on the freeway. I\u2019m still a fast changer. And discreet. I have a talent for taking my clothes off quickly. What was your first favorite film? The Sound of Music. It was very influential. And I got to meet Captain von Trapp while filming All the Money in the World [Christopher Plummer replaced Kevin Spacey after Spacey was pulled from the project]. We were about to be in this movie together, and I thought, How soon is too soon to ask Christopher Plummer to sing \u201cEdelweiss\u201d into my phone for my daughter? Michelle Williams wears a Louis Vuitton dress. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI play real people a lot. And it is a huge responsibility. Anytime you are playing somebody who was alive, for good or for bad, that performance becomes a version of an official record of what happened: what motivated them, what obstacles they faced, and how they got through their particular struggle. There\u2019s a degree of leeway that you can allow yourself as long as you\u2019re not turning good guys into bad guys, or knowledge into ignorance. Having said that, it\u2019s a little easier playing someone who\u2019s no longer living. Because then you don\u2019t have to meet them.\u201d Tom Hanks wears a Tom Ford suit, vest, and shoes; Boss shirt; Rolex watch. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI had a successful soap opera career in Mexico, but I left my fame and my comfort and I moved to Los Angeles because I wanted to make films. I was very, very famous in Mexico, and in the States I was working as an extra. People thought maybe I was running from the police. Why else would I leave everything I had to play a maid? I told them, \u2018This industry is going to change. We are too strong of an economic force to be ignored forever.\u2019\u201d Salma Hayek wears a Saint Laurent by Anthony Vaccarello dress; Cartier earrings. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful \u201cI was loosely attached to Call Me by Your Name for four years. It never seemed like it was coming together, and then it did. Now I\u2019ve spent nearly two years promoting it. So, in many ways, it will be the project of my youth. When I\u2019m older, I\u2019ll look at this film and remember what it was like to not be jaded, old, and washed up. I\u2019ll look back and say, \u2018Oh, when I was young\u2026\u2019\u201d Timoth\u00e9e Chalamet wears a Sandro jacket and pants; Schiesser tank top; Sermoneta Gloves gloves; Calvin Klein 205W39NYC boots. \u201cMy first kiss was at a party, when I was 12 or 13, during my first term at a coed school, so, you know, hormones were raging. A girl named Dora had this party when her parents were out of town, and it was literally a bacchanalia for 13-year-olds. No one was having sex, but it was just like, \u2018Oh, we all get to kiss each other.\u2019 And there were around 200 people there. It was about five hours of everyone going, \u2018Have we made out yet? No? Let\u2019s go!\u2019 To this day, my friends and I will be in a pub or at dinner and say, \u2018Remember Dora\u2019s party?\u2019 and sigh. It was an awakening.\u201d Andrew Garfield wears a Shrimps coat; Michael Kors sweater; Sunspel sweatpants. Photographs by Juergen Teller; Styled by Edward Enninful INFO 1/30\n\nDid you like auditioning when you were starting out as an actress?\n\nMan, what a nightmare. That was so rough. It was you know demoralizing. You see the same group of girls and you just feel like talk about a pack, you just travel around in this pack and it seems like nobody ever gets to break out of the pack. I auditioned for two years without getting a part. I was young, too, so at that point that was like a fifth of my life had been spent experiencing rejection, so I think that was hard to tolerate as a kid.\n\nDid you have an audition outfit?\n\nI had multiple outfits much like the costume box. I would change in between auditions. I remember changing in the car on the freeway and I\u2019m still a very fast changer and I\u2019m a discreet changer because of it. I have a talent for taking my clothes of quickly.\n\nWhat was the moment you knew you made it?\n\nI feel like I\u2019m still waiting for it. I feel like I\u2019m still waiting for the moment of you\u2019ll always have work and you\u2019ll always have a community and this whole thing isn\u2019t about to be sort of pulled out from underneath you. It\u2019s a funny thing to have a career or profession where, as you age, you aren\u2019t really necessarily allowed to harness all of that growth and all of that knowledge, like you\u2019re starting to understand what you do while at the same time your ability to do what you do is diminishing, so it\u2019s a very funny. It\u2019s hard to have a sense of security in a job like that.\n\nWhat was your first job?\n\nI served soft serve at the fair. I gave everybody bigger cones than should\u2019ve been allowed. I thought that it would make them happy but instead they were like, \u201cWhat is this? Like I can\u2019t even hold this unwieldy thing.\u201d It turns out people don\u2019t want like a ton of ice cream.\n\nWhat was the first movie that you loved?\n\nMy parents were really conservative and we weren\u2019t allowed to watch very much, so The Sound of Music is the movie that I\u2019ve probably seen the most in my life, because it was just about the only thing that my parents condoned that I also wanted to watch, so that was probably the most influential film that I watched growing up, and now I\u2019m going to meet Captain Von Trapp.\n\nDo you have a favorite song from The Sound of Music?\n\nMaybe \u201cEdelweiss.\u201d It\u2019s so sad at the end when they sing it like that gets it really gets to the heart of it. Now that we\u2019re gonna be in this movie together, I said to a friend of mine, \u201cHow soon is too soon to ask Christopher Plummer to sing \u2018Edelweiss\u2019 into my phone for my daughter?\u201d and my friend said, \u201cWell. maybe you should take him out to dinner first,\u201d and as soon as I told [my daughter] Matilda what was happening she said, \u201cCan you get him to? Can we sing with him? I need to meet him immediately and will he sing with us.\u201d\n\nWatch: Michelle Williams Could Sleep Under a Banner of Barbra Streisand\u2019s Face", "images":
