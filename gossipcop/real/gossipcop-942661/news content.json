It\u2019s been a wild year but we\u2019re here & life is good! So proud of you dropping back to back albums & fulfilling your dreams,\u201d she wrote. \u201cYou inspire me to make the impossible always become a reality. Love you.\u201d\n\nAlong with the sweet words, the star shared a black and white photo of West with their youngest daughter, Chicago, 4\u00bd months.\n\nKardashian West\u2019s mom Kris Jenner also shared a sweet post for her son-in-law.\n\n\u201cHappy birthday to my son Kanye!!\u201d she wrote. \u201cThank you for being a constant inspiration, for being the most wonderful father, friend, husband and son. I am so blessed to have you in my life. #HappyBirthdayKanye #proudmama #love.\u201d\n\nWest\u2019s birthday comes on the heels of a challenging time for the couple, who also share daughter North, 4\u00bd, and son Saint, 2. Earlier this year, the artist reemerged into the spotlight to dominate the news cycle with Twitter sprees, explosive interviews and a controversial alliance with President Donald Trump. He also revealed that he suffered from an opioid addiction after becoming dependent on the pain medications following a liposuction procedure in 2016.\n\nSources told PEOPLE that Kardashian West does her best to support her husband when he stirs up controversy \u2014 even though it can be challenging.\n\n\u201cDoes Kim agree with everything Kanye does and says? No, absolutely not,\u201d said one source recently. \u201cBut does she stand by him? Always. They always have each other\u2019s backs and will always go to bat for one another.\u201d\n\nAnother source told PEOPLE that the reality star is especially supportive of West because they have a family together.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very forgiving towards him, especially since he is the father of her children,\u201d the source said. \u201cHe\u2019s been through low points before and she knows people make mistakes.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kanye West Reveals He Was Diagnosed with a \u2018Mental Condition\u2019 at Age 39: \u2018It\u2019s a Superpower\u2019\n\nEarlier this week, the Keeping Up with the Kardashians star revealed what she has in store to celebrate West\u2019s big day.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m planning a dinner for him at our house,\u201d she told E! News at the CFDA Fashion Awards in New York City on Monday, where she was honored with the Influencer Award.\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty\n\nWatch the full season of Search History on PeopleTV.com or download the PeopleTV app on your favorite device.\n\nThe mom of three clarified that it would be \u201can intimate little dinner with friends,\u201d which would certainly be a departure from how the couple typically celebrates their birthdays.\n\nLast year, she surprised West with a trip to Japan after spending a few days as a family in the Bahamas.\n\nAlong with celebrating his birthday, West has been busy with the recent release of his new album Ye, which has already garnered over 100 million streams worldwide, while reaching #1 album on iTunes, Spotify and Apple Music in multiple countries.\n\nJust ahead of his birthday, West hosted another listening party in Los Angeles, this time with fellow rapper Kid Cudi for their joint project Kids See Ghosts.", "images":
