It\u2019s literally exactly what it sounds like: a shirt that is long enough to be considered a dress. A typical shirtdress looks like a long button-down shirt, and you can either buy them that way or get creative and make your own out of an over-sized shirt.\n\nShirtdresses are casual and easy to wear, making them perfect for the warmer days of spring and summer. They\u2019re versatile and can be easily dressed up or down, they have a very street-chic vibe going on, and there\u2019s also something really sexy about them \u2013 they kind of look like you just rolled out of bed and forgot pants. IDK guys. That\u2019s what they remind me of sometimes!\n\nIn all seriousness, a shirtdress, when styled right, looks very chic and cool and totally Pinterest-worthy. If you haven\u2019t invested in a good one yet, I recommend you do so now \u2013 or, like I said, create your own with an over-sized shirt. Here are 20 style tips on how to wear a shirtdress to get you inspired:\n\n1. Keep it simple with a denim shirtdress, a cute hat, and fun sneakers.\n\nSource\n\n2. Add a leather jacket to toughen up the look of a chambray dress.\n\nSource\n\n3. Keep things casual with a pair of slip-on sneakers.\n\nSource\n\n4. On chillier days, add sheer tights and combat boots.\n\nSource\n\n5. Not into showing off your legs? Wear a shorter shirtdress over skinny jeans. Add heels to keep the look streamlined.\n\nSource\n\n6. Don\u2019t be afraid to mix prints. This patterned jacket looks cool with the striped dress because of the similar colors.\n\nSource\n\n7. Use a scarf instead of a belt to nip the shirtdress in at the waist.\n\nSource\n\n8. Or use a regular belt to show off your waist. Birkenstocks give the outfit a \u201990s vibe.\n\nSource\n\n9. Add fun accessories like a pretty scarf, a straw hat, and a patterned bag.\n\nSource\n\n10. Keep a striped shirtdress casual with sneakers and a denim jacket.\n\nSource\n\n11. On cooler days, layer a sweater over your shirtdress to almost make it look like a skirt.\n\nSource\n\n12. Wear your shirtdress with low-heeled ankle boots for a touch of chic glamour.\n\nSource\n\n13. Make good use of a crop top by wearing it over your shirtdress.\n\nSource\n\n14. Layer an open-button down shirt over your shirtdress and add lots of necklaces.\n\nSource\n\n15. If you\u2019re not into bare legs, wear your shirtdress over a pair of leggings.\n\nSource\n\n16. Sometimes all you need are a pair of strappy sandals and a simple belt to look chic and glamourous.\n\nSource\n\n17. Gladiator sandals look cool and unexpected with an oversize shirtdress.\n\nSource\n\n18. A chambray shirtdress looks classicly cool with a pair of platform sandals.\n\nSource\n\n19. Feeling daring? Wear a mini skirt over your shirtdress.\n\nSource\n\n20. Layer with a blazer, and keep it from being too professional by adding flats and a cute hat.\n\nSource\n\nWhich of these outfit ideas is your favorite? How do you wear a shirtdress?
