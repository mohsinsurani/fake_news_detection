Birds would change flight patterns, dogs would howl at shadows, your cat would actually be nice to you. It\u2019s a wild time. Of course, we all know that your celebrity faves don\u2019t need any excuse to wild out online. From social media fails to hilarious Insta-stories, there\u2019s never been a better week to ask, \u201cUh\u2026 what are you doing?\u201d\n\nWhat are you doing, Drake?\n\nDrake\u2019s Insta is always a treasure trove of visual non sequiturs and random shots, and this image is no exception. It\u2019s almost unremarkable to see Champagne Papi looking sort of glum in an awkward posed candid. But what makes this pic WYD-worthy is his footwear. Of course Drake is rocking a pair of Rihanna\u2019s brand new Stance socks.\n\nThis is so on-brand for Drake. You just know he was the very first person to rock RiRi\u2019s new gear. Drake is the ultimate super loyal friend. This doesn\u2019t do much to quell the whole \u201cDrake is hopelessly in love with Rihanna\u201d narrative. But who cares? Wearing your bestie\u2019s face on your feet is a deeper level of commitment and Drake is totally up it.\n\nWYD, Sarah Jessica Parker?\n\nNo celeb had a more extreme reaction to the solar eclipse than SJP, who posted a series of videos from her watch party aboard a boat. The \u201cSex and the City\u201d star completely freaked out at the sight of the moon covering the sun. This is like \u201cThe Blair Witch Project\u201d but with very famous people and no death. SJP has, apparently, never seen anything more amazing in her entire life. Can we all agree to react to nature with this same level of wild enthusiasm from now on? Even if there isn\u2019t an eclipse happening. Just go outside, look at a cloud and start screaming. It\u2019ll significantly improve your life.\n\nWhat are you doing, Mariah Carey?\n\nListen, the answer to the question \u201cWhat is Mariah Carey doing?\u201d is always \u201cThe most.\u201d This is no exception. Celebrating her new Las Vegas-themed Paper magazine cover, the Elusive Chanteuse is giving us Very Rich Showgirl Realness. Mimi looks amazing but this ensemble looks so heavy. Getting dressed shouldn\u2019t be a workout. She\u2019s wearing so little and yet so much. What is this and why do we love it so much?\n\nBilly Eichner (and Sarah Paulson)! WYD?!\n\nFirst of all, this is definitely not a fail. This is the winningest win. Billy plus Sarah in a Vegas nightclub after a Cher concert is the definition of goals. On one hand, this is definitely a Stars are Just Like Us post\u2014who among us hasn\u2019t posted a dancing in the club pic? On the other hand, who among us has friends as fabulous as Sarah Paulson? We need to ask Billy Eichner some very serious questions, starting with \u201cWhat are you doing right and how can we be more like you?\u201d", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Rachel-Aven-The-Bachelorette.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drake-billboard-music-awards-2017.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/queen-elizabeth-ii-1.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/jeffrey-dahmer.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=146467699155455&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/r-eric-thomas.png?resize=%2C", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/king-charles-prince-harry-meghan-markle.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Jeffrey-Dahmer-2.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/drake-billboard-music-awards-2017.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["R.
