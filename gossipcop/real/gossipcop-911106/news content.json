During Wednesday\u2019s launch event, several representatives for the clothing brand were asked if there was an official statement regarding Upton\u2019s allegations on behalf of anyone for Guess or Marciano himself, but none was provided.\n\nThe party was attended by a starry crowd, from Paris Hilton to real estate developer Mohamed Hadid, whose daughter Gigi Hadid has been participating in Guess campaigns for years.\n\nAsked about the #MeToo movement, Lopez said that she supports all women coming forward to tell their stories and called the moment \u201ca beautiful time for women.\u201d \u201cWe are really finding our voices,\u201d Lopez said. \u201cWe are really coming out of the shadows and saying how we feel. [It\u2019s about] knowing our worth and our value and making the opposite sex aware of our worth and our value.\u201d\n\nShe added that this is also the time for women all over to continue speaking up and being supported as a way to also empower young women. \u201cIt\u2019s a groundbreaking thing that\u2019s going on in the world right now, so I\u2019m super excited to be a part of this time. Of course, I always support women speaking up. I\u2019m super excited about the time we are living in right now \u2014 especially for my daughter.\u201d\n\nOn Thursday, Lopez released this statement addressing the Marciano accusations: \u201cMy position on these issues is well known, as I have been very vocal about them. I do not condone any acts of sexual harassment, violation, or misconduct. Any accusations should be fully and thoroughly investigated. I will continue to support our rights as women.\u201d\n\nAt the event, Marciano addressed his guests and spoke at length about asking Lopez to sign on to the campaign that will be seen around the world. It took him several months to finally reach Lopez in an attempt to ask her to consider becoming the face of Guess. \u201c[The campaign] will be seen in at least 45 countries,\u201d Marciano said, as his guests cheered him on. \u201cJennifer trusted me. She trusted me with the pictures \u2026 that I could do great pictures. The trust was there. It was destiny. It was not an accident. I want to make pictures that every single day you will go back to these pictures one day and show your children.\u201d\n\nAccording to Lopez\u2019s manager Benny Medina, who was also present at the Guess event, the star\u2019s next album is likely to be released in September.\n\nA version of this story first appeared in Billboard.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-912864978_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-912864978_copy_-_embed_2018.jpg?w=688", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-912864978_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-912864978_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Booth Moore Justino Aguila Billboard", "Booth Moore", "Justino Aguila Billboard"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/jennifer-lopez-addresses-sexual-harassment-accusations-leveled-at-guess-founder-paul-marciano-1081150/", "title": "Jennifer Lopez Addresses Sexual Harassment Accusations Leveled at Guess Co-Founder Paul Marciano", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The pop star appeared at an event to toast her new campaign for the fashion brand on Wednesday night, as Kate Upton was posting about Marciano on Instagram.", "news_keywords": "Jennifer Lopez, Style News", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Justino Aguila Billboard", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1081150, "title": "Jennifer Lopez Addresses Sexual Harassment Accusations Leveled at Guess Co-Founder Paul Marciano", "published_at": "2018-02-01 16:37:24", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/gettyimages-912864978_copy_-_h_2018.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Style News", "topics": "News", "body": "Jennifer Lopez walked into the Guess headquarters in downtown Los Angeles on Wednesday night looking radiant in a blue dress as she officially launched her new worldwide ad campaign with the iconic brand.\r\nThe timing for the artist, who was joined at the event by her boyfriend Alex Rodriguez, couldn't have been more awkward.\r\n\r\nIn an Instagram post just hours before, model Kate Upton had accused Guess creative director Paul Marciano of sexual and emotional harassment.
