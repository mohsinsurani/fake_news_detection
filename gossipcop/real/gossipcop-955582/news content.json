As the chairman and C.E.O. of CBS Corporation, he oversees shows ranging from \u201c60 Minutes\u201d to \u201cThe Big Bang Theory.\u201d His portfolio includes the premium cable channel Showtime, the publishing house Simon & Schuster, and a streaming service, CBS All Access. Moonves, who is sixty-eight, has a reputation for canny hiring and project selection. The Wall Street Journal recently called him a \u201cTV programming wizard\u201d; the Hollywood Reporter dubbed him a \u201cWall Street Hero.\u201d In the tumultuous field of network television, he has enjoyed rare longevity as a leader. Last year, according to filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, he earned nearly seventy million dollars, making him one of the highest-paid corporate executives in the world.\n\nIn recent months, Moonves has become a prominent voice in Hollywood\u2019s #MeToo movement. In December, he helped found the Commission on Eliminating Sexual Harassment and Advancing Equality in the Workplace, which is chaired by Anita Hill. \u201cIt\u2019s a watershed moment,\u201d Moonves said at a conference in November. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that a company\u2019s culture will not allow for this. And that\u2019s the thing that\u2019s far-reaching. There\u2019s a lot we\u2019re learning. There\u2019s a lot we didn\u2019t know.\u201d\n\nBut Moonves\u2019s private actions belie his public statements. Six women who had professional dealings with him told me that, between the nineteen-eighties and the late aughts, Moonves sexually harassed them. Four described forcible touching or kissing during business meetings, in what they said appeared to be a practiced routine. Two told me that Moonves physically intimidated them or threatened to derail their careers. All said that he became cold or hostile after they rejected his advances, and that they believed their careers suffered as a result. \u201cWhat happened to me was a sexual assault, and then I was fired for not participating,\u201d the actress and writer Illeana Douglas told me. All the women said they still feared that speaking out would lead to retaliation from Moonves, who is known in the industry for his ability to make or break careers. \u201cHe has gotten away with it for decades,\u201d the writer Janet Jones, who alleges that she had to shove Moonves off her after he forcibly kissed her at a work meeting, told me. \u201cAnd it\u2019s just not O.K.\u201d\n\nThirty current and former employees of CBS told me that such behavior extended from Moonves to important parts of the corporation, including CBS News and \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d one of the network\u2019s most esteemed programs. During Moonves\u2019s tenure, men at CBS News who were accused of sexual misconduct were promoted, even as the company paid settlements to women with complaints. It isn\u2019t clear whether Moonves himself knew of the allegations, but he has a reputation for being closely involved in management decisions across the network. Some of the allegations, such as those against the former anchor Charlie Rose, as reported by the Washington Post, have already become public. Other claims are being reported here for the first time. Nineteen current and former employees told me that Jeff Fager, the former chairman of CBS News and the current executive producer of \u201c60 Minutes,\u201d allowed harassment in the division. \u201cIt\u2019s top down, this culture of older men who have all this power and you are nothing,\u201d one veteran producer told me. \u201cThe company is shielding lots of bad behavior.\u201d\n\nIn a statement, Moonves said, \u201cThroughout my time at CBS, we have promoted a culture of respect and opportunity for all employees, and have consistently found success elevating women to top executive positions across our company. I recognize that there were times decades ago when I may have made some women uncomfortable by making advances. Those were mistakes, and I regret them immensely. But I always understood and respected\u2014and abided by the principle\u2014that \u2018no\u2019 means \u2018no,\u2019 and I have never misused my position to harm or hinder anyone\u2019s career. This is a time when we all are appropriately focused on how we help improve our society, and we at CBS are committed to being part of the solution.\u201d According to CBS, there have been no misconduct claims and no settlements against Moonves during his twenty-four years at the network. A statement from the company said, \u201cCBS is very mindful of all workplace issues and takes each report of misconduct very seriously. We do not believe, however, that the picture of our company created in The New Yorker represents a larger organization that does its best to treat its tens of thousands of employees with dignity and respect. We are seeing vigorous discourse in our country about equality, inclusion, and safety in the workplace, and CBS is committed to being part of the solution to those important issues.\u201d\n\nThe allegations are surfacing at a time when CBS is engaged in an increasingly acrimonious fight with its former parent company, Viacom, which acquired CBS in 1999 and spun it off as a separate entity seven years later. A holding company founded by the mogul Sumner Redstone still owns a majority stake in both Viacom and CBS, and Redstone\u2019s daughter and heir, Shari Redstone, has sought to reunite the businesses. Moonves has resisted the move, and in May Redstone\u2019s holding company and CBS filed lawsuits against each other. All of the women making allegations against Moonves began speaking to me before the current lawsuits, in independent interviews carried out during the past eight months. All said that they were not motivated by any allegiance in the corporate battle. But several felt that this was an opportunity to examine a workplace culture that many of the women in this story described as toxic.\n\nIlleana Douglas, who later received an Emmy nomination for her role in HBO\u2019s \u201cSix Feet Under,\u201d was introduced to Moonves in 1996. At the time, she was meeting with networks, looking for a deal to write and perform for television. Moonves, who was then the president of CBS Entertainment, seemed to take a personal interest in her. He told Douglas that he was a fan of her performances in the Martin Scorsese films \u201cCape Fear\u201d and \u201cGoodfellas,\u201d and urged her to work with CBS. \u201cThere was the big sell\u2014he was telling me, \u2018You\u2019re gonna get a house with a pool, you\u2019re gonna love it, it\u2019s a great life,\u2019 \u201d Douglas recalled. She agreed to sign a holding deal with CBS, which promised to pay her three hundred thousand dollars to appear exclusively in the network\u2019s programs.\n\nCBS ultimately didn\u2019t proceed with a pilot that Douglas wrote, but the network cast her in a comedy called \u201cQueens,\u201d as an eccentric native of the New York borough. In March, 1997, shortly before production of the pilot episode began, Moonves called Douglas\u2019s manager, Melissa Prophet, and told her that he was concerned about Douglas\u2019s attitude during a reading with her co-star, Penelope Ann Miller. Prophet relayed the concern to Douglas, who was surprised and confused: the reading, in front of a group of CBS executives, had elicited uproarious laughter. Moonves, she said, had taken her by the shoulders and congratulated her. Moonves had told Prophet that he wanted to meet with Douglas, alone, to insure that they were creatively aligned. (Prophet told me that she did not recall the conversation or setting up the meeting.) By then, Douglas had worked closely with Moonves for months. \u201cHe seemed more than just my boss,\u201d she told me. \u201cHe was very much like a father figure.\u201d\n\nWhen Douglas met with Moonves at his office, she began to raise concerns about the \u201cQueens\u201d script, but Moonves, she recalled, cut her off. \u201cHe interrupts me to ask me am I single,\u201d she said. Douglas, whose nearly decade-long relationship with Scorsese was coming to an end, was caught off guard. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say at that point,\u201d she told me. \u201cI was, like, \u2018I\u2019m single, yes, no, maybe.\u2019 \u201d She began talking about the script, but Moonves interjected, asking to kiss her. According to Douglas, he said that they didn\u2019t have to tell her manager: \u201cIt\u2019ll just be between you and me. Come on, you\u2019re not some nubile virgin.\u201d\n\nAs Douglas attempted to turn the focus back to work, Moonves, she said, grabbed her. \u201cIn a millisecond, he\u2019s got one arm over me, pinning me,\u201d she said. Moonves was \u201cviolently kissing\u201d her, holding her down on the couch with her arms above her head. \u201cWhat it feels like to have someone hold you down\u2014you can\u2019t breathe, you can\u2019t move,\u201d she said. \u201cThe physicality of it was horrendous.\u201d She recalled lying limp and unresponsive beneath him. \u201cYou sort of black out,\u201d she told me. \u201cYou think, How long is this going to go on? I was just looking at this nice picture of his family and his kids. I couldn\u2019t get him off me.\u201d She said it was only when Moonves, aroused, pulled up her skirt and began to thrust against her that her fear overcame her paralysis. She told herself that she had to do something to stop him. \u201cAt that point, you\u2019re a trapped animal,\u201d she told me. \u201cYour life is flashing before your eyes.\u201d Moonves, in what Douglas assumed was an effort to be seductive, paused and asked, \u201cSo, what do you think?\u201d Douglas told me, \u201cMy decision was to get out of it by joking my way out, so he feels flattered.\u201d Thinking that reminding Moonves that he was her boss might discourage him, she told him, \u201cYes, for the head of a network you\u2019re some good kisser.\u201d Moonves frowned and got up. She scrambled to find her briefcase. \u201cWell, this has been great. Thanks,\u201d she recalled saying, moving toward the door. \u201cI\u2019ve got to go now.\u201d\n\nMoonves, she said, followed her to the door and blocked her path. He backed her up to the wall, pressing against her, with his face close to hers. \u201cIt was physically scary,\u201d Douglas told me. \u201cHe says, \u2018We\u2019re going to keep this between you and me, right?\u2019 \u201d Attempting to put him off with a joke, she replied, \u201cNo, sir, we won\u2019t tell anyone that you\u2019re a good kisser.\u201d Moonves released her and, without looking at her, walked away. \u201cIt was so invasive,\u201d she said of the threatening encounter. \u201cIt has stayed with me the rest of my life, that terror.\u201d", "images":
