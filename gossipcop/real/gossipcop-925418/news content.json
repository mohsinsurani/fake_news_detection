She wants to look like Diana Ross for one day. I don't know how, like, that got racist on Halloween.\"\n\nAccording to Kelly, it was okay for a white person to wear blackface on Halloween, or for a black person to wear whiteface on Halloween when she was a kid, as long as they were dressing up as a character, which de Lesseps had done.", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6fec051a-189e-48d7-b369-4d2ebfc3a189.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/LuAnn-De-Lesseps-Blackface-Not-Racist.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4b4ada48-86be-4e4b-bb9c-5533d3708ba6.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/e494db4a-e9aa-4be6-a73c-2041f4691eb1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/5d5cf9e5-a519-4c4c-a12e-46eff7aecb30.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/LuAnn-De-Lesseps-Blackface-Not-Racist.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5130404/megyn-kelly-doesnt-understand-why-people-thought-luann-de-lesseps-diana-ross-costume-was-considered-racist/", "title": "Megyn Kelly Doesn't Understand Why People Thought LuAnn De Lesseps' Diana Ross Costume Was Considered 'Racist'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Megyn Kelly Doesn't Understand Why People Thought LuAnn De Lesseps' Diana Ross Costume Was Considered 'Racist'", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/5130404/megyn-kelly-doesnt-understand-why-people-thought-luann-de-lesseps-diana-ross-costume-was-considered-racist/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Megyn Kelly Doesn't Understand Why People Thought LuAnn De Lesseps' Diana Ross Costume Was Considered 'Racist'", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/10/LuAnn-De-Lesseps-Blackface-Not-Racist.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-10-24 09:21:19Z", "section": "Celebrities"}, "description": "Megyn Kelly Doesn't Understand Why People Thought LuAnn De Lesseps' Diana Ross Costume Was Considered 'Racist'", "keywords": "Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@GirlWithGossip"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1540372879.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
