April the giraffe\u2019s calf has met his dad, Oliver, and it made for the most precious, heartwarming photo ever!\n\nAnimal Adventure Park in Harpursville, New York, tweeted the adorable snap of the father-son introduction on Tuesday, April 18. In the pic, Oliver leans down and touches his baby\u2019s nose through a fence. (Oliver is currently separated from April and the calf for their safety.) \u201cDad & Baby meet!\u201d the tweet read.\n\nThe zoo owner, Jordan Patch, told Good Morning America on Monday, April 17, that it\u2019s rare for male giraffes to help with their newborns\u2019 upbringing. \u201cOliver \u2014 usually males have no part in raising of the young \u2014 [but] he\u2019s actually been quite inquisitive and getting nose to nose with baby,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s creating some very cute moments.\u201d\n\nAs fans all over the world saw via livestream, April the giraffe gave birth to her fourth calf on Saturday, April 15, after 16 months of pregnancy. Approximately 1.2 million people watched as she welcomed the baby, who weighed 129 pounds and measured 5 feet, 9 inches.\n\nThe newborn giraffe doesn\u2019t yet have a name since Animal Adventure Park is holding a contest to name the calf. Animal lovers everywhere can submit a name for the baby until April 25 at nameaprilscalf.com. Each submission costs $1 with a minimum purchase of five name suggestions for $5. At the end of the voting period, the zoo will open another voting contest with the 10 most popular names. All proceeds will benefit giraffe conservation events, the zoo and Ava\u2019s Little Heroes, a charity for families who face unexpected medical expenses.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/c9sacz6xsae3tok-1f7a720b-011b-473c-9387-45be5f257537.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C576px%2C302px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/c9sacz6xsae3tok-1f7a720b-011b-473c-9387-45be5f257537.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C576px%2C302px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/april-the-giraffes-baby-calf-meets-his-dad-see-the-precious-pic-w477512/", "title": "April the Giraffe\u2019s Baby Calf Meets His Dad: See the Precious Pic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Celebrity Pets", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "April the giraffe\u2019s baby calf met his dad, Oliver, and it\u2019s the most precious photo ever \u2014 see it here!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "April the Giraffe\u2019s Baby Calf Meets His Dad: See the Precious Pic", "description": "April the giraffe\u2019s baby calf met his dad, Oliver, and it\u2019s the most precious photo ever \u2014 see it here!", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/april-the-giraffes-baby-calf-meets-his-dad-see-the-precious-pic-w477512/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T03:13:26+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/c9sacz6xsae3tok-1f7a720b-011b-473c-9387-45be5f257537.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C576px%2C302px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/c9sacz6xsae3tok-1f7a720b-011b-473c-9387-45be5f257537.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C576px%2C302px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-18T20:04:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T03:13:26+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "April the Giraffe\u2019s Baby Calf Meets His Dad: See the Precious Pic", "description": "April the giraffe\u2019s baby calf met his dad, Oliver, and it\u2019s the most precious photo ever \u2014 see it here!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/c9sacz6xsae3tok-1f7a720b-011b-473c-9387-45be5f257537.jpg?crop=0px%2C59px%2C576px%2C302px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492545840.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
