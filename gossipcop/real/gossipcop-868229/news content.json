{"url": "https://people.com/music/chester-bennington-substance-abuse-depression/", "text": "Chester Bennington\u2018s gritty rock voice belied a man struggling with depression and a history with drug and alcohol abuse.\n\nOn Thursday, Bennington \u2013 frontman for the million-selling alt-rockers Linkin Park\u2014was found dead by police just before 9 a.m. inside a private residence in Palos Verdes Estates, California, authorities told PEOPLE. His death also comes on the same day that his late friend and Soundgarden lead singer Chris Cornell would have turned 53.\n\nBennington was 41 years old and left behind six children.\n\nBennington had been candid about mental health battles in numerous interviews over the years. In 2015 he opened up about his dark periods to Rock Sound.\n\n\u201cI literally hated life and I was like, \u2018I don\u2019t want to have feelings. I want to be a sociopath. I don\u2019t want to do anything. I don\u2019t want to care what other people feel like. I want to feel nothing.'\u201d\n\nOwen Sweeney/REX/Shutterstock\n\nDuring an equally revealing interview with Kerrang in 2011, the singer opened up about being molested when he was 7 years old.\n\n\u201dIf I think back to when I was really young, to when I was being molested, to when all these horrible things were going on around me, I shudder,\u201d he said.\n\nMiikka Skaffari/FilmMagic\n\nBennington joined Linkin Park in 1999, and the band scored their first commercial success the following year with their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which contained the popular songs, \u201cCrawling,\u201d \u201cIn the End,\u201d \u201cOne Step Closer.\u201d\n\nThe primary lyricist for the band, he used his addictions as inspiration. In a 2009 interview with Noisecreep, Bennington revealed that \u201cCrawling\u201d was about \u201cfeeling like I had no control over myself in terms of drugs and alcohol.\u201d The irony of earning fame and fortune from his demons was not lost on him. \u201cThat feeling, being able to write about it, sing about it\u2014those words sold millions of records, I won a Grammy, I made a lot of money.\u201d\n\nStill, he worked hard to maintain his sobriety. \u201cIt\u2019s not cool to be an alcoholic,\u201d he continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not cool to go drink and be a dumbass. It\u2019s cool to be a part of recovery. This is just who I am, this is what I write about, what I do, and most of my work has been a reflection of what I\u2019ve been going through in one way or another.\u201d\n\n\u201cCrawling\u201d was not the only song that contained allusions to depression and personal strife. In a March 2017 interview with Rock Sound, Bennington also said that \u201cHeavy\u201d was about letting go and releasing bad or troubled feelings.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s where the line, \u2018If I just let go, I\u2019d be set free\u2019 comes from \u2014 that\u2019s what \u2018Heavy\u2019 is about. When I\u2019m opening that song saying, \u2018I don\u2019t like my mind right now\u2019, that\u2019s f\u2014ing real. It is not a safe place for me to be unless I\u2019m doing what I need to do: taking care of myself, being real, being open, getting it out, taking all the steps to make myself whole. Then it\u2019s a pretty safe neighborhood, but it goes bad real fast. It\u2019s great to get that s\u2014 out.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255).", "images":
