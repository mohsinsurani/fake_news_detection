Oliver Hudson missed the chance to play Jack Pearson on This is Us \u2014 because he went fishing!\n\nThe Splitting Up Together star, 41, appeared on the LadyGang podcast on Tuesday, May 15, where he spoke with hosts Keltie Knight, Becca Tobin and Jac Vanek. During their chat, Hudson mentioned that he read for the part of the beloved patriarch and did \u201cvery well\u201d \u2014 well enough that he was asked to do a chemistry read with Mandy Moore.\n\n\u201cBut this will tell you how much I love to fish. I had a 10-day fishing trip planned. It\u2019s my life. Fishing is a big part of my life and it was this 10-day fishing trip. And my agent says, \u2018We have to test, and they really like you, and this, this, and that.\u2019 And I said, \u2018Oh, I\u2019m supposed to go on a fishing trip\u2019\u2026 And he\u2019s like, \u2018Okay, yeah, so? I mean, this is a big thing,\u2019\u201d he revealed. \u201cAnd I said, \u2018You know what? I\u2019m going to do my fishing trip.\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter the NBC series became a success, the Rules of Engagement alum admitted that he had an \u201cOh s\u2014t\u201c moment \u2014 but even he knew it was going to be a hit when checking the script. \u201cI rarely like anything, but I read it and I was like, \u2018This is really good,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI thought it was very well written and new and a little different. Interesting.\u201d\n\nClearly the masses agree. Milo Ventimiglia, who snagged the role of Jack, and his costars have broken records \u2014 and hearts \u2014 with the captivating series. Hudson has made out just fine, too \u2014 he is currently starring on ABC\u2019s Splitting Up Together with Jenna Fischer, where the pair star as a couple who find their relationship rejuvenated after they file for divorce.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hudson-milo.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/hudson-milo.jpg?crop=0px%2C2px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Leanne Aciz-Stanton", "Leanne Aciz Stanton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/oliver-hudson-almost-played-jack-pearson-on-this-is-us/", "title": "Oliver Hudson Almost Played Jack Pearson on 'This Is Us'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Oliver Hudson revealed he read for the part of Jack Pearson on 'This Is Us,' but missed the chance for a surprising reason \u2014 find out more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "OMG!
