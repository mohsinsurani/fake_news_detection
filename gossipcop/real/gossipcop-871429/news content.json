You know when someone\u2019s clean sober but clearly something\u2019s up in their head? They\u2019re like, \u2018No, but look, I\u2019m totally fine. Look, I\u2019m skinny, everything\u2019s good.\u2019 \u201d\n\nMichael Stewart/WireImage;\n\nMichael Stewart/WireImage; Michael Tran/FilmMagic\n\nJeremy has had a tough road on UnREAL. A cameraman on Everlasting \u2014 the Bachelor-like dating show run by Quinn (Constance Zimmer) and Rachel (Shiri Appleby) \u2014 he spent season one trying to move on from Rachel, only to reunite with her and hit her in a moment of rage in season 2.\n\nSeason three will present even more obstacles for Jeremy. \u201cMy first season went one way. Second season went a completely different direction,\u201d Kelly said. \u201cFor the third season, I really got to change it up, and it was a lot of fun.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: UnREAL\u2018s Craig Bierko on His 50 Pound Weight Loss!\n\nKelly isn\u2019t the only actor to lose a considerable amount of weight for the show. Craig Bierko, who plays Everlasting co-creator Chet, shed 50 lbs. before season 2 \u2014 by enrolling at The Biggest Loser Resort on Amelia Island, where he focused on cross-training exercises.\n\n\u201cIt is a miraculous place,\u201d Bierko told PEOPLE in October 2016. \u201cI wanted to lose 30 lbs. and all told, I lost close to 50 lbs. Not there \u2013 I came home and lost another 20 lbs., and I keep going.\u201d\n\nUnREAL will return for its third season in early 2018.
