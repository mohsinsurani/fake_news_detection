The comedienne opened up about the headline-making incident on Australian talk show Sunrise earlier this week, backtracking on her previous mea culpa.\n\n\u201cI am no longer sorry, the whole outrage was B.S, the whole thing got so blown out of proportion,\u201d she said. \u201cI lost everybody.\u201d\n\n. @KathyGriffin: \u201cI\u2019m no longer sorry.

My entire tour was canceled within 24 hours because every single theater got all these death threats,\u201d she added. \u201cThese Trump fans, they\u2019re hardcore.\u201d\n\nWhen TV host Samantha Armytage then asked Griffin whether she thought she had crossed a line by sharing the graphic image, the veteran comic got defensive.\n\n\u201cNo, you\u2019re full of crap. Stop this,\u201d she said. \u201cStop acting like my little picture is more important than talking about the actual atrocities that the president of the United States is committing.\u201d\n\nGriffin also noted that non-Republicans had turned on her as well, including Chelsea Clinton and Debra Messing, who had both tweeted to condemn her actions. But Griffin felt the impact most deeply when her close friend and longtime New Year\u2019s Eve cohost Anderson Cooper disavowed her with a single tweet.\n\n\u201cFor the record, I am appalled by the photo shoot Kathy Griffin took part in,\u201d he wrote at the time. \u201cIt is clearly disgusting and completely inappropriate.\u201d\n\nAccording to The Cut, four of Cooper\u2019s CNN colleagues reached out to Griffin repeatedly in subsequent days to make sure she was OK; Cooper didn\u2019t reach out to Griffin until August 10th. Via a series of text messages, she soon told him their friendship was over, The Cut reports.\n\nCooper told Andy Cohen on Watch What Happens Live in July that the pair are \u201cstill friends,\u201d and that he hopes \u201cshe bounces back.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=1581&h=1054&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/kathy-griffin-is-no-longer-sorry-about-trump-photo-shoot-outrage-was-b-s-196289/", "title": "Kathy Griffin \u2018No Longer Sorry\u2019 About Trump Photo Shoot \u2013 Rolling Stone", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#df3535", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Months after her Trump decapitation photo shoot, Kathy Griffin says entire situation was \"blown out of proportion\" and rescinds her original apology.", "news_keywords": "Donald Trump", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "rollingstone", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 196289, "author": "Joyce Chen", "pmc-category": "(Sub)Culture,(Sub)Culture News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-08-30T17:30:25"}, "pmc-tag": "Donald Trump", "title": "Kathy Griffin Is \u2018No Longer Sorry\u2019 About Trump Photo Shoot: Outrage Was \u2018B.S.\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Joyce Chen", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RS", "application-name": "RS", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 196289, "title": "Kathy Griffin Is 'No Longer Sorry' About Trump Photo Shoot: Outrage Was 'B.S.'", "published_at": "2017-08-30 17:30:25", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/kathy-griffin-not-apologetic-trump-head-hoax-5d0e5f42-78d2-40da-b1b7-656e4d1370d3.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Donald Trump", "topics": "(Sub)Culture News", "body": "Kathy Griffin is rescinding her apology over her controversial art piece depicting a decapitated President Trump.
