Riley FBR senior analyst Barton Crockett told THR that \"Solo\" will lose more than $50 million, while other industry financing sources told the outlet that the loss could exceed $80 million, depending on auxiliary revenues and the undisclosed, exact terms of Disney's deal for the film.\n\n\"Solo\" dropped 65% at the box office in its second weekend of release, and its global box office total currently stands at $264.3 million, according to Box Office Mojo.\n\n\"Solo\" also bombed in its opening weekend in China, as Business Insider's Jason Guerrasio reported. The film brought in only $10.1 million over Memorial Day weekend in China, a record low for \"Star Wars\" films in the country, though the franchise itself has historically never grabbed the attention of China, the world's second-largest movie market.\n\nIf it doesn't see a late surge, as analysts are predicting it won't, \"Solo\" will become the first movie from Disney and Lucasfilm to lose money.\n\n2017's \"Star Wars: The Last Jedi\" brought in $1.332 billion at the global box office, while the first \"Star Wars\" spin-off \"Rogue One\" grossed $1.056 billion in 2016.\n\nThe first collaboration from Disney and Lucasfilm, \"Star Wars: The Force Awakens,\" grossed $2.068 billion in 2015, setting off a renewal of the \"Star Wars\" series that is now likely to see its first miss in \"Solo.\"", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg",
