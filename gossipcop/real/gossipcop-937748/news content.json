The series features Willow, her mother, Jada Pinkett-Smith, and Jada\u2019s mother, Adrienne Banfield, as they discuss all of the pertinent topics in the lives of women today.\n\nAnd on Monday, Willow opened up about her body image insecurities. The \u201cWhip My Hair\u201d singer admitted she struggled with the fact that her body wasn\u2019t as \u201ccurvy\u201d as some other girls.\n\nWillow explained that \u201ccurvier\u201d girls always ended up dating the boys she liked. She couldn\u2019t help but feel jealous because of it. \u201cCurvier girls have always gotten more attention from the boys that I\u2019ve liked,\u201d the daughter of Will Smith explained.\n\nIt started happening over and over again as she got older, and she began to seriously consider if she\u2019s just not that desirable. \u201cIs my body just not what society likes?\u201d\n\nWillow went on to state that it\u2019s difficult when her friends say to her that it must be great to wear revealing clothing and not have people react to her differently. People always want what they can\u2019t have, or maybe her friend\u2019s statements are just passive-aggressiveness.\n\nWhen reading a question from Facebook, a question asking as to why women are \u201cso mean\u201d when it comes to appearances, Willow said it\u2019s \u201call about envy.\u201d\n\n\u201cBecause they wished they had what the other person has,\u201d the daughter of Jada and Will Smith explained. Demonstrating wisdom far beyond her years, Willow said mean comments are mostly just reflections of themselves.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe 19-year-old wasn\u2019t the only one to talk about her daily struggle with self-esteem. Her mother, Jada, goes on to talk about what it\u2019s like to deal with hair loss as an aging woman. For many, it\u2019s an issue which causes a lot of embarrassment.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Rob-Kardashian-Blac-Chyna-Weight-Loss-300x206.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/willow_smith-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Khloe-Kardashian-Wedding-Tristan-Thompson-300x247.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Jada-Pinkett-Smith-and-Willow-Smith-Blog.Chron_.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Kandi-Burruss-Phaedra-Parks-300x247.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Porsha-Williams-Looks-Stunning-In-A-White-Dress-Leaving-Her-Fans-In-Awe-Claiming-My-King-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Nicki-Minaj-Teases-Collab-With-YG-2-Chainz-And-Big-Sean-Watch-The-Video-300x230.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/57d8979d9fc75df95a9f4b76e749b4e3?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Karrueche-Tran-Is-Reportedly-Freaking-Out-After-Rumors-That-Chris-Brown-Posted-And-Deleted-A-Video-For-Her-Birthday-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-700x466.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/ToddMalm-60x60.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tamar-Braxton-Hair-300x247.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Tiny-Teyana-Taylor-Exchange-Twerking-Tips-During-Their-Wild-Girls-Night-Tiny-Respected-T.I.-Even-If-He-Was-Missing-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Christina-El-Moussa-Mitzissister.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Willow-Smith-WMagazine.com_-e1526946756485.jpeg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/Willow-Smith-WMagazine.com_-e1526946756485.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Todd Malm", "Michelle Johnson"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180524120636/http://celebrityinsider.org/willow-smith-says-she-used-to-feel-jealous-about-curvier-girls-149299/", "title": "Willow Smith Says She Used To Feel Jealous About \u201cCurvier\u201d Girls", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Todd Malm", "news_keywords": "Willow Smith,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Willow Smith,", "description": "Willow Smith has been getting a fair amount of exposure in the last month after the premiere of her mother's Facebook show, Red Table Talk.
