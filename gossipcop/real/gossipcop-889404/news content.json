She spoke about her years with Adams on an episode of the WTF with Marc Maron podcast. She said: \"I felt like I was drowning. It was so untenable and unsustainable and it was so lonely. I was so sad. I was lonely with him.\" She followed up in an interview with the New York Times, saying: \"His controlling behavior essentially did block my ability to make new connections in the industry during a very pivotal and potentially lucrative time \u2014 my entire mid-to-late 20s.\"\n\nIn 2015, Moore began dating Dawes frontman, Taylor Goldsmith.

The 3,351 square foot house has three bedrooms and three bathrooms on 1.4 acres. The backyard has a pool and sweeping views of the San Gabriel Valley.
