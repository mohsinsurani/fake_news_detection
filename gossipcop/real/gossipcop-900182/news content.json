After all, she was the one who revealed the pair were once secretly engaged.\n\nZoe Kravitz and Nicole Kidman currently star together in HBO's Emmy-winning series \"Big Little Lies.\" FilmMagic\n\nDuring a February 2017 interview with The EDIT, the Oscar winner casually revealed the special connection she shared with her younger \"Big Little Lies\" co-star.\n\n\"Well, I knew Zoe because I was engaged to her father,\" she shared, adding jokingly, \"It's all in the family!\"\n\nKidman obviously still thinks her old flame is pretty terrific. \"I love Lenny; he's a great guy,\" she said right after dropping her bombshell.\n\nStill friends: Lenny Kravitz poses with Nicole Kidman and her husband, Keith Urban, in 2013.

interview.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s so good that sometimes it was distracting,\" Zoe gushed. \"After every take I wanted to just stop and say, \u2018Wow.\u2019\u201d\n\nMonths later, in June 2017, Zoe shared happy childhood memories of Kidman.\n\n\u201cI hadn\u2019t seen her in a long time before 'Big Little Lies,' but there was a point where we were all kind of living together,\" she told the EDIT. \"I was about 13, and she would take me to see movies; she was so nice to me.\"", "images":
