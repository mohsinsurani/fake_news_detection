Time\n\nBecca Kufrin is a fianc\u00e9e once more.\n\nLess than three months after her break-up with Bachelor Arie Luyendyk Jr. aired, the new Bachelorette revealed she is engaged to People magazine. Good Morning America also announced the news Tuesday.\n\n\"It was the happiest moment of my life. And it feels so good to say it,\" the 28-year-old Minnesota native told People. \"I still pinch myself, like, did that all just happen? It\u2019s been a whirlwind.\u201d\n\nUnderstandably so. Luyendyk proposed to Kufrin only to break-up with her on-camera and make a play for his season's runner-up Lauren Burnham.\n\nLuyendyk and Burnham are now engaged and announced on The View Wednesday they will marry in a private ceremony in Maui on Jan. 12.\n\nKufrin says after her public break-up, she grieved. \u201cI was confused and angry and all the emotions you go through a heartbreak with,\u201d she said to People. But the potential to find love again as The Bachelorette, it seems, deadened the ache of her broken heart.\n\n\u201cYes, I fell in love and we were engaged,\u201d she told the entertainment magazine. \u201cBut that ended. And I realized nothing since then changed. I still wanted to find my partner, and I wasn\u2019t going to let anything stop me.\u201d\n\n#TheBachelorette's big announcement: SHE'S ENGAGED! Becca dishes on finding love and the new season of @BacheloretteABC: pic.twitter.com/EYCzqrEItX \u2014 Good Morning America (@GMA) May 22, 2018\n\nKufrin calls her turn as Bachelorette \"the most worthwhile thing I've ever done,\" and shares using the word \"fianc\u00e9\" for her new man has another feeling this time around.\n\n\"It just has a different feeling. It feels so good to say it, and this time I feel like it's gonna stick,\" she said. The odds are in Kufrin's favor. Out of the 13 Bachelorettes that have come before her, three married the winners from their seasons, and three are currently engaged to their final picks. Out of 22 seasons of The Bachelor, only Season 17's Sean Lowe and Catherine Giudici (married in 2014 with two kids) stuck it out.\n\nWhatever the future holds for Kufrin and her new love, one thing is for certain, she is extremely happy right now.\n\n\"I feel like I just can't wipe the smile off my face,\" she said to People. \"It just feels like it's just a perfect fit for me... in my heart, it just feels so right. I feel like I finally found my missing puzzle piece.\"\n\nKurfins Bachelorette journey begins with a two-hour premiere Monday (8 p.m. ET/PT, ABC).\n\nMore: Is it time to stop watching 'The Bachelor?'\n\nMore: 'The Bachelor' recap: Three hours, two devastated women and one worst finale ever", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5750411413001_5750409972001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7de371f52761ded520180fb207fdcbfcdf179c21/c=0-113-1992-1239/local/-/media/2018/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636625794586750290-148892-0488.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7de371f52761ded520180fb207fdcbfcdf179c21/c=0-113-1992-1239/local/-/media/2018/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636625794586750290-148892-0488.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Jensen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/05/22/bachelorette-becca-kufrin-engaged-arie-luyendyk-bachelor/631971002/", "title": "Bachelorette Becca Kufrin reveals she's engaged: 'I finally found my missing puzzle piece'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/05/22/bachelorette-becca-kufrin-engaged-arie-luyendyk-bachelor/631971002/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Bachelorette Becca Kufrin reveals she's engaged: 'I finally found my missing puzzle piece'", "description": "\\", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/7de371f52761ded520180fb207fdcbfcdf179c21/c=0-113-1992-1239/local/-/media/2018/05/22/USATODAY/USATODAY/636625794586750290-148892-0488.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "\\", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526943600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
