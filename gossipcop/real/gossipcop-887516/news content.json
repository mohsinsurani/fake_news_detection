The foursome was also joined by Jordyn Woods, 20, and Hailey Baldwin, 20.\n\n\u201cKylie and Kendall were both extremely loving and cuddly with their boyfriends,\u201d the onlooker says. \u201cBoth couples had their arms around each other, and the girls were really sweet with their guys. Travis and Kylie were especially cute and lovey-dovey. Kendall and Blake had a blast going through the mazes together.\u201d\n\nWhile there were certain rides pregnant Kylie couldn\u2019t go on, she \u201cmade sure Travis went ahead and had fun,\u201d says the onlooker, adding that the reality star kept her belly \u201cunder wraps in a big hoodie and leggings.\u201d\n\nKendall and Griffin, who plays for the Los Angeles Clippers, have been hanging out since August. Last week, a source told PEOPLE that the NBA star, who shares two children with Brynn Cameron, a former basketball player at USC, is \u201csuper into\u201d Kendall.\n\nGetty (2)\n\n\u201cShe thinks he\u2019s dorky and funny, but also cool and sexy \u2014 he has a certain attractive \u2018swagger,\u2019 \u201d the source said. \u201cThey are seeing each other more, and Blake is doing everything in his power to make Kendall his girlfriend.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always working and traveling and knows a full-blown relationship isn\u2019t necessarily the best idea, but things are heating up,\u201d the source added. \u201cShe is for sure enjoying dating him.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Here\u2019s Why Kendall Jenner Is Missing from the 2017 Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show Lineup\n\nAs for her younger sister, Kylie has remained under the radar since multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE last month that she\u2019s expecting her first child, a baby girl, with Scott. She\u2019s been dating the rapper since earlier this year after splitting from heron-again, off-again boyfriend of nearly three years, Tyga.\n\nTravis Scott and Kylie Jenner Bob Levey/Getty\n\nLast week, a source told PEOPLE that Kylie \u2014 who hasn\u2019t publicly addressed her pregnancy but seems to be teasing the news on Snapchat \u2014 \u201cstill wants to keep a low profile\u201d and \u201cprefers to stay home\u201d at the moment.\n\n\u201cEven though this is a very exciting time for her, she wants to be more private for now and is doing her best to stay out of the public eye,\u201d the source said.\n\n\u201cShe feels good, but her body is changing,\u201d the source explained. \u201cShe doesn\u2019t want to be photographed. At the moment, she wants more privacy. She has family and friends come to her house instead so she has company. She\u2019s very excited about the baby though. She talks about the baby nonstop. She\u2019s already shopping like crazy.\u201d\n\nOn Monday, Kylie was noticeably absent from photos of the family shooting their Keeping Up with the Kardashians Christmas special at Kris Jenner\u2019s home with now-retired Olympic medal-winning figure skater Nancy Kerrigan. A source told PEOPLE that she was present during filming, but opted not to ice skate.\n\n\u201cIt was a scheduled taping,\u201d the source said. \u201cShe kept in the background, but seemed great.\u201d\n\nKeeping Up with the Kardashians airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images":
