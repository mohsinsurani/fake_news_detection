Jay-Z opened up about his longtime friendship and feud with Kanye West in a wide-ranging interview with T: The New York Times Styles Magazine.\n\n\u201cI [talked to] Kanye the other day, just to tell him, like, he\u2019s my brother. I love Kanye. I do,\u201d the Brooklyn native, 47, told the Times\u2019 executive editor Dean Baquet for a profile published on Wednesday, November 29. \u201cIt\u2019s a complicated relationship with us.\u201d\n\nJay-Z continued, \u201cKanye came into this business on my label. So I\u2019ve always been like his big brother. And we\u2019re both entertainers. It\u2019s always been like a little underlying competition with your big brother. And we both love and respect each other\u2019s art, too. So it\u2019s like, we both \u2014 everyone wants to be the greatest in the world. You know what I\u2019m saying? And then there\u2019s like a lot of other factors that play in it. But \u2026 we gonna always be good.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cFamily Feud\u201d rapper then confirmed that there has been some tension between him and West, 40, since the Chicago native lashed out at him during an onstage rant in October 2016.\n\n\u201cBut that happens. In the long relationship, you know, hopefully when we\u2019re 89 we look at this six months or whatever time and we laugh at that,\u201d Jay-Z said. \u201cThere\u2019s gonna be complications in the relationship that we have to get through. And the only way to get through that is we sit down and have a dialogue and say, \u2018These are the things that I\u2019m uncomfortable with. These are the things that are unacceptable to me. This is what I feel.\u2019 I\u2019m sure he feels that I\u2019ve done things to him as well. \u2026 I\u2019m not a perfect human being by no stretch.\u201d\n\nThe 21-time Grammy winner went on to call the \u201cFamous\u201d rapper \u201ca very compassionate person\u201d who simply \u201cgets in trouble trying to help others.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-west-jay-z.jpg?crop=265px%2C0px%2C1241px%2C652px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-west-jay-z.jpg?crop=91px%2C0px%2C1619px%2C914px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-west-jay-z.jpg?crop=265px%2C0px%2C1241px%2C652px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jay-z-opens-up-about-his-complicated-relationship-with-kanye-west-hes-my-brother/", "title": "Jay-Z on His \u2018Complicated Relationship\u2019 With Kanye West", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jay-Z opened up about his \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 with Kanye West in a wide-ranging interview with 'T: The New York Times Style Magazine' \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jay-Z Opens Up About His \u2018Complicated Relationship\u2019 With Kanye", "description": "Jay-Z opened up about his \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 with Kanye West in a wide-ranging interview with 'T: The New York Times Style Magazine' \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jay-z-opens-up-about-his-complicated-relationship-with-kanye-west-hes-my-brother/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:04+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-west-jay-z.jpg?crop=265px%2C0px%2C1241px%2C652px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-west-jay-z.jpg?crop=265px%2C0px%2C1241px%2C652px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-29T18:15:18+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:14:04+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jay-Z Opens Up About His \u2018Complicated Relationship\u2019 With Kanye", "description": "Jay-Z opened up about his \u2018complicated relationship\u2019 with Kanye West in a wide-ranging interview with 'T: The New York Times Style Magazine' \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/kanye-west-jay-z.jpg?crop=265px%2C0px%2C1241px%2C652px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=84&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511979318.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
