Mr. Boatwright was arrested on July 5 on unrelated drug charges, the police said, and was served an arrest warrant for first-degree murder while still in custody on Tuesday.\n\nAnother suspect, Dedrick Devonshay Williams, 22, was arrested two days after the killing, and charged with first-degree murder, though detectives said at the time that they were seeking additional suspects. On Wednesday, the Broward Sheriff\u2019s Office said it was still seeking an unidentified \u201csecond gunman\u201d in the slaying; Robert Allen, 22, has also been named as a person of interest in the case.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/merlin_140386377_8014936b-9382-4ebd-9005-4e1bce50e1c8-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9c49199bb51c95cef51e50c8548876a0e7c75e5bc90de350eb85e1ce2a3e994d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9c49199bb51c95cef51e50c8548876a0e7c75e5bc90de350eb85e1ce2a3e994d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Coscarelli"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/music/xxxtentacion-death-arrest.html", "title": "Second Suspect Arrested in Killing of Rapper XXXTentacion", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The police in Florida said on Wednesday that they had arrested one of two gunmen in the 20-year-old musician\u2019s death, but were still seeking an additional assailant.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/07/11/arts/music/xxxtentacion-death-arrest.html", "type": "article", "title": "Second Suspect Arrested in Killing of Rapper XXXTentacion (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/07/12/arts/12xxxarrest/12xxxarrest-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=9c49199bb51c95cef51e50c8548876a0e7c75e5bc90de350eb85e1ce2a3e994d&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "A fan holds up an XXXTentacion shirt outside the memorial for the rapper in Florida.
