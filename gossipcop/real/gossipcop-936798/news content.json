The streaming service announced the cancellation hours before the scheduled premiere and red carpet event, citing the Friday morning shooting at Santa Fe High School that left 10 people dead.\n\nDespite the canceled premiere red carpet and party, the entire Season 2 is available on Netflix.\n\nThe first season of \"13 Reasons Why\" drew criticism for its graphic depiction of a teenager's suicide. The second season focuses on the aftermath of the girl's death, and it includes a storyline about a student's thwarted plans to shoot up a school dance. The student, who is heavily armed with a rifle and handguns, is talked out of the shooting by a classmate who helps him escape before police arrive.\n\nThe show's launch party in West Hollywood was expected to feature appearances by show stars Katherine Langford, Dylan Minnette, Kate Walsh and others, and producer Selena Gomez.", "images": ["https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/10/07/fe49af8e-69c7-4139-8713-4ec974793319/thumbnail/140x90/b99d611a6f27b20183cd5c2d55f6cb26/the-rock-preview-1280.jpg", "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/10/07/7166363c-725e-482f-bb27-018bca0e95f1/thumbnail/140x90/b6f2512d2469461c8b0fbda2d232469a/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-9-45-22-am.png", "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/04/28/97124cc9-2e5e-40e2-b82d-af0f0191bf9c/thumbnail/1200x630/bd3b0bfd9b7eb48e588034b24f78c135/reasons-why1.jpg", "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2021/05/06/ba9c5ca7-3040-4c98-86cb-663352dee96a/thumbnail/140x90/d38e9030ac0c955cd73af45532a0a635/GettyImages-1170982787.jpg", "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/2017/04/28/97124cc9-2e5e-40e2-b82d-af0f0191bf9c/reasons-why1.jpg", "https://assets3.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2022/10/04/8394ebc7-3c91-4afa-9cd4-b20b753b3903/thumbnail/140x90/9f0d5406b5b698364da2e01325ad1628/ye-and-candace.jpg", "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2020/10/12/c8ed092c-f571-4c92-966b-70fa921a388f/thumbnail/140x90/d001831348c1764ebe63a1380b0ab1be/GettyImages-912885210.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/04/28/97124cc9-2e5e-40e2-b82d-af0f0191bf9c/thumbnail/1200x630/bd3b0bfd9b7eb48e588034b24f78c135/reasons-why1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/", "title": "\"13 Reasons Why\" premiere party canceled after school shooting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=0", "color-scheme": "only light", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "description": "The Netflix series&#039; second season features a storyline about a tudent&#039;s thwarted plans to shoot up a school dance", "keywords": "School Shooting", "news_keywords": "School Shooting", "al": {"web": {"url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/"}, "ios": {"app_name": "CBS News", "app_store_id": 334256223, "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/"}, "android": {"app_name": "CBS News", "package": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews", "url": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/"}}, "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://www.cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/", "title": "\"13 Reasons Why\" premiere party canceled after school shooting", "description": "The Netflix series' second season features a storyline about a tudent's thwarted plans to shoot up a school dance", "image": {"identifier": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/04/28/97124cc9-2e5e-40e2-b82d-af0f0191bf9c/thumbnail/1200x630/bd3b0bfd9b7eb48e588034b24f78c135/reasons-why1.jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "fb": {"app_id": 1536620209892267, "pages": 131459315949}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CBSNewsEntertainment/", "content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"country": "US", "name": {"iphone": "CBS News", "ipad": "CBS News", "googleplay": "CBS News"}, "id": {"iphone": 334256223, "ipad": 334256223, "googleplay": "com.treemolabs.apps.cbsnews"}, "url": {"iphone": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/", "ipad": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/", "googleplay": "cbsnewsapp://cbsnews.com/news/santa-fe-high-school-shooting-netflix-cancels-13-reasons-why-season-2-premiere-party/"}}, "site": "@CBSNews", "title": "\"13 Reasons Why\" premiere party canceled after school shooting", "description": "The Netflix series' second season features a storyline about a tudent's thwarted plans to shoot up a school dance", "image": "https://assets1.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2017/04/28/97124cc9-2e5e-40e2-b82d-af0f0191bf9c/thumbnail/1200x630/bd3b0bfd9b7eb48e588034b24f78c135/reasons-why1.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "theme-color": "#101010", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "CBS News", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.cbsnews.com", "summary": ""}
