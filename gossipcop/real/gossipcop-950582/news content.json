He was taken to a hospital in Olbia, but his injuries were not serious and he was discharged.\n\n\u201cGeorge was treated and released from an Olbia hospital,\" his representative Stan Rosenfield told USA TODAY. \"He is recovering at home and will be fine.\u201d\n\nSurveillance video of the crash was obtained late Tuesday by the newspaper Corriere della Sera. It shows a blue Mercedes veering into oncoming traffic, apparently to turn into a residential compound near Olbia.\n\nThe video shows what is reported to be Clooney's scooter crashing into the car while another scooter alongside him manages to veer around it.
