Corinne Olympios is \u201cmost likely\u201d joining the cast of Bachelor in Paradise season 4, she revealed to E! News.\n\nWhile she didn\u2019t exactly give a definite confirmation, the Bachelor alum, 25, said there\u2019s a good chance she\u2019ll be heading to Mexico this summer. \u201cI mean, I\u2019m still not sure yet. Most likely, yes,\u201d she told the website. \u201cSo not 100 percent locked in yet.\u201d\n\nHowever, there\u2019s one \u201cspecial someone\u201d that could stop her from taking another chance on a reality-TV romance. The bubbly blonde has been seeing a mystery man \u2014 but she cautioned that it\u2019s not serious yet. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing him for a little bit. I\u2019m not ready to come out to the world about him yet,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s still in the early stages. I don\u2019t know what\u2019s going to happen, but we\u2019re vibing really nicely and everything\u2019s going well and I just want it to stay that way.\u201d\n\nWhile Olympios didn\u2019t reveal her new beau\u2019s identity, she said he lives in Los Angeles and that the pair have known each other for a long time. \u201cHe has his s\u2013t together. He supports me in everything I do,\u201d she said. \u201cWe just get along so well. We\u2019re also like great friends. It just meshes.\u201d\n\nThe TV personality just launched a Team Corn clothing line inspired by her infamous lines from season 21 of the ABC dating show. Olympios partnered with Riot Society clothing to create shirts and tanks with phrases such as \u201cPlatinum Vagine,\u201d \u201cBut First, Cheese Pasta\u201d and \u201cMake America Corrine Again.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/corinne-olympios-zoom-75e7d587-fe5d-4f3c-8ab4-836dd22d25cb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/corinne-olympios-zoom-75e7d587-fe5d-4f3c-8ab4-836dd22d25cb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/corinne-olympios-im-most-likely-heading-to-bachelor-in-paradise-w476426/", "title": "Corinne Olympios: I\u2019m \u2018Most Likely\u2019 Heading to \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Corinne Olympios revealed that she\u2019s \u2018most likely\u2019 heading to \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 season 4 \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Corinne Olympios: I\u2019m \u2018Most Likely\u2019 Heading to \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019", "description": "Corinne Olympios revealed that she\u2019s \u2018most likely\u2019 heading to \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 season 4 \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/corinne-olympios-im-most-likely-heading-to-bachelor-in-paradise-w476426/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:16:56+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/corinne-olympios-zoom-75e7d587-fe5d-4f3c-8ab4-836dd22d25cb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/corinne-olympios-zoom-75e7d587-fe5d-4f3c-8ab4-836dd22d25cb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-12T19:51:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:16:56+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Corinne Olympios: I\u2019m \u2018Most Likely\u2019 Heading to \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019", "description": "Corinne Olympios revealed that she\u2019s \u2018most likely\u2019 heading to \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 season 4 \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/corinne-olympios-zoom-75e7d587-fe5d-4f3c-8ab4-836dd22d25cb.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1698px%2C890px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492026660.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
