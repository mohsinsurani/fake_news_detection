As of Tuesday, per E! News, the quasi-coupling that may or may not have existed between the Kardashian family member and NBA player is no more. Or at the very least, things have \u201cslowed down\u201d considerably\u2014things that were apparently \u201cnever serious\u201d in the first place, if an insider is to be believed.\n\n\u201cThey were hanging out but both knew that it wasn\u2019t going to be a long-term, exclusive relationship,\u201d the insider told E! \u201cThey are still in contact and hangout here and there when they are both in town because they truly have a lot of fun together. Kendall always says that Blake makes her laugh and that\u2019s why she loves being around him.\u201d\n\nSaid insider is reportedly not the only one who can confirm the \u201cslowing down\u201d of things. Another source told E! News that indeed, things were not serious, and that the frequent hangouts have lessened in the past month, but added that this wasn\u2019t due to any major event. \u201cThere was nothing that caused this specifically and they will always be friends,\u201d the source continued, adding that Jenner \u201chas a lot on her plate and isn\u2019t really looking for a serious relationship.\u201d\n\nJenner and Griffin were previously seen canoodling at Universal Studios\u2019s Halloween Horror Nights in October. Also seen canoodling were rumored parents-to-be Kylie Jenner and Travis Scott, who were there in attendance on a double-date. Prior to that, Jenner and Griffin were spotted on another double hang-out in August, during which, it was said, Jenner was less than enthused about Griffin\u2019s affections. As this chapter of Kardashian-Jenner life comes to a close, we can go back to focusing on the A plot, aka Kylie Jenner\u2019s maybe pregnancy.\n\nRelated: Kendall Jenner Will Never Have Her Own
