Prior to airing, ABC hyped the show\u2019s landmark episode with a detailed oral history, clips of the cast reminiscing on the show\u2019s start and splashy promos that welcomed viewers to a \u201ctwisty parallel universe.\u201d The episode starts with Olivia, Fitz and Jake arguing over what to do with the show\u2019s latest shadow organization, but quickly switches gears and takes us back to the moment Fitz\u2019s campaign decided to steal the election. This time, however, Olivia stops the Defiance plan. Rather than advance the current plot, Scandal made the choice to reflect on the show\u2019s mythology and ask audiences: aren\u2019t we better off with Scandal, in all its soapy, trashy glory, than without it?\n\nIn a season that has relied far too heavily on flashbacks, it seemed like \u201cThe Decision\u201d would merely be another distraction\u2013\u2013an episode that would give the audience more insight into characters\u2019 motivations, but would ultimately be pointless. This is definitely the case. \u201dThe Decision\u201d exists entirely outside of this season\u2019s current plot. It\u2019s unnecessary fan service, but unlike most of Scandal\u2019s sixth season so far, it\u2019s entertaining fan service. Fitz and Olivia get married. Quinn escapes Olivia\u2019s orbit and remains Lindsay, the reality star. Huck never learns to shave. Abby and David stay together. Mellie and Cyrus get married. It\u2019s enjoyably over the top, but most importantly, the actual stories being told in this Alternate Scandal-land are boring.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt\u2019s fair to criticize Scandal\u2019s later seasons for losing focus on what made the show great. Olivia killed a man with a wheel chair. Characters suffer from weekly amnesia and magically alternate between all-knowing gods to idiots the second the plot calls for it. \u201cThe Decision\u201d is what Scandal looks like when it acts with a sense of logic that critics crave. It\u2019s the Scandal viewers are asking for when they roll their eyes and beg Olivia and Fitz to just get together or for Olivia to run as far as she can from the White House. It\u2019s the version of Scandal that exists when the show focuses on being realistic, rather than an insane mindfuck. And, well, it turns out that\u2019s not the Scandal we really want after all.\n\nIt turns out, Scandal really is better when it\u2019s careening through plots at a dangerous pace. Watching Olivia deal with Fitz\u2019s male fragility and insecurity isn\u2019t fun. While it\u2019s nice to see that Fitz is still the worse in any timeline, I\u2019d rather have Fitz in the Oval than on a crappy political talk show. Instead of taking tacky selfies in front of portraits before being dismissed, I\u2019d rather have Olivia and her amazing coats gliding through the halls of the White House; solving impossible problems. In its 100th episode, Scandal sets the haters straight. The show will never be the procedural it was in season one and it should be celebrated for the joyride that it is. Because, well, the joyride is better than Olivia and crew fighting to pass bills while enjoying weekly screenings of a Bachelor parody.\n\nSo, after 100 episodes filled with murder, kidnapping and treason, \u201dThe Decision\u201d lets us appreciate exactly where the show is coming from. Scandal is a show that has played with our expectations for six seasons now. What started as a complicated exploration of a strong, educated black woman out to save the world has become an imbalanced look at the convoluted ideas of power, justice and truth. Scandal isn\u2019t a world where a black woman needs to be gifted with strength or a magic intuition that allows her to always know what\u2019s right in order to succeed. In fact, Scandal exists in an alternate reality already. A reality where a black woman can be messy and wrong. One where an openly gay man can be Vice President or Chief of Staff without America\u2019s entire political system collapsing. One where Fitz and Mellie are somehow Republicans who fight for gun control and Planned Parenthood.\n\nWhile I\u2019ve certainly had my complaints, I\u2019d rather be entertained by Scandal\u2019s actual alternate reality than the one logical one presented in \u201cThe Decision.\u201d Fitz may tell Olivia that she was right to stop the Defiance plan at the end of the episode, but I disagree. Thank you, Olivia Pope, for taking us to hell and back over the course of 100 episodes. Scandal may have gone off the rails awhile ago, but the scenery is a lot more interesting out here.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nStray Observations\n\nI love that alternate reality Olivia Pope has natural hair. Of course she can\u2019t afford those weekly perms.\n\nObviously, the best way to know if it was wrong or right to steal the election would be to see how the actual American people fared under Fitz. In Real Scandal-land, we never see normal citizens reacting positively to Fitz\u2019s administration, but people love him as a talking head in Alternate Scandal-land. Olivia is even working on legislation that would actually help people in Alternate Scandal-land. While the citizens of Real Scandal\u2019s America might be suffering, it\u2019s entertaining for us.\n\nCyrus and Mellie getting married was so unnecessary and over the top. I do like that it makes it clear that neither Cyrus or Mellie should be president in any timeline. I loved seeing James again, though. RIP James.\n\nI guess Marcus has replaced Harrison\u2019s entire presence in Scandal and Olivia\u2019s history.\n\nQuinn as a reality star was hilarious and enjoyable. I love that Huck still loved her in the show.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re certainly not screwing me, not in the way I like at least\u201d - FITZ, YOU ARE AWFUL IN EVERY TIMELINE.\n\nABC only released two press photos with this episode. I am sharing them here because they are hilarious (if you couldn\u2019t tell, I really hate Fitz):\n\n", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,fl_progressive,g_center,h_264,q_80,w_470/b79608df135ebc4b059a2cdad3a83176.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/kqnkjlylkf7tymsqmoqr.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/52a29fe0001de9a08e76ea6d559528e9.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/u0939doeuioaqhspkjyc.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/j59upeyynundqjvbmcwj.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/v4sckews2f3bzf0ztbkf.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/aqhdzcldymb9mkltfhxh.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/rnxqtvv6advgidzfs6am.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f2b6295902a8e0a7c4d168840e7b3d51.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/eti2h1r4wg0bqxctxenl.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/muaaluj2wznfomol9ero.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.avclub.com/at-100-episodes-scandal-asks-to-be-embraced-for-the-so-1798191234", "title": "At 100 episodes, Scandal asks to be embraced for the soapy mess that it is", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "keywords": "TV, Scandal, Recap, The A.V.
