But their array of fragrances with sweet, fruity, and floral notes is not something that you can miss out on. The best Victoria\u2019s Secret perfumes evoke something unique in your personality type. They offer a wide range of fragrance mists that suits everyone. However, choosing a perfume that matches your preferences can be puzzling. So, we have carefully picked a list of products that will definitely lift your spirit. Check out our list of the 15 best Victoria\u2019s secret perfumes with enchanting fragrances. Keep scrolling!\n\nBest Victoria\u2019s Secret Perfumes For Women \u2013 2022\n\n1. Best Overall: Bombshell Eau de Parfum\n\nThe best seller amongst Victoria\u2019s Secret line of perfumes, Bombshell is a fruity floral scent also known as the \u2018LBD of Fragrance\u2019. The perfume contains notes of Purple Passion Fruit, Shangri-La Peony and Vanilla Orchid that combine to give you a fragrance which is the perfect blend of flowers and fruits.\n\nPros\n\nNot overpowering\n\nPleasant fruity notes, suitable for people of all ages\n\nCons\n\nDoes not last long\n\nBombshell Eau de Parfum Review\n\nKick-starting this list for today is everybody\u2019s eternal favorite from the Victoria\u2019s Secret Collection\u2014the Bombshell Eau de Parfum. With notes of Purple Passion Fruit, Shangri-La Peony and Vanilla Orchid, Bombshell is a subtle pleasure to the senses which very, very few perfumes have come close to in my humble opinion (Ferragamo\u2019s Incanto Shine being one of them). This pleasant fruity floral scent comes with no limits on what ages may or may not use it and is a hit with young girls and women alike for not being too overpowering. Also, thanks to the fact that it isn\u2019t what one would call a \u2018statement perfume\u2019, there are no restrictions on what time of the day, or in what sort of crowd one can use this perfume making it a winner all the way. My only complaint with this perfume is that it doesn\u2019t stay on for as long as one would\u2019ve liked, requiring constant reapplication. But if that doesn\u2019t pose a problem to you, Bombshell is one perfume that should definitely make it to your shopping list this season. To get a better understanding of this fragrance, check out this video on YouTube.\n\n2. Best For Mature Women: Heavenly Eau de Parfum\n\nA warm and ethereal scent that Victoria\u2019s Secret describes as \u2018an angel favorite\u2019, Heavenly Eau de Parfum combines notes of White Musk, Sandalwood, Vanilla and White Peony that make it an award winning favorite.\n\nPros\n\nStrikes a good balance between floral and fruity\n\nLasts long\n\nLight, pleasant fragrance\n\nCons\n\nMature fragrance\u2014better suited to grown-up women\n\nVanilla tones might be overpowering for some\n\nHeavenly Eau de Parfum Review\n\nFor women who\u2019d like Victoria\u2019s secret bestseller that has no hint of floral or fruity in it, here\u2019s Heavenly to the rescue. A bestseller since its launch, this particular fragrance has undergone a revamp in recent times to make it more appealing to the new generation, though thankfully it\u2019s intrinsic tones have remained the same. The new Heavenly now comes in a bottle that has angel wings on the cap and is embellished with tiny crystals\u2014an ode to their VS angel fashion show? That\u2019s what I\u2019m assuming too. But a nice touch nonetheless. Coming to the fragrance itself, I find that the notes of White Musk, Sandalwood, Vanilla and White Peony lend it a striking warm essence that to me speak elegance and sensuality. In fact, the sandalwood and musk, in addition to giving Heavenly a distinctly musky flavor, also lend to its longevity that Bombshell lacks, thus making it perfect for long term wear. As a woman trying to make a subtle yet defining impression, there could hardly be a better scent than this. Keep in mind though, that this fragrance might be better suited to grown-up women than teenagers.\n\nNOTE- Image used for representation is a special edition bottle.\n\n3. Best Mild Fragrance: Love Spell Eau de Toilette\n\nFrom the Secret Garden Collection, Love Spell gives you the feeling of wearing flowers on your face all day, every day. Suitable for people who dislike using perfumes. Available as Eau de Toilette, Mist and Body Lotion only.\n\nPros\n\nSuitable for people who dislike wearing strong perfumes\n\nSummer friendly\n\nLasts long\n\nMild fragrance\n\nCons\n\nNot available as Eau de Parfum\n\nLove Spell Eau de Toilette Review\n\nOkay, so let me begin with an advisory\u2014Love Spell isn\u2019t a perfume in the traditional sense. With hints of Peach, Cherry Blossom, and White Jasmine, the Victoria\u2019s Secret Love Spell is more an Eau de Toilette than an Eau de Parfum*. This makes Love Spell mild and refreshing, and a perfect pick for someone who finds regular perfumes too overpowering to wear on a daily basis. On the flip side though, the scent here may not last as long as in EDPs as the concentration is not as intense. That said, I found the Victoria\u2019s Secret Love Spell to be a fantastic EDT that keeps you smelling of flowers for a good number of hours before requiring any sort of retouch. Considering the summers in this country, Love Spell, in particular, is a great summery fragrance from VS. I carried it along for a family vacation to the seaside recently, and I must compliment its no-fuss bottle that avoids any kids of spillage, and an easy to use spray nozzle that made for great travel-friendly packaging. An additional half star just for that.\n\n* The concentration of the perfume oil in an EDT is less (5-9%) than in an EDP (8-14%).\n\n4. Best For All Ages: So In Love Eau de Parfum\n\nBack by popular demand, Victoria\u2019s Secret So In Love perfume is a mesmerizing fragrance that imparts a sheer, fresh floral bliss to the wearer, and is a fragrant ode to the timeless allure of love. Winner of the FiFi Award for Fragrance of the Year (Women\u2019s Private Label/Direct Sell), 2006.\n\nPros\n\nFloral scent, without being too sweet\n\nBack on popular demand\n\nSuitable for all ages\n\nCons\n\nNot available easily\n\nSo In Love Eau de Parfum Review\n\nSeems like Victoria\u2019s Secret can do no wrong when it comes to the fragrance market. Another scent that was brought back purely due to customer demand, Victoria\u2019s Secret \u2018So In Love\u2019 is a timeless classic that can be worn by women of any age with ease. With undertones that I particularly love\u2014rose, violet leaves, cognac, jasmine, honey, and ylang-ylang- this a floral fragrance that is pleasant without being too sweet. Call it an ode to my name or whatever, but I find that I am very partial to perfumes with an essence of roses and So In Love is no exception. Despite the honey tones that sweeten the deal, the cognac warms it up just the right amount to maintain its beautiful essence of roses. In the years since its launch, So In Love has found a niche group of loyalists who swear by it for its non-fruity non-chemical fragrance, including yours truly. Wear it on a first date, or a day out with your partner, for setting the perfect mood. You might want to thank me later!\n\n5. Best Spicy Fragrance: Rapture Eau de Cologne\n\nGet ready to be hit with the right chords of nostalgia with the Victoria\u2019s Secret Rapture Eau de Cologne. It was launched in 1992 and has been retired and relaunched many times now. It combines the unique notes of orange blossom, amber, citruses, and jasmine, to offer women a rejuvenating fragrance that is spicy yet pleasant.\n\nPros\n\nLong-lasting\n\nAmber spicy fragrance\n\nCons\n\nAvailability issues\n\nRapture Eau de Cologne Review\n\nLet me warn you \u2013 Rapture is like no other fragrance from Victoria\u2019s Secret. The spiciness of the scent is here to create a spell on you. The cologne opens with the notes of orange blossom and citruses, blending into the heart notes of jasmine, Bulgarian rose, and freesia to give you a heavenly fragrance. The base notes of amber, heliotrope, vanilla, and musk again rule the traces of the whole perfume, making you stand out in the crowd like never before. You can check out this YouTube video for a brief review of this perfume.\n\n6. Best Long-Lasting: Candy Rocks Body Mist\n\nWild meets sweet in this coveted fragrance by Victoria\u2019s Secret infused with sugared watermelon, which is sweet yet wild. It contains conditioning aloe to let you love your skin while feeling like you\u2019re in candy store.\n\nPros\n\nFruity fragrance\n\nLong-lasting\n\nCons\n\nNone\n\nCandy Rocks Body Mist Review\n\nWho doesn\u2019t love fruits and candies? There\u2019s always a child hidden in us that wishes to run across a candy street, wild and free. This body mist from Victoria\u2019s Secret is a reminiscence of childhood. It takes you down memory lane and is perfect to be worn any time of the day. The fruity fragrance is rejuvenating and uplifting in a heartbeat. The warm and wild scents are a mixture of both worlds. It can be ideal wear for a casual hangout during the day or early evening.\n\n7. Best Strong Fragrance: Bombshell New York Eau de Parfum\n\nAn ode to the energy of the world\u2019s most famous city, Bombshell New York is a fragrance inspired by the flowers of the night, bottled exclusively for the sexy and glamorous\n\nPros\n\nStrong without being overpowering\n\nLasts long\n\nEdgier variant of the Bombshell line\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret Bombshell New York Perfume Review\n\nWhat\u2019s better than one very good thing? Two very good things, of course! Just like yours truly, VS couldn\u2019t seem to get enough of Bombshell either me thinks and that\u2019s how Bombshell New York happened. Because similar to Bombshell, Bombshell New York too is a fruity floral scent, albeit with an edge. Carrying undertones of Starfruit, Twilight Jasmine and Madagascar Vanilla, I\u2019m pegging this fragrance as a mature variant of Bombshell, better suited to women looking to make a statement. Another way it scores over the original Bombshell is that the shorter staying power of Bombshell seems to have been corrected here making Bombshell New York an absolute winner. Use it a couple of times to know why I\u2019m calling it that, and why you\u2019ll never want to step out of the house again without wearing it. No cons for this little baby here, only tonnes of love. Check out this YouTube video to learn more about this signature fragrance.\n\n8. Best Sweet Fragrance: Wicked Eau de Parfum\n\nAn edgy, dark twist on the original Crush fragrance with some absolutely delish notes like Freesia, Black sugar and Tahitian Vanilla, Victoria\u2019s Secret Wicked is a warm perfume meant for the 99% angel.\n\nPros\n\nSuitable for wear by everyone\n\nLasts long\n\nGreat dry down\n\nSweet fragrance neither floral nor fruity\n\nCons\n\nThe sweetness may be overpowering for some\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret Wicked Perfume Review\n\nSo, I have a real feeling that the noses involved in creating Wicked were on a sugar rush that particular day coz Wicked is hands down one of the sweetest fragrances from Victoria\u2019s Secret collection. With notes of Freesia, Black Sugar and Tahitian Vanilla, the VS Wicked is a fragrance that can be a real hit or miss with users. Personally, I feel that if you\u2019re looking for something that is neither too floral nor too fruity, you\u2019re going to love Wicked for what it is. A mostly vanilla sweet smell, it is rescued by just the right amount of floral tones that give it a nice warmth. Of all the VS perfumes I have tried in the past, I particularly love the dry down here (the smell that lingers after the initial notes have worn off) for its distinct smell that is never too floral, or fruity, or musky, but a happy blend of all three. Great job by VS at trying to create something different from their regular collection. Do bear in mind though that the strong sweet notes have put off a user occasionally, which is why you\u2019d be well advised to try it for yourself before buying it. I\u2019m going to go with 4 stars for this one.\n\n9. Best Fruity Fragrance: Night Eau de Parfum\n\nInspired by midnights in Paris, Victoria\u2019s Secret \u2018Night\u2019 is a warm, sparkling fragrance that makes for the perfect provocation to both\u2014your senses, and to the ones around you. Combines notes of Black Plum, Velvet Woods and Luscious Apple amongst others,\n\nPros\n\nFruity\n\nSubtle fragrance\n\nCons\n\nDoes not last long\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret Night Perfume Review\n\nFirst things first, Victoria\u2019s Secret \u2018Night\u2019 looks absolutely gorgeous lying on the vanity. The black, rhinestone studded bottle speaks for itself as the perfect accompaniment to a mature, sensual lady. In fact, that was pretty much my sole reason for buying it. With notes of Black Plum, Velvet Woods and Luscious Apple, Victoria\u2019s Secret Night makes for a distinct signature that makes the wearer instantly recognizable wherever she goes. If you\u2019re someone looking for a subtle fragrance that heralds your presence in a gathering, Night is the perfume for you. On the flip side though, the perfume doesn\u2019t last too long which is a bummer. Also, the name \u2018Night\u2019 might just be a misnomer as the perfume doesn\u2019t have any particularly bold or edgy notes to it that speak for the night. Instead, it\u2019s a floral scent that is comparable with a lot of other perfumes from VS. To review it in one sentence, I\u2019d probably say that I like it, but I\u2019m not sure if I\u2019d buy it again. Three and a half stars from me.\n\nImmerse yourself in the magic of Victoria\u2019s Secret new fruity floral fragrance that takes sexy to a whole new level. With notes of Black Peony, Raspberry Liqueur and Praline, Scandalous is one fragrance that women of all ages would love to wear.\n\nPros\n\nWarm, floral dry down\n\nSuitable for all ages\n\nFruity floral fragrance\n\nCons\n\nBody mist better than the perfume\n\nDoes not last long\n\nScandalous Eau de Parfum Review\n\nWith the stunningly sensual Jasmine Tookes as the face of this perfume, Scandalous has one thing to say, and it says out loud\u2014if you\u2019re looking to slay, this is the perfume to do it with. A fruity floral scent a la Bombshell, Scandalous has undertones of Black Peony, Raspberry Liqueur and Praline, a distinct combination that makes for a distinct signature too. An essentially fruity-floral fragrance (VS seems to have cornered the market on this segment), it has a beautiful dry down that gave me just the right hit of floral notes. However, I must admit that I didn\u2019t care much to stock up on it because, though it\u2019s a great scent, I find it comparable to a lot of other VS perfumes that I already own and must do away with before I get another. Its effect doesn\u2019t last long either which is why a couple of friends I know seem to prefer the body mist over the perfume as a cheaper alternative. That said, it is suitable for women of all ages, and if you\u2019re on the lookout to shake things up a bit while still sticking to the floral-fruity theme, Scandalous should be your go-to perfume.\n\nA zany mix of floral and spice, Victoria\u2019s Secret \u2018Crush\u2019 is a young, fresh scent that bottles the feeling of being addicted to someone.\n\nPros\n\nSweetness isn\u2019t too overpowering\n\nCitrus base\n\nSummer go-to\n\nA youthful, fresh scent\n\nCons\n\nSeasonal perfume\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret Crush Perfume Review\n\nChanneling a whole lot of pink and a whole lot of cute in its packaging, Crush is Victoria\u2019s Secret offering for youngsters, and for the young at heart. With notes of Pink Peppercorn, Treasure Peony and Ashok flower, Crush takes you on a frosting filled trip to wonderland right from the first spritz. What I like best about this fragrance is that though sweet and high on its own \u2018youthfulness\u2019, at no point is the sweetness too overpowering an attack on the senses. With a warm, citrus base, Crush makes for the perfect summer scent and considering I live in a tropical country, it comes in handy pretty much all year round. But that very seasonality is also a bane as people who live in colder areas might not find it much to their liking. So, do keep that in mind before you go out shopping for this one.\n\nP.S.- I bought this perfume for my niece last Christmas, and I don\u2019t think I could\u2019ve chosen any better. This is why I now nominate Crush as the perfect gift for female members of your family this festive season too. Do let me know how that fares!\n\nDesigned as the consummate flirt, Victoria\u2019s Secret Tease is the result of what happens when a seductress meets a coquette\u2014a fragrance that is the ultimate in the art of seduction.\n\nPros\n\nBeautifully packaged\n\nNot harsh on the skin\n\nWarm scent\n\nCons\n\nLongevity is terrible\n\nNot travel-friendly\n\nNot suited to all age groups\n\nTease Eau de Parfum Review\n\nThere isn\u2019t a single thing I dislike about how Tease looks sitting on my vanity, a boudoir inspired fragrance that is an instant throwback to the parlors of France. The fishnet and lace packaging on the bottle coupled with the hot pink atomizer makes for some truly attractive packaging that I fell in love with at first glance. Full marks to whoever came up with the design for this little baby. As for the fragrance itself, combining notes of Black Vanilla, Frozen Pear and Blooming Gardenia, I find that coming to Victoria\u2019s Secret collection at least, this fragrance truly is the ultimate \u2018tease\u2019. A warm scent that I feel is better carried off by grown women, the major downer with this fragrance is its longevity. At barely an hour or two of staying power, Tease hardly lasts you for even a quarter of a day which is a shame as it has a pleasant dry down that I liked smelling for whatever little time it lasted. If longevity isn\u2019t a concern you have, Tease might just make another great gift this festive season, this time for the ladies of your family.\n\nSeduction in a bottle, Victoria\u2019s Secret Very Sexy has been a crowd favorite right since its launch in the early 2000s. A \u2018spicy\u2019 scent, it combines notes of Vanilla Orchid, Sun-drenched Clementine and Midnight Blackberry.\n\nPros\n\nSpicy fragrance\n\nArousing (as reported by users)\n\nCons\n\nNot for regular wear\n\nStrong scent, to be used with a light hand\n\nVery Sexy Eau de Parfum Review\n\nHonest to heaven, I\u2019d like to tip my hat to whoever at Victoria\u2019s Secret came up with this fragrance. A strong, spicy scent that has undertones of Vanilla Orchid, Sun-drenched Clementine and Midnight Blackberry, Very Sexy hasn\u2019t been taken off the shelves since its launch in the 2000s. Imagine! But smell it once, and it isn\u2019t too hard to understand why, as Very Sexy has a delectable peppery fragrance that exudes a strong come-hither scent which is difficult to resist, and (reportedly) is a crowd favorite with boyfriends and husbands alike. Be careful to use it with a light hand though as it is a strong perfume. Not suitable for regular wear either.\n\nThis body mist is a combination of fruits fresh at the market, evoking a memory of a vivid summer afternoon. With the infusion of essential oils, the mist keeps you smelling and your skin feeling sunny and bright.\n\nPros\n\nFresh fruity fragrance\n\nSummer fragrance\n\nCons\n\nNone\n\nBerry Pop Body Mist Review\n\nDespite being a summer fragrance, Berry Pop Body Mist will have your heart all year round. With the amalgamation of the beautiful frozen strawberry, pink hibiscus, and amber crystals as its notes, the scent gives you fresh-juice feels that not only quenches your skin\u2019s thirst but also provokes your senses gently. This body mist is a fond fragrance to remember someone as it would bring back pleasant moments of joy, fun, and all things sunny. Wear this sweet-smelling scent for a day out with your girls or for a picnic with your family, and see yourself blush as the compliments pour in.\n\nThis fragrance is as light as air and is so captivating that it makes you impossible to forget. It gives a little remembrance of him that smells seductive on you.\n\nPros\n\nLong-lasting\n\nFresh flowery fragrance\n\nCons\n\nNone\n\nLove Fragrance Mist Review\n\nLove Fragrance Mist is a beloved fragrance from the family of Victoria\u2019s Secret. Infused with the notes of fresh air flowers, this scent is delicate yet heavenly. This elegant and sophisticated scent is ideal for all occasions. Its soft flowery fragrance adds to the simplicity of your overall personality. If you want to speak for less is more, Love Fragrance Mist should be your best bet for all times.\n\n*Subject to Availability\n\nGive us a yay or nay in the comments below, we\u2019ll be waiting to hear from you.\n\nVictoria\u2019s Secret is a must-try if you love trying unique fragrances.
