A family spokesperson told The Desert Sun that Caruso suffered a heart attack in the early morning.\n\n\u201cThere are no words for the loss of mom. Thank u for the incredible outpouring of love. It helps,\u201d Daly, 44, tweeted on Monday. \u201cPlease hug the ones you love most tonight.\u201d\n\nDaly\u2019s TODAY colleagues announced the sad news Monday on-air, one day after The Voice won the 2017 Emmy for outstanding reality competition series.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re sorry to start this hour with some sad news,\u201d Savannah Guthrie began. \u201cOur thoughts and our prayers are going out to Carson and his family over the sudden passing of his mom, Pattie.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe spoke to him, and he wanted to share this message with all of you,\u201d said Matt Lauer before reading a statement from Daly.\n\n\u201cIt is with heavy hearts that we announce the passing of our mother, wife, grandmother, Pattie Daly Caruso,\u201d the statement reads. \u201cShe passed away peacefully on Sunday, Sept. 17. Kiki, as she was known to her grandchildren and many others, touched so many lives with her kindness, her giant spirit and her love of life. She\u2019ll be terribly missed by her family and the world, but her spark will shine for eternity.\u201d\n\n\u201cCarson, we are so sorry,\u201d Lauer said. \u201cOur thoughts are with you and your family.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat a devoted and loving son Carson is,\u201d Guthrie added. \u201cPattie was just a force, and our love is with him.\u201d\n\nDaly Caruso\u2019s independent interview show, Valley Views, ran for more than 25 years and was reportedly the longest-running television show in the Coachella Valley. She interviewed a range of celebrities, including President Donald Trump, Barbara Sinatra, Arnold Palmer and more.\n\nDaly previously opened up about his mother\u2019s influence on him in 2013.\n\n\u201cI think having a strong parent has just been such an inspiration,\u201d the father of three said. \u201cBecause it\u2019s a constant reminder for me to find my own pillar of strength and to be that for my own growing family.\u201d\n\nDaly\u2019s wife Sirialso commemorated the family\u2019s loss.\n\n\u201cHeartbroken,\u201d she wrote on Instagram.\n\n\u201cMy O\u2019Mo, as I called her (\u2018other mother\u2019), was a vibrant force in my life,\u201d she continued. \u201cI feel her presence today and will forever. Carson and I appreciate your love and support.\u201d", "images":
