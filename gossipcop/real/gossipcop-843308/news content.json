But why did Hawn leave Hollywood in the first place? In a new interview with daughter Kate Hudson, Hawn finally reveals why she bowed out of the industry after making 2002\u2019s The Banger Sisters.\n\n\u201cI believe that life is about doing,\u201d Hawn explained to Hudson in a conversation for Interview magazine, after being asked the million-dollar question. \u201cIt\u2019s about changing. It\u2019s about transitioning. I can\u2019t imagine, as a human being, not being able to grow. When I turned 50, I asked some of my girlfriends, all actresses of the same age, \u2018What are we going to do now?\u2019\n\n\u201cI wanted to go live somewhere for a while, learn archaeology, or take part in healing the world on some level,\u201d Hawn continued. \u201cI wanted to dig deep and say, \u2018Who am I now? What do I have to offer? What do I have to learn?\u2019 I started learning about the brain, psychology. And after 9/11, I decided, \u2018I know what I\u2019m going to do.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBut Hawn wasn\u2019t going to act or produce\u2014she was going to create in an entirely different way.\n\n\u201cI ended up writing two books and creating MindUP,\u201d Hawn says, citing the international educational organization for children she founded. \u201cIt\u2019s now in Jordan, Serbia, the U.K., America, Canada, Hong Kong. I never looked back. I never wished to be acting again. I was so engaged.\u201d\n\n(In a previous interview with Yahoo, Hawn also suggested that she had no interest in waiting around for Hollywood offers either: \u201cEvery woman hits a certain age; every woman has to face it. That\u2019s the way it goes, and I really am not a sit-around-and-wait-for-the-phone-to-ring person.\u201d)\n\nIn 2016, Schumer confessed that it took her several years to convince Hawn to take a role in the mother-daughter comedy she had written.\n\n\u201cI met her on an airplane a couple of years ago and told her there\u2019s a movie I really want to make with her,\u201d Schumer told the Los Angeles Times. \u201cAnd she was very nice. \u2018O.K., honey.\u2019 She probably thought I was a psycho. . . . Then I\u2019d meet her at different things, saying, \u2018We\u2019re making this movie together,\u2019 and I think, eventually, some people got in her ear and told her I wasn\u2019t crazy, that I make things.\u201d\n\nIn her conversation with Hudson, Hawn also reflected on how the industry changed while she was still acting in film, and the one movie star who is not having any of this television business.\n\n\u201cThe business was changing while I was in it,\u201d Hawn reflected. \u201cConglomerates were coming in, starting to buy studios. Now it\u2019s all about being on the stock market, building amusement parks. Videotapes started back then, and I remember Jack Nicholson saying, \u2018I\u2019m never going to be on one of those small screens!\u2019 And I thought, Dude, I don\u2019t think we have a choice!\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62100dc174854b6731411914/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined",
