David Becker/Getty Images\n\nSteve Harvey's daytime talk show is a lighthearted variety show of family-friendly jokes and relationship advice, but the comedian was running his team under a list of draconian demands.\n\nOn Wednesday, veteran Chicago media reporter Robert Feder published a leaked email from Harvey to his talk show team that included rules like, \"Do not open my dressing room door. IF YOU OPEN MY DOOR, EXPECT TO BE REMOVED.\" and, \"I want all the ambushing to stop now.\"\n\nHarvey confirmed the authenticity of the email with Entertainment Tonight's Kevin Frazier on Thursday, and told him, \"I don't apologize about the letter, but it's kind of crazy what people who took this thing and ran, man.\" He added that \"in hindsight, I probably should've handled it a little bit differently,\" given that its brutal tone made it go viral.\n\n\"The Steve Harvey Show\" team wrapped its final day of production in Chicago on Thursday, after five seasons in the city. The show is relaunching as a more celebrity-centric series called \"Steve\" and will be shot in Los Angeles. Feder reported that \"most if not all\" of the 80 people who worked for Harvey in Chicago would be out of a job when the first iteration of his show ended.\n\nSources told Radar Online last week that Harvey did not give staffers an opportunity to follow him to the new show, and did not give them much notice of the change.\n\nHarvey told ET's Frazier that he had lost control of his staff ahead of Season 5, and that's why he sent the email Feder published. \"I've always had a policy where, you know, you can come and talk to me \u2014 so many people are great around here, but some of them just started taking advantage of it,\" he said.\n\nThe full leaked email is below, and you can read Feder's analysis and more details at his blog:\n\n\"Good morning, everyone. Welcome back.\n\nI'd like you all to review and adhere to the following notes and rules for Season 5 of my talk show.\n\nThere will be no meetings in my dressing room. No stopping by or popping in. NO ONE.\n\nDo not come to my dressing room unless invited.\n\nDo not open my dressing room door. IF YOU OPEN MY DOOR, EXPECT TO BE REMOVED.\n\nMy security team will stop everyone from standing at my door who have the intent to see or speak to me.\n\nI want all the ambushing to stop now. That includes TV staff.\n\nYou must schedule an appointment.\n\nI have been taken advantage of by my lenient policy in the past. This ends now. NO MORE.\n\nDo not approach me while I\u2019m in the makeup chair unless I ask to speak with you directly. Either knock or use the doorbell.\n\nI am seeking more free time for me throughout the day.\n\nDo not wait in any hallway to speak to me. I hate being ambushed. Please make an appointment.\n\nI promise you I will not entertain you in the hallway, and do not attempt to walk with me.\n\nIf you're reading this, yes, I mean you.\n\nEveryone, do not take offense to the new way of doing business. It is for the good of my personal life and enjoyment.\n\nThank you all,\n\nSteve Harvey\"", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5914d41a1442931f008b49a1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://i.insider.com/58d3dca9d349f97b098b52d3?width=1280&height=866&format=jpeg&auto=webp", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5914d41a1442931f008b49a1?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Richard Feloni"], "canonical_link": "https://www.businessinsider.com/steve-harvey-doesnt-apologize-for-staff-rules-2017-5", "title": "Steve Harvey said he doesn't apologize for his brutal staff rules, which include 'do not attempt to walk with me' and 'do not wait in any hallway to speak to me'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Steve Harvey said he doesn't apologize for his brutal staff rules, which include 'do not attempt to walk with me' and 'do not wait in any hallway to speak to me'", "datePublished": "2017-05-11T21:35:35Z", "dateModified": "2017-05-11T21:48:31Z", "news_keywords": "Steve Harvey, Management, Richard Feloni", "description": "Steve Harvey ran his daytime show according to a strict set of rules.
