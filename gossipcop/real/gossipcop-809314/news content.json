News of her dad\u2019s recovery in a new interview published on Saturday, September 1. \u201cHe\u2019s doing good now and feeling good. I\u2019m so happy he\u2019s healthy now.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly reported in November 2016 that Joe was diagnosed with prostate cancer earlier that year. He underwent surgery in September 2016.\n\nA source revealed to Us in February 2017 that the fashion photographer was beginning treatment for his condition. \u201cJoe just started radiation. He feels fine, he\u2019s getting through it and still working. It\u2019s all scheduled once a week. He\u2019s super optimistic,\u201d the insider said at the time. \u201cDoctors are hopeful that this will take care of it and be the last step, and he will hopefully then be in remission and cancer-free. Joe just says he feels like it\u2019s like going to get a checkup.\u201d\n\nAshlee\u2019s husband, Evan Ross, also spoke to E! about the family\u2019s trying time. \u201cIt was a really scary experience for Ashlee, for their whole family,\u201d the Hunger Games: Mockingjay actor, 30, said. \u201cSo for me I was just trying to make sure I was there and paying attention to how everyone was feeling.\u201d (The couple share daughter Jagger, 3, while the \u201cBoyfriend\u201d singer is also mom to 9-year-old son Bronx with ex-husband Pete Wentz.)\n\nNow that her father is doing better, Ashlee can focus on the future, which includes making music with her husband \u2026 and their children. Ross told Us in August that he and his wife \u201cwant to take the kids on the tour.\u201d She added: \u201cMake it a family thing.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ashlee-Simpson-Joe-Simpson-Prostate-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C14px%2C1333px%2C752px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ashlee-Simpson-Joe-Simpson-Prostate-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C6px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ashlee-Simpson-Joe-Simpson-Prostate-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C6px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ashlee-simpson-gives-update-on-joe-simpson-after-his-prostate-cancer-battle/", "title": "Ashlee Simpson Gives Update on Joe Simpson After His Prostate Cancer Battle", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ashlee Simpson gave an update on her father Joe Simpson\u2019s condition after his battle with prostate cancer \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ashlee Simpson Gives Update on Father Joe After His Battle With Prostate Cancer", "description": "Ashlee Simpson gave an update on her father Joe Simpson\u2019s condition after his battle with prostate cancer \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ashlee-simpson-gives-update-on-joe-simpson-after-his-prostate-cancer-battle/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-09-01T22:00:16+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ashlee-Simpson-Joe-Simpson-Prostate-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C6px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ashlee-Simpson-Joe-Simpson-Prostate-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C6px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-09-01T21:05:22+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-09-01T22:00:16+00:00"}, "author": "Erin Crabtree", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ashlee Simpson Gives Update on Father Joe After His Battle With Prostate Cancer", "description": "Ashlee Simpson gave an update on her father Joe Simpson\u2019s condition after his battle with prostate cancer \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Ashlee-Simpson-Joe-Simpson-Prostate-Cancer.jpg?crop=0px%2C6px%2C1333px%2C700px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535835922.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
