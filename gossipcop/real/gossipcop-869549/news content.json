She still asks for Halloween. It was so weird. Honestly, [she was] probably very lucky to do that.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Michael Simon for Chase\n\nThe Cravings: Hungry for More cookbook author revealed that she and Legend, 39, are \u201cestablishing traditions\u201d now that Luna is starting to get a firmer grasp on the meaning of the holiday.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just learning about Santa. I didn\u2019t even know if I wanted her to believe in Santa. \u2026 I had no idea which way I wanted to go with it,\u201d Teigen said. \u201cJohn and I are just like, \u2018I don\u2019t know, we\u2019ll figure it out when she asks, I guess.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s definitely a stressful time, but I think now that Thanksgiving is over we can really focus and hone in on Christmas and gift-giving and just being around family,\u201d she explained.\n\nThe proud mom said she\u2019s \u201cexcited to shop for\u201d Luna and her baby brother Miles Theodore, 6 months, because she can\u2019t wait to \u201csee them get excited about something\u201d \u2014 even though Miles\u2019 idea of a good time is pretty simple these days.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s excited about milk and that\u2019s it,\u201d Teigen joked, admitting \u201ceverything\u201d her family does over the holiday season is \u201cabout photos.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Merry Chrissy-mas!
