And there's one 90210 pal who knows exactly why the soap actress is definitely going to be missed.\n\n\"Well I can't even confirm whether I'm back, so there you go. But I know that a lot of people are gonna miss Eileen,\" Erika Girardi told The Daily Dish while out promoting her partnership with Beautyblender in NYC on Thursday.\n\nSo what is it that makes Eileen such a great BFF? Well, lucky for you, Erika explained all. \"Eileen is one of the most understanding, kind, and giving human beings I've ever met -- and what you see on TV is what you get,\" she said about her pal and sometimes The Young And The Restless co-star. \"She's lovely.\"\n\nEileen confirmed her RHOBH exit in July, in a statement to The Daily Dish: \"After a lot of careful thought, I've decided because of my crazy schedules at The Young and The Restless, as well as Days of Our Lives, it's best for me and my family if I step away from being a Housewife for now. But you never know, I might be popping in from time to time just to see what the ladies are up to! Thanks for your love and support guys!!!\"\n\nEileen joined RHOBH in Season 5, giving fans an inside look at her glam life as a soap star, as well as her marriage to actor Vincent Van Patten.\n\nCheck out the pals in action, below.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/faux_player__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/56/331/170321_3488612_Eileen_Davidson_Is_Taking_Retail_Therapy_to_.jpg?itok=fGV8fgoD", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/06/daily-dish-rhoa-after-show.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/07/daily-dish-rhobh-after-show.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/04/dish-042617-erika-jayne.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhop-candiace-dillard-chris.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhobh-garcelle-beauvais-movie.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhobh-kyle-richards-jamie-lee-curtis-halloween-ends-reunion.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhonj-dolores-catania-nana.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embed/public/field_blog_image/2017/04/dish-042817-erika-eileen.jpg?itok=zwJneuOO", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-kyle-cooke-tom-schwartz-divorce.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2021/05/bravocon-2021-announcement_0.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-072017-eileen-erika.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/08/daily-dish-real-girlfriends-in-paris-trailer.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/04/dish-041817-eileen-davidson.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/09/daily-dish-rhoslc-season-3-announcement_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/faux_player__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/796/926/170720_3555077_Erika_Girardi_Reacts_to_Eileen_Davidson_s_RH.jpg?itok=t7G8qLpf", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog_related_show_mobile/public/2022/07/rhobh_s12_bravotvshowtile_1200x1200.jpg?h=cd2a7045&itok=DNy-z4_3"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-072017-eileen-erika.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/eileen-davidson-exits-the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-erika-jayne-reacts", "title": "Eileen Davidson Exiting RHOBH: Erika Jayne Reacts", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1125013, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Erika Girardi Reacts to Eileen Davidson Exiting RHOBH\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_tv_shows\":\"The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\",\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/07\\/dish-072017-eileen-erika.jpg?itok=MZtIIkKm\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/07\\/dish-072017-eileen-erika.jpg?itok=2A394rQN\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/07\\/dish-072017-eileen-erika.jpg?itok=NqX2WGOs\"}}", "description": "Eileen Davidson confirmed earlier this month that she would not be returning to The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills for Season 8.
