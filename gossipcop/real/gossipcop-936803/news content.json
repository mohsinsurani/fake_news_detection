But in true \u201cSHIELD\u201d fashion, the shocks didn\u2019t stop there, as the episode then jumped ahead six months, revealing that Daisy was no longer with SHIELD, and Coulson (Clark Gregg) was no longer Director of the agency \u2014 with him and Mack (Henry Simmons) on the hunt for their former operative, who was traveling incognito and leaving a trail of seismic destruction in her wake. Elsewhere, Holden Radcliffe (John Hannah) was celebrating the \u201cbirth\u201d of his Artificial Intelligence creation AIDA, in the form of a Life Model Decoy \u2014 a concept that Marvel fans have been anticipating ever since the show debuted.\n\nVariety spoke to showrunners Jed Whedon and Maurissa Tancharoen about losing Lincoln and Ward/Hive, the future of FitzSimmons and what\u2019s ahead for the show in Season 4 following that time jump.\n\nBrett Dalton has certainly gone through the wringer over the past three seasons \u2013 with Hive being obliterated, are we finally losing him for good?\n\nTancharoen: In the Marvel universe, you can never say that you lose anyone for good; our entire series is centered around a man who was brought back from the dead. But we sustained Brett Dalton\u2019s character as an antagonist for the past three seasons and that\u2019s just a testament to how much we love and respect the actor as well as what he\u2019s given to the character. But as with everything, we don\u2019t want any story to ever lose steam; we don\u2019t want any character\u2019s arc to ever lose steam. We felt like we could give Grant Ward/Hive his glorious ending that he deserved, because Grant Ward essentially died halfway through Season 3, but we didn\u2019t want to let go. [Laughs.]\n\nWhedon: We definitely want to leave people wanting more \u2013 we don\u2019t want them to lose steam and we don\u2019t want anybody to get burnt out on people always turning up, but I think that by the end, you\u2019ll wish that he was around, which is our goal.\n\nTancharoen: It\u2019s never an easy decision to kill off any of our characters.\n\nWhedon: Unless the actors were pricks, which in this case they aren\u2019t, so that makes this very difficult. [Laughs.]\n\nIt was very poetic to see Daisy\u2019s two love interests go out in a blaze of glory together, at least visually, even if Ward\u2019s technically been gone for a while. Why did you decide to sacrifice Lincoln, out of all the possibilities?\n\nWhedon: The idea of sacrificing someone came up in talking about how to give Ward/Hive a glorious end. We didn\u2019t want it to be just a victory, because you feel connected to Ward and to Brett as an actor \u2013 he was the first person we ever shot on the pilot, and so we wanted to give him a sort of poetic and worthy death, so we started talking about someone making the true hero\u2019s sacrifice play, and in rattling around that idea, we landed on Lincoln because we find that there\u2019s something sort of beautiful about someone doing the truly heroic act because they don\u2019t believe that they\u2019re a hero. He thinks the other people need to stay around to do good, so he\u2019s doing it because he doesn\u2019t think he\u2019s a hero and in doing that, he becomes the ultimate hero. We loved that. And then there\u2019s obviously the connection to Daisy and the emotional impact it\u2019ll have on her, and the idea of him being a lost soul finally finding his purpose, all these things sort of led to [us thinking] it was the right thing to do for story, even though we like hanging out with Luke all the time.\n\nWhy did you decide to cap the finale off with a time jump rather than waiting until the Season 4 premiere?\n\nWhedon: We\u2019ve done a time jump each new season and so we just thought \u201chey, let\u2019s do it early!\u201d We thought it was a fun way to get people excited and also to see the way the game will change without knowing totally what all of it means.\n\nDaisy is back on her own again \u2013 why was it the right time to take her back out of SHIELD?\n\nTancharoen: When we first met Daisy, formerly Skye, she came from a place of isolation, so we\u2019re sort of returning her back to that point. She kept her distance from people; she grew up through the foster care system where she kept feeling like she was being either abandoned or hurting others, and in the events of our season finale and everything that led up to it, I think she has not only guilt but shame, so she has once again isolated herself.\n\nWhedon: But we also wanted to show that she did not curl up into a ball \u2013 she\u2019s clearly isolating herself, but also leaving a wake of destruction. And how much good she\u2019s doing as opposed to how much destruction she\u2019s causing, we\u2019ll wait and see, but I think you can tell from her interaction with the little girl that she\u2019s trying to make good on her promise to help Inhumans and trying to [honor] what Lincoln said when he said he believed she was meant for more than this \u2014 I think she\u2019s trying to honor his version of her.\n\nTancharoen: I think the audience can glean from that jump that we can have faith in the fact that she\u2019s still out there doing good work.\n\nWith Daisy out in the cold, will we see much of the Inhumans next year?\n\nWhedon: Yeah, we love all those characters.\n\nTancharoen: We now have a fairly sizeable group to call upon if we need them.\n\nThe last scene also introduced the concept of Life Model Decoys \u2013 there\u2019s obviously been a lot of speculation about that aspect of the Marvel universe since before the show even began, so why did it feel like now was right time to introduce them?\n\nWhedon: Partially, we\u2019ve been waiting on it because we knew what was coming in the second \u201cAvengers\u201d movie so we didn\u2019t want to hit that note before them. But it\u2019s also a progression of\u2026 this year our theme was \u201cAre you Inhuman?\u201d and dealing with humans without powers and how they react to people given powers, whether or not it ruins them or how that affects their humanity. So now our next progression is \u201cwhat\u2019s beyond humanity,\u201d and what if you can take those choices into your own hands \u2013 what will happen then?\n\nTancharoen: I think over the course of the three seasons, we\u2019ve been exploring what is possibly the next step in human evolution constantly, and with the introduction of Radcliffe as someone who\u2019s already exploring that next step. And it\u2019s also very much a part of our real world right now, body modification is a huge part of popular culture, so it\u2019s our way of opening up that world within the world of \u201cSHIELD.\u201d\n\nDoes that mean we can expect John Hannah to be a major presence in Season 4?\n\nTancharoen: Yeah, it would really be a bummer to see him just disappear. [Laughs.]\n\nIt sounds like we\u2019re also jumping into FitzSimmons finally being in an actual relationship \u2013 what will their dynamic be like next season?\n\nWhedon: Obviously, relationships are complicated, especially when you work within a spy organization. We hoped at the end of this year to put them in that position\u2026 one of the best things about FitzSimmons was hoping they would get together, and so when you put them together, you lose the hope that they will get together. We have to move on to a new thing and I think we\u2019re trying to give them a relationship that\u2019s based on a friendship, which is what we loved about them initially, but as they move forward, I think things will find themselves to be much more complicated than that.\n\nTancharoen: Our relationships on the show don\u2019t really fare very well. We have many examples, Coulson and Rosalind, May and Andrew, Daisy and Ward and Lincoln\u2026 but I think FitzSimmons always gives us hope in the ideal notion of romance and love\u2026 But don\u2019t hold on to that hope, ever, I think. [Laughs.]\n\nSince \u201cSHIELD\u201d spinoff \u201cMarvel\u2019s Most Wanted\u201d isn\u2019t going ahead, will we see Bobbi and Lance back next season?\n\nTancharoen: We adore those characters and we\u2019re always open to that possibility, but we can\u2019t say much on that subject right now.\n\nHow would you say this season\u2019s experiences have affected Coulson as a leader, and where does he go from here?\n\nWhedon: He made some decisions as Director that he regrets, and I think heavy is the head that wears the crown \u2013 he didn\u2019t enjoy being the one calling the shots and putting people in danger, even at the end, tried to take it all on himself. But now we see in the flashforward that he\u2019s no longer Director, so we\u2019re returning him, as we are with Daisy, a little bit to where we started. He\u2019s in the field as Agent Coulson; how that changes the game or changes how he operates, we\u2019ll have to wait and see.\n\nWhat did you think of the \u201cAgents of SHIELD\u201d Season 3 finale and what do you hope to see in Season 4?
