The stories of some of these celebrities are so inspiring but can also bring you to tears. When you see a rapper having several million dollars to their name it is close to a miracle considering the hustle and struggles of a normal rap artist from the streets to go all the way up. However making it to the top and staying at the top are two different things. Maybe it is these struggles that make rap artist acquire flashy stuff once they make it. Having proved to themselves that they can make it, they are not afraid to show the whole world what they got. Maybe.\n\nWhen you talk about money and rap there are those names that immediately come to mind, these are the likes of Dr. Dre, P. Diddy, Birdman among other.\n\nBelow are some of the top 10 richest rappers in the world in this year 2019:\n\n10. Snoop dogg \u2013 $135 million\n\nCalvin Cordozar Broadus Jr.\u2019s stage name is Snoop dog and he has stayed in the music industry for a long time. He has been selling a lot of records since the early 1990s and he is still doing great in the industry. He has refused to join the hall of fame and is still giving young rappers a run for their money. He has evolved with the industry and his music has many fans going back almost three decades. The truth is; Snoop is still making loads money from rapping and that is why he is on this list.\n\n9. Lil Wayne \u2013 $135 million\n\nDwayne Michael Carter Jr. Popularly known as Lil Wayne meaning: little Wayne. Little is a term that could be associated with his size but not his money. This heavily tattooed artist has had his fair share of drama while in the limelight ranging from a rumor about his death to a served jail term. He is one of the most resilient artists in the rap industry and most definitely among the richest. Dwayne is a very dynamic rap artist who is here to stay.\n\n8. O\u2019Shea Jackson \u2013 $140 million\n\nIf you are not keen, you are likely to miss him. He is highly organized and apart from doing music he is also an actor, a producer and a director just to name a few of his many talents. He has successfully managed to stay away from bad press for a long time (maybe it is because he is focused on making more money). It is hard to tell how he has managed to stay humble despite everything we know about him; from a gangster society to one of the richest rappers. Many people know him as Ice-cube.\n\n7. Eminem \u2013 $160 million\n\nEminem has defied every force against him and earned much respect in the rap industry. Rap is mainly associated with blacks but Marshall has levelled the field. He might have had little and/or no education but Eminem has a lot of money and is still making more! Like many others, his journey started in a humble slum \u2013 Detroit. He won the Grammy Award for having the Best Rap Album of the Year.\n\n6. Birdman \u2013 $170 million\n\nThe labels; Cash Money Brother and Big Tymers are his. Just like Snoop Dog, he has been in the industry for a long time. He is one of the most influential rappers of all time. Apart from music he is also a big time entrepreneur and I suppose that is where his big cash is flowing from. He might not have as many hits as the rest but he is still among the big fish.\n\n5. 50 Cent \u2013 $270 million\n\n50 Cent has been one of the most famous names in the rap industry and know we know for a fact that he has a lot of water. It is said that 50\u2019s wealth can be traced to shares he had with Vitamin Water which was bought by Coca-Cola making his share value to grow. He must have channeled his money to worth investments otherwise we would not have had him on this list of world\u2019s Wealthiest Rappers 2018.\n\n4. Master P- $350 million\n\nPercy Robert Miller is popularly referred to as Master P. Apart from being a very influential rapper Percy\u2019s money comes from owning a major record label. Over time, his worth has been growing exponentially. He has had a lot of solo hits such as the popular \u201cMake \u2018Em Say Ugh\u201d hit in 1997. He at one time also played basketball for NBA. He had quite a run in the game before finally quitting to focus on music.\n\n3. Jay-Z \u2013 $810 million\n\nWith over 75 million sold Jay-Z had one of the best artist selling history ever. No wonder he has so much money. In his record label, Roc Nation he still manages big names such as Rihanna and Kanye West which means more money. He doesn\u2019t stop there, he is still heavily invested in businesses. He recently purchased Armand de Brignac, a luxury champagne brand. He is also a family guy married to the one and only Beyonce Knowles. Need I say more!\n\n2. P.Diddy \u2013 $820 million\n\nSean Combs who is also known as Puff Daddy or P.Diddy or just Diddy apart from having many stage names he also has a lot of money. He is doing great both in music and in the business world. It is safe to say that the guy has is all figured out financially speaking. His new music TV station, Revolt TV, continues to make him more money as his net worth continues to grow.\n\n1. Dr. Dre. \u2013 $830 million\n\nDr. Dre\u2019s transaction involvement in the sale of Beats by Dre to apple ripped a large profit which gave him a major boost to where he is now financially. As the head of Aftermath Entertainment label which has big time clients such as Eminem and Busta Rhymes he must enjoy a lion\u2019s share of profits from the same. It is said that he is the George Foreman of the rap world.\n\nThe list above of world\u2019s Top 10 Wealthiest Rappers of the year 2019. The rap industry is affected by so many variable and the names an order in the list above keep changing from time to time due to the dynamic nature of the industry. Who knows?
