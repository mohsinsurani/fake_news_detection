Coming to grips with the idea that someone who is not related to you could possibly love you that much. She was it for me,\u201d Manganiello, 41, reveals.\n\n\u201cPeople say things like, \u2018Marriage and relationships are work.\u2019 But it\u2019s not. Life is hard. Having somebody to help you deal with it is the greatest thing that ever happened,\u201d the Magic Mike alum shares.\n\nManganiello also admits his past romances may have prepared him for what not to do in his current marriage. \u201cLooking back on the relationships I had before this, I think the universe was giving me some tough practice so I\u2019d get this right,\u201d he says.\n\nRELATED GALLERY: 14 Lessons on Love We\u2019ve Learned from Sofia & Joe\n\nCharley Gallay/Getty\n\nManganiello asked Vergara to marry him on Christmas Day 2014 after nearly six months of dating.

It\u2019s a story about redemption and put\u00adting your life back together,\u201d he tells the publication of Stano, the independent film he developed and produced and stars in with Vergara.\n\nManganiello previously gushed about his wife, telling PEOPLE in 2015: \u201cThe best part of getting married was not having to change anything. It was finding someone who complimented me perfectly.\u201d\n\nRampage, also starring Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson, hits theaters April 13.\n\nThe April issue of Cigar Aficionado is on newsstands now.", "images":
