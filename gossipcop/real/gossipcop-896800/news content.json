Though they have both worn some memorable ensembles, it looks like Markle may have had a bigger year than her royal sister-in-law when it comes to influencing the latest trends.\n\nBoth duchesses made it onto global fashion search platform Lyst's new ranking of the most powerful celebrity fashion influencers of the year, with Markle landing in a higher spot on the list than Middleton.\n\nThe list was generated by tracking more than 100 million searches and using sales data, page views, and social media mentions to determine each celebrity's influence. Kylie Jenner nabbed the top spot on the list, followed by her sister Kim Kardashian West.\n\nMarkle was found to be the third most popular celebrity fashion influencer of 2018\n\nBoat neck dresses have become one of Markle's signature styles.

Nigel Roddis/Getty Images\n\nAccording to Lyst's findings, Markle caused a huge spike in search traffic for certain brands and designs\n\nBoth Givenchy and Stella McCartney saw boosts in traffic following the royal wedding. People were also searching for \"boat neck\" and \"tuxedo dress\" designs.\n\nRead more: Meghan Markle keeps wearing dresses with the same neckline \u2014 and it's quickly becoming one of her signature looks\n\nSearches for Stella McCartney were up after Markle's wedding reception.

WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nMiddleton may have landed lower on the list than her new sister-in-law, but her influence is still going strong\n\nThe data showed that the bright pink Mulberry coat she wore in January inspired over 10,000 searches that month. The coat was actually first seen in 2014, proving that her penchant for outfit recycling still maintains its influence.\n\nRead more: 35 stunning looks Kate Middleton repeats again and again\n\nMiddleton's bright pink coat was a huge hit. Eamonn M. McCormack/Getty Images\n\nA Brand Finance survey from back in October named Middleton as the most popular royal influencer of the year, so results seem to vary based on the data. It's also worth noting that Middleton was out on royal maternity leave for much of the year after giving birth to Prince Louis in April, so she debuted fewer new looks than Markle.\n\nEither way, both duchesses seem to be providing fashion inspiration in their own way.\n\nVisit INSIDER's homepage for more.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1
