No one was hurt in the accident, but Barker's car was totaled.\n\nOn Saturday, he told E! News at Beautycon, \u201cYesterday, I was in a really bad car accident, but I came out unscathed, which is pretty awesome. My car is totaled but I pretty much walked away okay, which is awesome. A school bus ran a red light. It was insane. I have a really big 4x4 G-Wagon and if I wasn't in that, it might have been different, but it held up pretty well.\u201d\n\nLandon wrote on Instagram, \u201cLife's crazy...My dad, @carl.daw and I could have died today, our car was struck by school bus.. are car was Totaled.\u201d\n\nWaiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.\n\nTravis is still recovering from his blood clots, which forced Blink-182 to postpones their upcoming Las Vegas concert residency. He said, \u201cI have, I think, like 30 in my right hand in arm and I have about 10 in my left, so I'm just waiting for them to clear up. I'm on blood thinners.\"", "images": ["https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/93/5by6/2018/06/20/931a863428ec55c5ad9ff08dcd62bc50_md.jpeg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/11/3by2/2018/06/20/114c24895ec250a2a20e7409c14eb34e_xs.jpeg", "https://static.extratv.com/extra-web/img/logos/extra-logo-v2.png", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/60/4by3/2022/10/07/609f948ac97a464ea460ed19086acb24_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/a6/5by6/2022/09/09/a668e8a02bde4274977d780df2506122_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/aa/5by6/2022/08/26/aae10085192e4034a2105023f04d71e8_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/7e/4by3/2022/10/07/7ea99f398dcb4cc6a72b05e3dfc7c129_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/18/5by6/2022/09/22/18f361b5ab144b4086a3e24561052ccb_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/60/5by6/2022/08/28/602bb24ef12d43b3bcacc1290be6e214_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/25/4by3/2022/10/07/25e4ba86c254479abccbf93f17c28a8e_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/98/5by6/2021/09/20/98b7ee196b204af181d6233a7d0b8545_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/2b/5by6/2022/10/07/2b40d6fd2faa47ffa7c5148ddf775120_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/07/5by6/2022/10/02/07cc2ee5e2904451a36696585bc8b915_sm.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/41/3by2/2022/10/07/410ada150cbb4b8786541e98ba81fd6b_md.png", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/8d/16by9/2018/06/20/8d4604d30c635673af69290c6944b670_xl.jpeg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/c9/5by6/2022/10/07/c91dfa8bfa6d4a54970afc8b2a84ac24_md.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/a0/3by2/2018/03/19/a0d4639c8feb5d7483ea4d599531d43e_xs.jpg", "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/eb/4by3/2022/10/07/eb027b8c7cca437ba114f203989d10eb_sm.jpg"], "top_img": "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/8d/16by9/2018/06/20/8d4604d30c635673af69290c6944b670_xl.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://extratv.com/2018/07/16/travis-barker-survives-really-bad-crash-with-school-bus/", "title": "Travis Barker Survives \u2018Really Bad\u2019 Crash with School Bus", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "google-site-verification": "google56b059efc05e54d5.html", "robots": "index,follow", "description": "Travis Barker is lucky to be alive!", "fb": {"app_id": 18489729593, "pages": 26676834754}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Extra/"}, "og": {"site_name": "Extra", "type": "article", "url": "https://extratv.com/2018/07/16/travis-barker-survives-really-bad-crash-with-school-bus/", "title": "Travis Barker Survives \u2018Really Bad\u2019 Crash with School Bus", "description": "Travis Barker is lucky to be alive!", "image": "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/8d/16by9/2018/06/20/8d4604d30c635673af69290c6944b670_xl.jpeg"}, "twitter": {"site": "@extratv", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Travis Barker Survives \u2018Really Bad\u2019 Crash with School Bus", "description": "Travis Barker is lucky to be alive!", "image": "https://extra-images.akamaized.net/image/8d/16by9/2018/06/20/8d4604d30c635673af69290c6944b670_xl.jpeg"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "#0b1d2e", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "extratv.com", "application-name": "extratv.com", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "theme-color": "#0b1d2e", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://static.extratv.com/extra-web/icons/msapplication-tile-image-310x310-v1.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#0b1d2e", "msapplication-starturl": "https://extratv.com/?adid=IE9pin", "msapplication-navbutton-color": "#0b1d2e", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "Extra", "msapplication-task": "name=Photos;action-uri=https://extratv.com/photos/;icon-uri=https://static.extratv.com/extra-web/icons/favicon-32x32-v1.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531695600.0, "source": "http://extratv.com", "summary": ""}
