(April 21) AP\n\nQueen Elizabeth II is celebrating her 92nd birthday with a star-studded concert Saturday.\n\nThe concert will take place at Royal Albert Hall in London, and is set to feature contemporary artists as well as songs from classic musicals.\n\nTom Jones, Kylie Minogue, Sting and Shaggy, Shawn Mendes, Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Anne-Marie, Craig David and Donel Mangena as set to perform.\n\nThe world's longest-reigning living monarch will attend the concert, known as \"The Queen's Birthday Party,\" along with other members of the royal family.\n\nThe concert will benefit The Queen's Commonwealth Trust, youth charity for which the queen is patron.\n\nBuckingham Palace also announced Saturday that Prince Harry will serve as president of the trust. He is expected to speak at the concert for the first time in his new role, which will include leading tributes to his grandmother.\n\nEarlier in the day, honorary gun salutes were staged in Hyde Park, the Tower of London and the town of Windsor to mark the occasion.\n\nThe queen celebrates two birthdays every year: Her actual birthday on Apr. 21, which she usually marks privately with her family, and her \"official birthday\" in the summer. That usually falls on the second Saturday in June, when she joins the Trooping the Color military parade in central London.\n\nElizabeth's official birthday this year came on the tails of the Commonwealth Heads of Government meeting, which brought the leaders of the 53 Commonwealth countries together in England.\n\nThe queen has led the disparate group, made up of Britain and its former colonies, since she took the throne in 1952.\n\nContributing: The Associated Press", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5da312f1a23f159a2fe420777a080bcae3a03e0/c=0-268-3496-2243/local/-/media/2018/04/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636598994298158141-AP-Britain-Commonwealth.1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5774410065001_5774403852001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5da312f1a23f159a2fe420777a080bcae3a03e0/c=0-268-3496-2243/local/-/media/2018/04/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636598994298158141-AP-Britain-Commonwealth.1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/04/21/queen-elizabeth-concert-sting-shawn-mendes-92nd-birthday/538919002/", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II to attend concert featuring Sting, Shawn Mendes for 92nd birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2018/04/21/queen-elizabeth-concert-sting-shawn-mendes-92nd-birthday/538919002/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Queen Elizabeth II to attend concert featuring Sting, Shawn Mendes for 92nd birthday", "description": "Other performers set for \\", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c5da312f1a23f159a2fe420777a080bcae3a03e0/c=0-268-3496-2243/local/-/media/2018/04/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636598994298158141-AP-Britain-Commonwealth.1.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Other performers set for \\", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524265200.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
