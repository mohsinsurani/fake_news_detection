TMG fired back, saying the actor\u2019s financial woes are all his own.\n\nTMG says Depp\u2019s sense of entitlement is \u201cclear and epic,\u201d as evidenced by his recent interview with The Wall Street Journal \u2014 in which he said, \u201cIt\u2019s my money.

On information and belief, Depp\u2019s flagrant bragging about his senseless and extreme spending to The Wall Street Journal is further evidence of his psychological issues.\u201d\n\nDepp\u2019s lawyer Adam Waldman sent The Hollywood Reporter a statement Monday evening. \u201cAccused of criminal malfeasance and theft totaling tens of millions of dollars, in a case with a whistleblower from the Mandels\u2018 own firm whose testimony and documents they fight to hide, the defendants decided their only defense is psychobabble,\u201d writes Waldman. \u201cThis is how guilty people respond when confronted with the detailed results of a 9 month legal and forensic investigation conducted by 4 firms.\u201d\n\nMay 2, 8:35 a.m. Updated with a quote from Depp\u2019s attorney.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/johnny_depp.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/johnny_depp.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/johnny_depp.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Ashley Cullins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/johnny-depp-has-a-clear-epic-sense-entitlement-managers-say-999062/", "title": "Johnny Depp Has a \u201cClear and Epic\u201d Sense of Entitlement, Ex-Managers Say", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "In an amended complaint, the ex-managers claim the actor wears an earpiece on set and pays someone to feed him lines so he doesn't have to memorize them.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Ashley Cullins", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 999062, "title": "Johnny Depp Has a \"Clear and Epic\" Sense of Entitlement, Ex-Managers Say", "published_at": "2017-05-01 13:22:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/johnny_depp.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "topics": "Business News", "body": "Johnny Depp's former business managers aren't taking his recent comments about their dispute\u00a0lightly \u2014 and they have escalated their claims against the actor in an amended complaint.\r\nThe legal battle between Depp and The\u00a0Management Group's Joel and Robert Mandel began in January, when the actor sued his former business managers for fraud.
