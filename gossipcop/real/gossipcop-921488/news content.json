VOLTA is based on extreme sports.\n\nArnaud described himself on social media as being trained in high-flying circus acts, including the \u201csolo single ring spin\u201d and \u201cSwiss rings.\u201d\n\nHe had at least two daughters, including one born in August 2015 to wife and model Inna D Gorelova, according to his social media accounts.\n\nArnaud worked various shows in several hotels before joining VOLTA\u2019s cast full-time in 2016.\n\nThis is not the first time a member of the circus troupe \u2014 known for its death-defying stunts, which are performed largely without safety nets \u2014 has died on stage.\n\nIn 2013, Sarah Guyard-Guillot, who was also from France, fell almost 100 feet to her death when her safety net failed during a performance of \u201cKa\u201d at the MGM Grand in Las Vegas.\n\nThe company was fined more than $25,000 for safety violations \u2014 including for providing inadequate equipment training for the mother-of-two \u2014 by the state of Nevada.\n\nIn 2016, the 43-year-old son of one of the company\u2019s founders also was killed while setting up a telescopic lift in a show in San Francisco.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/Free-People-Feature-Image.png?w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/Stoopin-Thumbs-12H.2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/yann3.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=661", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NATHAN-FIELDER-METS.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/brandy-comp.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/yann3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/chloe-grace-moretz-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/yann2.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/pitbull-mauling-317.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/yann3.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Linda Massarella"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/03/18/cirque-du-soleil-aerialist-dies-after-fall-during-show/", "title": "Cirque du Soleil aerialist dies after fall during show", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
