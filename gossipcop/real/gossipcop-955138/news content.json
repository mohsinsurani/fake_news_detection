I get a hint of summer florals with a white-musk base note as she breezes up to the Beverly Hills Hotel Polo Lounge. The scent, I find out, is very exclusive. Only one bottle exists, and it was custom-made at a DIY perfumery by her 5-year-old daughter, Everly, who also named it: Mermaid Dreams.\n\n\u201cI was like, \u2018Ah, this child kills me,\u2019\u201d Jenna says, beaming. And though today Jenna has on a white, wide-legged linen jumpsuit with strappy wedges and several delicate gold necklaces, Mermaid Dreams is pretty much all she was wearing at our Naked Truth cover shoot, outside Joshua Tree National Park in California. Nudity is something the 37-year-old has zero qualms about. \u201cI\u2019ve been a dancer my entire life, so I\u2019m used to little clothing,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cYou lose a sense of modesty.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s challenging to go through a big change and have the whole world have an opinion about it.\"\n\nMovie star, TV host (the season-two finale of her reality competition show World of Dance airs this month), and producer are now part of Jenna\u2019s multi-hyphenate description, but dancing is still what moves her. She was in kindergarten when her mom enrolled her in dance classes after she noticed Jenna mimicking the moves in Jane Fonda\u2019s Workout. At 19, Jenna was tapped to join Janet Jackson\u2019s All for You tour\u2014even now, the routines live on in her muscle memory: \u201cI could do \u2018Rhythm Nation\u2019 and \u2018If\u2019 in my sleep,\u201d she says. Dance didn\u2019t only affect Jenna\u2019s sense of modesty; it also shaped her entire future.\n\nIf you\u2019ve seen 2006\u2019s Step Up, you\u2019re familiar with the precise-yet-fluid, insane-strength-requiring moves she\u2019s known for. You\u2019re also familiar with the crackling chemistry she had with her costar, Channing Tatum. That chemistry sparked offscreen as well\u2014the two married in 2009 and, four years later, had their daughter, Everly. But even if that chemistry was not entirely eclipsed, it at least dimmed enough for the couple to call it quits.\n\n\n\nDENNIS LEUPOLD\n\n\n\n\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been a journey, and it\u2019s been a transformation of myself\u2014my needs and wants as a woman,\u201d Jenna says of the past year. \u201cI think everyone wants to hold on to what\u2019s in front of them, but when you open your mind, saying, \u2018I want what\u2019s best for myself and my daughter,\u2019 you have to be okay with however that looks.\u201d In this case, it was a parting of ways.\n\nRelated Story Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan Announce Split\n\nIn April, Jenna and Channing announced their split on Instagram. \u201cI feel I\u2019ve been on a wave of growth,\u201d she says. \u201cIt does look different; it\u2019s a new normal, and I really think we\u2019ll get used to that.\u201d And though she talks about the uncoupling with an air of practiced positivity, she admits it\u2019s been far from painless. \u201cIt\u2019s always challenging to go through a big change and have the whole world have an opinion about it,\u201d she says.\n\nEnduring other people\u2019s opinions comes with the territory of fame, and Jenna is no stranger to putting herself out there. She recently learned the term mom-shaming the hard way: After posting a photo of her lingerie-clad backside on Instagram, followers claimed disappointment in her \u201ctoo sexy\u201d behavior.\n\nRelated Story Everyone Is Freaking Out About Jenna Dewan's Photo\n\nBut Jenna isn\u2019t having it. \u201cApparently, when you become a mother, you\u2019re supposed to leave your sexuality at the door, and I never understood that,\u201d she says. \u201cI think there\u2019s nothing sexier than becoming a mother. You give life. It\u2019s everything. And you don\u2019t change who you are inside just because you have a kid.\u201d\n\nFeeling sexy is certainly one result of her workouts, but it\u2019s not her main goal. \u201cI really like to feel strong, and I like to feel curvy. And when I say \u2018curvy,\u2019 I mean \u2018muscular.\u2019 In the gym, I add more weight rather than increasing reps because I want to build muscle, so I can pick up my daughter,\u201d she says. \u201cBefore, it used to be like, \u2018I wanna get long, lean muscles.\u2019 Now, I\u2019m just like, \u2018I wanna feel strong and good.\u2019\u201d\n\n\n\nDENNIS LEUPOLD\n\nThough she loves taking a jazz-funk or contemporary dance class, she works regularly with trainer Jennifer \u201cJJ Dancer\u201d Johnson. Their sessions are typically 45 minutes, and according to JJ, Jenna makes the most of every second. \u201c[She\u2019s like,] \u2018Let\u2019s go hard or go home!\u2019\u201d JJ says. \u201cShe is a beast.\u201d JJ even named one of her moves the Jenna Squat; it involves some hip-hop-inspired movement. \u201cIt\u2019s a little fun, a little sexy, and a lot hard,\u201d Jenna says. An apt move for the woman sitting across from me who somehow makes forking through her favorite salad (packed with cucumber, golden raisins, and sunflower seeds) low-key sensual.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s okay for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people.\"\n\nIt\u2019s this kind of well-roundedness she seeks to exemplify for her daughter. \u201cI\u2019m cautious not to always say, \u2018You\u2019re beautiful,\u2019 or \u2018You look pretty.\u2019 I say those things, but I follow it up with, \u2018You\u2019re smart, you\u2019re strong, you\u2019re opinionated.\u2019\u201d She wants future Everly to appreciate sexuality, one of the reasons she defends her intimate images. \u201cI want my daughter to see that and be like, \u2018Wow, my mother was a fully actualized, sensual woman.\u2019\u201d It\u2019s clear Jenna will keep posting the pics she wants and hope the haters will learn to live and let live. \u201cWomen are so much stronger and more powerful, and living in our goddess energy, when we come together to lift each other up rather than tear each other down.\u201d\n\nThe ease with which Jenna drops a phrase like \u201cgoddess energy\u201d indicates that her wellness isn\u2019t based on workouts alone. Meditation, breath work, and hosting shaman-led goddess circles are among her practices. When I ask if she\u2019s had her aura photographed, Jenna pulls out her phone to show me a snap of her vibrant violet energy (magical, mystical, intuitive, according to the aura photographer).\n\nDENNIS LEUPOLD\n\nI realize toward the end of our chat that neither one of us has mentioned Channing by name. But when I grab the check from our server, it bears an inescapable reminder. The reservation name the restaurant has in its system is printed in all caps at the top: DEWAN-TATUM. Jenna assures me she views the situation less as an ending and more as an evolution. \u201cIt\u2019s okay for a relationship to change into a new form that is actually better for both people involved, and I think that\u2019s maybe what shocked everyone so much\u2014that it can be a positive thing,\u201d she says. \u201cThat was ultimately what happened with us.\u201d\n\nEmerging from that change is a woman clearly in the process of coming into her own. \u201cI did a lot of work healing from the inside out, becoming more in touch with my womanly power,\u201d she says. \u201cIt was always, \u2018I\u2019m a dancer,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m married,\u2019 or \u2018I\u2019m an actress.\u2019 Over the last couple of years, it became about learning about myself.\u201d I\u2019m reminded of something Jenna said earlier in the afternoon, about the warm Southern California weather. \u201cI am from Texas; I\u2019m used to heat. I\u2019m like a snake that comes out in the sun,\u201d she said, turning her face toward the light and smiling. Much like she shed her clothes for this story, Jenna is shedding her proverbial skin, and what\u2019s underneath is truly a sight to behold.\n\nThis interview also appears in the September issue of
