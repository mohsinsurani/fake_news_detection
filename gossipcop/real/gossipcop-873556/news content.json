That doesn\u2019t mean they\u2019re always a good idea. Case in point: ABC\u2019s \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d Season 4 premiere, as producers made the show\u2019s much-discussed summer controversy feel like an exciting reality TV plot twist, rather than serious allegations of misconduct that temporarily shut down production. Ultimately, Monday night\u2019s episode ended on a \u201cto be continued\u201d note, teasing the second part of the two-night premiere on Tuesday.\n\nIn case you missed it, production on the popular \u201cBachelor\u201d spinoff was shuttered in June after alleged \u201cmisconduct\u201d took place during filming on set in Mexico. Producers did not elaborate, though within hours rumors were flying, namely that the situation involved two cast members; an incident in a pool; and \u201ca drunk sexual encounter with a female contestant who may have been too intoxicated to consent,\u201d according to reports.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nSoon, it emerged the two contestants were Corinne Olympios and DeMario Jackson \u2014 Olympios, 24, hired a lawyer and called the incident her \u201cworst nightmare.\u201d Jackson, 30, said his character was being destroyed with \u201cfalse claims and malicious allegations.\u201d A couple of weeks later, production company Warner Bros. completed an investigation of the footage, and found it \u201cdoes not support any charge of misconduct by a cast member.\u201d Olympios\u2019s own investigation was competed to her satisfaction. A few days later, filming resumed, though Olympios and Jackson did not return.\n\nEven though the show went on, viewers were very aware of the fact that allegations occurred \u2014 ones that triggered the franchise to review its safety procedures. Yet before the premiere, producers appeared to treat the controversy as a harmless misstep, along with a cheery promo that some dubbed \u201chorribly flippant.\u201d (ABC Entertainment\u2019s president, Channing Dungey, said they meant the trailer to be \u201ccheeky,\u201d and pulled them when it was clear that audiences weren\u2019t amused.)\n\nBefore the premiere, the Hollywood Reporter published an interview with Robert Mills, head of ABC\u2019s alternative programming, who said the show would address the controversy \u201chead on.\u201d According to THR, Monday\u2019s episode would \u201cair footage leading up to the shutdown, and Tuesday will see Chris Harrison hosting a \u2018thought-provoking\u2019 conversation with the cast about the show\u2019s new rules and the topic of consent.\u201d\n\nHowever, if you didn\u2019t read about this plan ahead of time, it sure looked like the show was tastelessly using the scandal as bait for fans to tune in to Tuesday\u2019s episode \u2014 as evidenced by many frustrated tweets from viewers. And while cliffhangers are certainly a much-used part of \u201cThe Bachelor\u201d formula, maybe this wasn\u2019t the time or place for that strategy.\n\nThe beginning of the episode looked like it would be different, as it featured host Chris Harrison on an empty beach.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cAs many of you already know, this was the season of \u2018Paradise\u2019 that looked like it might not happen. After two days of shooting, we decided to suspend production. Yes, there was trouble in paradise as accusations and allegations ran wild. It was an extraordinarily stressful and emotional time for our cast and all of our crew, including myself,\u201d he said gravely.\n\nStill, he added, the goal of \u201cParadise\u201d is to help former \u201cBachelor\u201d cast members find love. But first, the producers wanted to show everything that happened during the two days before production came to a halt. \u201cLet\u2019s get this season started, a season that I can definitely say will go down in \u2018Bachelor\u2019 history as the most shocking, and yes, the most dramatic season ever,\u201d Harrison said, a wink to longtime viewers who know that\u2019s promised every season.\n\nSo the show went on, as the contestants were introduced and started pairing off \u2014 a couple scenes showed DeMario and Corinne bonding. Eventually viewers saw them laughing together, with Corinne sitting on his lap. They ran over to the pool, yelling hello to fellow contestant Alex Woytkiw, who was conducting an on-camera interview.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Corinne and DeMario, I don\u2019t know. I know that they\u2019re enjoying each other\u2019s company. They seem like they are clicking,\u201d Alex said, watching in amusement. \u201d \u2018Paradise\u2019 comes with potential to fall in love, and Corinne and DeMario are forging a relationship. They look like they have a connection.\u201d\n\nAlex continued to narrate as Corinne and DeMario jumped in the pool. \u201cJust to let the viewers at home know, Corinne has not changed out of her clothing. She is fully dressed, in the pool right now with DeMario. This is so romantic. It is approximately 4:30 in the afternoon right now, and Corinne and DeMario are already attached at the hip,\u201d he laughed.\n\nThat was the last time Corinne and DeMario were seen together on camera. Throughout the episode, there were multiple teasers about drama. \u201cStay tuned for the moment \u2026 the cameras stopped rolling,\u201d a voice-over said mischievously.\n\nThen, with about two minutes left in the show, the camera zoomed in on Corinne talking with Alex and another cast member, Amanda Stanton. A producer walked over. \u201cCan I steal you for a minute?\u201d he asked Corinne. Looking confused, Corinne stood up. Then they cut to another producer who found DeMario on the beach, walking with Alexis Waters. \u201cI hate to do this, but I need him. I gotta talk to him in private,\u201d the producer said.\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cWhat the f\u2014 is going on?\u201d Alexis asked.\n\nThere was no answer. The next two minutes were a blur of activity, with dramatic music playing in the background. The contestants talked over each other: \u201cI think DeMario left.\u201d \u201cWhere\u2019s Corinne?\u201d A producer marched over. \u201cShut it down!\u201d he barked at a camera operator, who lowered his camera to the sand.\n\nThings got blurry as other cameras were dramatically pointed to the ground, and the crew was ordered to stop filming. The cast grew increasingly confused. \u201cI\u2019m thinking it\u2019s something with Corinne and DeMario from the first night,\u201d one woman said in the background.\n\nThe contestants slowly packed up and headed back to their rooms. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like a chill fell over \u2018Paradise,\u2019\u201d explained Danielle Maltby to the camera. \u201cWe\u2019re just all looking at each other like, \u2018What the f\u2014 is happening?\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nEventually, viewers saw an empty beach as the spooky music continued, with a voice-over urging the audience to tune in on Tuesday night. A couple scenes showed the cast all gathered around Harrison saying sternly, \u201cDo you want to be here?\u201d\n\nObviously, there\u2019s not much suspense \u2014 any \u201cParadise\u201d viewer knows what happens next. And given the serious nature of the initial allegations, there was no reason not to explain everything upfront, no cliffhangers necessary.\n\nRead more:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2017/08/Untitled-collage-7-1024x1024-1.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2017/08/Untitled-collage-7-1024x1024-1.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Yahr", "Staff Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/08/15/bachelor-in-paradise-addresses-scandal-in-most-frustrating-way-possible-in-the-premiere/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 addresses scandal in most frustrating way possible in the premiere", "meta_data": {"description": "Reality competition shows love a good cliffhanger, but that doesn't mean they're always a good idea.", "og": {"site_name": "Washington Post", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/08/15/bachelor-in-paradise-addresses-scandal-in-most-frustrating-way-possible-in-the-premiere/", "image": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/style-blog/files/2017/08/Untitled-collage-7-1024x1024-1.jpg&w=1440", "title": "Analysis | \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 addresses scandal in most frustrating way possible in the premiere", "description": "Reality competition shows love a good cliffhanger, but that doesn't mean they're always a good idea."}, "twitter": {"site": "@WashingtonPost", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Analysis | \u2018Bachelor in Paradise\u2019 addresses scandal in most frustrating way possible in the premiere", "description": "Reality competition shows love a good cliffhanger, but that doesn't mean they're always a good idea."}, "last_updated_date": "2021-12-03T06:44:30.699Z", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-15T10:00:24.000Z", "modified_time": "2021-12-03T06:44:30.699Z", "section": "Arts & Entertainment", "content_tier": "metered"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "next-head-count": 70, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=352509417, app-argument=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/arts-and-entertainment/wp/2017/08/15/bachelor-in-paradise-addresses-scandal-in-most-frustrating-way-possible-in-the-premiere/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502751600.0, "source": "https://www.washingtonpost.com", "summary": ""}
