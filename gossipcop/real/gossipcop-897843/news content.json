News reports. At one point, Kutcher put his arm around his wife's waist and whispered something in her ear that made her giggle.\n\nKimberly White / Getty Images\n\nThe lovebirds met as co-stars on \"That '70s Show\" back in 1998, but didn't fall for each other until more than a decade later.\n\nIn fact, in July 2016, Kunis revealed to late-night host James Corden that she always thought of Kutcher as just a pal who once helped her with her chemistry homework on set \u2014 until she caught a glimpse of him from behind at an awards ceremony years later.\n\n\"At first I was like, 'Wow, that guy's really tall.' That's what I thought. Then he turned around and I went, 'Huh!'\" Kunis recalled.\n\n\"That moment you hear or see in movies where your heart skips a beat \u2014 and it happened with Ashton,\" she explained. \"I was, like, 'Stop it!' ... It was the weirdest thing. I was, like, 'This isn't really happening.'\"\n\nWell, it did happen. And we're so glad!", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_49/1301460/mila-ashton-today-171204-inline2.jpg",
