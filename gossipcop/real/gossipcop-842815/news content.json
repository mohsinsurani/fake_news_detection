Kelley, the screenwriter behind season one, is coming back\u2014and he'll write all seven scripts for season two. \"Going back to last season, we didn\u2019t really close the chapter,\" Kelley said at the TCA panel. \"It ended on an open note. What will happen to these relationships, friendships, marriage? Everybody up here can get jobs\u2014we didn\u2019t want to do this unless we could at least have a fair shot of living up to the bar that we had set in year one. We met and talked about what the stories were and were very candid about what was viable and which stories were not good enough. We didn\u2019t agree to set sail until we agreed this was storytelling we felt passionate about.\u201d\n\nFor season two, Kelley worked with an almost novella-like template written by Big Little Lies author Liane Moriarty. This seems to include some details about how the characters have reckoned with everything that went down in the first season. \u201cWe've talked about trauma; we've seen trauma; we've experienced trauma\u2014but how do we cope with it? That's the big theme for season two,\" Witherspoon said at the TCA panel in February. She also said that it was interesting to see how each character navigated their own issues and continued their stories past where the book and the show ended.\n\n\"The book ended with a lot to do with Bonnie\u2019s character [played by Kravitz], so it was fascinating to see how she was going to respond and how the actual events happened and how it affected her in her life,\" Witherspoon continued. \"We were in a little bit of a difficult spot since we had a book to follow the first time. We were lucky Liane Moriarty almost wrote a novella to use as a template. And we all had unresolved issues. [My character] had an affair, and that was never resolved.\"\n\n\u201cBonnie\u2019s character wasn\u2019t as explored as much as it was in the book, and what she\u2019s done, what is going to happen. And for Celeste, what is the aftermath of abuse once the person is gone? In this case, dead. It doesn\u2019t mean you\u2019re healed,\" Kidman said.\n\n\"The dynamic is really interesting this season,\" said Kravitz. \"There still is a conflict within us, but we now have this thing that binds us together and watching us do this dance together because of this lie that we all hold.\"\n\nAlexander Skarsg\u00e5rd is back too. His character, Perry Wright, was killed at the end of season one, but TV Line confirms he'll still pop up around Monterey, California\u2014presumably in the form of flashbacks. Of course, Skarsg\u00e5rd did tell people.com, \"I don\u2019t even know if I\u2019m really dead or not,\" but he was most likely just teasing.\n\nSeason two will be just as dramatic (and violent) as the first. In its original release, HBO teased that \"relationships will fray\" and \"loyalties will erode\" in season two. Plus, \"the potential for emotional and bodily injury shall loom.\" So that basically means someone's going to get hurt.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633b2344c7327481279341ea/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633ef8eaf0197d1ce66b2735/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633dcb5fa325f3cb9d2d5dcc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c51e5c49dee4f2d49524845/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/TCDHATA_EC103.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5c5b3c20b4d3072ceb0b3f43/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/emilia-clarke-kit-harington-got.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1548777466/glamour_salaries-10.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5cd3165466548fc8cf1c7143/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/meghan-markle.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/big-little-lies.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa", "Julyssa Lopez", "Jessica Radloff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/big-little-lies-season-2-details", "title": "Big Little Lies Season 2: Everything We Know So Far", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "From Meryl Streep's casting decision to the writer and director of the series, here's everything we know about \"Big Little Lies\" season two.", "id": "5a78d0556a41a70bc017a5cf", "keywords": "meryl streep,big little lies,tv", "news_keywords": "meryl streep,big little lies,tv", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a78d0556a41a70bc017a5cf", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"From Meryl Streep's casting decision to the writer and director of the series, here's everything we know about \\\"Big Little Lies\\\" season two.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "BRB, watching this on loop forever.", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "This New Trailer for 'Big Little Lies' Season 2 Is Explosive", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/big-little-lies-season-2-details"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-01T17:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2019-05-10T19:00:00.000Z", "author": "Christopher Rosa,Julyssa Lopez"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "BRB, watching this on loop forever.", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5a78d84b7e5df3558d813818/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/big-little-lies.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "This New Trailer for 'Big Little Lies' Season 2 Is Explosive"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519923600.0, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
