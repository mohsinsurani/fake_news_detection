My family, my friends, my teachers, my colleagues, and my idols. I am obsessed with all the women in my life. I adore them and need them more and more every day. I am so grateful to be a woman, I wouldn't change it for the world. I hope I'm not only defined by my gender though. I hope I'm defined by my input to the world, my ability to love and to have empathy. To raise my son to be a a good man alongside the good man who loves me for everything I am and am not. I want what's best for people, I think we all do. We just can't agree on what that is. Power to the peaceful, power to the people x #womensmarch2018 (sic)\"\n\nThe _Make You Feel My Love _singer joined the likes of Whoopi Goldberg, Scarlett Johansson, Eva Longoria and Reese Witherspoon in standing strong and fighting for their rights and hoping to bring change to the country.\n\nOn one of her signs, typical of potty-mouthed Adele, she displayed the words: \"Everyone's full of s--t.\"\n\nHer other placard said: \"I am no longer accepting the things I cannot change! I am changing the things I cannot accept.\"\n\nLawrence's read: \"A woman's place, is in the revolution.\"\n\nWhilst Diaz's said: \"A movement should never take us backwards, it should only ever carry us forwards!\"", "images": ["https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/loading.gif", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_175,q_70,w_280/ao17t5btlio70ea37mov", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/ewn-logo.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/dd8dxnjrs2slzr3i4eej", "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/rv5tjmvvbgjfe4qxnu6l", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/ewn-logo-sticky.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/bzs2euuly2bxvvv7gjki", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/lqsb3bur7aanpojmuovc", "https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/ael2dmv9unm5ic852drl", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/v1538138159/rjmmxcnwfcznechkzz9p.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_436,w_700/rv5tjmvvbgjfe4qxnu6l", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/wqkje8icy4nzwyf6klhq", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/anvgdve5spryhhigjndy", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/apple.jpg", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/android.jpg"], "top_img": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/rv5tjmvvbgjfe4qxnu6l", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bang Showbiz"], "canonical_link": "https://ewn.co.za/2018/01/21/adele-cameron-diaz-and-jennifer-lawrence-unite-at-women-s-march", "title": "Adele, Cameron Diaz & Jennifer Lawrence unite at Women's March", "meta_data": {"shorturl": "https://ewn.co.za/xaqpm", "description": "Adele stood united with Hollywood pals Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lawrence at the 2018 Women's March in Los Angeles on Saturday.", "keywords": "Cameron Diaz, Adele, Jennifer Lawrence, Women's march, Lifestyle", "news_keywords": "Cameron Diaz, Adele, Jennifer Lawrence, Women's march, Lifestyle", "author": "BANG Showbiz", "ContentItemType": "Article", "articleid": 288942, "disqusidentifier": 0, "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/rv5tjmvvbgjfe4qxnu6l", "secure_url": "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/rv5tjmvvbgjfe4qxnu6l", "width": 700, "height": 437}, "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2018/01/21/adele-cameron-diaz-and-jennifer-lawrence-unite-at-women-s-march", "title": "Adele, Cameron Diaz & Jennifer Lawrence unite at Women's March", "description": "Adele stood united with Hollywood pals Cameron Diaz and Jennifer Lawrence at the 2018 Women's March in Los Angeles on Saturday."}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/rv5tjmvvbgjfe4qxnu6l", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ewnreporter", "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2018/01/21/adele-cameron-diaz-and-jennifer-lawrence-unite-at-women-s-march", "site": "@ewnreporter", "title": "Adele, Cameron Diaz & Jennifer Lawrence unite at Women's March", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Eyewitness News", "ipad": "Eyewitness News", "googleplay": "Eyewitness News"}, "id": {"iphone": 636459947, "ipad": 636459947, "googleplay": "com.eyewitnessnews"}}}, "fb": {"app_id": 259652954116494, "pages": 168892509821961}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=636459947", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.eyewitnessnews", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "p": {"domain_verify": "3acf0ffe30e8e741add34eeb0aa173dd"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516492800.0, "source": "https://ewn.co.za", "summary": ""}
