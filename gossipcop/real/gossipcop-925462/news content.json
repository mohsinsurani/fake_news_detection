You have to ask her that \u2014 I\u2019m not gonna speak for her,\u201d the 30-year-old said on a recent episode of her podcast, It\u2019s Happening With Snooki & Joey. \u201cBut Sammi is just in such a happy place that I feel like she doesn\u2019t want to jump back into that drama if it does happen. And being that there was a lot of Ron and Sam drama when we did film, it was just really hard on both of them. So I just think she doesn\u2019t want that anymore.\u201d\n\nGiancola and Ortiz-Magro met when they first headed to Seaside Heights, New Jersey, as the first members of the show in 2009. The ups and downs of their relationship were documented over the following seasons, until the duo officially called it quits in 2014.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jersey Shore Is Back With a \u2018Family Vacation\u2019 But One Original Cast Member Is Not Joining Them\n\nGiancola, 30, was part of the the group\u2019s recent road trip reunion, though Ortiz-Magro sat the special event out.\n\nAlthough it seems that Giancola is defintely out for the new series, Polizzi is hanging on to hope that she\u2019ll change her mind.\n\n\u201cBut at the same time, we\u2019re just like, it\u2019s gonna be different. We\u2019re all begging her to come back on the show. It\u2019s really up to her,\u201d the podcast host said. \u201cEveryone pray that Sammi comes back, because I feel like she might change her mind. So Sam, if you\u2019re listening, come to the show. Like, stop being \u2014 stop it. Stop it right now before I spank you.\u201d\n\nThe Jersey Shore cast, in 2011.

And while a short teaser trailer heralded their return, exactly what fans can expect from the new series is still a secret.\n\nThe news comes just months after Cortese married longtime boyfriend Christopher Buckner in October. The nuptials brought a lot of the gang back together, with Farley, Guadagnino, DelVecchio, Polizzi, Giancola and Sorrentino all in attendance.\n\nDave Kotinsky/Getty Images\n\nSnooki expressed her excitement on Instagram, sharing a video of the promo from her living room \u2014 except, it might have been too quick for her.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s it?!?\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s so short!\u201d\n\nJWOWW also shared the promo, writing in the caption, \u201cGotta teach these young ones \ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffd\ud83d\udc85\ud83c\udffd.\u201d\n\n\u201cHide yo wife, hide yo kids..Did someone say there\u2019s a new #JerseyShore series coming out in 2018 on @mtv ?!
