The singer fell down the steps of her Nashville home in November, which resulted in a broken wrist and a facial injury that required 40 stitches. Since the fall, Underwood has largely stayed off of social media, and in the last six months, has only shared a few carefully composed shots of her face \u2014 seemingly not yet ready to reveal herself post-injury.\n\nIn January, Underwood opened up about how she was feeling in the wake of the fall and her medical treatment. \"There is also another part of the story that I haven't been ready to talk about since I have still been living it and there has been much uncertainty as to how things will end up. It's crazy how a freak random accident can change your life,\" she wrote in a letter to her fan club, People reported. \"In addition to breaking my wrist, I somehow managed to injure my face as well. I\u2019ll spare you the gruesome details, but when I came out of surgery the night of my fall, the doctor told [Underwood\u2019s husband] Mike [Fisher] that he had put between 40 and 50 stitches in.\" She later shared that she was recovering well, but \"not quite looking the same.\"", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/631a1c8d68aaf78002ae26f5/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/632c9012fd6b1f9334621f7c/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac519a9424f773b2007db6c/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/carrie-underwood-face-after-stitches.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/63189a13d2e4297eb710307c/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/62debbb719ab039cb3653c9c/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Zoe Weiner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/carrie-underwood-post-fall-photo-profile", "title": "Carrie Underwood Posts Photo of Her Face 5 Months After Stitches", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Former \"American Idol\" star Carrie Underwood shared a photo of herself in the music studio five months after her serious fall and facial injury.", "id": "5ac519a02f24d3056a978698", "keywords": "carrie underwood,snd,selfie", "news_keywords": "carrie underwood,snd,selfie", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ac519a02f24d3056a978698", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Former \\\"American Idol\\\" star Carrie Underwood shared a photo of herself in the music studio five months after her serious fall and facial injury.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac519a9424f773b2007db6c/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/carrie-underwood-face-after-stitches.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac519a9424f773b2007db6c/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/carrie-underwood-face-after-stitches.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She had a fall in November that necessitated 40 facial stitches.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Carrie Underwood Just Shared a New Photo of Herself Five Months After Getting Facial Stitches", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/carrie-underwood-post-fall-photo-profile"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-04-04T19:35:50.950Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-04T19:35:50.950Z", "author": "Zoe Weiner"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "She had a fall in November that necessitated 40 facial stitches.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5ac52f022f24d3056a97869e/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/carrie.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Carrie Underwood Just Shared a New Photo of Herself Five Months After Getting Facial Stitches"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522870550.95, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
