On the Tuesday, March 20, episode of the relationship reality show, the three couples struggled with what it meant to make their marriages the real deal. Some couples navigated the rocky waters with skill, while others were on the verge of sinking.\n\nShawniece and Jephte Make Up, Again\n\nJephte was so upset at the prospect of having to surrender his phone to Shawniece that he walked out. She refused to chase him. After getting some (good) advice from his friend, he left her a few roses as an apology. Later, they discussed their five-year plan and surprisingly, seemed to be on the same page when it came to career, travel and kids.\n\nMolly and Jonathan Still Haven\u2019t had Sex\n\nMolly was committed to showing Jonathan more physical affection. Instead, though, she gave him a gift card to his favorite story for his birthday. Apparently, that did the trick, though! No man has ever been more excited for a gift card.\n\nJaclyn and Ryan Hit a Rough Patch\n\nDuring a boys\u2019 night out with Jonathan, Jephte, and Pastor Cal, Ryan revealed that he and Jaclyn were feeling tension about her desire to live a \u201cgypsy\u201d lifestyle, which he wasn\u2019t feeling. Pastor Cal reasoned that she might just want some extended vacations, but Ryan argued that she wanted to move abroad. Instead of going home to Jaclyn (who was sick), Ryan opted to leave the boys\u2019 night to hang with a friend. Jaclyn later told the camera that Ryan was drunk and she was feeling a bit over the marriage.\n\nThey talked it out the next night. The conversation was civil, but she revealed that she was worried he wasn\u2019t making space for her in his life. He asked for more slack and she asked him if he just didn\u2019t want to be married at all. He insisted he wanted to be married and they hugged it out \u2026 for now.\n\nTell Us: Which couple do you think is the strongest right now?\n\nMarried at First Sight airs on Lifetime Tuesdays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/married-at-first-sight.jpg?crop=304px%2C39px%2C1166px%2C611px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/married-at-first-sight.jpg?crop=304px%2C39px%2C1166px%2C611px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Creutz", "Elizabeth Durand Streisand"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/married-first-sight-recap-ryan-goes-drinking-friends-instead-caring-sick-wife-jaclyn-home/", "title": "\u2018MAFS\u2019 Recap: Ryan Ditches Jaclyn to Go Drink With His Friends", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ryan goes drinking with his friends instead of caring for his sick wife at home \u2013 read Us Weekly\u2019s \u2018Married at First Sight\u2019 recap", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018MAFS\u2019 Recap: Ryan Ditches Jaclyn to Go Drink With His Friends", "description": "Ryan goes drinking with his friends instead of caring for his sick wife at home \u2013 read Us Weekly\u2019s \u2018Married at First Sight\u2019 recap", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/married-first-sight-recap-ryan-goes-drinking-friends-instead-caring-sick-wife-jaclyn-home/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-15T12:47:18+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/married-at-first-sight.jpg?crop=304px%2C39px%2C1166px%2C611px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/married-at-first-sight.jpg?crop=304px%2C39px%2C1166px%2C611px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-21T02:15:10+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-15T12:47:18+00:00"}, "author": "Christina Creutz", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018MAFS\u2019 Recap: Ryan Ditches Jaclyn to Go Drink With His Friends", "description": "Ryan goes drinking with his friends instead of caring for his sick wife at home \u2013 read Us Weekly\u2019s \u2018Married at First Sight\u2019 recap", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/married-at-first-sight.jpg?crop=304px%2C39px%2C1166px%2C611px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521598510.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
