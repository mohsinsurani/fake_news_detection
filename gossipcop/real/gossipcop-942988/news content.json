The \"Parts Unknown\" host's net worth had previously been estimated at about $16 million.\n\nThe papers filed in Manhattan Surrogate's Court showed that Bourdain had $425,000 in \"cash and savings,\" $35,000 in a brokerage account, $250,000 in \"personal property,\" and $500,000 in \"intangible property including royalties and residuals.\"\n\nThe will reportedly says Bourdain's 11-year-old daughter, Ariane Busia-Bourdain, will receive most of his fortune. Ariane's mother, Bourdain's ex-wife Ottavia Busia, is the executor of his estate.\n\nSince his divorce with Busia was never formalized, she is legally still his next of kin. Bourdain reportedly left Busia his air miles, which he asks her in the will to \"dispose of in accordance with what [she] believes to have been my wishes.\"\n\nBourdain and his ex-wife Ottavia Busia. Evan Agostini/Invision/AP\n\nPeople reports that the court will appoint a guardian to protect Ariane Busia-Bourdain's interests in her father's estate because she is a minor.\n\nThe celebrity chef's New York condo, which was reported to be worth $3.35 million when he bought it in 2014, was not included in the will, but the filings indicate a $1 million mortgage liability for an unspecified property.\n\n\"I own an apartment with a mortgage that my ex-wife and my daughter live in, and I'm a renter,\" Bourdain told People in February. \"I should always be a renter. I regret buying that apartment. The bank owns it, and then you're stuck with it.\"\n\nThe will was apparently written in 2016 before his split with Busia. Bourdain was dating the actress and activist Asia Argento at the time of his death by suicide.\n\nBourdain was in France working on Season 12 of \"Parts Unknown\" when he was discovered dead in his hotel room.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' viewBox='0 0 1 1'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/youtube.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/bottom-right.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/instagram.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/app-store-badge.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/twitter.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/DE/logos/BI-DE-Black-on-Light-final-footer-logo-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/BI-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/badges/google-play-badge.svg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3C%3Fxml version='1.0' encoding='UTF-8'%3F%3E%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='1' height='1'/%3E", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/facebook.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-com-trademark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/Insider-logo-dark-opt.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/INSIDER/US/logos/insider-inc.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/shared/light-switch.png", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/logos/Tech-Insider-opt.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b3f3c6842e1cc0a927b2f92?width=1200&format=jpeg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/BI/US/icons/linkedin.svg", "https://www.businessinsider.com/public/assets/subscription/marketing/banner-overlay/top-left.svg", "https://i.insider.com/5b1a67631ae66241008b4e51?width=700"], "top_img": "https://i.insider.com/5b3f3c6842e1cc0a927b2f92?width=1200&format=jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tom Murray"], "canonical_link": "https://www.insider.com/anthony-bourdains-will-reveals-he-was-worth-just-12-million-2018-7", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's will reveals he was worth $1.2 million \u2014 much less than previous estimates", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Anthony Bourdain's will reveals he was worth $1.2 million \u2014 much less than previous estimates", "datePublished": "2018-07-06T12:32:00Z", "dateModified": "2018-07-06T14:46:58Z", "news_keywords": "Anthony Bourdain, Parts Unknown, CNN, Chef, Will, Death, Suicide, Tom Murray", "description": "According to court papers, Bourdain's assets amount to $1.21 million.
