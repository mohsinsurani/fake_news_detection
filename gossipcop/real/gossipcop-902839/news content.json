But the timing of the new arrival made Stamos wonder if he\u2019d be able to return to host the 38th annual 4th of July broadcast from the West Lawn of the U.S. Capitol again this year after deeply enjoying his debut stint in 2017.\n\nRachel Murray/Getty\n\n\u201cFortunately, I\u2019ve been able to take off work now, but I said, \u2018Well I don\u2019t know if I could do [the concert] again, because I\u2019m having a little baby,\u2019 \u201d Stamos told PEOPLE at a photo shoot to promote the celebration. \u201cAnd they said, \u2018Well, what can we do to get you?\u2019 \u201d\n\nThe solution? Family road trip! \u201cI said, \u2018Well, I got to bring the kid, then.\u2019 So we\u2019re bringing Billy! And PBS just sent this really cute onesie that says \u2018Future Host,\u2019 and all this patriotic stuff.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019ll be baby Stamos\u2019 first cross-country excursion, coming on the heels of a slightly not-so-smooth local road trip, Stamos admitted. \u201cIt was Mother\u2019s Day and Caitlin\u2019s birthday, so we went down to Laguna [Beach], and it was the first time we didn\u2019t have a nanny \u2014 that was rough!\u201d he laughed. \u201c[But] so far, it\u2019s been a dream, and when I look at him, I feel like I\u2019ve been thinking about that face for a long time.\u201d\n\nStamos said that fatherhood has been everything that he expected it would be, and it\u2019s deepened his connection to his country. \u201cI always knew it was going to be like this,\u201d he explained. \u201cIt took me longer than it should\u2019ve, but I knew that I would be a family and be contributing to this country, and holding onto the morals and the values that my parents had, that I like to think of the world having. It\u2019s a time to be kind and graceful to people. It just takes so much energy to block all the negativity. I\u2019m really trying to get people together.\u201d\n\nAs a bonus, Stamos\u2019 longtime friends and frequent, if unofficial, bandmates \u2014 the iconic, multi-platinum selling music legends The Beach Boys \u2014 will join him in the nation\u2019s capitol as both performers and the recipients of the fifth annual A CAPITOL FOURTH\u2019s National Artistic Achievement Award, with Stamos presenting.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just the biggest glorified fan, really,\u201d Stamos said of his connection to the group, which goes back to the 1980s, appearing in their music video for \u201cKokomo,\u201d frequently joining them on stage behind the drum kit and executive producing the 2000 miniseries The Beach Boys: An American Family. \u201cI\u2019m a fan who gets to hang out with them.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: New Dad John Stamos Opens Up About Fatherhood & Reveals Which Parent His Son Looks Like\n\nSo much so that the band has become as close as family: founding member Mike Love even got ordained and officiated Stamos and McHugh\u2019s wedding ceremony.\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

It\u2019s always a special feeling playing with them, but especially when you\u2019re in D.C. I think I said it even in the show last year: the Fourth of July, Washington, the Beach Boys \u2014 it doesn\u2019t get more American than that. But more than that, I love the effect they have on people and that their music has on people. In a graceless time right now, where people are looking for comfort, I think the Beach Boys music and this whole show, it does that, right?\u201d\n\nAn all-star roster of performers bridging a variety of American favorite musical genres will be joining Stamos and the Beach Boys for the celebration, including Jimmy Buffett and the Broadway cast of the new musical Escape From Margaritaville (this is their first stop after Broadway before launching a national tour); three-time Grammy Award-winning a capella artists Pentatonix; legendary Motown stars The Temptations; platinum country music singer-songwriter Luke Combs; country music star and American Idol alum Lauren Alaina; gospel legend CeCe Winans; and internationally-acclaimed violinist Joshua Bell; with the National Symphony Orchestra, under the direction of top pops conductor Jack Everly.\n\nAdditionally, soprano superstar Ren\u00e9e Fleming will perform \u201cYou\u2019ll Never Walk Alone\u201d to honor the nation\u2019s men and women in uniform and their families.\n\nAlso participating in the event will be the Choral Arts Society of Washington, the U.S. Army Herald Trumpets, the U.S. Army Ceremonial Band, Members of the Armed Forces carrying the State and Territorial Flags and the Armed Forces Color Guard provided by the Military District of Washington, D.C. The top-rated, award-winning program will be capped off with a rousing rendition of Tchaikovsky\u2019s \u201c1812 Overture\u201d complete with live cannon fire provided by the United States Army Presidential Salute Battery, an audience favorite and \u201cA Capitol Fourth\u201d tradition.\n\nJohn Stamos/Instagram\n\nThe celebration will culminate with the largest and most spectacular fireworks display in the nation.\n\n\u201cIt was electrifying,\u201d said Stamos of his debut hosting stint. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve been in front of crowds and a lot of the shows or concerts, and Broadway stuff I\u2019ve done. But they\u2019re coming there for a different reason, to see something. Here I felt they were part of it. They were part of our party, part of our show. \u2026 I\u2019ll try again this year to interact with the crowd. I let the producer and the director know, \u2018I may stop and talk to somebody,\u2019 and we did it. It was really sweet.\u201d\n\nStamos was also gratified that last year during the show he was able to address the hot-button topic of immigration, a facet of American tradition he values given his own family\u2019s history since his grandfather passed through Ellis Island to embrace the nation\u2019s traditions of liberty, opportunity and freedom of speech.\n\n\u201cThe beauty was that this country give him that, and then has given that to my father and me, and I\u2019ll pass that on to my son, all because of an immigrant coming over,\u201d said Stamos. \u201cHe worked hard and took advantage, in the best sense, of what this country has to offer all of us.\u201d\n\nThe 38th annual broadcast of A Capitol Fourth airs on PBS Wednesday, July 4 from 8-9:30 p.m. ET before a concert audience of hundreds of thousands, millions more at home, as well as to our troops serving around the world on the American Forces Network. The program can also be heard live in stereo over NPR member stations nationwide. The concert will also be live-streamed on PBS, You Tube, Facebook and www.pbs.org/a-capitol-fourth and available as Video on Demand for a limited time only, July 4 to July 18, 2018.", "images":
