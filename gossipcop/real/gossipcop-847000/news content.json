Farrah Abraham revealed in a new interview why she walked off the set of the season premiere of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition.\n\nThings got tense on the Friday, April 28, episode when the Teen Mom OG star mentioned her 2010 physical altercation with her now-estranged mother, Debra Danielsen. Danielsen was arrested for the incident after she allegedly choked and hit her then 18-year-old daughter, TMZ reported at the time. She was later charged with assault in an Iowa court.\n\nAbraham walked off the set of the WE tv reality series on Friday night after her mom called the since-dropped charges \u201cbogus\u201d and claimed that Abraham had threatened to kill her.\n\n\u201cWhy am I raising my voice, why am I arguing and fighting up against somebody who can\u2019t admit to what is really happening and going on in our family history?\u201d the MTV star told E! News. \u201cI get really upset when I\u2019m around liars. I detest people who lie. I can\u2019t stand it.\u201d\n\nAbraham hinted that future episodes of Marriage Boot Camp will also focus on her fight with Danielsen. \u201cThere is an episode where we talk about traumatic experiences, my mom and I, and we still cannot get on the same page,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, sometimes between lie detector tests and traumatic experiences, there\u2019s just a certain point in time where you\u2019re like, \u2018Somebody does not have the wherewithal to take accountability to even remember things,\u2019 and you\u2019re like, \u2018Why do I even want to be around them anymore?\u2019 The best narcissists can block things out and act like nothing ever happened to just keep going.\u201d\n\nNonetheless, the reality star doesn\u2019t regret sharing her personal life with viewers. \u201cI really believe in sharing my story to improve social behaviors in the nation,\u201d she told E! News. \u201cI think that\u2019s the best way to do it through media. And I\u2019ve made history time and time again with that.\u201d\n\nMarriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition airs on WE tv Fridays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-zoom-d4b19564-0a75-45aa-8ea0-1c08758b6cda.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-zoom-d4b19564-0a75-45aa-8ea0-1c08758b6cda.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/farrah-abraham-reveals-why-she-walked-off-marriage-boot-camp-w479858/", "title": "Farrah Abraham Reveals Why She Walked Off 'Marriage Boot Camp'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "'Teen Mom OG' star Farrah Abraham revealed in a new interview why she walked off the set of 'Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition' \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Farrah Abraham Reveals Why She Walked Off 'Marriage Boot Camp'", "description": "'Teen Mom OG' star Farrah Abraham revealed in a new interview why she walked off the set of 'Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition' \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/farrah-abraham-reveals-why-she-walked-off-marriage-boot-camp-w479858/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:09:47+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-zoom-d4b19564-0a75-45aa-8ea0-1c08758b6cda.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-zoom-d4b19564-0a75-45aa-8ea0-1c08758b6cda.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-05-01T20:53:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:09:47+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Farrah Abraham Reveals Why She Walked Off 'Marriage Boot Camp'", "description": "'Teen Mom OG' star Farrah Abraham revealed in a new interview why she walked off the set of 'Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition' \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/farrah-abraham-zoom-d4b19564-0a75-45aa-8ea0-1c08758b6cda.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493671980.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
