Meanwhile, performers like Terry Crews have opened up the conversation to discuss sexual harassment and assault in the entertainment industry at large. In a post entitled \u201cIn light of the Harvey Weinstein allegations,\u201d actress Lili Reinhart joins them in revealing her own experience with workplace sexual harassment, which began when a former co-worker attempted to sexually assault her on a date. \u201cI feel the need to share a story of my own personal experience where a man in a position of power over me, used that said power to try and take advantage of me,\u201d the actress writes.\n\n\u201cI was a teenager working on a project \u2026 when I started to have a crush on a guy I was working with,\u201d Reinhart begins on her Tumblr, explaining that her co-worker was a \u201csignificantly older\u201d man who asked out the Riverdale star. \u201cI\u2019m not comfortable giving specific details about the situation because I don\u2019t feel it\u2019s necessary,\u201d she says. \u201cAll that matters is that he tried to force himself on me when we were on a date.\u201d After saying no and asking her date to take her home, Reinhart claims the the unnamed man reportedly brought his indignation back to the set with him. \u201cDays following, he grew angry at the situation and became defensive about it and his actions. Claiming that I was \u2018a tease\u2019 and \u2018the most manipulative woman he\u2019d ever met.\u2019 His ego was bruised to say the least, because I refused to engage with him sexually that night,\u201d she recalls. The co-worker subsequently refused to speak to Reinhart, creating a hostile environment for which the actress blamed herself. \u201cI was miserable,\u201d she writes. \u201cAnd felt that I needed to keep my mouth shut about the entire situation because 1. I figured no one would believe me and 2. He played a much bigger role in this project than me \u2026 he had more power. If I said something, maybe the production would be halted \u2026 people would be put out of work. I would be looked at as dramatic and a diva, no one would want to work with me again.\u201d Reinhart concludes by extending her sympathy to the women who were victimized by Weinstein\u2019s alleged pattern of harassment and assault. Writes the actress, \u201cI\u2019m coming forward about my own experience to further express how common these assaults are in this industry and how important it is that we take action to fight against it.\u201d You can read the entire post here.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f3f/2ee/ffdbf48a554c396fb3fec85564f5c5a31c-13-Lili-Reinhart.rsquare.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f3f/2ee/ffdbf48a554c396fb3fec85564f5c5a31c-13-Lili-Reinhart.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f3f/2ee/ffdbf48a554c396fb3fec85564f5c5a31c-13-Lili-Reinhart.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Halle Kiefer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/riverdales-lili-reinhart-writes-about-attempted-sexual-assault.html", "title": "Lili Reinhart of \u2018Riverdale\u2019 Writes About Attempted Assault", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "lili reinhart, riverdale, sexual harassment, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Riverdale\u2019s Lili Reinhart Discusses Attempted Sexual Assault by Former Co-worker", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2017/10/riverdales-lili-reinhart-writes-about-attempted-sexual-assault.html", "description": "\u201cIf I said something, maybe the production would be halted \u2026 people would be put out of work.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f3f/2ee/ffdbf48a554c396fb3fec85564f5c5a31c-13-Lili-Reinhart.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Riverdale\u2019s Lili Reinhart Writes About Attempted Assault", "description": "\u201cIf I said something, maybe the production would be halted \u2026 people would be put out of work.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/f3f/2ee/ffdbf48a554c396fb3fec85564f5c5a31c-13-Lili-Reinhart.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@hallekiefer", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-13T21:22:05.054-04:00", "tag": "lili reinhart, riverdale, sexual harassment", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "Lili Reinhart of \u201cRiverdale\u201d writes a Tumblr post revealing a former co-worker attempted to force himself on her.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "lili reinhart, riverdale, sexual harassment", "author": "Halle Kiefer", "fb": {"app_id": 158902697551841}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "Vulture", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vulture", "application-name": "Vulture", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00bcf1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/vulture/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507944125.054, "source": "https://www.vulture.com", "summary": ""}
