Producers Andr\u00e9s Torres and Mauricio Rengifo won producer of the year for the song, and Daddy Yankee \u2014 one of the track\u2019s co-writers (and featured artists) \u2014 was the big winner of the evening with eight awards. In addition to his \u201cDespacito\u201d wins, Yankee took home Latin rhythm artist of the year, solo, and songwriter of the year for \u201cDespacito\u201d as well as several other songs that hit Billboard\u2019s Hot Latin Songs chart, including \u201cHula Hoop\u201d and \u201cLa Rompe Corazones\u201d with Ozuna.\n\nHe was followed in wins by Luis Fonsi and Justin Bieber, both taking home seven awards each. In addition to his \u201cDespacito\u201d trophies, Bieber won crossover artist of the year, while Fonsi, as the lead performer on \u201cDespacito\u201d and the subsequent \u201cEchame la Culpa,\u201d won the Hot Latin Songs artist of the year award.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the year of \u201cDespacito\u201d: There was an explosion of Latin tracks that went global this year and Latin artists who were able to reach fans like never before, mostly with urban or urban-leaning tracks. The night\u2019s performances by mostly huge urban superstars included premieres by Ozuna (performing \u201cLa Modelo\u201d with Cardi B), Bad Bunny (performing \u201cAmorfoda\u201d), Maluma (\u201cEl Prestamo\u201d) and Nicky Jam and J Balvin, who performed \u201cX\u201d for the first time on television.\n\nThe coveted artist of the year award, which takes into consideration sales, airplay and streaming, went to Ozuna, who had success in all areas thanks to a succession of singles and his debut album Odisea.\n\nEven pop wins had an urban tinge. Following the \u201cDespacito\u201d blast, superstar Shakira was the biggest winner of the night, with five awards that included Latin pop artist of the year, solo, and Top Latin Albums artist of the year, female. But she also won Hot Latin Songs artist of the year, female for hits that included the decidedly urban-leaning \u201cChantaje\u201d with Maluma.\n\nIn turn, Maluma, a 10-time nominee (including in four categories for \u201cChantaje\u201d), won social artist of the year, a nod to his extraordinary social media following.\n\nRegional Mexican music, long the driving force of Latin music in this country, got shut out from most main categories by the sheer force of massive urban hits. However, regional Mexican acts still dominated the artist of the year, new category, with Christian Nodal taking the award. Nodal also won regional Mexican artist of the year, solo, and regional Mexican song of the year. Also coming in with three wins was Romeo Santos, who won Top Latin Albums artist of the year, male; tropical album of the year; and tropical artist of the year, solo.\n\nThis year\u2019s special lifetime achievement award went to Mexican rock band Man\u00e1, who were honored both for their career as one of the most iconic and lasting bands in Latin music and for their philanthropic endeavors, particularly through their Selva Negra environmental foundation. The group performed two of its biggest hits: \u201cEn el muelle de San Blas\u201d and \u201cCorazon Espinado.\u201d\n\nIn the label categories, Sony Music Latin was the big winner of the evening, taking home 16 of their 20 nominations, including Hot Latin Songs imprint of the year and Top Latin Albums label of the year. Universal Music Latin Entertainment won three out of their 10 nominations including Hot Latin Songs label of the year. On the publishing end, Sony ATV won both publisher of the year (Sony/ATV Latin Music Publishing) and publishing corporation of the year (Sony/ATV Music).\n\nThe Billboard Latin Music Awards honor the most popular albums, songs and performers in Latin music, as determined by the actual sales, streaming, radio airplay and social data that informs Billboard\u2019s weekly charts during a one-year period from the rankings dated February 4, 2017 through this year\u2019s January 27 charts.
