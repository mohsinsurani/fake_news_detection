Great question. There are multiple reasons. The first is that I fucking LOVED the people I worked with and for and wish them NOTHING but success and love on the this great show. To only see this as my loss is limiting and self centered. It\u2019s so much bigger than me. How about all of the other writers, producers, crew and fellow actors that worked so hard and gave everything they had to make this show work? This isn\u2019t just my story. All of my friends and family who have reached out have said \u201cF them! You\u2019ll show them!\u201d. I understand this way of thinking but let me pose a question. How does it serve me to be angry? It would not and does not CHANGE the situation. Me being angry at someone or something would not ultimately make me feel any better. It actually would make me feel much worse. If I chose to be angry that emotion spills over into my relationship with myself, my family and my friends. If I choose anger then I\u2019m taking on the perspective of a victim. I\u2019m not a victim. This is a circumstance. It is my choice and my choice only on how I choose to deal with it. After receiving the call that the show was being picked up and I was being replaced (while I was at Disneyland with my family, ugh) I went to the perspective of the student. What is the lesson here? What can I learn from this experience moving forward? I\u2019ve yet to be given a reason but when I do you bet your ass that I will try and learn from it. Another reason I am posting this is fear. Fear of embarrassment. Fear of Failure. I\u2019ve never been fired before and certainly not publicly. Right now I want to run. I want to hide. I want to quit. The TOUGHER thing to do is face it. To embrace it. Learning to deal with failure is one of the most important lessons you\u2019ll deal with in your life. Guess what? Failure is mandatory. It\u2019s growth. It\u2019ll never stop. It\u2019s where all the good shit happens that makes you a better person when you are open to seeing the right perspective.
