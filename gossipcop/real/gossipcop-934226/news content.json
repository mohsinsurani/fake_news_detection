A pair of tennis shoes, presumably Grande\u2019s, can be seen between his legs.\n\nChoosing to let the image speak for itself, Grande shared the image without a caption.\n\nThe \u201cGod Is a Woman\u201d singer disabled comments on the social media platform after some fans began to blame her for Miller\u2019s death on Friday.\n\nMiller, whose real name was Malcolm McCormick, was pronounced dead at 11:51 a.m. at his Studio City, California, home on Friday, the Los Angeles County Department of Medical Examiner-Coroner confirmed in a statement to PEOPLE.\n\nA cause of death is yet to be determined, but a source told PEOPLE that Miller had gone into cardiac arrest after appearing to suffer a drug overdose.\n\nJamie McCarthy/Getty. Jamie McCarthy/Getty\n\nMinutes before Grande broke her silence on Miller\u2019s death, the rapper\u2019s mother Karen Meyers also shared a photograph of her smiling son learning his head against her while they enjoyed a baseball game together.\n\nShe captioned the image with a broken-heart emoji.\n\nFollowing Miller\u2019s death, his family released a statement thanking everybody for their \u201cprayers.\u201d\n\n\u201cMalcolm McCormick, known and adored by fans as Mac Miller, has tragically passed away at the age of 26,\u201d they said in a statement provided to PEOPLE. \u201cHe was a bright light in this world for his family, friends and fans. Thank you for your prayers. Please respect our privacy. There are no further details as to the cause of his death at this time.\u201d\n\nThe rapper\u2019s tragic death comes months after PEOPLE confirmed his split from Grande in May.\n\n\u201cAriana and Mac officially broke up right after Coachella weekend, but they ultimately struggled for a long time with their relationship, and it was basically over last year,\u201d a source previously told PEOPLE.\n\nAfter online trolls blamed her for Miller\u2019s untimely death on Friday, a source told PEOPLE that the rapper had moved on from their relationship.\n\n\u201cIt honestly seemed he was over the Ariana situation,\u201d the source said, adding that Miller had said at one point, \u201cI\u2019ve matured and my ex hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nDavid X Prutting/BFA/REX/Shutterstock\n\nGrande and Miller first went public with their relationship in September 2016 \u2014 three years after they collaborated on her hit single \u201cThe Way.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: LISTEN: Mac Miller Was Working on Music Hours Before His Death\n\n\u201cThis is one of my best friends in the whole world and favorite people on the planet,\u201d she wrote of Miller in an Instagram Story days after their breakup in May. \u201cI respect and adore him endlessly and am grateful to have him in my life in any form, at all times regardless of how our relationship changes or what the universe holds for each of us!\u201d\n\nShortly after their breakup, Grande began dating Pete Davidson, to whom she became engaged in June.\n\nJeff Kravitz/FilmMagic\n\nIn July, Miller opened up about his past relationship with Grande during an interview with Zane Lowe on Beats 1 on Apple Music and explained that they had both moved on since their split.\n\n\u201cI was in love with somebody. We were together for two years. We worked through good times, bad times, stress and everything else. And then it came to an end and we both moved on. And it\u2019s that simple,\u201d he said.\n\nMiller also went on to add that while some fans have assumed he\u2019d \u201cbeen on the Internet\u201d following up on his ex\u2019s every move after the news of her whirlwind romance with fianc\u00e9 Davidson, that wasn\u2019t the case.\n\nExplaining why he\u2019d taken a step back from things, the rapper remarked that not only was he about to drop his new album, \u201cIt just all seemed kind of unimportant you know \u2014 the need to show people I was OK.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s all positive energy,\u201d he added. \u201cI am happy for her and [the fact that she\u2019s] moving forward with her life, just as I\u2019m sure she is with me.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt honestly seemed he was over the Ariana situation,\u201d the source reveals, adding that Miller had said at one point, \u201cI\u2019ve matured and my ex hasn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nIf you or someone you know is in need of help, please contact the SAMHSA substance abuse helpline at
