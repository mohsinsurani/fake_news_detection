And \u2014 fingers crossed! \u2014 The Office could come back, too. With television revivals ruling the ratings, the beloved sitcom could be poised for a comeback. And Jenna Fischer would certainly be down for that.\n\nSpeaking on a panel during Splitting Up Together's 2018 Winter TCA tour on January 5, the actress who played The Office's Pam Halpert fielded a question about the show's potential return. Now, before you get too excited to return to Scranton, Pennsylvania, know that nothing is official.\n\nFischer claimed that she hasn't heard anything about a revival of the show from the powers that be. \"I think that\u2019s for networks to figure out,\" she said. \"I haven\u2019t been approached about it and don\u2019t know anything about it \u2026 But I love Pam!\u201d\n\nLater, the actress added: \"I think the idea of an Office revival is a great idea. I would be honored to come back in any way that I am able to. I loved playing that character and as long as [co-creator] Greg Daniels is the person in charge and the visionary behind it, then I would absolutely be up for it.\"\n\nFrom her past comments, it's clear that Fischer also wouldn't mind reuniting with her onscreen love interest, John Krasinski. When she dropped by Watch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen, the actress shared that she and the actor who played Jim Halpert had some serious chemistry.\n\nWatch the clip above for Fischer's gushing take on her former costar, and keep your fingers crossed for great things to come at Dunder Mifflin.", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/06/daily-dish-rhoa-after-show.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/07/daily-dish-rhobh-after-show.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhop-candiace-dillard-chris.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhobh-kyle-richards-jamie-lee-curtis-halloween-ends-reunion.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/legacy/images/persons/dish-022411-Jenna-Fischer.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhobh-garcelle-beauvais-movie.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhonj-dolores-catania-nana.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-kyle-cooke-tom-schwartz-divorce.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/faux_player__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/5/107/160121_2972024_Jenna_on_Her_Chemistry_with_John_Krasinski.jpg?itok=ncLHoM9K", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2021/05/bravocon-2021-announcement_0.jpg", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-010918-jenna-fischer-.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/08/daily-dish-real-girlfriends-in-paris-trailer.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/09/daily-dish-rhoslc-season-3-announcement_0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2018/01/dish-010918-jenna-fischer-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/jenna-fischer-weighs-in-on-the-office-revival-rumors", "title": "Jenna Fischer Responds to The Office Revival Rumors", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1132043, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Jenna Fischer Weighs In on The Office Revival Rumors\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/01\\/dish-010918-jenna-fischer-.jpg?itok=qIXzQKBv\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/01\\/dish-010918-jenna-fischer-.jpg?itok=nz-6qZPz\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2018\\/01\\/dish-010918-jenna-fischer-.jpg?itok=hIcZ-smO\"}}", "description": "Will & Grace is back.
