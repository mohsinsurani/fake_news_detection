These stars ended up dating or even marrying their managers.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/tJitlSP-Z1/ Kelly Rowland 2014 was a big year for Kelly Rowland. Not only did she become a wife, she became a mother as well. The former Destiny\u2019s Child member started dating manager Tim Weatherspoon in 2011. Two years later he asked her to be his wife via Skype. Last May, the couple tied the knot with a destination wedding in Costa Rica. A few months later Rowland gave birth to their son Titan.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/rrs40kgYHR/ Mary J. Blige Not only does Mary J. Blige trust Kendu Isaacs with her heart, she trusts him with her career, too. They recently celebrated their 11th wedding anniversary and he\u2019s been in charge of her career just as long. \u201cI\u2019m just happy that my man is still with me and he\u2019s had the courage to stay with me. I\u2019m grateful for that,\u201d Blige said when asked about how she felt about her 11th wedding anniversary.\n\nWendy Williams Wendy Williams has gone from dominating the radio airwaves in New York to having her own national daytime talk show. And there for much of her success and helping her navigate her radio and television career as well as other projects has been husband Kevin Hunter. They tied the knot back in 1997 and a year later he became her agent. After suffering two miscarriages, Williams and her husband are now the parents to one teenage son.\n\nUsher Usher enjoyed life as a single man following his divorce from wife Tameka Foster in 2008 until he started dating Grace Miguel shortly afterward. But over the holiday season, Usher reportedly popped the big question and his manager Grace has been spotted tooling around Miami with what appeared to be a diamond band on her left ring finger. \u201cI have an incredible partner and manager,\u201d Usher said. \u201cShe has helped me through some of the hardest times in my life and my career. She\u2019s someone who\u2019s been able to support and understand all of who I am. Not just as a dancer or as a performer or as a singer, but as a humanitarian and a businessman and as a person.\u201d\n\nTasha Smith Tasha Smith\u2019s an example of how mixing business and pleasure doesn\u2019t always work. The \u201cWhy Did I Get Married?\u201d star tied the knot to her boyfriend of one year, Keith Douglas, in 2010. Douglas was also her manager, but a few months ago, Douglas filed for a restraining order against Smith, claiming that he was fearful of his life. She went to court and filed for a restraining order of her own. A judge ordered Smith and Douglas to stay away from each other, which could be especially challenging because they still lived in the same house together.\n\nhttps://instagram.com/p/xDjl8EgsWR/ Tamar Braxton Tamar Braxton had dreams of becoming a chart-topping singer but when her first album flopped, she settled for singing background for big sister Toni. But \u201cBraxton Family Values\u201d proved to be the perfect launching pad and Tamar\u2019s solo career she was given a new lease on life. Hubby Vince Herbert had his hands full managing his wife\u2019s new career. Vince was also Lady Gaga\u2019s manager and viewers of \u201cBraxton Family Values\u201d and \u201cTamar and Vince\u201d have watched her complain about not being on the top of his list of priorities.\n\nView this post on Instagram Repost from @rasheedadabosschick #HappyNewYear \ud83d\udcaf what's good??? #2015 A post shared by Kirk Frost (@frost117) on Dec 31, 2014 at 10:43pm PST Rasheeda Frost Kirk Frost has been managing wife Rasheeda\u2019s career longer than they\u2019ve been married. The \u201cLove & Hip Hop Atlanta\u201d star had been managing his wife\u2019s career for 17 years and married for 12 when in 2012 she wanted a change in direction. Rasheeda spoke to famed manager Debra Antney about possibly managing her career and she was in tears when cameras were present as Rasheeda told Kirk that she wanted to fire him as her manager. Fortunately, they worked through their professional and personal issues and are good now.\n\nCeline Dion Age ain\u2019t nothing but a number. At least that\u2019s according to Celine Dion and her husband Rene. They first met when she was 12 and he was 38 years old. He began managing her career and seven years later their professional relationship became something much more. They got married in 1994 and after trying the old-fashioned way to have a child, the couple welcomed a son after in-vitro fertilization treatments in 2001. Dion became a mother again when she welcomed twins in 2010.\n\nBritney Spears Following her split from hubby Kevin Federline and a very public meltdown that landed her in the psych ward, Britney Spears worked on piecing her life back together. There to help her get her career back on track was manager Jason Trawick. But soon he became more than her employee and the couple began dating in 2009. He asked for her hand in marriage at the end of 2011 but they would never make it down the aisle together. They split soon after ushering in 2013.\n\nLa Toya Jackson La Toya Jackson\u2019s relationship with manager Jack Gordon started out strictly professional. But when things took a romantic turn, Gordon suddenly became very controlling. The pair ended up getting married and La Toya\u2019s career took a sharp nosedive and when she realized he was looking to have her star in pornography, Jackson had enough. The marriage only lasted a year. She filed for a divorce and sued her former hubby in civil court for years of abuse under the Violence Against Women Act.\n\nBobby Brown Bobby Brown was married to Whitney Houston for 15 years and when their tumultuous relationship came to an end, the self-proclaimed King of R&B found solace with manager Alicia Etheridge. They welcomed a son together in 2009 and a year later the \u201cDon\u2019t Be Cruel\u201d singer asked for her hand in marriage. He proposed to her while performing onstage at the Funk Fest in Jacksonville, FL. They got married two years later in Hawaii.\n\nView this post on Instagram A post shared by AMERIE \u110b\u1166\u1106\u1173\u1105\u1175 \ud83d\udcda\ud83c\udfbc (@amerie) on Apr 4, 2014 at 12:48pm PDT Ameriie Ameriie has probably been more focused on her relationship than her career, which wouldn\u2019t be such a bad thing if she weren\u2019t involved with her manager. The \u201cOne Thing\u201d singer has been dating longtime boyfriend and manager Lenny Nicholson since 2004 and they got married in 2011 in an oceanfront wedding in Anguilla. She\u2019s expected to release two projects in 2015 and is slated to go on tour in the UK as well.\n\nView this post on Instagram Cooking for friends and family on New Year's Eve!! \ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89\ud83c\udf89 A post shared by Mariah Carey (@mariahcarey) on Dec 31, 2014 at 8:45pm PST Mariah Carey Her marriage to Tommy Mottola may have been rocky but one thing is for certain: the Sony executive helped turn Mariah Carey into a star. She was 20 years his junior and has revealed that Mottola made her feel inferior in their marriage. They also had a difference in opinion as far as the creative directions her albums and career would go. After five years of marriage, the \u201cButterfly\u201d singer had enough of Mottola\u2019s controlling ways and filed for a divorce.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035391&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/themes/bossip4/images/madamenoire_logo_white.svg", "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cropped-tab-logo.jpg?strip=all&quality=80", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=187138648481959&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/themes/bossip4/images/madamenoire_logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cropped-tab-logo.jpg?strip=all&quality=80", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Iva Anthony"], "canonical_link": "https://madamenoire.com/500775/celebs-who-date-their-managers/", "title": "Mixin\u2019 Business With Pleasure: Celebs Who Date Their Managers", "meta_data": {"fb": {"admins": 100006356380901, "pages": 123136324375898}, "google-site-verification": "89cYy4uYOnrle-D3H3SPnHJySu32IytBEKjsv1_skZo", "y_key": "637ec967f3cf29ad", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "article-type": "slideshow", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Celebs marrying their managers is nothing new in Hollywood and these famous people have also mixed business with pleasure.", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Celebs Who Date Their Managers", "description": "Celebs marrying their managers is nothing new in Hollywood and these famous people have also mixed business with pleasure.", "creator": "@MadameNoire", "site": "@MadameNoire", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "MadameNoire", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "6 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "wp-parsely_version": "1.13.0", "sailthru.date": "2015-01-27 09:10:49", "sailthru.title": "Mixin\u2019 Business With Pleasure: Celebs Who Date Their Managers", "sailthru.tags": ",celebrity couples,Arts & Entertainment,Slideshows", "sailthru.author": "Iva Anthony", "sailthru.description": "Sometimes it works...sometimes not so much.", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Mixin\u2019 Business With Pleasure: Celebs Who Date Their Managers", "url": "https://madamenoire.com/500775/celebs-who-date-their-managers/", "description": "Sometimes it works\u2026sometimes not so much.", "site_name": "MadameNoire", "image": {"identifier": "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cropped-tab-logo.jpg?strip=all&quality=80", "width": 512, "height": 512}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-01-27T14:10:49+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-01-27T14:10:49+00:00"}, "msapplication-TileImage": "https://madamenoire.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2017/10/cropped-tab-logo.jpg?w=270&strip=all&quality=80"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1422367849.0, "source": "https://madamenoire.com", "summary": ""}
