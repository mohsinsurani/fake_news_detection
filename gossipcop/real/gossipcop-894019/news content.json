The baby boy was born on Monday, May 7 at 11:53 p.m. in Los Angeles, People confirms. His name is Hart, after Spiegel's grandfather.\n\n\"Words cannot explain how happy we are to welcome our beautiful son into our family. Miranda is doing well and Flynn is excited to be a big brother. Thank you for the kind words and wishes during this very special time,\" the couple said in a statement to People.\n\nThis marks the Victoria's Secret alum's second child. She's also mother to seven-year-old Flynn, whom she shares with ex-husband Orlando Bloom.\n\nKerr, 35, and Spiegel, 27, married in May 2017 with a small, intimate wedding at their Brentwood, California home. The model and Snapchat CEO reportedly first met when they were seated together at a Louis Vuitton dinner in 2014. The pair then announced their engagement in July 2016.\n\n\"Our wedding was just so joyful,\" the model said at last year's panel for Goop Health. \"We started the day, did yoga, then our families came over and we literally had this celebration in our backyard. It was incredible. It was so magical.\"\n\nNews of Kerr's pregnancy first broke in November 2017. \"Miranda, Evan and Flynn are looking forward to welcoming the newest member of their family,\" a spokesperson for Kerr said in a statement at the time.\n\nShe debuted her baby bump on the red carpet in January at a Golden Globes afterparty in a body-hugging leopard print gown.\n\nGetty Images\n\nCongratulations to the happy couple!", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2478974-012-1665067784.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.721xh;0,0.0461xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/36/1504865988-miranda-kerr-evan.jpg?crop=0.998xw:0.734xh;0,0.0376xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2479931-003-1665162992.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0192xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/599dd307d55930657939d4e1/thumb_1503515403_204x124.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-on-september-26-news-photo-1665065585.jpg?crop=0.941xw:1.00xh;0.0304xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665155826.jpg?crop=0.984xw:1.00xh;0.00962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-miranda-kerr-baby-bump-1525954886.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=320:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665151779.jpg?crop=0.676xw:1.00xh;0.269xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-arriving-for-lunch-at-the-abbey-of-san-news-photo-1665070515.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0.0551xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tom-brady-and-gisele-b-c3-bcndchen-attend-the-2019-met-gala-news-photo-1664907170.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kate-del-castillo-teresa-mendoza-lrds3-tlmd-2-1664910940.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0566xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/harpersbazaaruk.cdnds.net/17/36/1504865988-miranda-kerr-evan.jpg?crop=0.998xw:0.734xh;0,0.0376xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a20645416/miranda-kerr-gives-birth-first-child-evan-spiegel/", "title": "Miranda Kerr Just Gave Birth to Her First Child with Evan Spiegel", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Miranda Kerr Just Gave Birth to Her First Child with Evan Spiegel", "description": "The model has given birth to her first child with husband and Snapchat CEO.
