She took the tweet down. I don't know, I can't speak for her,\" he told Colbert toward the end of their interview promoting Franco's film The Disaster Artist. \"The others \u2014 look, in my life I pride myself on taking responsibility for things that I've done. I have to do that to maintain my well-being. I do it whenever I know that there is something wrong or needs to be changed.\"\n\n\"The things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate,\" he added, \"but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice, because they didn't have a voice for so long. So, I don't want to shut them down in any way.\"\n\nYouTube\n\nFranco's comments come several days after the Golden Globes award ceremony, where he won for best actor in a comedy or musical. During the broadcast, his evident support for \"Time's Up,\" an initiative seeking to end sexual harassment and gender inequality in the workplace, prompted disgust from Sheedy and others.\n\n\"James Franco just won,\" Sheedy, whom Franco directed in a 2014 off-Broadway show, said on Twitter. \"Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business.\"\n\nIn an earlier tweet, Sheedy had asked: \"Why is James Franco allowed in?\"\n\nBoth tweets, which lodged no specific allegations, have since been deleted, but at least two other women posted claims against the actor and director.\n\nFilmmaker Sarah Tither-Kaplan alleged a contract she signed with Franco regarding nudity in two of his films was exploitative, and actress Violet Paley addressed a tweet to Franco, saying, \"Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17?\"\n\nHey James Franco, nice #timesup pin at the #GoldenGlobes , remember a few weeks ago when you told me the full nudity you had me do in two of your movies for $100/day wasn't exploitative because I signed a contract to do it? Times up on that! \u2014 Sarah Tither-Kaplan (@sarahtk) January 8, 2018\n\nCute #TIMESUP pin James Franco. Remember the time you pushed my head down in a car towards your exposed penis & that other time you told my friend to come to your hotel when she was 17? After you had already been caught doing that to a different 17 year old? \u2014 Violet (@VioletPaley) January 8, 2018\n\n\"A couple weeks ago, James offered me & a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone 'apology,' \" Paley later tweeted, adding: \"I don't accept.\"\n\nA couple weeks ago, James offered me & a few other girls an overdue, annoyed, convenient phone \u201capology\u201d. I don\u2019t accept, but maybe some other people\u2019s lives would be made easier if he donated all of his earnings from \u201cThe Disaster Artist\u201d to @RAINN01. \u2014 Violet (@VioletPaley) January 9, 2018\n\nNeither allegation has been independently confirmed by NPR.\n\nStill, the simmering controversy was enough to dissuade The New York Times from holding an event featuring Franco. The paper canceled that event, which had been scheduled for Wednesday.\n\n\"The event was intended to be a discussion of the making of the film, 'The Disaster Artist.' Given the controversy surrounding recent allegations, we're no longer comfortable proceeding in that vein,\" the Times explained in a statement to The New York Daily News.\n\nFranco remains scheduled to make another late-night appearance Wednesday, on Late Night with Seth Meyers on NBC.\n\nIn Tuesday night's conversation with Colbert, Franco reiterated his support for \"Time's Up,\" saying he backs the drive for pay equity in the workplace, \"which just means people that are underrepresented \u2014 women and people of color, people in the LGBT community \u2014 get leadership positions, that they fill all positions that they've been deprived of.\"\n\nThen he spoke specifically of the claims against him.\n\n\"The way I live my life, I can't live \u2014 if there's restitution to be made, I will make it. So, if I've done something wrong, I will fix it. I have to. I think that's how that works. I don't know what else to do,\" Franco told Colbert.\n\n\"Look, I really don't have the answers\" on the larger issue of sexual harassment, Franco added. \"I think the point of this whole thing is that we listen. ... I'm here to listen and learn, and change my perspective where it's off. And I'm completely willing, and I want to.\"", "images": ["https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-dark.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesat_sq-cbde87a2fa31b01047441e6f34d2769b0287bcd4-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/08/gettyimages-902753384_sq-e30ff0e0368f87ea8d8bb5ea8eb5c77f1df96de4-s100-c15.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/npr-logo.svg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/10/gettyimages-880547996-1-_wide-f791945ef22edf6f4bc850cba03fe47b212d302c-s1400-c100.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/branding/sections/thetwo-way/branding_icon-aec8943f7fba654246d504d81ae2999f30b3106f-s1000-c100.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2022/09/23/planet-money_tile_npr-network-011_sq-931aa24b5dd8a691a73c0f0aa2541322c8104add-s100-c100.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/all-things-considered.png", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/up-first.jpg?version=2", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/morning-edition.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome/programs/logos/fresh-air.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2022/09/23/life-kit_tile_npr-network-01_sq-200388bae100cab944ffa3655e7f3119e026d305-s100-c100.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2022/09/23/invisibilia_tile_npr-network-01_sq-2382fccb673e33b6a484c55ddf092554dc1dd2fe-s100-c100.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2022/09/22/book-of-the-day_tile_npr-network-01_sq-624a7585e5bbea1a1294f5da2f5a96927829ad1c-s100-c100.jpg", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2019/02/26/we_otherentitiestemplatesun_sq-4a03b35e7e5adfa446aec374523a578d54dc9bf5-s100-c85.png", "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/04/18/colindwyer_sq-e28a2355d0bdaccf437566c357a0ef6342442bc2-s100-c85.jpeg", "https://media.npr.org/chrome_svg/music-logo-light.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.npr.org/assets/img/2018/01/10/gettyimages-880547996-1-_wide-f791945ef22edf6f4bc850cba03fe47b212d302c-s1400-c100.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Colin Dwyer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/10/576994537/james-franco-denies-sexual-misconduct-claims-saying-theyre-not-accurate", "title": "James Franco Denies Sexual Misconduct Claims, Saying They're 'Not Accurate'", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "1VqzbDm4ukeFVHOoq5LjIKA2fVKZD-EYv8cXZhKXSfU", "robots": "noarchive,index,follow,max-image-preview:large", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=324906251, app-argument=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/01/10/576994537/james-franco-denies-sexual-misconduct-claims-saying-theyre-not-accurate", "Rating": "General", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "date": "2018-01-10", "description": "Several claims against Franco have surfaced on Twitter.
