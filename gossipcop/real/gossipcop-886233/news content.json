He has slammed the President previously in the nine-minute 2016 freestyle \u201cCampaign Speech\u201d and in Big Sean\u2019s \u201cNo Favors.\u201d\n\n\u201cAnd any fan of mine who\u2019s a supporter of his, I\u2019m drawing in the sand a line, you\u2019re either for or against, and if you can\u2019t decide who you like more and you\u2019re split on who you should stand beside, I\u2019ll do it for it for you with this. F\u2014 you,\u201d he said toward the end, raising his middle finger.\n\nA request to the White House for comment was not immediately returned.\n\nThe latest freestyle, which Eminem revealed on Twitter is called \u201cThe Storm,\u201d comes as anticipation for Eminem\u2019s eighth studio release builds. The rapper decried Trump\u2019s comments following the white supremacist rally in Charlottesville, questioned the President\u2019s own patriotism following his attacks on athletes and Sen. John McCain, and in closing, issued a passionate tribute to Colin Kaepernick.\n\nFOR MORE: Check out the series\n\n\u201cI appreciate you @Eminem,\u201d Kaepernick tweeted, along with a fist emoji.\n\nThe former San Francisco 49ers quarterback is now a free agent after he rose to national prominence last fall when he refused to stand for the national anthem to protest police brutality. Eminem previously expressed his support for Kaepernick in \u201cCampaign Speech.\u201d\n\nHere are the 11 most explosive lines from his newest anti-Trump freestyle in the order that they appear:\n\n1) \u2018A kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s the full verse: \u201cWe better give Obama props \u2018cause what we got in office now is a kamikaze that will probably cause a nuclear holocaust while the drama pops, and he waits for s\u2014 to quiet down, he\u2019ll just gas his plane up and fly around till the bombing stops.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Hip-hop stars slam Trump amid anthem firestorm\n\nHere, Eminem is likely referencing Trump\u2019s war of words on social media with North Korea\u2019s Kim Jong Un, whom the President referred to as \u201clittle rocket man.\u201d\n\n2) \u2018Trump, when it comes to giving a s\u2014 you\u2019re stingy as I am\u2019\n\nThis line comes after Eminem references rising tensions in America.\n\n3) \u2018Racism\u2019s the only thing he\u2019s Fantastic 4 cause that\u2019s how he gets his rock off, he\u2019s orange\u2019\n\nFantastic Four - Heroes Unite Trailer (2015) - Miles Teller, Jamie Bell Superhero Movie HD\n\n4) \u2018Cause he cannot withstand the fact we\u2019re not afraid of Trump\u2019\n\nHere\u2019s the full verse: \u201cThat\u2019s why he wants us to disband cause he cannot withstand the fact we\u2019re not afraid of Trump. Walking on egg shells, I came to stomp. That\u2019s why he keeps screaming, \u2018Drain the swamp,\u2019 cause he\u2019s in quicksand.\u201d\n\nHere, Eminem criticizes those who have been tepid when it comes to expressing their opposition to the President.\n\n5) \u2018All these horrible tragedies and he\u2019s bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm\u2019\n\n\u201cBut this is his form of distraction, plus he gets an enormous reaction when he attacks the NFL, so we focus on that instead of talking Puerto Rico or gun reform for Nevada. All these horrible tragedies and he\u2019s bored and would rather cause a Twitter storm with the Packers.\u201d\n\nHere, the rapper slams the President for spending days attacking NFL players who take a knee and escalating the feud as a hurricane ravaged Puerto Rico and a massacre occurred in Nevada. Trump visited both Puerto Rico and Las Vegas following each disaster.\n\n6) \u2018Who\u2019s going to pay for his extravagant trips\u2019\n\nFull verse: \u201cHe says he wants to lower our taxes, then who\u2019s going to play for his extravagant trips back and forth with his fam to his golf resorts and his mansions?\u201d\n\nLast month Trump unveiled a Republican framework for tax reform that calls for sweeping tax cuts and a simplification of the tax code.\n\n7) \u2018Same s\u2014 that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more\u2019\n\nFull verse: \u201cSame s\u2014 that he tormented Hillary for and he slandered then does it more. From his endorsement of Bannon, support for the Klansman, tiki torches in hand for the solider that\u2019s black and comes home from Iraq and is still told to go back to Africa.\u201d\n\nHere, Eminem is referring to Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who is also the executive chairman of the conservative media outlet Breitbart News.\n\n8) \u2018This racist 94-year old grandpa\u2019\n\nThis line comes before the rapper says Trump is ignoring America\u2019s racist past.\n\n9) \u2018To him, you\u2019re zero cause he don\u2019t like his war heroes captured\u2019\n\n\u201cHe says you\u2019re spitting in the face of vets who fought for us you b\u2014\u2014-, Unless you\u2019re a POW who\u2019s tortured \u2026 cause to him you\u2019re zero cause he don\u2019t like his war heroes captured. That\u2019s not disrespecting the military.\u201d\n\nEminem accuses the President of disrespecting the military \u2013 a charge that Trump recently leveled against athletes who take a knee during the national anthem. In this lyric, he references Trump\u2019s previous attacks on Arizona Sen. John McCain, who spent five years as a prisoner during the Vietnam War. In 2015, Trump questioned whether McCain is a war hero, saying, \u201cI like people that weren\u2019t captured, OK?\u201d\n\n10) \u2018F\u2014 that, this is for Colin, ball up a fist and keep that s\u2014 balled like Donald the b\u2014-\u2018\n\nYou can check out hip-hop\u2019s strongest lyrics on Kaepernick HERE.\n\n11) \u2018The rest of America stand up. We love our military and we love our country but we f\u2014\u2014 hate Trump\u2019\n\nEminem\u2019s latest attack is part of a larger trend in hip-hop, which turned on Trump in 2016 and largely settled for Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, after nearly three decades of idolizing his wealth and power in hundreds of lyrics.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150512163444-deena-zaru.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/DMEa0CJbAUs/hqdefault.jpg", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170106163954-hip-hop-barack-obama-composite-do-not-use-for-upcoming-story.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/161025115846-donald-trump-hillary-clinton-hip-hop-politics.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_900,w_1599,c_fill/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171010231422-eminem-trump-split.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170810083230-get-political-logo-large-169.png?q=h_80,w_175,x_0,y_0/w_1280", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170927123728-eminem-kendrick-lamar-kaepernick.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_900,w_1599,c_fill/h_144,w_256"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171010231422-eminem-trump-split.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deena Zaru"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/11/politics/eminem-donald-trump-bet-hip-hop-awards/index.html", "title": "Eminem unleashes on Trump at the BET Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Eminem unleashes on Trump: The 11 fiercest lines | CNN Politics", "description": "In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem \"came to stomp\" at the BET Awards.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171010231422-eminem-trump-split.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/10/11/politics/eminem-donald-trump-bet-hip-hop-awards/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Eminem unleashes on Trump: The 11 fiercest lines | CNN Politics", "description": "In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem \"came to stomp\" at the BET Awards.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/171010231422-eminem-trump-split.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cnnpolitics"}, "description": "In what is perhaps the fiercest and the most exhaustive attack against Donald Trump in hip-hop, Eminem \"came to stomp\" at the BET Awards.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "politics", "meta-branding": "get-political", "theme": "politics", "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-11T04:49:26Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-12T08:58:11Z", "tag": "2016 presidential election, arts and entertainment, celebrities, discrimination, donald trump, elections and campaigns, eminem, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, music, political candidates, political figures - us, politics, racism and racial discrimination, rap and hip-hop music, societal issues, society, us federal elections, us federal government, us presidential elections, white house, colin kaepernick, sports figures", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "2016 presidential election, arts and entertainment, celebrities, discrimination, donald trump, elections and campaigns, eminem, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, music, political candidates, political figures - us, politics, racism and racial discrimination, rap and hip-hop music, societal issues, society, us federal elections, us federal government, us presidential elections, white house, colin kaepernick, sports figures", "author": "Deena Zaru", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507676400.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
