As reported by E!, during a special interview with Vanity Fair, Ross was asked questions about having kids where she bluntly made it clear that some boundaries need to be set and not everything is up for discussion when it comes to her personal and private life. The cover model and actress sat down with the magazine and gave her thoughts on how she feels constantly being asked about whether she plans on having kids or not. Back in 2016 and 2017 for example, Ross, who was promoting the third season of her show Black-ish was constantly asked whether the 45-year-old ever plans on having kids.\n\nBecause Ross' character in the series was expecting her fifth child, she was often asked whether she ever wanted to become a mother in real life.\n\n\"Last year, I was pregnant all season. That brought on a lot of comments and questions and pontifications from people with no invitation.\"", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c4ca7c76-1956-4818-b67f-af1d1f0cfe0c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/4bdfd395-a3e7-4b65-8057-f0fd5b318099.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/570c1285-665e-4cb1-ab3e-2c7358094af1.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/52c9a0b6-f10c-4c3b-a53b-713d9021c8d2.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/ee9811a7-9d76-4c83-8e30-f53bfebf972c.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/3bd1a3d2c01a173ca477b7aa4785d73d?s=800", "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-9269769822.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-9269769822.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4931815/tracee-ellis-ross-shuts-down-baby-questions-telling-people-to-get-out-of-her-womb/", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Shuts Down Baby Questions Telling People To 'Get Out' Of Her Womb", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tracee Ellis Ross Shuts Down Baby Questions Telling People To 'Get Out' Of Her Womb", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4931815/tracee-ellis-ross-shuts-down-baby-questions-telling-people-to-get-out-of-her-womb/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Tracee Ellis Ross Shuts Down Baby Questions Telling People To 'Get Out' Of Her Womb", "image": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/GettyImages-9269769822.jpg", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2018-06-07 14:41:24Z", "section": "Celebrities"}, "description": "Tracee Ellis Ross Shuts Down Baby Questions Telling People To 'Get Out' Of Her Womb", "keywords": "Celebrities", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528382484.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
