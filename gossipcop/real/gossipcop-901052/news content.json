On Monday, the married couple stepped out for a night out in London, where they supported the Motor Neuron Disease Association\u2019s Carol Concert. The night marked their first public appearance since announcing in November that they\u2019re expecting a second child together.\n\nFor the occasion, Eddie did what Eddie does best and kept it super dapper in a suit with a straight tie and matching pocket square. Hannah covered her growing baby bump in a green coat with oversize buttons, pockets, and matching jeans.\n\nDoug Peters/PA Wire/PA Images\n\nThe couple welcomed their first child, a baby girl named Iris May Redmayne, in June 2016. Last year, Eddie opened up about parenthood on Ellen.\n\n\u201cBefore you\u2019re a parent, you sort of hear people talking about [not getting any sleep] and suddenly you\u2019re the guy who\u2019s like floating in a sort of constant jet lag with a constant IV of caffeine. So yes, I\u2019ve become that person. It\u2019s worth every minute,\u201d he said.\n\nIt sounds like they\u2019re taking parenthood by storm.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121917-eddie-redmayne-pregnant-hannah-bagshawe-lead.jpg?itok=uuiGS_Sc", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2017/12/121917-eddie-redmayne-pregnant-hannah-bagshawe-lead.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/12/121917-eddie-redmayne-pregnant-hannah-bagshawe-lead.jpg?itok=nKgApZ2w", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121917-eddie-redmayne-pregnant-hannah-bagshawe-lead.jpg?itok=uuiGS_Sc", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Borge"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509/http://www.instyle.com/news/eddie-redmayne-pregnant-wife-hannah-first-public-appearance", "title": "Eddie Redmayne and Wife Hannah Make First Public Appearance Since Announcing Pregnancy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "Maternity,Celebrity,News,Star Couples,Baby News,Eddie Redmayne", "news_keywords": "eddie readmayne, hannah redmayne, eddie redmayne and wife hannah pregnant, eddie redmayne father", "description": "The couple stepped out for a charitable event in London on Monday.", "og": {"title": "Eddie Redmayne and Wife Hannah Make First Public Appearance Since Announcing Pregnancy", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509/http://www.instyle.com/news/eddie-redmayne-pregnant-wife-hannah-first-public-appearance", "description": "These two are just so cute.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121917-eddie-redmayne-pregnant-hannah-bagshawe-lead.jpg?itok=uuiGS_Sc"}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://www.instyle.com/news/eddie-redmayne-pregnant-wife-hannah-first-public-appearance", "description": "The couple stepped out for a charitable event in London on Monday.", "media": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121917-eddie-redmayne-pregnant-hannah-bagshawe-lead.jpg?itok=uuiGS_Sc"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://www.instyle.com/news/eddie-redmayne-pregnant-wife-hannah-first-public-appearance", "title": "Eddie Redmayne and Wife Hannah Make First Public Appearance Since Announcing Pregnancy", "description": "These two are just so cute.", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171222120509im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/12/121917-eddie-redmayne-pregnant-hannah-bagshawe-lead.jpg?itok=uuiGS_Sc"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
