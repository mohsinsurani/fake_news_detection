During an interview with the Southeast Missourian in February, Boyd described the accident as \"a very, very, very bad wreck,\" revealing that he'd \u201cshattered a lot of bones and shattered my hip, which has left me almost unable to use that leg for now.\u201d\n\nBoyd told the newspaper he was using his recovery time to work on music for an upcoming album, which he had hoped to release in 2019.\n\n\"Any time you're in a moment of struggle, God has a way of coming in and uplifting you. You have these 'down moments,' whether it be health or physical, like it is now, and it just feels like something great is about to happen once I get back on my feet and back in front of the audience again,\" Boyd said.\n\nAfter winning the $1 million prize on \"America's Got Talent,\" Boyd released his debut album, \u201cMy American Dream,\u201d in 2009.\n\nThe singer also dabbled in Missouri politics, running an unsuccessful campaign for a seat in the Missouri House of Representatives in 2012 and 2014.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_24/1345266/neal-boyd-americas-got-talent-today-tease-180611.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_24/1345266/neal-boyd-americas-got-talent-today-tease-180611.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_24/1345266/neal-boyd-americas-got-talent-today-tease-180611.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gina Vivinetto"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/former-america-s-got-talent-winner-neal-e-boyd-dies-t130706", "title": "Former 'America's Got Talent' winner Neal E.
