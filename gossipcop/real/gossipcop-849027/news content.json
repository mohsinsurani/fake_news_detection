Photo: Samir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nUp until now, the courtship between American actress Meghan Markle and roguish Prince Harry, has been proceeding at a perfectly private, glacial, Jane Austen\u2013like pace.\n\nPrince Harry sneaks a kiss at the Invictus Games. Photo: GRHO, RYMI, NGRE/GLH / Patriot Pics / NGRE / BACKGRID\n\nBut over the last week, the royal pair of the moment made a gradual coming out at the Invictus Games \u2014 the multi-sport event Prince Harry started for wounded veterans. Last weekend, they made their first public appearance but didn\u2019t sit together. Then, this week, they turned it up a notch and not only sat together in public but also held hands.\n\nYet, this weekend, the lovebirds really threw it all on the table. Not only did Prince Harry reportedly leave his seat to join Markle and her mom in their box, Harry was actually spotted planting a kiss on her cheek.\n\nOf course this gesture is still delicate enough to be part of the Royal Courtship Plan. But those watching closely predict that Harry could be bending the knee very soon. Or as some theorists are suggesting, perhaps this means they are already engaged?\n\n", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e7d/cfa/99467429ec4fed81b43eabc0526bf4ac91-1-HarryMeghan.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/823/344/da1a9dba9612177afdf60a604e71b306d0-1-TheKiss.h368.w245.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/93d/dd4/6993359860ee6cc420bb272619119c2cdf-elon-musk-settlement.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e7d/cfa/99467429ec4fed81b43eabc0526bf4ac91-1-HarryMeghan.rsquare.w700.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd4/409/28254d99ceca593534b46a52a9e49b452b-RISSI-AND-MIKO-SET-1152022.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e7d/cfa/99467429ec4fed81b43eabc0526bf4ac91-1-HarryMeghan.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Van Syckle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-have-their-first-public-kiss.html", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Have Their First Public Kiss", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "power, royals, prince harry, meghan markle, keeping up with the royals, the royal courtship plan, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Have Their First Public Kiss", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2017/10/prince-harry-and-meghan-markle-have-their-first-public-kiss.html", "description": "Does this mean they are already engaged?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e7d/cfa/99467429ec4fed81b43eabc0526bf4ac91-1-HarryMeghan.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Have Their First Public Kiss", "description": "Does this mean they are already engaged?", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e7d/cfa/99467429ec4fed81b43eabc0526bf4ac91-1-HarryMeghan.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@katievansyckle", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-01T14:51:45.942-04:00", "tag": "power, royals, prince harry, meghan markle, keeping up with the royals, the royal courtship plan", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/katie.syckle", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Finally Make Out in Public at the Invictus Games in Toronto.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "power, royals, prince harry, meghan markle, keeping up with the royals, the royal courtship plan", "author": "Katie Van Syckle", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506883905.942, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
