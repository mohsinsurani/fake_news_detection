The following year, he appeared in an episode of the Australian television medical drama All Saints. Lonsdale became a recurring member of the cast of the Australian teen drama series Dance Academy in the 2012 second season as the character Oliver Lloyd, who became a regular in the third and final season.\n\nLonsdale was a VJ on MTV for two and a half years.[7] He released a single on iTunes titled \"One and Only\" in 2014. He then played a supporting role as Uriah Pedrad in The Divergent Series: Insurgent (2015), the second film in the series,[8] later briefly reprising said role in The Divergent Series: Allegiant (2016). In 2016, his single \"Higher\" was included on Connor Franta's curated album Common Culture, volume 5.[9] Lonsdale next appeared in the historical drama The Finest Hours (2016) as Eldon Hanon, the youngest sailor involved in a rescue at sea.\n\nIn 2015, Lonsdale auditioned for the role of Jefferson Jackson, but the role was given to Franz Drameh.[10] Instead, he was cast as Wally West (the previously unknown son of Joe West) on CW's The Flash and became a regular supporting character in season two and as Kid Flash in season three.[11] In 2017, the character left The Flash and debuted on season three of Legends of Tomorrow.[12] That year, Lonsdale also appeared in an episode of Supergirl.[13]\n\nIn 2018, Lonsdale starred as Bram in the film Love, Simon, based on the novel Simon vs. the Homo Sapiens Agenda by Becky Albertalli about a teenage boy who struggles to come out. Lonsdale later said the role helped in coming to terms with his own sexuality.[14] Upon release, the film received positive reviews from critics,[15] and was dubbed historically significant, as it is the first film ever released by a major studio to focus on a gay teenage romance.[16][17]\n\nIn 2019, Lonsdale starred in Camila Cabello's music video for \"Liar\".[18] He has also released musical recordings, including \"Higher\" in 2015, \"Good Life\" in 2017, \"Kiss the Boy\" in 2018, and \"Preach\" in 2018.
