While some reports claim the pair are definitely back together, the So So Def producer recently revealed that it\u2019s actually nothing more than wishful thinking on behalf of their fans, according to The Jasmine Brand.\n\n\u201cAll of this is a speculation I guess when someone gets single. The fans actually really want to see us back together, so people have been championing this, but none of this is actually true,\u201d Dupri admits. \u201cI dated Janet damn near 10 years. I don\u2019t have to hide. Why would I sneak around with someone that y\u2019all know that I been with? I know her better than the man she met.\u201d\n\nLearn more about their rumored romance below.\n\nORIGINAL STORY: 9/26/2017\n\nJanet Jackson\u2019s marriage to Wissam Al-Mana was short-lived but reportedly still full of drama. In fact, her brother Randy Jackson claims the billionaire businessman was verbally and emotionally abusive to his younger sister, prompting their separation just weeks after the birth of their son, Eissa.\n\nReportedly, Jackson\u2019s ex Jermaine Dupri has been a shoulder to lean on, and the two have reconnected after eight years apart.\n\nAccording to sources at Bossip, \u201cThings have been heating back up between the former couple, who have recently reunited and not just for music making purposes.\u201d\n\nThe pair dated from 2001 until 2009, with Janet having this to say after confirming their split: \u201cJermaine is one of my best friends. I love him to death. We\u2019re still connected. We\u2019re still good friends. We still talk.\u201d\n\nThe So So Def founder spoke on his past relationship with the ageless beauty in 2016, saying he knows Janet entered his life for a reason, according to TheJasmineBrand.\n\n\u201cI believe that my life is a definition of a journey and inside that journey there were supposed to be things that happen and me having a relationship with her [Janet] I definitely know it was part of my life that I was thought a lot for these 8 yrs and I look at it like that.\n\nHe went on to say, \u201cI don\u2019t know if it was supposed to stay, but it was supposed to come into my life and teach me what I have learned.\n\nDo you think these two should give love another shot?", "images": ["https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CIARA-1st-cover-drop1-320x426.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/jada-pinkett-smith-image-1-158x90.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/ebony-logo.svg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/leonel-heisenberg-A56yu_pmNKQ-unsplash-235x132.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/dapper_dan-320x180.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Screen-Shot-2022-10-06-at-7.44.50-PM-320x180.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-collage-1-1000x552.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/UN_KeyArt_1920x1080-490x276.jpeg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/UN_KeyArt_1920x1080-158x90.jpeg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kiana-Lede_Eric-Williams-320x180.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/yvonne-orji-91222-image-1-158x90.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/CIARA-1st-cover-drop1-300x370.jpg", "http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-collage-1.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/1_8Poe4RXyCyue5RHy2HDwJg-320x180.jpeg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/happy-child-school-235x132.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/black-family-camping-10522-image-158x90.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/FTBU_02-235x132.jpg", "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/black-family-camping-10522-image-235x132.jpg"], "top_img": "http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-collage-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.ebony.com/janet-jackson-jermaine-dupri-back-together/", "title": "Jermaine Dupri on Rumors He Rekindled Relationship with Janet Jackson (UPDATE)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow", "description": "Janet Jackson Jermaine Dupri Back Together: Rumor has it Janet Jackson is open to giving love another chance with ex-boyfriend, Jermaine Dupri.", "googlebot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "bingbot": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jermaine Dupri on Rumors He Rekindled Relationship with Janet Jackson (UPDATE)", "description": "Janet Jackson Jermaine Dupri Back Together: Rumor has it Janet Jackson is open to giving love another chance with ex-boyfriend, Jermaine Dupri.", "url": "http://www.ebony.com/janet-jackson-jermaine-dupri-back-together/", "site_name": "Ebony", "image": "http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-collage-1.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ebonymag/", "published_time": "2018-01-19T09:07:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-16T13:34:38+00:00"}, "fb": {"app_id": 140414896817566}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jermaine Dupri on Rumors He Rekindled Relationship with Janet Jackson (UPDATE)", "image": "http://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Untitled-collage-1.jpg", "creator": "@EBONYMag", "site": "@EBONYMag"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.ebony.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/cropped-EB-icon-512-1-270x270.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516352864.0, "source": "https://www.ebony.com", "summary": ""}
