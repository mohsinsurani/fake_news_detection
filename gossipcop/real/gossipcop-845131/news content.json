In The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks (Sky Atlantic), an adaptation of the book of the same title by Rebecca Skloot that remained on bestseller lists for six years, she reminds us why. It is her film from beginning to end. She plays Deborah, the emotionally and physically unstable daughter of Henrietta Lacks, who suffers the torments of growing up not just motherless, but abused by family members and tortured by the knowledge that her mother was \u2013 and still is \u2013 being exploited for other peoples\u2019 gain.\n\nHenrietta Lacks was 31 and a mother of five children when she died at Baltimore\u2019s Johns Hopkins hospital of cervical cancer in 1951. The doctors there took a sample of her malignant tissues as part of their search for a line of cells that were able to survive and reproduce outside the body, and so make possible medical experiments they were not able to perform on living bodies. Henrietta\u2019s cells proved to be the ones, and \u2013 by forming the springboard for new treatments for diseases such as TB, flu, herpes, Aids and for the development of chemotherapy \u2013 changed the face of medicine for ever.\n\nThe doctors did not ask for their impoverished, black female patient\u2019s consent before they took that sample, out of a combination of professional zeal, arrogance, racism and paternalism whose precise proportions we can never know. Nor did they ever explain to her children whose blood they came and sampled, many times over the years, precisely what they were doing and why. Poor black bodies have a history of being common property. Deborah is keen to have her mother\u2019s story told by Skloot, a science journalist (played here by Rose Byrne, doing fine work in an essentially passive role), although her own paranoia \u2013 aggravated of course by the very real exploitation her family has suffered \u2013 and the family\u2019s distrust, reticence and other problems impede their progress as much as the medical establishment\u2019s deliberate and accidental (through the loss of records, documentation and so on) obstructions do.\n\nThe film does not do justice to the profoundly careful, detailed and intricate book \u2013 nor, more surprisingly, to Henrietta herself, who appears only in brief flashbacks as a beautiful smiling figure of absolute perfection rather than a living being. It touches on all the important themes \u2013 the power imbalance between ordinary people and the medical establishment, the historical injustices perpetrated by the latter against black people \u2013 but doesn\u2019t have time to expand on or investigate any of them thoroughly. And there are odd, inexplicable pivots such as when Skloot sits down with the family and they suddenly change the habits of a lifetime and begin to \u201cspeak on the dead\u201d, providing her and Deborah with stories of Henrietta that they have withheld from her daughter for a lifetime. Why? Because they trust or esteem this white journalist newcomer more than their own kin? It seems unlikely.\n\nBut none of this matters, because Winfrey carries all before her. Part of Deborah is a child still mired in grief, part of her is a savvy adult (\u201cKeep on being white,\u201d she says wryly to Skloot, as she manages to gain access to more information about Henrietta in a few months than the family has managed over years) and all of her is periodically wracked by bouts of mental illness. Winfrey conveys all of Deborah\u2019s violent irascibility, misery and frustration, underlain by her eternal yearning for her lost mother, and breaks your heart at every turn. It is a slalom race of a part and she negotiates every hairpin bend with utter certainty and consummate skill. If the film pushes Henrietta to the edges, it is at least to make room for a performance from Winfrey that tells us all there is to know about the damage that loss, lies and injustice can do to a child, to an adult, to a family and to a society. She is extraordinary.\n\nThe last episode of Paula (BBC2) descended into a maelstrom of madness. I\u2019m still trying to make sense of it, but I\u2019m not entirely sure it\u2019s possible. It was as if someone had gathered up a load of endings from various different thrillers and stuck them together with some very poor quality, nasty-smelling glue.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/uploads/2017/10/09/Lucy-Mangan,-R.png?width=300&quality=85&auto=format&fit=max&s=ac80477b5fecbdb9d0fb635d622b0eea", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50dc0e70326e6bedff30478a225851d4f91eb47d/1422_245_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34ab7066ab3c80b8abdb7aa88f601a97", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Television%2COprah+Winfrey%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CCulture", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50dc0e70326e6bedff30478a225851d4f91eb47d/1422_245_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/50dc0e70326e6bedff30478a225851d4f91eb47d/1422_245_3051_1831/master/3051.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctZGVmYXVsdC5wbmc&enable=upscale&s=34ab7066ab3c80b8abdb7aa88f601a97", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lucy Mangan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2017/jun/09/oprah-winfrey-immortal-life-henrietta-lacks-sky-atlantic", "title": "The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks review \u2013 Oprah is extraordinary", "meta_data": {"description": "There are odd moments, inexplicable pivots and it fails to do justice to its eponymous hero, but none of that matters when Winfrey is on screen.
