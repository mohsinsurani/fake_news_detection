And I mean, why wouldn\u2019t he be? He\u2019s smart (I think). He\u2019s handsome. He\u2019s funny. He\u2019s handsome. Did we mention handsome? Where was I? Oh yeah, this dude began his Bachelorette tenure with a vaguely racist comment and he would STILL be a better Bachelor than the last like, five dudes we\u2019ve had (minus Ben, you\u2019re perfect). Let\u2019s see\u2026 he doesn\u2019t have a speech impediment, isn\u2019t a raging misogynist, and also isn\u2019t responsible for anyone\u2019s death as far as we know, so sign me tf up. And by me I mean him. But also me. To compete on his season. Yeah, okay, you get it. Moving on.\n\nLast night\u2019s Men Tell All didn\u2019t reveal who the next Bachelor would be, so it\u2019s no surprise that #DeanforBachelor was trending on Twitter during the episode. I\u2019m honestly just surprised that enough people were able to break themselves away from the spell Dean\u2019s eyes cast upon them for long enough to create a hashtag, but I would like to thank those heroic Americans for their service to this country. But will Dean Unglert be the next Bachelor? Sorry, Deanie Babies. It\u2019s not looking likely. Let\u2019s look at the evidence.\n\nExhibit A: Dean is on Bachelor in Paradise. While I\u2019m fully aware that being on Bachelor in Paradise does not preclude you from becoming The Bachelor, having Dean be on The Bachelorette and then Bachelor in Paradise two weeks later and THEN be The Bachelor seems like a lot. He would have to have Nick Viall levels of blackmail material on everyone working at ABC in order to pull that off, and I just don\u2019t see that happening for a relative rookie to the franchise. However, I am in no way suggesting that my eyes, ears, or soul would tire of seeing Dean on my television screen, in case anyone from ABC is reading this. When it comes to how many consecutive hours of Dean I could feasibly watch on TV:\n\nExhibit B: Dean said he is not ready to be The Bachelor. I know\u2014I\u2019m already crafting my excuse to call out of work sick tomorrow so I can deal with this news, too. But it\u2019s (reportedly) true. Dean supposedly told The Hollywood Reporter, which sounds like a fake news outlet if I\u2019ve ever heard one, \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m ready yet, at this point in my life.\u201d Dean\u2019s right; he\u2019s got to rack up a good thousand more Instagram followers before he can truly be \u201cready.\u201d However, he did add, \u201cOf course, I would never immediately dismiss any offer, but I\u2019d really have to sit down and really think about it.\u201d I think that\u2019s our cue to create a GoFundMe to come up with the extra cash ABC needs to present Dean with an offer he can\u2019t refuse, right? I\u2019ll set one up just in case.\n\nSo I mean, who really knows what will happen. I think I speak for all of us when I say that if ABC tries to pull some fuckery and Nick Viall us again with some lame-ass dude from three seasons ago, I will personally burn the studio to the ground.", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=588217684700940&ev=PageView\n\t\t&noscript=1", "https://betches.com/wp-content/plugins/a3-lazy-load/assets/images/lazy_placeholder.gif", "https://betches.com/wp-content/themes/betches-2021/assets-img/gif-mascot-articles.gif", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/6a995ad748b7867f1d3e60b8b4623101?s=96&d=mm&r=g", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-ZqRuYBtPWtPaq.gif", "https://d24bnpykhxwj9p.cloudfront.net/s3file/s3fs-public/users1/2017-08/Tue/giphy%20%281%29_0.gif"], "top_img": "https://d24bnpykhxwj9p.cloudfront.net/s3file/s3fs-public/users1/2017-08/Tue/giphy%20%281%29_0.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Betches Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://betches.com/will-dean-unglert-be-the-next-bachelor/", "title": "Sorry Everyone, Dean Unglert Is Probably Not The Next Bachelor", "meta_data": {"facebook-domain-verification": "6qqpx3gpczagbs3x011wbysboop762", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "ahrefs-site-verification": "816d47663ea477d9bb41ce45e2525282b9b6373557042d1d775bf52d9714be81", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sorry Everyone, Dean Unglert Is Probably Not The Next Bachelor - Betches", "description": "Dean Unglert, green-eyed Ken doll and America\u2019s boyfriend, is on many people\u2019s short list to be the next Bachelor.
