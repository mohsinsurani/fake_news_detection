Sources tell Variety that Showtime is developing a sequel series to the show that aired from 2004 to 2009. Many original cast members are attached to the reboot in producing and acting roles.\n\nRachel Shelley as Helena, Pam Grier as Kit, Mia Kirshner as Jenny, Katherine Moennig as Shane, Jennifer Beals as Bette, Laurel Holloman as Tina, Leisha Hailey as Alice, and Rose Rollins as Tasha Williams in \"The L Word.\" Don Flood / Showtime\n\nBased on the original series, the reboot of \"The L Word\" would center around a new ensemble of women, following their lives, loves and tribulations. However, if the project is greenlit, stars Jennifer Beals, Kate Moennig and Leisha Hailey are expected to serve as executive producers and appear in the series with their characters as a point of connection from the prior series to the new one. Other characters from the original series may also appear in the new version.\n\nShowtime declined to comment.\n\n\"The L Word\" was created by Ilene Chaiken, who will serve as an executive producer on the Showtime revival. She will remain showrunner on Fox's \"Empire\" and continue to develop projects for 20th Century Fox Television under her overall deal with the studio, and is also an executive producer on Hulu's \"The Handmaid's Tale.\" Chaiken has been outspoken about her own identity as a lesbian, and has regularly featured LGBTQ relationships on \"Empire.\" Insiders say the idea for the sequel series first came from Chaiken.\n\nShowtime is currently in the process of bringing on a new writer, executive producer and showrunner who specifically has ties to the lesbian community to bring a fresh perspective to the show by documenting how relationships and experiences have evolved today, and what has changed and hasn't changed, since the show first aired.\n\n\"The L Word\" ran for six seasons. After wrapping up its run on Showtime in 2009, the series aired in syndication on Logo. The original followed the lives of a group of lesbians and their friends, played by Beals, Hailey, Moennig, Laurel Holloman, Mia Kirshner and Pam Grier. The groundbreaking series was credited for bringing lesbian characters to the forefront of television, and was nominated for and won many GLAAD Media Awards.\n\nFollow NBC Out on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201703/a_ov_out_beforeifall_170302.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/l-word-sequel-series-development-showtime-n781851", "title": "'The L Word' Sequel Series in Development at Showtime", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/feature/nbc-out/l-word-sequel-series-development-showtime-n781851", "title": "'The L Word' sequel series in development at Showtime", "description": "Showtime is reportedly developing a sequel series to the show about a group of Los Angeles lesbians that aired from 2004 to 2009.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "title": "'The L Word' sequel series in development at Showtime", "description": "Showtime is reportedly developing a sequel series to the show about a group of Los Angeles lesbians that aired from 2004 to 2009.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Showtime is reportedly developing a sequel series to the show about a group of Los Angeles lesbians that aired from 2004 to 2009.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "'The L Word' sequel series in development at Showtime", "description": "Showtime is reportedly developing a sequel series to the show about a group of Los Angeles lesbians that aired from 2004 to 2009.", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "type": "article", "unibrow": "OUT Pop Culture", "authorName1": "Variety", "authorName2": "Reuters"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Tue Jul 11 2017 17:57:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Tue Jul 11 2017 18:01:32 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_05/1920811/170302-l-word-jennifer-beals-cast-316p.jpg", "next-head-count": 101}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499795820.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
