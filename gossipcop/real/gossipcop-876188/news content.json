They were unable to keep their hands off each other as they posed on the red carpet.\n\nHowever, it is really possible you didn\u2019t even realize that it was Rose posing with the rapper because she looked totally unrecognizable!\n\nOh hey \ud83c\udf39 A post shared by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Aug 27, 2017 at 10:17pm PDT\n\nShe was wearing a custom black, sparkling gown by Yousef Aljasmi which perfectly displayed her famous curves.\n\nShe stepped away from her go-to platinum shaved hairstyle and donned a brunette wig.\n\nE! News talked to the model ahead of the show, and she dished about her new look but what\u2019s more important is the fact that she noted that she might end up releasing a rap song one of these days.\n\nShe will do all this with the help of her man, Savage.\n\nAmber was previously married to Wiz Khalifa, and she also dated Kanye West. She has now completely fallen for her new man, and she takes to Instagram to gush over him as much as possible.\n\nSweethearts \ud83d\ude0d A post shared by Amber Rose (@amberrose) on Aug 27, 2017 at 10:28pm PDT\n\n\u2018It\u2019s pretty amazing waking up every morning feeling love like this,\u2019 Rose told her 15.9 million fans in July.\n\n\u2018I\u2019ve cried endlessly and been hurt a lot in my life, I\u2019ve been abused, talked to like I wasn\u2019t s\u2013t, been gaslighted and slut shamed by men that I once loved and cared about.\u2019\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAmber continued saying that, \u2018I\u2019m so thankful that God brought this amazing person in my life who genuinely has my back and is ready to \u2018pull up\u2019 to defend my honor by any means. Maybe he\u2019s just as broken as me and that\u2019s why we\u2019re perfect for each other but either way, he\u2019s not going anywhere and neither am I.\u2019", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Why-The-Weeknd-Pulled-A-No-Show-At-The-MTV-VMAs-Revealed-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://2.gravatar.com/avatar/57ebe458713c79d451a0d6e2d9853c2b?s=60&d=mm&r=g", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Webp.net-resizeimage-10-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Inside-Vicki-Gunvalson-And-Tamra-Judges-Nastiest-Fight-Ever-The-Former-Friends-Caused-Pure-Hell-In-Iceland-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Danielle-Staub-Fianc\u00e9-Marty-Caffrey-300x256.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Kenya-Moore-Kandi-Burruss-Avoids-Drama-300x243.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amber-Rose-Is-Unrecognizable-While-Making-Her-Red-Carpet-Debut-With-21-Savage-At-The-2017-MTV-VMAs.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Gabourey-Sidibe-Jussie-Smollett-Friendship-300x245.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kenya-Moore-Fights-With-Nene-Leakes-And-Kim-Zolciak-300x196.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/21-Savage-And-Amber-Rose-SOHH-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tameka-Tiny-Harris-Redhead-Change-300x244.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Webp.net-resizeimage-4-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Amber-Rose-Is-Unrecognizable-While-Making-Her-Red-Carpet-Debut-With-21-Savage-At-The-2017-MTV-VMAs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170903090038/http://celebrityinsider.org/amber-rose-is-unrecognizable-while-making-her-red-carpet-debut-with-21-savage-at-the-2017-mtv-vmas-62470/", "title": "Amber Rose Is Unrecognizable While Making Her Red Carpet Debut With 21 Savage At The 2017 MTV VMAs", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "amber rose, VMAs 2017,", "keywords": "celebrity news, amber rose, VMAs 2017,", "description": "Amber Rose and Savage made their red carpet debut as a couple at the 2017 MTV Video Music Awards.
