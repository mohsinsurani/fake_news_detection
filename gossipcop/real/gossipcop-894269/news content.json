This was no small feat because their grandma is Ms. Diana Ross, and yet it happened. After performing a medley of some of her biggest hits, Ms. Ross began calling her grandkids up to the stage one at a time. One of the first to arrive was Jagger Snow Ross, daughter of Evan Ross and Ashlee Simpson. She marked the momentous occasion by picking her nose on stage.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

He then read off the official goodnight from the teleprompter (while another Ross grandkid picked her nose). Does Ashlee Simpson really know how lucky she is?\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.
