He said it\u2019s likely the disorderly conduct charge could eventually be expunged from the rapper\u2019s record.\n\n\u201cThey overcharged him,\u201d Norwood said. \u201cThey tried to get him for inciting a riot. The video did not show any of that.\u201d\n\nRogers PD / Splash\n\nThe publication reported the rapper was required to pay $6,825.31 to two people who said they were injured at the concert, including $640 in court associated costs.\n\nKeith Foster, a spokesman for the Rogers Police Department, told PEOPLE at the time that Scott had \u201cencouraged people to rush the stage and bypass security protocols to ensure concert goer safety.\u201d\n\n\u201cDuring the rush to the stage several people were injured, including an employee from the security company hired to help monitor and control the crowd, and a member of the police department. The injured subjects were treated at the AMP by members of the Rogers Fire Department and Mercy Medical.\u201d\n\nScott recently welcomed newborn daughter Stormi Webster with girlfriend Kylie Jenner.\n\nBob Levey/Getty\n\nThe beauty mogul announced her first child\u2019s birth with a social-media post and accompanying video montage on Feb. 4, writing on Instagram, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for keeping you in the dark through all the assumptions. I understand you\u2019re used to me bringing you along on all my journeys. My pregnancy was one I chose not to do in front of the world.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI knew for myself I needed to prepare for this role of a lifetime in the most positive, stress free, and healthy way I knew how. There was no gotcha moment, no big paid reveal I had planned. I knew my baby would feel every stress and every emotion so I chose to do it this way for my little life and our happiness.\u201d", "images":
