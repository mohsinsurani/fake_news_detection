I took her words to heart and responded privately after taking the time to process what she had said.\u201d\n\n\u201cI continue to support the movement that is happening in our culture,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is necessary and long overdue.\u201d\n\nWaithe, 33, previously touched on the Ansari allegation in an interview with KPCC\u2019s The Frame.\n\n\u201cHere\u2019s the truth \u2014 in every situation, it\u2019s not always black-and-white,\u201d she said last month. \u201cAnd I know that\u2019s simple for people, and it\u2019s easy for people to [ask], \u2018Whose side are you on?\u2019 There are no sides, really, in some of these scenarios.\u201d", "images":
