The tiff escalated and ended with Priestley being hauled out of the party by security after he hurled a jab Weinstein\u2019s way.\n\nThe drama was dragged into the spotlight on Monday after Mira Sorvino tweeted her reaction to the confirmation that Weinstein had blacklisted her for rebuffing his advances, telling director Peter Jackson not to hire her or fellow actress Ashley Judd. \u201cThere it is, confirmation that Harvey Weinstein derailed my career, something I suspected but was unsure,\u201d she wrote.\n\nIn response to her tweet, actress Tara Strong speculated that perhaps Priestley had been blacklisted by the producer as well after he punched him in the face.
