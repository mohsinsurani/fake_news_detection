While Kathy never went so far as to intern at one of her daughter\u2019s previous gigs as a writer on \u201c30 Rock\u201d and \u201cThe Mindy Project,\u201d Wigfield, 33, says, \u201cHer personality is very much Carol on the show. She\u2019s outspoken and very much up in my business all the time and checking my thyroid and putting her hand down my shirt.\u201d\n\nThat specific boundary-crossing act appears in the two-episode premiere (Tuesday at 9 p.m. on NBC), as do other real-life examples \u2014 helped by the fact that Wigfield\u2019s younger sister, Ashley, is also a writer on the show. Heelan (\u201cGround Floor\u201d) plays a slightly younger version of Wigfield, who\u2019s torn between still needing her mother and not wanting to need her \u2014 a role that felt especially relevant to the actress, who is a new mom to a weeks-old daughter with husband Rene Gube.\n\n\u201c[That] was kind of amazing, knowing that I was having a girl when we were filming a mother-daughter show,\u201d says Heelan, 30. \u201cBefore this child popped out of me, [I thought] yes, I would never be overbearing like that and I\u2019m not gonna scare her with horrible dramatic things that could happen to her and constantly be hovering or trying to control who she dates. But then when I look at her face now, I\u2019m like, \u2018Girl, I can\u2019t promise you I\u2019m not gonna do any of that crazy stuff.\u2019\n\n\u201cI have a lot more compassion for mothers everywhere.\u201d\n\n\u2018Her personality is very much Carol on the show. She\u2019s outspoken and very much up in my business all the time and checking my thyroid and putting her hand down my shirt.\u2019 - Tracey Wigfield on her mother's similarity to 'Great News' character\n\nIn \u201cGreat News,\u201d the confidence-challenged Katie soon warms up to the idea of her cheerleader-in-chief mother being around the office, not least because of Carol\u2019s unfiltered way of talking to her superiors. Though Heelan first met her TV mom Martin at their first rehearsal, she also immediately wanted to be around the Broadway legend all the time.\n\n\u201cAs the daughter, if your mom\u2019s in the room, you feel grounded, you feel comforted by that person and we instantly had that,\u201d she says. \u201cEven in social situations, when we weren\u2019t working, if she\u2019s there, I want to be next to her. I had so much to learn from her, too. As an actor, it was like Christmas.\u201d\n\nThe ensemble cast is rounded out by \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum Horatio Sanz as the staff video editor, Adam Campbell as the executive producer, Wigfield as the channel\u2019s nerdy meteorologist, John Michael Higgins as \u201cThe Breakdown\u201ds blowhard co-anchor and Nicole Richie (yes, of \u201cThe Simple Life\u201d fame) as the hip co-host he\u2019s perpetually butting heads with.\n\n\u201c[Nicole] came in and auditioned \u2026 and she nailed it,\u201d Wigfield says. \u201cI always thought she was really funny on \u2018The Simple Life\u2019 but she obviously hasn\u2019t done a ton of scripted acting. I was so pleasantly surprised that she was really good and very precise and had great timing. I\u2019m excited for people to see her.\u201d\n\n\u201cGreat News\u201d Series premiere 9 p.m. Tuesday on NBC", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/tv_great3a.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6&comscorekw=entertainment", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/tv_great1a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=300", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/chloe-grace-moretz-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/pitbull-mauling-317.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ron-DeSantis-Ana-Navarro.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/wwe-sara-lee.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1665186647&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/tv_great3a.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/jen-shah-417.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/04/tv_great3a.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Andrea Morabito"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/04/24/real-life-mom-daughter-duo-played-for-laughs-on-great-news/", "title": "\u2018Great News\u2019 is a comedic nod to creator\u2019s overbearing mom", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
