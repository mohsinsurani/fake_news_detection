Sheree Whitfield tells Us Weekly that she doesn\u2019t see her Real Housewives of Atlanta costars forgiving Phaedra Parks anytime soon after that bombshell reunion finale last week.\n\n\u201cMy heart dropped so far,\u201d Whitfield recalled of the explosive moment when host Andy Cohen called out Parks for spreading the \u201cmegawatt lie\u201d that fellow castmate Kandi Burruss and her husband, Todd Tucker, were planning to drug and take home Porsha Williams. \u201cI was in shock! We were all in shock.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if she thinks Parks will be forgiven, Whitfield, who is currently on her Wives, Fianc\u00e9es, and Side-Chicks of Hotlanta book tour, told Us she doesn\u2019t see them mending things in the near future.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know, it\u2019s so hard right now. It\u2019s hard to establish trust with someone like that because, for me, it seemed that she showed no remorse for what she did and for her actions,\u201d Whitfield explained. \u201cI think it will be hard for any of the women to forgive.\u201d\n\nAs for Parks\u2019 exit from the series \u2014 Us Weekly previously confirmed she\u2019s out for season 10 \u2014 Whitfield is uncertain how she feels.\n\n\u201cI never want to take money out of anyone\u2019s pockets and that\u2019s not who I am, but in this instance, it\u2019s hard to say,\u201d the reality star concluded.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/107533364_phaedra-parks-sheree-whitfield-zoom-320eaa41-6fe6-4b69-881c-15dab4f911f7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/107533364_phaedra-parks-sheree-whitfield-zoom-320eaa41-6fe6-4b69-881c-15dab4f911f7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sheree-whitfield-talks-dramatic-rhoa-reunion-w482177/", "title": "Sheree Whitfield Talks Dramatic \u2018RHOA\u2019 Reunion", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Sheree Whitfield tells Us Weekly that she doesn\u2019t see the \u2018RHOA\u2019 women forgiving Phaedra Parks anytime soon \u2014 more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "RHOA'S Sheree Whitfield: \u2018It Will Be Hard\u2019 to Forgive Phaedra", "description": "Sheree Whitfield tells Us Weekly that she doesn\u2019t see the \u2018RHOA\u2019 women forgiving Phaedra Parks anytime soon \u2014 more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sheree-whitfield-talks-dramatic-rhoa-reunion-w482177/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:04:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/107533364_phaedra-parks-sheree-whitfield-zoom-320eaa41-6fe6-4b69-881c-15dab4f911f7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/107533364_phaedra-parks-sheree-whitfield-zoom-320eaa41-6fe6-4b69-881c-15dab4f911f7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-05-12T22:47:12+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:04:05+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "RHOA'S Sheree Whitfield: \u2018It Will Be Hard\u2019 to Forgive Phaedra", "description": "Sheree Whitfield tells Us Weekly that she doesn\u2019t see the \u2018RHOA\u2019 women forgiving Phaedra Parks anytime soon \u2014 more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/107533364_phaedra-parks-sheree-whitfield-zoom-320eaa41-6fe6-4b69-881c-15dab4f911f7.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494629232.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
