This is the first time Harry and William have spoken about their mother's death in a documentary, although there have been many documentaries about the Princess in the past including Diana: Her True Story (1993), Diana: The Witnesses In The Tunnel (2007), and Unlawful Killing(2011).\n\nDiana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy will also include interviews from friends of Princess Diana's who have never spoken publicly before.\n\nPrince Harry, 32, was just 12 when he lost his mother and Prince William, 35, was 15.\n\nIn the new documentary, Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy, William and Harry reminisce over old childhood photos with their mom.\n\nWilliam turned to his brother in the promo and said that they were both in the photo, pointing at a picture of a pregnant Diana saying that Harry was \"in the tummy.\"\n\nThe Royals remembered Princess Diana as being \"very informal\" and enjoying \"laughter and fun.\"\n\nAlthough the men lost their mother almost two decades ago, Prince Harry got emotional saying that \"she still is our mum.\"\n\nHe added that Diana \"smothered us with love, that's for sure.\"\n\nOxford Film and Television is producing the documentary film and said that the Royal siblings also \"offer their perspective on the Princess' unique contribution to public life, including her charitable and humanitarian work.\"\n\nITV's Jo Clinton-Davis said that the new film would offer a \"fresh and revealing insight\" into Princess Diana's personal life with \"intimate reflections\" of her two sons, friends and family, to create a \"definitive portrait of a unique person who touched the lives of millions,\" according to the Telegraph.\n\nWill you watch Diana, Our Mother: Her Life and Legacy?
