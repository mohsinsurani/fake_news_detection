Now, eight months after welcoming a baby boy named Jennings, there's another bundle of joy on the way.\n\n\"Some might say I\u2019m crazy. Some might call me a glutton for punishment. I\u2019d say I\u2019m a little bit of both,\" Maynard wrote in a blog post for People.com. \"But more than anything, I\u2019m just so excited for this summer to get here. Why you ask? Well \u2026 I\u2019m pregnant. Again.\"\n\nMaynard said that she realized that she'd given birth to Jennings \"like, two seconds ago,\" and added, \"I guess I should\u2019ve read that part in the baby handbook that says you\u2019re super fertile after giving birth, huh?\"\n\nBut unexpected or not, she and Johnson couldn't be happier about their growing family.\n\n\"I said about two weeks after Jennings was born that I couldn\u2019t wait to have another,\" Maynard explained. \"I just had no clue it would happen so quickly! Some of my closest friends have had a really hard time getting pregnant and my heart breaks for them, so I\u2019m just so grateful for this blessing God has given our family.\"\n\nThis will be the third child for Maynard, who also has a 10-year-old daughter, Ricki, from her relationship with late NASCAR driver Ricky Hendrick.\n\nSo much has changed in Maynard's life over the past few years. In 2011, she received the final rose from Brad Womack on Season 15 of \"The Bachelor.\" But months after the finale, they parted ways.\n\nMORE: 'Bachelorette' star Emily Maynard welcomes baby \u2014 see the first pic!\n\nThe following year, Maynard looked for love again on \"The Bachelorette.\" But despite another seemingly happy ending with contestant Jef Holm, they too broke off their engagement.\n\nIn 2013, she met now-husband Johnson.\n\n\"I\u2019m living proof that God has an incredible plan for each of us, we just have to be patient enough to wait for Him and His timing!\" she wrote.\n\nFollow Ree Hines on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg",
