Up to now, things have been pretty confusing as the show focused on Ally (Sarah Paulson), a woman with a host of phobias who\u2019s been seemingly terrorized by a group of murder clowns who, at least at points, seemed like they might have been in her head.\n\nOver time, the show has developed the fact that Kai (Evan Peters) is actually the chief creator of chaos on the show. And in Episode 4, we finally see him really at work, taking the side of vulnerable people, no matter what they believe, in order to draw them into his plot.\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult': Important 2016 Election Facts You Need to Remember\n\nIt seems Kai is the guy behind the clown cult, with its bloody smiley face insignia, and in Episode 4 we see him convince one person to commit murder and another to cut off his own hand on Election Night to ensure he could \u201cpull the lever for go f\u2013k yourself\u201d (Trump, as it happens).\n\nSome of the pieces are coming together \u2014 Harrison (Billy Eichner) and Meadow (Leslie Grossman) are apparently a part of the clown cult, as is newscaster Beverly (Adina Porter) \u2014 and Kai is definitely involved in murders. And his actions in the first three episodes might mean that the goal of the clowns terrorizing Ally is to get her to join up, like the other characters he\u2019s targeted.\n\nBut the questions still outweigh the answers. There\u2019s the weird chemical spray truck and Harrison\u2019s crazy plastic barrels (which are of the variety Walter White used to dissolve bodies on \u201cBreaking Bad,\u201d if you remember). Nothing about Winter (Billie Lourd), Kai\u2019s Hillary-supporting, liberal stereotype sister, seems to make sense at all. And what about Ivy (Alison Pill), who apparently didn\u2019t just know Winter before she and Ally hired her to be their nanny, but kidnapped a guy with her?\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult' Fans Are Finally Putting It All Together\n\nIt\u2019s not that the hints that \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d is dropping aren\u2019t landing. The first three episodes did a solid job of portraying Kai first as a bigot, then as a manipulator, before finally putting the pieces together to show him as a charismatic murder-leader. There were plenty of clues popping up about Harrison and Meadow, and fans have been suspicious of Ivy from the start.\n\nBut what\u2019s interesting, and ultimately confusing, is just how much information the show is throwing at people, and how many questions it\u2019s raising. Not just about who\u2019s in the cult, but what the cult is trying to do, and how seemingly unrelated elements factor in as well.\n\nIt\u2019s a lot like \u201cLost,\u201d really. Not only is there the hatch to wonder about, but there\u2019s the polar bear. And the bus. And the monster. And the numbers. And the strange connection that seems to bind all the characters together.\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult' Fans Can't Help But Ask, 'Why Are You Wearing Sombreros?'\n\n\u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d has that kind of stuff going on as well, and it\u2019s still not even close to clear how everything fits together. For instance, we know Kai is a cult leader, and we know he\u2019s recruited several people \u2014 but we haven\u2019t seen anyone as the clowns yet. And the murder of Serina (Emma Roberts) seems to have taken place before any of the other clown murders, as Kai was recruiting Beverly. Three clowns were present for that one. They could have been Kai, Meadow and Harrison, but it seems a bit early to take your new pals out on a murder spree. So does that mean Kai has other recruits waiting in the wings (with knives) that we haven\u2019t seen yet?\n\nThere\u2019s one other element that\u2019s exploding a lot of fans\u2019 theories and attempts to understand \u201cAHS: Cult\u201d after four episodes: Harrison and Meadow. At the end of Episode 3, \u201cNeighbors from Hell,\u201d Meadow disappeared and Harrison was found covered in blood. Earlier in the episode, the cult\u2019s smiley face mark was seen on their house.\n\nWhy would Kai and the cult target their own? There have been hints about why the cult might kill Meadow, but why leave Harrison alive, when he could potentially turn on everybody? (Also, a quick tangent: Honestly, what is going on with Winter?)\n\nAlso Read: 'American Horror Story: Cult' Fans Agree: Ozzy Has the Right Idea\n\nWith weird additional elements like the chemical sprayers, it might be a mistake to think that everything in \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d is connected, or at least, connected to the cult. As has been the case in previous seasons of the anthology series, sometimes the links between ancillary things and the main story are a bit tenuous \u2014 the scares are more important than everything making sense together.\n\nThen again, maybe we\u2019re just thinking about this mystery wrong. Maybe fans aren\u2019t seeing the big picture yet. Maybe Kai\u2019s clown cult isn\u2019t the only clown cult in town.\n\nIt might be confusing, but trying to puzzle out where \u201cAmerican Horror Story: Cult\u201d is headed is the most fun part of the season so far.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/american-horror-story-cult-grocery-store-clown.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thewrap-film-slate.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/de0e8e974cafc73bc1d4da210275ae4c?s=96&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thewrap.com%2Fwp-content%2Fthemes%2Fthewrap-canvas%2Fimgs%2Fthewrap-gravatar.png&r=g", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/american-horror-story-cult-characters-ranked.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo_Small.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo-Stacked.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Image-2022-04-26-at-3.00.43-PM-300x81.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/american-horror-story-cult-grocery-store-clown.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Phil Hornshaw"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/american-horror-story-cult-is-the-most-confusing-mystery-since-lost/", "title": "\u2018American Horror Story: Cult\u2019 Is the Most Confusing Mystery Since \u2018Lost,\u2019 and That\u2019s Fine (Commentary)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f9f9f9", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-title": "\u2018American Horror Story: Cult\u2019 Is the Most Confusing Mystery Since \u2018Lost,\u2019 and That\u2019s Fine (Commentary)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/american-horror-story-cult-is-the-most-confusing-mystery-since-lost/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-09-26T22:46:57-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Phil Hornshaw", "parsely-tags": "adina-porter, alison_pill, american-horror-story-cult, billie-lourd, billy_eichner, emma_roberts, evan-peters, fx-network, leslie-grossman, sarah_paulson", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/american-horror-story-cult-grocery-store-clown-160x105.jpg"}, "description": "Is everybody in the clown cult?
