News\u2018 latest sneak peek at Sunday\u2019s new episode of Total Bellas, the WWE star reveals to twin sister Brie the happy news that she\u2019s reconciled with John Cena \u2014 and that he agreed to reverse his vasectomy and give her a child.\n\n\u201cCan you believe he\u2019s going to give me a baby?\u201d she gushes.\n\n\u201cGet pregnant with me, on my second!\u201d says Brie, who\u2019s already a mom of one. \u201cOh my gosh. Could you imagine if we were pregnant at the same time?\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019d be crazy,\u201d says Nikki. \u201cI just can\u2019t believe I get to be a mom \u2014 and with the man of my dreams. I don\u2019t have to go find some guy to have a baby with.\u201d\n\nWhen the twins\u2019 mom Kathy shows up, things get even more emotional.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s been such an emotional couple of weeks,\u201d says Kathy, tearing up. \u201cI didn\u2019t want it to be done, but I knew you had to go through what you had to and I\u2019m just so proud of both of you \u2014 you and John.\u201d\n\nOf course, with the wedding back on, so is the stress that comes with planning.\n\n\u201cI feel like I\u2019m still trying to process that John and I are back on and now I have to get back into wedding planning mode,\u201d says Nikki. \u201cAnd since we want to keep our same date, I am very behind. I feel like I have ideas in my head, but I think the only thing I actually have locked in right now is a place and an amazing wedding planning team.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: John Cena and Nikki Bella Step Out Together for First Time in 4 Weeks After Calling Off Wedding\n\nHowever, there may still be trouble ahead: In PEOPLE\u2019s exclusive look at the rest of the season, Nikki questions if she needs to call off the wedding again due to \u201cdeeper problems.\u201d\n\nIn April, Bella ended the engagement three weeks before her and Cena\u2019s May 5 wedding date. Sources previously told PEOPLE that her decision to call it quits was due to their differing stances on marriage and having kids.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed earlier this month that they are back together.\n\nTotal Bellas airs Sundays (9 p.m. ET) on E!", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/9r3NawaPjzfiwuaQyzhs_UrwmZE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(399x0:401x2)/espy-awards-24-1-c1203bad66f94bcf8a43457ca45f6163.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/xV-Dxlfp_-tueFdjHESXK8q0UmE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/gettyimages-1005369986-6ddabf3e4731429b8716a79c5f4b8918.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7JuzQXKnoUpz1V1Ug80tsV_8H-I=/1539x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/john-cena4-8fa7ff0844554d02b35357ea08982512.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/P_G1SwMB-Odzqir5ECtYuHnR-0M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(768x0:770x2)/john-cena4-8fa7ff0844554d02b35357ea08982512.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/E5E9SgAlcDEPcdqUhGXGhZBdIbo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(902x0:904x2)/screen-shot-2018-07-26-at-10-35-41-am-1e96a134666048b8a50bc1c089e45300.png", "https://people.com/thmb/ywFSTb0Winhe7k4TI4y-h1mfrfE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/nikki-bella-john-cena-2ec12ab6eb1446ef93bf871ce06f6d3a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rLXTiqa0XUZ6kNhqRWEV7QPjHbw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(806x0:808x2)/john-cena1-c92c1d28ac8b4d398deff49e7779cec3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/mEHmJA90OaYPLApyTvNoaATYfZ8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(665x0:667x2)/img_1659-1-2000-2f8047f1b93f42c2a860224f16b22b11.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/M37JLBK8Nu2kVyAVo-2hqRDm7Jw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/nikki-bella1-8441a2ee4cb549b2890940418d36b355.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/2_yrJJuXOjcOAZndhPga41yrp-M=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/artem-chigvinstev-7e33cee9d1ad4161a6caf8df68ac2a41.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/l3QYGTsO6ypbfR90n_vRWyYRbO4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/bella-twins-1-2000-ff92cbae1f2c40308df32b7a8fbb31c5.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/XDCf05W2UgvDT1WvtKivlPmf3IA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/nikki-bella2-1-2000-baefb7f74b8c45db907d4913ae9b790b.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/7JuzQXKnoUpz1V1Ug80tsV_8H-I=/1539x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/john-cena4-8fa7ff0844554d02b35357ea08982512.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aurelie Corinthios"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-talks-babies-after-john-cena-reconciliation/", "title": "Nikki Bella Talks Babies After John Cena Agrees to Reverse Vasectomy", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The WWE star reveals to twin sister Brie the happy news that she's reconciled with John Cena", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "PEOPLE", "sailthru.author": "Aurelie Corinthios", "article": {"section": "People", "opinion": "false", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/peoplemag"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Peoplemag", "url": "https://people.com/tv/nikki-bella-talks-babies-after-john-cena-reconciliation/", "title": "Nikki Bella Talks Babies After John Cena Agrees to Reverse Vasectomy", "description": "The WWE star reveals to twin sister Brie the happy news that she's reconciled with John Cena", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/7JuzQXKnoUpz1V1Ug80tsV_8H-I=/1539x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/john-cena4-8fa7ff0844554d02b35357ea08982512.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "title": "Nikki Bella Talks Babies After John Cena Agrees to Reverse Vasectomy", "description": "The WWE star reveals to twin sister Brie the happy news that she's reconciled with John Cena", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/7JuzQXKnoUpz1V1Ug80tsV_8H-I=/1539x2000/filters:fill(auto,1)/john-cena4-8fa7ff0844554d02b35357ea08982512.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
