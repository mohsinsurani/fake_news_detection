We tried hard for a long time, and we\u2019re really disappointed. Our son has two parents who love him very much and for his sake we want to keep this situation as private as possible moving forward,\u201d Pratt posted on his Facebook page. Pratt\u2019s publicist confirmed the separation to CNN.\n\n\u201cWe still have love for each other, will always cherish our time together and continue to have the deepest respect for one another.\u201d\n\nA similar statement was tweeted from Faris\u2019 verified account late Sunday night.\n\nThe couple has been married for eight years. They have one child together.\n\nThe news came as a shock to fans who have long adored the love story of the \u201cGuardians of the Galaxy\u201d star and his \u201cHouse Bunny\u201d star wife.\n\nI believed in love until Chris Pratt and Anna Faris separated. \u2014 Alex Goldschmidt (@alexandergold) August 7, 2017\n\nJust woke up and saw that Chris Pratt and Anna Faris are breaking up. pic.twitter.com/Tuz6birCZV \u2014 Sonya (@_Sebbies_) August 7, 2017\n\nanna faris and chris pratt breaking up affects me in no way but also i feel like im their child and it's my fault somehow \u2014 elijah daniel (@elijahdaniel) August 7, 2017\n\nIn a 2014 interview with Esquire magazine Pratt said he met Faris in 2007 on the set of the film \u201cTake Me Home Tonight,\u201d in which they both featured.\n\nShe was married at the time and Pratt decided to be himself since she wasn\u2019t available, he said. That included leaving out porn magazines around his apartment when she came over and talking about his sexual exploits with other women.\n\nThey were \u201ctwin souls\u201d who grew up together 20 minutes from each other in Washington State, though they didn\u2019t meet until they were adults, Pratt said. Once she split with her then-husband, he determined then and there that he would marry her, he told Esquire.\n\nHe expanded on that in an AMA interview on Reddit in 2015.\n\n\u201cAnna and I are meant to be together,\u201d Pratt said. \u201cOur relationship has made me believe in divine intervention and destiny, just as much as my crazy career and the way I fell into this life. She and I grew up 20 minutes away from each other but never met until we met in LA.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929104601-lisa-france-profile-image.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150108121625-joe-sutton-profile.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180220084316-toni-braxton-birdman-0123.jpg?q=x_39,y_164,h_1125,w_2000,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170807094222-chris-pratt-anna-faris.jpg?q=x_3,y_319,h_1774,w_3153,c_crop/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170807094222-chris-pratt-anna-faris.jpg?q=x_3,y_319,h_1774,w_3153,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Sutton Lisa Respers France", "Joe Sutton", "Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/06/entertainment/anna-faris-chris-pratt-separation/index.html", "title": "Chris Pratt, Anna Faris announce separation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Chris Pratt, Anna Faris announce separation | CNN", "description": "Actors Chris Pratt and Anna Faris have filed for separation, according to statements posted on their official social media pages.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170807094222-chris-pratt-anna-faris.jpg?q=x_3,y_319,h_1774,w_3153,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/06/entertainment/anna-faris-chris-pratt-separation/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Chris Pratt, Anna Faris announce separation | CNN", "description": "Actors Chris Pratt and Anna Faris have filed for separation, according to statements posted on their official social media pages.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170807094222-chris-pratt-anna-faris.jpg?q=x_3,y_319,h_1774,w_3153,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Actors Chris Pratt and Anna Faris have filed for separation, according to statements posted on their official social media pages.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-07T03:35:15Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-07T23:59:39Z", "tag": "anna faris, celebrities, chris pratt, internet and www, social media, technology", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "anna faris, celebrities, chris pratt, internet and www, social media, technology", "author": "Joe Sutton,Lisa Respers France", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501974000.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
