Viewers can't help but miss the words written in white on his black T-shirt that read, \"Stay Black.\"\n\nWhile the provocative title is presumed to be an allusion to the rapper's reconciliation with the hyphen in his name, the underlying social issues shown in the short clip are likely not a coincidence.\n\n4:44, which is widely believed to be a visual album, is set to drop this Friday, June 30, exclusively to Tidal and Sprint customers. Hova, who recently welcomed twins with his wife, Beyonc\u00e9 (you may have heard of her), is an owner of the subscription streaming service. 4:44 is the Grammy-winning rapper's 13th studio album.\n\nRELATED: Listen to a First Taste of JAY-Z's New Album 4:44\n\nWatch the\"Kill Jay Z\" video above.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/09/092017-nikolaj-coster-waldau.jpg?itok=In2ChMSJ", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/09/092117-jennifer-lawrence-dior-oscars-lead.jpg?itok=E3QCnFlt", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/1506016535/dg.jpg?itok=SuMLZmAb", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/09/092117-amal-clooney-un-tout.jpg?itok=YqpYOwAd", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/images/2017/09/092117-kate-bosworth2.jpg?itok=YGFmJoOt", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/09/092117-chirssy-teigen.jpg?itok=fq4IbPPv", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/09/091417-vampire-facial-video.jpg?itok=eq0dG8bf", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1381046852207528&ev=PixelInitialized", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/all/themes/instyle/images/instyle-logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1036056483/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/09/092117-hayek-daughter-lead.jpg?itok=r_Q2Wrcj", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/06/061917-jay-z-lead.jpg?itok=c32-Q0F2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/09/092117-kims-brattiest-moment-kuwtk-lead_0.jpg?itok=Bk3HqvNv", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/images/2017/09/092117-teigen-legend-costumes-lead.jpg?itok=Tie20Bne", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/images/2017/09/092117-olivia-culpo-lead.jpg?itok=mJN7j7tq"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/06/061917-jay-z-lead.jpg?itok=c32-Q0F2", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352/http://www.instyle.com/news/jay-z-album-kill-jay-z-commercial", "title": "JAY-Z Teases 4:44 Album with \"Kill Jay Z\" Commercial", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"title": "JAY-Z Teases His\u00a0<em>4:44</em> Album with\u00a0Provacative\u00a0\"Kill Jay Z\" Commercial @InStyle", "site": "@InStyle", "image": {"src": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/06/061917-jay-z-lead.jpg?itok=c32-Q0F2"}, "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "You need to watch the moving clip."}, "og": {"site_name": "InStyle.com", "title": "JAY-Z Teases His\u00a04:44 Album with\u00a0Provacative\u00a0\"Kill Jay Z\" Commercial", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/06/061917-jay-z-lead.jpg?itok=c32-Q0F2", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170921215352/http://www.instyle.com/news/jay-z-album-kill-jay-z-commercial", "description": "You need to watch the moving clip."}, "fb": {"pages": 18938064984}, "ins": {"channel": "Videos"}, "description": "The provocative title is presumed to be an allusion to the rapper's reconciliation with the hyphen in his name.", "news_keywords": "jay z, jay-z, new jay z album, 4:44, kill jay z, jay z commercial", "generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "viewport": "width=1020"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
