The veteran actor reunited with his Rocky Balboa costar Milo Ventimiglia while filming scenes for season 2 of This Is Us.\n\nStallone, 71, took to Instagram on Saturday, August 12, to share photos from the set of the NBC drama as he began working on his one-episode role. He will play an actor who helps Kevin Pearson (Justin Hartley) adjust to fame on the set of a period war film directed by Ron Howard.\n\nVentimiglia, 40, revealed on Jimmy Kimmel Live! earlier this month that he called the Rocky actor to see if he\u2019d be willing to appear on This Is Us. Stallone shared a photo with the Emmy nominee on Instagram on Saturday, writing, \u201cMy good buddy Milo Ventimiglia who was nice enough to invite me to be on the show.\u201d\n\nVentimiglia opened up about Stallone\u2019s role in a recent interview. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to know that the material attracts the greats even like Sly,\u201d he told Entertainment Tonight. \u201cAnd to know that he\u2019d want to be a part and play with us, it\u2019s a very good feeling, so we\u2019re thrilled.\u201d\n\nOn the THIS IS US set with Justin Hartley , this is a fantastic show and he is great to work with!#thisisus @justinhartley A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Aug 12, 2017 at 6:57pm PDT\n\nGetting punched out by the amazing@chrissymetz On the set of THIS IS US #thisisus A post shared by Sly Stallone (@officialslystallone) on Aug 12, 2017 at 7:04pm PDT\n\nStallone also shared some behind-the-scenes snaps with other members of the cast. \u201cOn the THIS IS US set with Justin Hartley , this is a fantastic show and he is great to work with!\u201d he captioned a picture with Hartley, 40.\n\nThe three-time Oscar nominee then posted a photo of Chrissy Metz playfully punching him in the face. \u201cGetting punched out by the amazing @chrissymetz on the set of THIS IS US,\u201d he wrote.\n\nIt is unlikely that Stallone and Ventimiglia will share the screen again, though. Ventimiglia\u2019s beloved character, Jack Pearson, died prior to the present-day scenes on This Is Us.\n\nStill, Stallone will play a \u201cfather figure\u201d to Hartley\u2019s character, creator Dan Fogelman said at the Television Critics Association press tour. \u201cWe needed a big star for this movie, and we\u2019re really excited for the script,\u201d Fogelman said on August 3.\n\nThis Is Us season 2 premieres on NBC on Tuesday, September 26, at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/milo-ventimiglia-and-sylvester-stallone-2006-77f14767-66bd-406a-a285-ade96fb8752a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/milo-ventimiglia-and-sylvester-stallone-2006-77f14767-66bd-406a-a285-ade96fb8752a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sylvester-stallone-reunites-with-milo-ventimiglia-on-this-is-us-set-w497592/", "title": "Sylvester Stallone Reunites With Milo Ventimiglia on \u2018This Is Us\u2019 Set", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Sylvester Stallone reunited with his 'Rocky Balboa' costar Milo Ventimiglia while filming season 2 of 'This Is Us' \u2014 see the photos", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sylvester Stallone Reunites With Milo Ventimiglia on 'This Is Us' Set", "description": "Sylvester Stallone reunited with his 'Rocky Balboa' costar Milo Ventimiglia while filming season 2 of 'This Is Us' \u2014 see the photos", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/sylvester-stallone-reunites-with-milo-ventimiglia-on-this-is-us-set-w497592/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:42:07+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/milo-ventimiglia-and-sylvester-stallone-2006-77f14767-66bd-406a-a285-ade96fb8752a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/milo-ventimiglia-and-sylvester-stallone-2006-77f14767-66bd-406a-a285-ade96fb8752a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-08-14T15:49:48+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:42:07+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sylvester Stallone Reunites With Milo Ventimiglia on 'This Is Us' Set", "description": "Sylvester Stallone reunited with his 'Rocky Balboa' costar Milo Ventimiglia while filming season 2 of 'This Is Us' \u2014 see the photos", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/milo-ventimiglia-and-sylvester-stallone-2006-77f14767-66bd-406a-a285-ade96fb8752a.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502725788.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
