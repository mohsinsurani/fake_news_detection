Stephen Colbert and Jimmy Fallon opened The Late Show and The Tonight Show using the same cold open, which also guest starred Conan O\u2019Brien, whose own program on TBS is on hiatus this week.\n\nThe clip finds Colbert typing his monologue for the night when he receives a call from Fallon. \u201cHey, Lowlife,\u201d Fallon says as Colbert answers. The comedian\u2019s response? \u201cHey, Lost Soul.\u201d They\u2019ve borrowed those nicknames from Donald Trump\u2019s speech in South Carolina Monday night, where the president continued his anti-late-night tirade\u2014a feud he first ignited earlier this week, when he slammed Fallon for saying that he regrets mussing Trump\u2019s hair on air in 2016.\n\nIn the clip, Colbert and Fallon chat about the president\u2019s comments before calling O\u2019Brien to join the party. (Since he\u2019s on hiatus, the bit depicts the Conan host in the middle of shaving his beard and chest.) After the three hang up, the version of the video shown on CBS ends with Colbert running out on stage, as he always does. But this time, he\u2019s announced not as \u201cStephen Colbert,\u201d but as \u201cThat Guy from CBS\u201d\u2014another homage to the president\u2019s speech, in which he refused to name the comedian with whom he\u2019s battled most intensely.\n\nThis might be the first time in late-night history that two shows have used the same cold open. When reached for comment by Variety, O\u2019Brien briefly explained how the bit came together: \u201cColbert reached out to me this morning. I have since had my number changed.\u201d\n\nBack when Late Show launched with host David Letterman, such a collaboration would have been unthinkable. Letterman and former Tonight Show host Jay Leno were famously fierce rivals for years, thanks to their battle to take over Tonight from Johnny Carson. Over the years, the late-night landscape has evolved, and hosts have become less overtly hostile to one another. Perhaps the first step in the direction of cooperation came about a decade ago, during the 2007-2008 W.G.A. writers\u2019 strike. At the time, Colbert, O\u2019Brien\u2014then host of NBC\u2019s Late Night\u2014and Jon Stewart staged a feud over who was responsible for making Mike Huckabee famous, which ended with a final brawl on O\u2019Brien\u2019s show.\n\nIn recent years, collaboration across late night\u2019s growing bevy of shows has only increased, despite the continued ratings feud between Fallon and Colbert; even hosts whose time slots compete can be seen appearing on one another\u2019s shows occasionally. Each late-night host has his or her own way of dealing with this administration, and as we\u2019ve seen, some methods resonate more than others. But at this point, about halfway to 2020, it appears late night is above all united by the shared pressure of being forced to turn one of the country\u2019s most harrowing administrations into comedy\u2014and as Colbert, Fallon, and O\u2019Brien have proven, there\u2019s strength in numbers.", "images":
