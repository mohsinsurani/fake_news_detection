Pregnant Serena Williams and her fianc\u00e9, Alexis Ohanian, relaxed on a babymoon in Mexico over the weekend.\n\nThe tennis champ, 35, and her hubby-to-be, 34, soaked up the sun on Friday, April 21. Williams glowed in a paisley-printed one-piece swimsuit as she laughed alongside the Reddit founder.\n\nThe couple were also photographed relaxing on Sunday, April 23, as they kept cool under an umbrella. For their next day at the beach, Williams opted for a red and orange printed one-piece and jean shorts.\n\nAs previously reported, Williams announced via Snapchat on April 19 that she\u2019s expecting her first child. She later revealed that she wasn\u2019t quite ready to share the news with the world.\n\nSpeaking at a TED conference in Vancouver on Tuesday, April 25, Williams told Gayle King that she posted the snap on accident. \u201cOn social media you press the wrong button and\u202630 minutes later I missed four calls and I\u2019m like, \u2018That\u2019s weird.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe athlete explained that she\u2019s been documenting her pregnancy in pics for herself and that she didn\u2019t mean to share the \u201c20 weeks\u201d snap.\n\n\u201cIt was a good moment,\u201d she said. \u201cI was only going to wait five or six more days.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/serena-williams-alexis-ohanian-e4edc7a1-c74f-4c90-a5ef-c8db8be94f4a.jpg?crop=124px%2C1px%2C1169px%2C613px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/serena-williams-alexis-ohanian-e4edc7a1-c74f-4c90-a5ef-c8db8be94f4a.jpg?crop=124px%2C1px%2C1169px%2C613px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-serena-williams-and-alexis-ohanian-babymoon-in-mexico-w479054/", "title": "Pregnant Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian Babymoon in Mexico", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Pregnant Serena Williams and her fiance, Alexis Ohanian, are relaxing on a babymoon in Mexico \u2014 see the beach pics", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pregnant Serena Williams Dons Swimsuit on Babymoon in Mexico", "description": "Pregnant Serena Williams and her fiance, Alexis Ohanian, are relaxing on a babymoon in Mexico \u2014 see the beach pics", "url": "/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-serena-williams-and-alexis-ohanian-babymoon-in-mexico-w479054/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-15T20:05:14+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/serena-williams-alexis-ohanian-e4edc7a1-c74f-4c90-a5ef-c8db8be94f4a.jpg?crop=124px%2C1px%2C1169px%2C613px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/serena-williams-alexis-ohanian-e4edc7a1-c74f-4c90-a5ef-c8db8be94f4a.jpg?crop=124px%2C1px%2C1169px%2C613px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-26T22:11:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-15T20:05:14+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pregnant Serena Williams Dons Swimsuit on Babymoon in Mexico", "description": "Pregnant Serena Williams and her fiance, Alexis Ohanian, are relaxing on a babymoon in Mexico \u2014 see the beach pics", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/serena-williams-alexis-ohanian-e4edc7a1-c74f-4c90-a5ef-c8db8be94f4a.jpg?crop=124px%2C1px%2C1169px%2C613px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493244660.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
