They met when Schwimmer was directing the 2007 romantic comedy Run in London. She relocated to Los Angeles to be with the actor and the pair tied the knot in June 2010. It is the first marriage for both.\n\nSchwimmer and Buckman welcomed daughter, Cleo, now 5, in May 2011.\n\nThe People v. O.J. Simpson: American Crime Story actor and Buckman often kept private about their relationship. Their last public event together was at the opening night of The Front Page at the Broadhurst Theatre in NYC in October 2016.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/david-schwimmer-zoe-68c67604-10dd-4301-9f8a-700516f85ebc.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1691px%2C888px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/david-schwimmer-zoe-68c67604-10dd-4301-9f8a-700516f85ebc.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1691px%2C888px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-schwimmer-wife-zoe-buckman-taking-some-time-apart-w475045/", "title": "David Schwimmer, Wife Zoe Buckman Taking 'Some Time Apart'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "David Schwimmer and his wife, Zoe Buckman, are taking some time apart after six years of marriage, the couple confirm exclusively to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "David Schwimmer, Wife Zoe Buckman Taking 'Time Apart' After Six Years of Marriage", "description": "David Schwimmer and his wife, Zoe Buckman, are taking some time apart after six years of marriage, the couple confirm exclusively to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/david-schwimmer-wife-zoe-buckman-taking-some-time-apart-w475045/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:20:29+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/david-schwimmer-zoe-68c67604-10dd-4301-9f8a-700516f85ebc.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1691px%2C888px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/david-schwimmer-zoe-68c67604-10dd-4301-9f8a-700516f85ebc.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1691px%2C888px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-05T15:13:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:20:29+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "David Schwimmer, Wife Zoe Buckman Taking 'Time Apart' After Six Years of Marriage", "description": "David Schwimmer and his wife, Zoe Buckman, are taking some time apart after six years of marriage, the couple confirm exclusively to Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/david-schwimmer-zoe-68c67604-10dd-4301-9f8a-700516f85ebc.jpg?crop=0px%2C28px%2C1691px%2C888px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491405180.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
