(AAP Video) NO ARCHIVING AAP VIDEO BEYOND 48 HOUR NEWS USAGE\n\nPRINCE Louis has six godparents including Prince William\u2019s longtime friend Guy Pelly, Kensington Palace has revealed.\n\nThe christening of Louis Arthur Charles, the third child of the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, will take place within hours at the Chapel Royal, St James\u2019s Palace.\n\nIn news that will disappoint royal fans, the Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh will not be attending.\n\nThe decision was not made on health grounds, Buckingham Palace said, and it is understood to have been mutually agreed by the Queen and the Cambridges some time ago.\n\nThe Prince\u2019s other godparents include Nicholas van Cutsem, Harry Aubrey-Fletcher, Lady Laura Meade, Hannah Gillingham and Lucy Middleton.\n\nMs Gillingham is a former schoolmate of Kate Middleton while Lucy Middleton, a solicitor, is her cousin.\n\nGuy Pelly is not a surprising choice for godfather since the London nightclub owner is one of Prince William and Prince Harry\u2019s closest friends.\n\nIn the past, Pelly had a \u201cparty animal\u201d reputation, opening and managing London\u2019s Mahiki, Whisky Mist and Tonteria. He and the Princes were regularly seen out and about in the nightclubs during their younger days.\n\nNicholas van Cutsem is a life-long family friend of the royal family. His daughter Florence van Cutsem was a bridesmaid at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan Markle, who will be attending the christening.\n\nHarry Aubrey-Fletcher is the son of Sir Henry Aubrey-Fletcher, the 8th Baronet and Lord Lieutenant of Buckinghamshire. Prince William was an usher when Harry married Louise Stourton in 2010.\n\nPrince Charles and Camilla will be attending as will Carol and Michael Middleton, Pippa Middleton and her husband James Matthews, and James Middleton, Kate\u2019s brother.\n\nPrince Louis will wear the handmade replica of the royal christening robe, made by Angela Kelly, dressmaker to The Queen.\n\nFollowing the service, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge will give a private tea at Clarence House. In a sweet touch, guests will be served slices of christening cake, which is a tier taken from William and Kate\u2019s wedding cake.", "images":
