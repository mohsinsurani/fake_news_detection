Asia\u2019s plan was to have live butterflies fly out \u2013 but they failed to release and the trick failed.\n\nKameron was named the winner and went on to face both Eureka and Aquaria in the final, meaning a three-way battle for the crown, a series first.\n\nThe final performance was to Big Bang by Jessie J, Nicki Minaj and Ariana Grande, with Aquaria walking away the victor.\n\nFans immediately tweeted their congratulations.\n\nit\u2019s a good day to be an Aquaria stan! #DragRace pic.twitter.com/9ohYsdfzbR \u2014 Syd (@underwood_syd) June 29, 2018\n\n@aquariaofficial excuse me miss, I think you need to change your bio to *RuPaul\u2019s Drag Race Season 10 WINNER\ud83d\udc51.
