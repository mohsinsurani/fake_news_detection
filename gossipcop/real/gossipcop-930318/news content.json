But, like fashion, I know that the fragrance market is still pretty conventional when it comes to gender and how each gender should smell. That means that I\u2019ve always held scents labeled 'unisex' at bay, refusing to buy into marketing gimmicks \u2014 but also, like, how do you assign a scent to a corporate concept?\"\n\n\n\n\"Anyway, if we\u2019re conforming to gender norms, then the KKW unisex fragrance will most likely be received by the mainstream as feminine-leaning. That being said \u2014 it smells good, almost lemon zest-y at first application, but then becomes more robust and sporty as the day progresses. Would I wear it again? No. But that\u2019s because I prefer stronger, more signature, consistent scents. The bottle, however, is pretty sick.\"", "images": ["https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/932/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/2058850/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/932/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/2058850/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mercedes Viera", "Hilary Shepherd", "Alexandra Polk", "Karina Hoshikawa", "Kelly Dougher", "Jacqueline Kilikita", "Kim Kardashian West Kkw Body Perfume"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/215777/kkw-body-fragrance-review", "title": "Kim Kardashian West KKW Body Perfume, Reviewed", "meta_data": {"title": "Kim Kardashian West KKW Body Perfume, Reviewed", "description": "Here's our honest take on whether these new KKW Body fragrances are worth your money.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/2018/11/215777/kkw-body-fragrance-review", "title": "Here's What All The New KKW Body Fragrances Actually Smell Like", "description": "Here's our honest take on whether these new KKW Body fragrances are worth your money.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/932/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/2058850/image.jpg", "secure_url": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/932/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/2058850/image.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1050}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Here's What All The New KKW Body Fragrances Actually Smell Like", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29", "description": "Here's our honest take on whether these new KKW Body fragrances are worth your money.", "image": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/932/0,0,2000,1050/x,80/2058850/image.jpg"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/192/112,0,1776,2400/x,80/2058848/image.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "news_keywords": "kim kardashian, kkw body, kkw body II, kkw body III, kim kardashian perfumes, kkw body fragrances, kim kardashian west", "p": {"domain_verify": "b10faeb45f92f5ebf0073a215d615ea9"}, "entry_template": "entry.slideshow", "author": "Rachel Lubitz"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1542758400.0, "source": "https://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
