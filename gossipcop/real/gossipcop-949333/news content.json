Since the former Jon & Kate Plus 8 stars\u2019 separation, Jon has been focused on his DJing career and battled his ex-wife for custody of the sextuplets and 17-year-old twins Mady and Cara.\n\nThough he wished them a happy birthday via Instagram in October, Jon remains estranged from the twins. In August 2016, Mady and Cara told PEOPLE that they weren\u2019t speaking to their father, who had given interviews to some media outlets about their strained relationship.\n\n\u201cHe makes it seem like we\u2019re being kept from him, which is insane,\u201d Mady said. \u201cHe should maybe spend some time thinking about why we don\u2019t want to see him, and maybe realize that if he ever does want a relationship with us, talking about us on TV is not the way to make that happen.\u201d\n\nLarsen & Talbert\n\n\u201cHe doesn\u2019t even know us,\u201d she added. \u201cHow can he dare to talk about us?\u201d\n\nBut Jon has been spending plenty of time with Hannah, including at a Father\u2019s Day weekend dinner with his girlfriend Colleen at Buddakan in Atlantic City, New Jersey, last month. In May, Jon and Hannah celebrated her 14th birthday together and paid a visit to her brother Collin, who is currently enrolled in a program away from home for children with special needs.\n\nJon & Kate Plus 8 aired from 2007 to 2009 before being rebranded as Kate Plus 8 following the couple\u2019s divorce. Kate will return to television this fall with a TLC dating series, Kate Plus Date.", "images":
