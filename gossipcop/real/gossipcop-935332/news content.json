The pair will stay in separate hotels before their nuptials; the first time Harry will see Markle in her wedding gown will be when she walks down the aisle toward him in St. George\u2019s Chapel at Windsor Castle.\n\nAccording to People, Harry will stay at the Dorchester Collection\u2019s Coworth Park in Windsor, along with his best man and older brother, Prince William. The five-star country house hotel sits on nearly 240 acres of idyllic Berkshire parkland, with rooms that are described as having \u201crural charm garnished with modern delight.\u201d The estate features an eco-luxury spa with an indoor pool, as well as three top-end restaurants. The rooms and suites themselves are fit for, well, royalty, with deep-soaking copper tubs, fresh flowers, and canopied beds with heavy cream-colored curtains.\n\nMeghan Markle, meanwhile, will be staying at Clivenden House Hotel just 15 miles away from her groom-to-be, spending her last night as a single woman with her mother, Doria Ragland. The Cliveden House is also a five-star country house hotel, and it is a 47-room, 350-year-old golden Palladian palace that sits just by the River Thames on 376 acres of National Trust land. The hotel is resplendent with touches of historic luxury, with a palette of red and gold velvets and a number of oversize oil paintings of British aristocrats scattered throughout the grounds. The suites, which have previously housed such guests as Lady Astor and Queen Victoria, run a wide gamut, but each has its own fireplace, a separate dressing room (ideal for Markle to change into her wedding gown) and an en suite bathroom. Outdoors, the resort offers deep-soaking hot tubs and a generously sized outdoor swimming pool.\n\nMarkle and her mother are set to depart for Windsor Castle directly from the hotel Saturday morning, when the former Suits actress will take those fated steps toward her husband-to-be, Prince Harry. The newlyweds will stay at Windsor Castle together the night of their wedding.\n\nRelated: The Complete Royal Wedding Travel Itinerary", "images": ["https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/631f8a523bb0b3f6d0294763/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5afb1c2dda68792ef45e5207/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-144836383.jpg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/633b30ae5c0b45bc4084f444/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us-reverse.0ae5c38d353e00b66b06ff79880d6cbcaac70fc2.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5d5478170f4080000941c7f2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/verso/static/architectural-digest/assets/logo-ad-us.651c7dd3bde4415d6ae6e43ca752399cf2213fc2.svg", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/61a65a0ac0a9b9aa1ffa29a6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5afb1c2dda68792ef45e5207/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-144836383.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5afb1c2dda68792ef45e5207/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-144836383.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast"], "canonical_link": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/here-are-the-hotels-where-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-will-stay-the-night-before-the-royal-wedding", "title": "Here Are the Hotels Where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Will Stay the Night Before the Royal Wedding", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Keeping with tradition, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will not stay together the night before the wedding", "id": "5afb18ad94fddd48f4c4cfca", "keywords": "royal wedding,meghan markle,spring,vancleefspring18", "news_keywords": "royal wedding,meghan markle,spring,vancleefspring18", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5afb18ad94fddd48f4c4cfca", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Keeping with tradition, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will not stay together the night before the wedding\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5afb1c2dda68792ef45e5207/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-144836383.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5afb1c2dda68792ef45e5207/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-144836383.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Keeping with tradition, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will not stay together the night before the wedding", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5afb1c2dda68792ef45e5207/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-144836383.jpg", "site_name": "Architectural Digest", "title": "Here Are the Hotels Where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Will Stay the Night Before the Royal Wedding", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com/story/here-are-the-hotels-where-meghan-markle-and-prince-harry-will-stay-the-night-before-the-royal-wedding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-05-15T18:46:06.535Z", "modified_time": "2018-05-15T18:46:06.535Z", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@ArchDigest", "description": "Keeping with tradition, Meghan Markle and Prince Harry will not stay together the night before the wedding", "domain": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "image": "https://media.architecturaldigest.com/photos/5afb1c2dda68792ef45e5207/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/GettyImages-144836383.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@ArchDigest", "title": "Here Are the Hotels Where Meghan Markle and Prince Harry Will Stay the Night Before the Royal Wedding"}, "fb": {"app_id": 267091300008193, "pages": 43794751042}, "google-signin-client_id": "960933707988-c28a5u0f04t7r9sdmr2u8ct9tioi4m1n.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526409966.535, "source": "https://www.architecturaldigest.com", "summary": ""}
