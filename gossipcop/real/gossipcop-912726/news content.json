News, Hart explained that fans of the original show may be surprised (in a good way) when they watch The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina. She said, \u201cI think what they\u2019re doing is smart, doing the darker version. I think it\u2019s going to be more like Buffy the Vampire Slayer than the Sabrina that most people know.\u201d\n\nThe 41-year-old went on to reveal that she won\u2019t be involved in the remake, like, at all, considering her entertainment company was completely removed from the Netflix reboot. She added, \u201cIt\u2019s an Archie comic, so the rights reverted from my company, Hartbreak Films, back to them. It\u2019s a totally different show.\u201d\n\nNevertheless, Hart is looking forward to seeing Kiernan Shipka portray the beloved Sabrina Spellman\u2026and so are we.", "images": ["https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/03/greta.jpg", "https://static.cdn.gallerymediagroup.com/purewow/logos/purewow-mark-black.svg", "https://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15961801&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/melissa-joan-hart-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-reboot-600.jpg", "https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/melissa-joan-hart-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-reboot.jpg?resize=720%2C404"], "top_img": "https://publish.purewow.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/02/melissa-joan-hart-sabrina-the-teenage-witch-reboot-600.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.purewow.com/news/melissa-joan-hart-sabrina-reboot", "title": "Here's What Melissa Joan Hart Thinks of Netflix's &#x2018;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&#x2019; Reboot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "google-site-verification": "Pu6hzorQtArtV6uOLn8QujZHHLSfHH5ry-oVWoRl8pY", "description": "Two months ago, Netflix green-lit the 'Sabrina the Teenage Witch' reboot for two seasons.
