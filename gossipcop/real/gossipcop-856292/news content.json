With exclusive access to writer-director Rian Johnson, plus interviews with Mark Hamill, Daisy Ridley, and others, V.F. presents the ultimate sneak peek at The Last Jedi\u2014and Carrie Fisher\u2019s lasting legacy.\n\nI. \u201cWe\u2019re Going Back?\u201d\n\nThe first trip to Skellig Michael was wondrous: an hour-long boat ride to a craggy, green island off the coast of Ireland\u2019s County Kerry, and then a hike up hundreds of stone steps to a scenic cliff where, a thousand years earlier, medieval Christian monks had paced and prayed. This is where Mark Hamill reprised his role as Luke Skywalker for the first time since 1983, standing opposite Daisy Ridley, whose character, Rey, was the protagonist of The Force Awakens, J. J. Abrams\u2019s resumption of George Lucas\u2019s Star Wars movie saga. The opening sentence of the film\u2019s scrolling-text \u201ccrawl,\u201d a hallmark of the series, was \u201cLuke Skywalker has vanished.\u201d Atop Skellig Michael, at the picture\u2019s very end, after an arduous journey by Rey, came the big payoff: a cloaked, solitary figure unhooding himself to reveal an older, bearded Luke, who wordlessly, inscrutably regarded the tremulous Rey as she presented to him the lightsaber he had lost (along with his right hand) in a long-ago duel with Darth Vader, his father turned adversary. It was movie magic: a scene that, though filmed in 2014 and presented in theaters in 2015, is already etched in cinematic history. The second trip to Skellig Michael? Maybe less of a thrill for an aging Jedi. Contrary to what one might have reasonably expected, that Abrams would have kept rolling in \u201914, recording some dialogue between Luke and Rey in order to get a jump on the saga\u2019s next installment\u2014especially given that Skellig Michael is a UNESCO World Heritage Site, with access limited to the summer months, and only when the weather is cooperative\u2014once Hamill and Ridley had nailed their epic staredown, that was a wrap. It fell to Abrams\u2019s successor, Rian Johnson, the director of The Last Jedi, the eighth movie in the saga, which opens this December, to painstakingly re-stage the clifftop scene, with the two actors retaking their places more than a year later. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. \u201cWhen I read the script for Episode VIII, I went, \u2018Oh my God, we\u2019re going back?\u2019 Because I said I was never going back,\u201d Hamill told me when I sat down with him recently at his home in Malibu. He wondered, in vain, if they could drop him in by chopper this time, \u201cwhich is so clueless of me, because there\u2019s no landing pad, and it would mar the beauty of it all,\u201d he said. Hamill is a youthful 65 but a sexagenarian nevertheless; whereas the fit young members of the crew were given 45 minutes to get up to the now iconic Rey-Luke meeting spot\u2014carrying heavy equipment\u2014Hamill was allotted an hour and a half, \u201cand I had to stop every 10, 15 minutes to rest.\u201d None of this was offered up in the form of complaint. Hamill just happens to be a rambling, expansive talker\u2014in his own way, as endearingly offbeat a character as his friend and on-screen twin sister, Carrie Fisher, who passed away suddenly and tragically last December. Like Fisher, Hamill was put on a diet-and-exercise regimen after he was reconscripted into the Star Wars franchise. (Harrison Ford was under less obligation, having retained his leading-man shape because he never stopped being a leading man.) Over a spartan snack plate of carrot sticks and hummus, the man behind Luke held forth at length on this subject. Watch the video below for a behind-the-scenes look at Annie Leibovitz\u2019s photo shoot with The Last Jedi cast and crew. \u201cYou just cut out all the things you love,\u201d he said. \u201cSomething as basic as bread and butter, which I used to start every meal with. Sugar. No more candy bars. No more stops at In-N-Out. It\u2019s really just a general awareness, because in the old days I\u2019d go, \u2018Well, I\u2019m not that hungry, but oh, here\u2019s a box of Wheat Thins,\u2019 and you don\u2019t put the Wheat Thins in the same category as Lay\u2019s potato chips, and yet I would sort of idly, absentmindedly eat these things while watching Turner Classic Movies, and \u2018Oh, I ate the whole box!\u2019 \u201d Hamill had been dieting and training for 50 weeks before he learned, via the Episode VII script he finally received from Abrams, that he would not appear in the movie until its last scene, and in a nonspeaking part at that. On this, too, he has a lot of thoughts. Though he grants that the delayed-gratification reveal of Luke was a narrative masterstroke, he\u2019d have done things differently if he\u2019d had his druthers. Han Solo\u2019s death scene, for example. Why couldn\u2019t Luke have made his first appearance around then? In the finished film, the witnesses to Han\u2019s death, at the hands of his own son, the brooding dark-side convert Kylo Ren (Adam Driver), are his longtime Wookiee co-pilot, Chewbacca, and the upstart Resistance fighters Rey and Finn (John Boyega). Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. \u201cNow, remember, one of the plots in the earlier films was the telepathic communication between my sister and me,\u201d Hamill said. \u201cSo I thought, Carrie will sense that Han is in danger and try to contact me. And she won\u2019t succeed, and, in frustration, she\u2019ll go herself. Then we\u2019re in the situation where all three of us are together, which is one of my favorite things in the original film, when we were on the Death Star. It\u2019s just got a fun dynamic to it. So I thought it would have been more effective, and I still feel this way, though it\u2019s just my opinion, that Leia would make it as far as she can, and, right when she is apprehended, maybe even facing death\u2014Ba-boom! I come in and blow the guy away and the two of us go to where Han is facing off with his son, but we\u2019re too late. The reason that\u2019s important is that we witness his death, which carries enormous personal resonance into the next picture. As it is, Chewie\u2019s there, and how much can you get out of [passable Chewbacca wail] \u2018Nyaaarghhh!\u2019 and two people who have known Han for, what, 20 minutes?\u201d Still, Hamill recognizes that the popular response to The Force Awakens\u2014its stirring ending in particular\u2014was overwhelmingly positive, his misgivings be damned. \u201cAs I said to J.J.,\u201d he recalled, \u201cI\u2019ve never been more happy to be wrong.\u201d Besides, holding back Luke in VII means that Hamill gets a lot more screen time in VIII. And dialogue. This time, at last, Luke Skywalker talks. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. II. A Long Way from Tosche Station\n\nRian Johnson, a sandy-haired, baby-faced 43-year-old Californian heretofore best known among cin\u00e9astes for his time-bending 2012 science-fiction film, Looper, is not only the director of Episode VIII but also its sole credited screenwriter. (Episode VII was written by Abrams, Lawrence Kasdan, and Michael Arndt.) Earlier this spring, in a screening room in the Frank G. Wells Building at Walt Disney Studios, in Burbank, California, Johnson described to me the approach he took to writing The Last Jedi, the second film of the Rey-centered trilogy. \u201cJ.J. and Larry and Michael set everybody up in a really evocative way in VII and started them on a trajectory. I guess I saw it as the job of this middle chapter to challenge all of those characters\u2014let\u2019s see what happens if we knock the stool out from under them,\u201d he said. As it is, none of the main characters in The Force Awakens emerged from that picture in what can be described as a triumphal state. John Boyega\u2019s Finn had been gravely wounded in a lightsaber duel with Kylo Ren. In a telephone interview from China, where he was filming Pacific Rim: Uprising, Boyega told me that, as teased in The Last Jedi\u2019s first trailer, his character, Finn, begins the new movie in a \u201cbacta suit,\u201d a sort of regenerative immersion tank that, in the Star Wars galaxy, heals damaged tissue. Adam Driver, alluding both to Finn\u2019s state and the scar seen on his own face in the trailer, told me, \u201cI feel like almost everyone is in that rehabilitation state. You know, I don\u2019t think that patricide is all that it\u2019s cracked up to be. Maybe that\u2019s where Kylo Ren is starting from. His external scar is probably as much an internal one.\u201d Johnson was surprised at how much leeway he was given to cook up the action. But Johnson, in drawing up his screenplay, decided to raise the stakes further. \u201cI started by writing the names of each of the characters,\u201d he said, \u201cand thinking, What\u2019s the hardest thing they could be faced with?\u201d At the top of Johnson\u2019s list: Luke Skywalker. When he was last glimpsed in Lucas\u2019s original trilogy, at the end of 1983\u2019s Return of the Jedi, Luke was basking in victory and familial warmth, reveling with Princess Leia Organa, Han Solo, and their rebel compatriots at a celebratory Ewok dance party. Turning away for a moment from the festivities, he saw smiling apparitions of his two departed Jedi mentors, Yoda and Obi-Wan Kenobi, along with his late father, Anakin Skywalker, restored to his unscarred, un-Vadered form after redeeming himself in death, sacrificing his own life to save his son\u2019s and slay the evil Emperor Palpatine. You\u2019d have expected Luke to have shortly thereafter found a nice girl and settled into a contented existence on a tidy planet with good schools and dual sunsets, no more than a couple of parsecs from the Organa-Solos and their little boy, Ben. But no. Leia and Han\u2019s romance didn\u2019t last, and something heavy went down with twin bro. The result: the cloak, the hood, and monastic isolation of the damaged, Leonard-Cohen-at-Mount-Baldy variety. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. So what happened to Luke? What we know from The Force Awakens is that he had been running some sort of Jedi academy when \u201cone boy, an apprentice, turned against him, destroyed it all.\u201d These are the words that Han Solo, prior to his death scene, offers to Rey and Finn\u2014the inference being that the boy was Han and Leia\u2019s son, and Luke\u2019s nephew, Ben, the future Kylo Ren. \u201cPeople that knew him best,\u201d Han says of Luke, \u201cthink he went looking for the first Jedi temple.\u201d That part of Luke\u2019s legend, Johnson confirmed, is accurate. The site of Rey\u2019s Force Awakens encounter with Luke is Ahch-To, the temple\u2019s home planet, which bears a striking resemblance to southwestern coastal Ireland. Though their time on Skellig Michael was brief, the Last Jedi crew returned to the area for additional shooting on the Dingle Peninsula, a ragged spear of land that juts out into the North Atlantic. There, Johnson said, the set builders \u201cduplicated the beehive-shaped huts where the monks lived on Skellig and made a kind of little Jedi village out of them.\u201d Luke, it transpires, has been living in this village among an indigenous race of caretaker creatures whom Johnson is loath to describe in any more detail, except to say that they are \u201cnot Ewoks.\u201d That Luke is so changed a person presented Johnson with rich narrative opportunities. The Last Jedi is to a large extent about the relationship between Luke and Rey, but Johnson cautions against any \u201cone-to-one correlation\u201d between, say, Yoda\u2019s tutelage of young Luke in The Empire Strikes Back and old Luke\u2019s tutelage of Rey. \u201cThere\u2019s a training element to it,\u201d he said, \u201cbut it\u2019s not exactly what you would expect.\u201d This being the spoiler-averse world of Lucasfilm, the production company behind the Star Wars movies, that\u2019s about as specific as the director is willing to get. (No, he won\u2019t tell you if Luke is related to Rey, or, for that matter, what species the super-villain Supreme Leader Snoke happens to be, or which character the title The Last Jedi refers to.) Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. But Johnson was happy to talk about Hamill\u2019s performance, which, he said, \u201cshows a very different side of the Luke character.\u201d In the original Star Wars trilogy, Luke was the de facto straight man, playing off Ford\u2019s rascally Han and Fisher\u2019s tart, poised Leia, not to mention the droid comedy tandem of C-3PO and R2-D2. Hamill? He was cast for his sincere mien and Bicentennial-era dreamboat looks\u2014part Peter Cetera, part Osmond brother. He still catches grief, he noted, for one particularly clunky line reading in the first movie, when Luke responds to his Uncle Owen\u2019s order to polish up their newly purchased droids by complaining, \u201cBut I was going into Tosche Station to pick up some power converters!\u201d Though his approach to the line was, he swears, deliberate\u2014\u201cI distinctly remember thinking, I\u2019ve got to make this as whiny and juvenile as I can,\u201d he said\u2014Hamill admitted that his greenness as an actor left him with \u201csomewhere to go later, where I wouldn\u2019t make those kinds of choices.\u201d In his years out of the spotlight, Hamill has flourished as a voice actor, most notably playing the Joker in a series of animated Batman TV shows, films, and video games. He performs the part with a demented brio and an arsenal of evil laughs ranging from Richard Widmark manic to Vincent Price broad\u2014a far cry from the gee-whiz wholesomeness for which he is best remembered. Oscar Isaac, at 38 the senior member of the core cast\u2019s \u201cnew kids\u201d (Driver is 33, and Ridley and Boyega are in their mid-20s), is old enough to remember as a child revering Luke Skywalker. \u201cSo to be there, and to watch Mark revisit Luke, particularly in these scenes we were shooting towards the end of the film, was bizarre and jaw-dropping,\u201d he told me. \u201cIt\u2019s like when you see an old band re-unite and go on the road, and they don\u2019t quite hit those high notes anymore\u2014though in this situation it\u2019s completely the opposite. It\u2019s the fulfillment of where your imagination would take you when you imagine where Luke would go, or what he\u2019s become.\u201d Star Wars celebrates its 40th anniversary this week. Watch the video below to find out six things we wouldn\u2019t have without the franchise. III. Significant New Figures\n\nOn the Disney campus, I sat in on a postproduction meeting in which Johnson was reviewing some scenes from The Last Jedi. Teams from Industrial Light & Magic, Lucasfilm\u2019s visual-effects division, were videoconferencing in from London, San Francisco, and Vancouver. On a big screen, Poe Dameron, Isaac\u2019s heroic X-wing fighter pilot, was back in action, coaching a gunner named Paige, a new character played by a Vietnamese actress named Veronica Ngo. Another scene featured General Hux, the nefarious First Order commander played with spittle-flecked relish by Domhnall Gleeson. Johnson loved what he was seeing but noted the presence of some \u201cschmutz\u201d\u2014smudges around the edges\u2014on the starcraft window that Hux was looking out of. \u201cI don\u2019t know, does the First Order not keep its windows clean?\u201d he asked. \u201cDid you guys play it that way before?\u201d He raised the question more deferentially than critically (and Ben Morris, the movie\u2019s London-based VFX supervisor, said it would be no problem to de-schmutzify the pane). Until The Last Jedi, Johnson had never overseen a picture with a budget above $30 million. But the director betrayed no sign of being overwhelmed. He is a gifted filmmaker whose previous movies, especially Brick (his 2005 debut) and Looper, are visually distinctive and intricately plotted, the assured work of a cinema-drunk U.S.C. film-school grad who, in preparation for Episode VIII, steeped himself in World War II movies like Henry King\u2019s Twelve O\u2019Clock High and \u201cfunky 60s samurai stuff\u201d like Kihachi Okamoto\u2019s Kill! and Hideo Gosha\u2019s Three Outlaw Samurai. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. The anointment of Johnson as Episode VIII\u2019s overseer is emblematic of the direction in which Kathleen Kennedy has taken Lucasfilm since she assumed the presidency of the company, in 2012, the same year that George Lucas, who had personally recruited her to take his place, sold the company to Disney. Though she reached out to Abrams, a proven wrangler of blockbuster series (Mission: Impossible, Star Trek), to initiate the current Star Wars trilogy, Kennedy has since picked filmmakers whose r\u00e9sum\u00e9s are less important than whether or not she is a fan of their work. Kennedy cut her teeth as a Steven Spielberg prot\u00e9g\u00e9e\u2014in the early 80s, when she was not yet out of her 20s, he entrusted her with producing E.T.\u2014and now she, too, is keen on giving relative unknowns their big chance. Johnson was someone she\u2019d had her eye on for years, she told me, admiring \u201chow deliberate he is in his storytelling and the way he moves the camera.\u201d The final film of the trilogy, due in 2019 and for the moment assigned the simple working title Episode IX, will be directed by Colin Trevorrow, who did not yet have the big-budget feature Jurassic World under his belt when he crossed Kennedy\u2019s radar; he came to her attention via his first feature, the 2012 indie comedy Safety Not Guaranteed, and a recommendation from her friend Brad Bird, the Pixar auteur. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Part of what makes Lucasfilm\u2019s new system work is that Kennedy has set up a formidable support structure for her filmmakers. Upon her arrival, she put together a story department at Lucasfilm\u2019s San Francisco headquarters, overseen by Kiri Hart, a development executive and former screenwriter she has long worked with. The story group, which numbers 11 people, maintains the narrative continuity and integrity of all the Star Wars properties that exist across various platforms: animation, video games, novels, comic books, and, most important, movies. \u201cThe whole team reads each draft of the screenplay as it evolves,\u201d Hart explained to me, \u201cand we try, as much as we can, to smooth out anything that isn\u2019t connecting.\u201d What the story group does not do, Hart said, is impose plot-point mandates on the filmmakers. Johnson told me he was surprised at how much leeway he was given to cook up the action of Episode VIII from scratch. \u201cThe pre-set was Episode VII, and that was kind of it,\u201d he said. If anything, Johnson wanted more give-and-take with the Lucasfilm team, so he moved up to San Francisco for about six weeks during his writing process, taking an office two doors down from Hart\u2019s and meeting with the full group twice a week. Among Johnson\u2019s inventions for The Last Jedi are three significant new figures: a \u201cshady character\u201d of unclear allegiances, played by Benicio Del Toro, who goes unnamed in the film but is called DJ by the filmmakers (\u201cYou\u2019ll see\u2014there\u2019s a reason why we call him DJ,\u201d Johnson said); a prominent officer in the Resistance named Vice Admiral Holdo, played by Laura Dern; and a maintenance worker for the Resistance named Rose Tico, who is played by a young actress named Kelly Marie Tran (and who is the sister of Paige, the character I witnessed in the scene with Poe Dameron). Tran\u2019s is the largest new part, and her plotline involves a mission behind enemy lines with Boyega\u2019s Finn, the stormtrooper turned Resistance warrior. Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Rose and Finn\u2019s adventure takes them to, among other places, another Johnson innovation: a glittering casino city called Canto Bight, \u201ca Star Wars Monte Carlo\u2013type environment, a little James Bond\u2013ish, a little To Catch a Thief,\u201d the director said. \u201cIt was an interesting challenge, portraying luxury and wealth in this universe.\u201d So much of the Star Wars aesthetic is rooted in sandy desolation and scrapyard blight; it appealed to Johnson to carve out a corner of the galaxy that is the complete opposite. \u201cI was thinking, O.K., let\u2019s go ultra-glamour. Let\u2019s create a playground, basically, for rich assholes,\u201d he said. Canto Bight is also where viewers will get their multi-species fix of gnarled aliens and other grotesque creatures, a comic-relief staple of Star Wars movies since Luke Skywalker first met Han Solo amid the cankerous and snouty inhabitants of the Mos Eisley cantina. The Last Jedi is dark enough as it is, so Johnson has made a point of infusing the movie with levity. \u201cI didn\u2019t want this to be a dirge, a heavy-osity movie,\u201d he said. \u201cSo one thing I\u2019ve tried really hard to do is keep the humor in there, to maintain the feeling, amid all the heavy operatic moments, that you\u2019re on a fun ride.\u201d Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. IV. Sister Carrie\n\nDaisy Ridley has her own tale to tell of Skellig Michael. Part of the reason she looks so convincingly weary at the conclusion of Episode VII is, she said, \u201cthat I had just vomited. I had adrenal exhaustion, and I was very, very sick.\u201d The second time up the cliff, she was in good health and pleased to be re-united with Hamill. But the overall making of Episode VIII proved more psychologically fraught. \u201cWhen I was doing Episode VII, I was kind of being washed along in a torrent of excitement and unexpectedness,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen we came around to do the next one, it was a bit more scary, because I knew the expectations, and I understood more what Star Wars means to people. It felt like more of a responsibility.\u201d The conflation of real-life and character narratives is not lost on Hamill. Fortunately for Ridley, she had become acquainted with a woman who knew a thing or two about such issues. There was no human being on earth better equipped to shepherd Ridley through what she was experiencing, as both the star of a movie franchise and a feminist model to young girls, than Carrie Fisher. \u201cCarrie lived her life the way she wanted to, never apologizing for anything, which is something I\u2019m still learning,\u201d Ridley said. \u201c \u2018Embarrassed\u2019 is the wrong word, but there were times through it all when I felt like I was \u2026 shrinking. And she told me never to shrink away from it\u2014that it should be enjoyed.\u201d This is a common refrain among the new generation of Star Wars actors: that Fisher was the one who taught them how to deal. Boyega recalled that when there was a backlash against his appearance in the first Force Awakens teaser trailer, released in November 2014\u2014the sight of a black man in stormtrooper armor drew ire from racists and doctrinaire Star Wars traditionalists\u2014Fisher counseled him not to take it to heart. \u201cI remember\u2014and forgive me, I\u2019m going to drop the f-bomb, but that\u2019s just Carrie\u2014she said, \u2018Ah, boohoo, who fuckin\u2019 cares? You just do you,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cWords like that give you strength. I bore witness in a million ways to her sharing her wisdom with Daisy too.\u201d Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. Fisher had a bigger role to play in The Last Jedi\u2014General Leia Organa logs significantly more screen time in Episode VIII than she did in VII. Isaac, who filmed several scenes with Fisher, said that, like Hamill, she delivered a rich performance, giving her all as an actor, rather than treating Leia\u2019s part as an exercise in feel-good sentimentalism. \u201cWe did this scene where Carrie has to slap me,\u201d he said. \u201cI think we did 27 takes in all, and Carrie leaned into it every time, man. She loved hitting me. Rian found such a wonderful way of working with her, and I think she really relished it.\u201d For his part, Johnson quickly formed a deep bond with Fisher as a fellow writer, spending long hours with her at the eccentric compound she shared with her mother, Debbie Reynolds, in the Coldwater Canyon section of Beverly Hills. \u201cAfter I had a draft, I would sit down with her when I was working on re-writing,\u201d he said. \u201cSitting with her on her bed, in her insane bedroom with all this crazy modern art around us, TCM on the TV, a constant stream of Coca-Cola, and Gary the dog slobbering at her feet.\u201d (For visuals on this characteristic state of affairs chez Fisher, I highly recommend Alexis Bloom and Fisher Stevens\u2019s HBO documentary, Bright Lights: Starring Carrie Fisher and Debbie Reynolds.) Fisher completed her part in Episode VIII late last summer, when principal photography on the film wrapped. \u201cShe was having a blast,\u201d said Kennedy. \u201cThe minute she finished, she grabbed me and said, \u2018I\u2019d better be at the forefront of IX!\u2019 Because Harrison was front and center on VII, and Mark is front and center on VIII. She thought IX would be her movie. And it would have been.\u201d Photograph by Annie Leibovitz. When I was conducting the interviews for this story, the Star Wars family was still mourning Fisher\u2019s unexpected death, which occurred on December 27, 2016, four days after she suffered a heart attack on a flight home to Los Angeles from London, and just a day before Reynolds suffered a fatal stroke. (The Star Wars \u201cfamily\u201d includes family in the literal sense: Fisher\u2019s daughter, the actress Billie Lourd, appears as a Resistance lieutenant in both The Force Awakens and The Last Jedi.) Fisher had celebrated her 60th birthday just two months earlier. \u201cOut of everyone, Carrie was the one I really became friends with and expected to have in my life for years and years,\u201d said Johnson. \u201cI last saw her in November, at the birthday party that she threw at her house. In a way, it was the perfect final, encapsulating image of Carrie\u2014receiving all her friends in the bedroom, with Debbie holding court in the living room.\u201d Fisher\u2019s death doesn\u2019t change anything about The Last Jedi except make it more poignant: the film farewell of both the actress and the character. But it does change Episode IX, for which, as Fisher hoped, a central role for Leia had been planned. Kennedy, Trevorrow, and the Lucasfilm team have been compelled to swing from grieving into pragmatic mode, working out how to reconceive the next film in the saga, which is scheduled to start shooting in January. One option that is not on the table is to reanimate Fisher\u2019s Leia via C.G.I., as was briefly done in Rogue One, last year\u2019s stand-alone, non-trilogy Star Wars film, created when she was alive. More extensively in that film, Grand Moff Tarkin, a character played by the late Peter Cushing in the first Star Wars movie, was brought back to life using C.G.I. jiggery-pokery and motion-capture technology that involved the use of an actor who physically resembles Cushing.
