elements, like wind, sun, and sea?\n\nFor instance, we remember seeing Olympian Ryan Lochte\u2019s hair go from a silver-blonde\u2026\n\n\u2026to a bluish-green\u2026\n\nAnyone else think the pool chemicals did the new dye job for him?\n\nWe did some digging and found some ways you can keep your blonde locks actually looking blonde.\n\nHydrate your hair:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BI0b_3Gj_I0\n\n\u201cDue to the elements in the summer months, you should spend extra time on your hair by following your normal hair regimen with a hydrating mask or treatment at least once a week,\u201d celebrity colorist Anival Morales told Glamour.\n\nWear a hat:\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BH_B1piBej2\n\n\u201cWearing a hat is the best way to have sun protection,\u201d model Soo Joo Park told Vogue.\n\n\u201cMy colorist Dhaniel Doud says you need sunblock for your hair the same way you need one for your skin.\u201d\n\nCarry headscarves:\n\n\u201cI pack vintage headscarves as well as a beaten-up old straw hat to protect my hair from the harshest sun, and French-plait my hair with added leave-in conditioner for long, carefree beach days,\u201d model Laura Bailey told Vogue.\n\nUse a leave-in conditioner (or water) before going swimming:\n\nBefore you get into the water, use a leave-in conditioner or water, then rinse your hair with water when you get out.\n\n\u201cMinerals and salt found in water and the sea can cause a buildup on your hair, making it look dull and discolored,\u201d Nicola Clarke, creative color director for Color Wow and celebrity hair colorist to people such as Kate Moss and Cate Blanchett, told Glamour.\n\nSpeaking of leave-in conditioner, try purple conditioner:\n\n\u201cIt goes back to an old laundry concept called \u2018bluing,\u2019 where people would intentionally add blue dye to laundry,\u201d cosmetic chemist Jim Hammer told Allure. \u201cThis would eliminate any yellowed, dingy appearance and make the laundry appear brighter and whiter.\u201d\n\n[Subheader]]Meri Kate O\u2019Connor, a senior colorist at Eva Scrivo Salons in New York City, agreed. \u201cThese formulas help to counteract the yellow, brassy tones often seen in blondes as they naturally oxidize,\u201d she said.[/subheader]\n\nAnd let\u2019s not forget about coconut oil:\n\nMany people swear by coconut oil to help hydrate their hair, from xoVain to the Barefoot Blonde (who has a great how-to on her blog).", "images":
