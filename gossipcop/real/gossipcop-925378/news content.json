But even as Meghan joyfully prepares for her walk down the aisle and marriage to royalty, Markle reportedly is finding herself haunted by ghosts from her past. Ranging from Meghan's former best friend, Ninaki Priddy, who allegedly betrayed Markle in a shocking way to jealous relatives and a possibly hostile ex-husband, those \"ghosts\" are darkening Meghan's wedding plans, according to E! News.\n\nWhile most of the people in Markle's life are thrilled about her marriage to Prince Harry, some of those \"ghosts\" from her past are tormenting her, according to the publication.\n\n\"A few [individuals] seem hell-bent on trying to ruin the big [wedding] day. The torment Meghan Markle must be going through, thanks to a best friend from hell, jealous family members and a former spouse, is unimaginable.\"\n\nWith a mere six weeks until Meghan and Harry tie the knot, the public Markle is focused on tasks such as getting fitted for her wedding dress, taking royal etiquette classes, and figuring out the politically charged seating arrangements. But it's the behind-the-scenes antics that are reportedly the most intriguing.\n\nAs an actress, Meghan was viewed as a brand with a distinctive voice, including her popular social media accounts. But as Markle prepares to become a duchess and member of the royal family, she is having to reinvent that brand. Meghan was fond of her social media platforms, sources told E! News, but now she must follow in Prince William's, Kate Middleton's, and Prince Harry's footsteps. The trio use the same @KensingtonRoyal handle, and Markle's appearances with Harry now are reported on Twitter with that handle.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-Ghosts.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/fa8aa86244d76bf2aee7e2fb5b934ea3?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/a5ba8e20-c5b5-4c82-ae2b-4f343261a07b.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Meghan-Markle-Prince-Harry-Ghosts.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4856890/meghan-markle-haunted-by-past-amid-royal-wedding-plans-e-news-reveals-shocking-ghosts-who-betrayed-her/", "title": "Meghan Markle Reportedly Haunted By Past Amid Royal Wedding Plans: 'E!
