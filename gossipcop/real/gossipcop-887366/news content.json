And as far as I know, this is that one show,\u201d Swift said long before the announcement of Reputation. She added, \u201cYou\u2019re the crowd in my most recent daydreams, when I\u2019m thinking about being onstage, so I was wondering: If you don\u2019t feel like dancing for yourself or screaming for yourself, you don\u2019t feel in the mood or whatever, you\u2019re like stressed out, would you do it for me tonight?\u201d\n\nFeb. 15-16 \u2013 TAS Rights Management, LLC filed nine separate trademarks for \u201cSwifties\u201d\n\nSwift\u2019s brand nailed down the things most true to her: Swifties. Nine separate trademarks were filed for the word alone, including one involving \u201ca website featuring non-downloadable audio recordings [and] video recordings.\u201d The idea that Swift would launch her own streaming service was debunked.\n\nMar. 2 \u2013 Ed Sheeran teases Swift\u2019s upcoming album\n\nThe singer revealed that his pal would be putting her music out quite late on in the year, saying, \u201cTaylor [Swift] isn\u2019t going to be releasing until probably the end of this year\u2014Christmas is the smartest time to release because that\u2019s when everyone buys records.\u201d Looks like he was right.\n\nMar. 10 \u2013 Man arrested for stalking/burglary inside Swift\u2019s apartment building\n\nA man was arrested in Swift\u2019s New York City building on charges of burglary, stalking, and trespassing. According to a Page Six report, the man allegedly hoped to meet the singer face-to-face. While the man was initially held on $20,000 bail, he was found unfit to stand trial and reportedly \u201cplaced in the custody of the New York State Office of Mental Health\u201d as of late September.\n\nApril 4 \u2013 \u201cBusy working\u201d on new album in Nashville\n\nAfter the singer had been spotted driving around Nashville, a source confirmed to ET that she\u2019d come \u201cto get away from the paparazzi,\u201d and also that she had \u201cbeen busy working on her upcoming album.\u201d\n\nMay 15 \u2013 She\u2019s really in Nashville! Swift celebrates Mother\u2019s Day at home with her mom\n\nTMZ did the heavy digging and proved that Swift really had been in Nashville \u2013 though she may have been hopping back and forth, as she was spotted getting onto her private jet after a spending the weekend with mama Swift for Mother\u2019s Day.\n\nJuly 4 \u2013 Keeping it low-key for the first time in years on the Fourth of July\n\nPaparazzi were very upset that Swift didn\u2019t have an Independence day blowout tailor-made for media, even though she\u2019d been keeping a relatively low profile all year.\n\nAug. 14 \u2013 $1 Countersuit Win\n\nThe long-drawn-out legal battle between DJ David Mueller, who was accused of reaching under the pop star\u2019s skirt to grope her during a photo shoot in 2013, was finally put to rest. After Mueller attempted to countersue for damages that occurred following Swift\u2019s accusation (which was quietly made to the station, who promptly let him go), the singer was awarded a single symbolic dollar in damages. Swift\u2019s attorney Douglas Baldridge explained the value, \u201cIt means no means no, and it tells every woman that they will determine what is tolerated with their body.\u201d\n\nAug. 18-20 \u2013 Bye bye, old Taylor\u2026 and old posts\n\nIn the internet-breaking fashion Swift seems to have perfected, the singer\u2019s social media accounts went into full blackout mode. No old posts were to be found anywhere, signaling that she was gearing up to launch something huge.\n\nAug. 21 \u2013 She\u2019s back, but only with some snakes\n\nIn one of the best social media moments of the year, Swift posted a three-part series of glitch-y snake videos without captions to her Instagram to break her short-lived blackout. The image of the snake had become synonymous with Swift\u2019s internet-meme identity, following the drawn-out beef with Kim Kardashian and Kanye West regarding West\u2019s \u201cFamous\u201d lyrics and video.\n\nA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Aug 23, 2017 at 7:01am PDT\n\nAug. 23 \u2013 It\u2019s an album!\n\nAfter five days (AKA an eternity in Swiftie time), Swift revealed the project behind the social media madness. Continuing in the three-part posting style, Swift announced \u201cFIRST SINGLE OUT TOMORROW NIGHT,\u201d posted the cover art, and announced the release date for then-upcoming album Reputation. All posts were still caption-less.\n\nAug. 24 \u2013 Look what you made her do.\n\nSwift released Reputation\u2019s lead single \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d with a clever caption on Instagram: \u201c..ready for it? New single #LookWhatYouMadeMeDo out now.\u201d Of course, the forthcoming track title remained an inside joke to the singer\u2019s team upon posting time.\n\nAug. 27 \u2013 Look what you made her do, part two.\n\nThe singer premiered the visuals for \u201cLWYMMD\u201d at the 2017 MTV VMAs, snagging 43.2 million views in the first 24 hours alone, now standing with over 783 million views. The Joseph Kahn-directed visual is loaded with references to the \u201cold Taylor,\u201d including a tombstone for Nils Sjoberg, her songwriting pseudonym on ex-boyfriend Calvin Harris\u2019 2016 hit \u201cThis Is What You Came For,\u201d nearly all of her most iconic outfits, more snakes, and nearly all her besties\u2019 names scribbled on a new version of her \u201cYou Belong With Me\u201d music video costume.\n\nSept. 3 \u2013 \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d released\n\nSwift released the second track off Reputation after she previewed it on Saturday Night Football the night prior. It followed suit with the darker, much more dramatic new Taylor, yet gave no clearer picture of what was yet to come.\n\nSept. 5 \u2013 No. 1, again\n\nTaylor Swift\u2019s \u201cLook What You Made Me Do\u201d tops the Billboard Hot 100, where it would reign for three weeks. The song was her fifth Hot 100 No. 1 and broke the weekly streaming record for a song by a woman; it also stopped the record-tying 16-week reign of \u201cDespacito.\u201d\n\nSept. 7 \u2013 TayTay On Demand\n\nEver wanted to know what Swift is up to at any given moment? Well this isn\u2019t exactly that, but the trailer jokes that it will be. Swift announced her new video-on-demand channel in partnership with AT&T and DirectTV called Taylor Swift NOW, accompanied by a hilarious play-by-play of Swift\u2019s day in the studio (complete with Andy Samberg cameo).\n\nOct. 11 \u2013 The Swift Life app announced\n\nStans will finally have a one-stop-shop for finding out everything there is to know about their fave singer. It is said to function as a social network of sorts, leaning into Swift\u2019s hobby of \u201clurking\u201d and replying to fans on social media, and also offering an opportunity to \u201ccollect Taymojis, stickers, pics, and more.\u201d\n\nOct. 20 \u2013 \u201cGorgeous\u201d released\n\nThe predictable yet addicting pop track the world was waiting for finally arrived. Swift sang of a romantic interest that was somehow too gorgeous for even a superstar like her to talk to. James Reynolds, two-year-old daughter of Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively, was later officially credited in album liner notes as the voice at the beginning of the track.\n\nOct. 27 \u2013 \u201c\u2026Ready for it?\u201d returns with visuals\n\nThe fans surely weren\u2019t ready for it, yet with the Joseph Kahn directed video packed with hidden messages, it wasn\u2019t long before Swifties decoded them all. Among the most obvious are Swift\u2019s birth year spray-painted on a wall, the Chinese characters for \u201cYear of the Snake,\u201d as well as a similar lightning strike in the intro to Calvin Harris\u2019 \u201cThis is What You Came For\u201d album art.\n\nNov. 2 \u2013 \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d lyric video released\n\nFans started to get a fuller picture of what was coming from Reputation in just over a week. Swift seemed to be finding her way to happiness in the first ballad to be released from the album, but she was still attempting to rid herself of the drama she\u2019d endured. The day was special for more than one reason, coinciding with the 13th anniversary (Swift\u2019s lucky number) of meeting Scott Borchetta, the Big Machine Records executive who signed her and gave her the fateful big break.\n\nNov. 7 \u2013 Track list revealed on Swift\u2019s Instagram Account\n\nThree days prior to the Reputation release date, Swift posted the back cover to the album, featuring the track listing.\n\n3 days until #reputation A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Nov 7, 2017 at 6:52pm PST\n\nNov. 8 \u2013 CMA Win\n\nEven though she\u2019s left country in the dust on her own albums, Swift\u2019s song for Little Big Town, \u201cBetter Man,\u201d nabbed song of the year at the 2017 CMAs.\n\nNov. 9 \u2013 The album was leaked, and this is why we can\u2019t have nice things\n\nIn this day and age, so many albums leak prior to release date, but not quite in this fashion: missing from the leaked files was track no. 13, \u201cThis Is Why We Can\u2019t Have Nice Things.\u201d Whether it was at the hands of Swift\u2019s team, Swift herself, or a sneaky fan, it was quite the clever move.\n\nOn the same day, an intimate recording \u201cNew Years Day\u201d from what looks like a secret session was premiered on ABC during an episode of Scandal.\n\nNov. 10 \u2013 Reputation is out everywhere, except for streaming services\n\nReputation hit shelves and online retailers; a Target exclusive version included a magazine with poems and photos from Swift. She announced 20 days later that Reputation would be available to stream at midnight on Dec. 1.\n\nNov. 11 \u2013 SNL\n\nSwift plays Saturday Night Live, busting out \u201c\u2026Ready for It?\u201d and an acoustic \u201cCall It What You Want.\u201d\n\nNov. 13 \u2013 Tonight Show\n\nFollowing the death of Jimmy Fallon\u2019s mother, Taylor Swift agreed to appear on The Tonight Show to play a moving version of \u201cNew Year\u2019s Day.\u201d\n\nNov. 20 \u2013 Reputation Is No. 1\n\nSwift\u2019s Reputation becomes her fifth No. 1 album on the Billboard 200. Reputation notched 2017\u2019s biggest week for an album, as the set earned 1.238 million equivalent album units in the week ending Nov. 16, according to Nielsen Music. Of that sum, 1.216 million were in traditional album sales \u2014 the largest sales frame for an album since 2015. It would hold the No. 1 spot for three weeks.\n\nNov. 28 \u2013 Grammy Time\n\nThe Taylor Swift-penned \u201cBetter Man\u201d from Little Big Town is nominated for best country song \u2014 which is a songwriter(s) award, so Swift will get a trophy if it wins. She\u2019s also nominated for best song written for visual media for her Zayn collab \u201cI Don\u2019t Want to Live Forever.\u201d\n\nDec. 1 \u2013 Taylors In the Stream\n\nReputation appears on the major streaming services.\n\nDec. 4 2017 \u2013 Reputation, but make it fashion (UK Vogue cover)\n\nVogue UK revealed its first cover of the new year would feature Swift. Newly appointed Editor in Chief Edward Enninful styled the singer during his second cover after taking the reigns from Alexandra Shulman. Mert Alas and Marcus Piggott, also photographers for all Reputation visuals, shot the twelve-page spread. Two days later, the high fashion mag revealed a poem Swift wrote exclusively to run with the feature, titled, \u201cThe Trick to Holding On.\u201d\n\nDec. 6 2017 \u2013 Swift is one of Time\u2019s \u201cSilence Breakers\u201d\n\nHer summer court case was not meant to be a media spectacle, but it was meant to prove a point with the symbolic $1 request. As Time gave the platform to \u201cThe Silence Breakers,\u201d women who helped bring sexual assault and harassment to the forefront of the national conversation, as its 2017 Person of the Year, Swift was among the individuals highlighted. The Time interview is the first time Swift has done press about the court case, and in it she detailed reaching out to Kesha for support, as well as her feelings as she sat in the courtroom. \u201cI was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened,\u201d Swift said. \u201cThis man hadn\u2019t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn\u2019t hold back on my mom \u2014 why should I be polite? I\u2019m told it was the most amount of times the word \u2018ass\u2019 has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.\u201d\n\n#TimePOY A post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Dec 6, 2017 at 6:21am PST\n\nDec. 8 2017 \u2013 Swift Plays iHeartRadio\u2019s Z100 Jingle Ball in NYC\n\nThe pre-Super Bowl performance wasn\u2019t her only concert of 2017, after all.

It is said to function as a social network of sorts, leaning into Swift\u2019s hobby of \u201clurking\u201d and replying to fans on social media, and also offering an opportunity to \u201ccollect\u00a0Taymojis, stickers, pics, and more.\u201dOct. 20 - \u201cGorgeous\u201d releasedThe predictable yet addicting pop track the world was waiting for finally arrived.

Among the most obvious are Swift\u2019s birth year\u00a0spray-painted on a wall, the Chinese characters for \u201cYear of the Snake,\u201d as well as a similar lightning strike in the intro to Calvin Harris\u2019 \u201cThis is What You Came For\u201d album art.Nov. 2 - \u201cCall It What You Want\u201d lyric video releasedFans started to get a fuller picture of what was coming from Reputation in just over a week.

The Time interview is the first time Swift has done press about the court case, and in it she detailed reaching out to Kesha for support, as well as her feelings as she sat in the courtroom. \"I was angry. In that moment, I decided to forego any courtroom formalities and just answer the questions the way it happened,\u201d Swift said. \u201cThis man hadn\u2019t considered any formalities when he assaulted me, and his lawyer didn\u2019t hold back on my mom -- why should I be polite? I\u2019m told it was the most amount of times the word 'ass' has ever been said in Colorado Federal Court.\"\u00a0#TimePOYA post shared by Taylor Swift (@taylorswift) on Dec 6, 2017 at 6:21am PSTDec. 8 2017 - Swift Plays iHeartRadio\u2019s Z100 Jingle Ball in NYCThe pre-Super Bowl performance wasn\u2019t her only concert of 2017, after all.
