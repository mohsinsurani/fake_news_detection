Each brought unique talent, incredible intelligence, and their own individual bit of magic as they gave life to these iconic characters.\n\nGinny reinvented Snow White for a modern audience \u2013 there was no way she would be stuck cleaning up after dwarfs, she created an iconic empowered heroine for the 21st century.\n\nJosh mined the depths of Prince Charming \u2013 a character who in myth was just a 'type' but in his superlative interpretation became a complex man fighting for love and family.\n\nEmilie took the character of Belle to a deep and soulful place, bringing great intelligence and warmth to the character, making her fiercely independent, strong willed but also an eternal optimist who saw only the best in all those she encountered.\n\nRebecca took us on a broomstick roller coaster ride as she re-invented the Wicked Witch of the West by finding the pain beneath the green. She made the character soar to incredible heights while always keeping her grounded and relatable.\n\nAnd Jared literally grew up before the eyes of millions, from a child actor with enormous innate talent to a young man whose abilities continue to astound as he created a character who truly, as we say on the show, has the heart of the truest believer.\n\nWe can't thank them enough for the hard work, dedication, and passion they delivered day in and day out. Without them there would be no Once Upon a Time.\n\nAs Once continues, this group will always be the beating heart of the show. And even though we won't be with them every week, in a show about magic and hope, we fervently believe it won't be the last we see of them.\"", "images":
