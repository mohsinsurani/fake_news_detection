For this leg of their tour, Becky G is the opening act for the girls. At their stop in Argentina's Luna Park, the group that was formed on Season 2 of \"The X-Factor USA\" was singing \"Flex,\" when someone rushed on to the stage and security swiftly reacted and removed her. But the problem is that the girl they removed was actually our girl Becky.\n\nVideo of the moment has now gone viral on social media and it shows Becky running to the girls and security getting a hold of her and pulling her away. Normani Kordei saw everything go down and looked confused as to what was going on, but continued to dance the choreography. When Ally Brooke realized what was happening, she went to go save the \"Shower\" hit-maker and inform the guard she was no crazed fan rushing the stage.\n\nAfter the incident, Becky G answered one of her fans asking how she was and she replied: \"My arm kinda hurt but they just doing they job.\" Watch the hilarious moment below and tell us what you think!\n\nFifth Harmony recently had a viral moment during their performance at the MTV VMAs 2017, when they addressed Camila Cabello's controversial exit by having a fake Camila thrown off the stage. The girls address the epic moment the following day on \"Good Morning America\" and answered why they had done that. \"We get asked all the time if we're getting a fifth member,\" Ally Brooke said on \"Good Morning America.\" \"We wanted to show the world in an artistic way that the four of us are Fifth Harmony and we're stronger and better than we've ever been.\"\n\nCamila Cabello left the group abruptly back in December 2016. News was made official on December 19 in a statement shared from their official Twitter account. \u201cAfter 4 and a half years of being together, we have been informed via her representative that Camila has decided to leave Fifth Harmony. We wish her well.\u201d\n\nBecky G on the other hand has been showing her versatility and was recently on the \"Power Rangers\" reboot movie where she played the yellow ranger, an experience she absolutely loved. \"Man, I'm so excited to even just see... the way we've been filming so far, we're at this half-way point, we're almost done,\" she told to Pop Sugar. \"In real life, it feels like I'm connected to my character on-screen because it's a coming-of-age story. These young people figuring out who they are, what their place is in the world, at the same time as becoming these superheroes.\"\n\nBecky G\u2019s real name is Rebbeca Marie Gomez and is from Inglewood, California. Her first major hit was \u201cBecky From The Block,\u201d where she heavily sampled Jennifer Lopez\u2019 hit \u201cJenny From The Block.\u201d She has appeared in television with roles in \u201cAustin & Ally\u201d and \u201cEmpire\u201d, and will soon be seen back on the big screen in \u201cMiles.\u201d", "images": ["https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/mini/public/2022/10/07/large-tents-are-constructed-parking-lot-orchard-beach-bronx.jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-Hcp4uvGdUTnpL.gif", "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2017/10/03/becky-g.jpg", "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/mini/public/2021/09/30/us-army-2536185960720.jpg", "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/mini/public/2022/08/10/rocket-67724960720.jpg", "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/mini/public/2022/10/06/timothy-dykes-ldbyctaekiq-unsplash.jpg", "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/mini/public/2022/10/07/thousands-people-attend-enough-enough-strike-rally.jpg"], "top_img": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2017/10/03/becky-g.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.latintimes.com/becky-g-mistaken-fan-fifth-harmony-concert-removed-stage-security-video-424983", "title": "Becky G Mistaken By Fan At Fifth Harmony Concert, Removed From Stage By Security [VIDEO]", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "becky g, fifth harmony", "fb": {"app_id": 229373533940657, "pages": 492371650790156}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Latin Times", "url": "https://www.latintimes.com/becky-g-mistaken-fan-fifth-harmony-concert-removed-stage-security-video-424983", "title": "Becky G Removed From Fifth Harmony Concert By Security", "description": "The \"Shower\" hit-maker is supporting 5H during their Latin American tour and was mistakenly confused by security as a crazed fan.", "image": {"identifier": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2017/10/03/becky-g.jpg", "secure_url": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/2017/10/03/becky-g.jpg", "height": 751, "width": 1200, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thelatintimes", "section": "Entertainment", "modified_time": "2017-10-03T16:26:25-04:00", "published_time": "2017-10-03T16:26:25-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thelatintimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Becky G Removed From Fifth Harmony Concert By Security", "url": "https://www.latintimes.com/becky-g-mistaken-fan-fifth-harmony-concert-removed-stage-security-video-424983", "description": "The \"Shower\" hit-maker is supporting 5H during their Latin American tour and was mistakenly confused by security as a crazed fan.", "image": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/files/styles/large/public/2017/10/03/becky-g.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#17323f", "msapplication-config": "https://images.latintimes.com/sites/latintimes.com/themes/lt/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#17323f", "keywords": "becky g, fifth harmony", "description": "The \"Shower\" hit-maker is supporting 5H during their Latin American tour and was mistakenly confused by security as a crazed fan."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507062385.0, "source": "https://www.latintimes.com", "summary": ""}
