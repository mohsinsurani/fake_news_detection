While attending a New York Fashion Week event on Friday, September 8, Jim Carrey gave a very strange interview.\n\nThe 55-year-old actor began by circling around E! News host Catt Sadler at Harper\u2019s Bazaar\u2019s party celebrating Icons by Carine Roitfeld at the Plaza in New York City, and it only got more awkward from there.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no meaning to any of this,\u201d Carrey explained of his attendance at the star-studded event. \u201cSo I wanted to find the most meaningless thing that I could come to and join and here I am. You got to admit, it\u2019s completely meaningless.\u201d\n\nWhen Sadler added that the party was celebrating icons, Carrey replied, \u201cCelebrating icons? Boy, that\u2019s just the absolute lowest aiming possibility that we could come up with \u2026 I don\u2019t believe that you exist but there is a wonderful fragrance in the air.\u201d The comedian then broke into a James Brown impression.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t believe in personalities. I believe that peace lies beyond personalities, beyond invention and disguise, beyond the red \u2018S\u2019 you wear on your chest, that makes bullets bounce off,\u201d he continued, referencing a 2014 commencement speech he gave Maharishi University of Management in Iowa.\n\nSadler tried to switch topics and complimented Carrey\u2019s bright, patterned suit. \u201dI didn\u2019t get dressed up,\u201d he replied. \u201cThere is no me. There\u2019s just things happening. It\u2019s not our world \u2026 we don\u2019t matter.\u201d\n\nOther guests at the party included Selena Gomez and The Weeknd, Gigi Hadid, Nicki Minaj and Kim Kardashian.\n\nCarrey also went on a similar rant recently while he was a special guest in Michael Moore\u2019s Broadway show, The Terms of My Surrender, on Thursday, September 7.\n\nAccording to an onlooker, Carrey said that \u201chuman beings don\u2019t matter\u201d when Moore asked him what people can do to make a difference in the world.\n\n\u201cHe continued to say, \u2018We consume ourselves with food and sex because we don\u2019t want to drown in a river of our own tears,'\u201d the eyewitness exclusively tells Us Weekly. \u201cFor a pretty simple question it got really weird and deep, at times not making much sense. Even Michael Moore joked that it got awkward and ran long after Jim had left the stage.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jim-carrey-e2cefb7b-2f22-4084-9368-5e9636b7b7be.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jim-carrey-e2cefb7b-2f22-4084-9368-5e9636b7b7be.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Cristina Gibson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jim-carrey-gives-bizarre-interview-at-nyfw-event-watch-w502229/", "title": "Jim Carrey Gives Bizarre Interview at NYFW Event", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jim Carrey gave a rambling, bizarre interview while attending a New York Fashion Week event \u2014 watch what happened", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Jim Carrey Gives Bizarre Interview at NYFW Event", "description": "Jim Carrey gave a rambling, bizarre interview while attending a New York Fashion Week event \u2014 watch what happened", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/jim-carrey-gives-bizarre-interview-at-nyfw-event-watch-w502229/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:33:40+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jim-carrey-e2cefb7b-2f22-4084-9368-5e9636b7b7be.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jim-carrey-e2cefb7b-2f22-4084-9368-5e9636b7b7be.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-09-11T16:36:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:33:40+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jim Carrey Gives Bizarre Interview at NYFW Event", "description": "Jim Carrey gave a rambling, bizarre interview while attending a New York Fashion Week event \u2014 watch what happened", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/jim-carrey-e2cefb7b-2f22-4084-9368-5e9636b7b7be.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C945px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505147760.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
