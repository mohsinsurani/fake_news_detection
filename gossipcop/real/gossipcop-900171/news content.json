{"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/13/tavis-smiley-pbs-suspended/", "text": "On the eve of the 15th season and 3,000th episode of my nightly talk show, I was as shocked as anyone else by PBS\u2019 announcement today. Variety knew before I did.\n\nI have the utmost respect for women and celebrate the courage of those who have come forth to tell their truth. To be clear, I have never groped, coerced, or exposed myself inappropriately to any workplace colleague in my entire broadcast career, covering 6 networks over 30 years.\n\nNever. Ever. Never.\n\nPBS launched a so-called investigation of me without ever informing me. I learned of the investigation when former staffers started contacting me to share the uncomfortable experience of receiving a phone call from a stranger asking whether, I had ever done anything to make them uncomfortable, and if they could provide other names of persons to call. After 14 seasons, that\u2019s how I learned of this inquiry, from the streets.\n\nOnly after being threatened with a lawsuit, did PBS investigators reluctantly agree to interview me for three hours.\n\nIf having a consensual relationship with a colleague years ago is the stuff that leads to this kind of public humiliation and personal destruction, heaven help us. The PBS investigators refused to review any of my personal documentation, refused to provide me the names of any accusers, refused to speak to my current staff, and refused to provide me any semblance of due process to defend myself against allegations from unknown sources. Their mind was made up. Almost immediately following the meeting, this story broke in Varietyas an \u201cexclusive.\u201d Indeed, I learned more about these allegations reading the Variety story than the PBS investigator shared with me, the accused, in our 3 hour face to face meeting.\n\nMy attorneys were sent a formal letter invoking a contractual provision to not distribute my programming, and that was it.\n\nPut simply, PBS overreacted and conducted a biased and sloppy investigation, which led to a rush to judgment, and trampling on a reputation that I have spent an entire lifetime trying to establish.\n\nThis has gone too far. And, I, for one, intend to fight back.\n\nIt\u2019s time for a real conversation in America, so men and women know how to engage in the workplace. I look forward to actively participating in that conversation.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F12%2F21%2Fderek_160.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-628601226-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-628601226-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Derek Lawrence", "Updated December", "At Pm Est"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/13/tavis-smiley-pbs-suspended/", "title": "Tavis Smiley responds to suspension by PBS following sexual misconduct investigation", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "The host allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with multiple employees.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Tavis Smiley responds to suspension by PBS following sexual misconduct investigation", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/13/tavis-smiley-pbs-suspended/", "description": "The host allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with multiple employees.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-628601226-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/13/tavis-smiley-pbs-suspended/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-628601226-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/13/tavis-smiley-pbs-suspended/", "title": "Tavis Smiley responds to suspension by PBS following sexual misconduct investigation", "description": "The host allegedly engaged in sexual relationships with multiple employees.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-628601226-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/12/13/tavis-smiley-pbs-suspended/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513123200.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
