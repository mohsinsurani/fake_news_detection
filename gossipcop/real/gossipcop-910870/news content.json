But also, someone in our office said that someone from her, like, representative called and pitched her and he was pretty sure they thought it was a reality show. And I thought, well, \u2018How is that possible?\u2019\n\nShe continued, \u201cIf they think it\u2019s a reality show, why am I wearing a red wig and calling myself Valerie Cherish? And why would I be on a reality show called \u2018The Comeback?\u2019 That\u2019s the whole humiliating joke. Why would I do that?\u201d\n\nThe series featured a red-headed Kudrow as a has-been sitcom star vying for another shot at fame. And while a third season has yet to be confirmed, there have been discussions.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re talking anyway, talking about what that would look like,\u201d Kudrow told E! News in 2015.\n\nThe first 13-episode season of \u201cThe Comeback\u201d ran from June to September 2005. An additional eight episodes aired nine years later in late 2014.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/lindsay-lohan-valerie-cherish.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/02/lindsay-lohan-valerie-cherish.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["February"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/02/01/lisa-kudrow-lohans-team-thought-the-comeback-was-a-reality-show/", "title": "Lisa Kudrow: Lohan\u2019s team thought \u2018The Comeback\u2019 was a reality show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
