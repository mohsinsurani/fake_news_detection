All of her efforts came to fruition on Friday when the holiday pop up, created in collaboration with Earth + Element owner Elizabeth Di Prinzio, opened to the public in Los Angeles\u2019 Silver Lake neighborhood.\n\n\u201cWe poured our hearts and souls into this store so it\u2019s really nice to see everybody enjoying and appreciating and touching everything,\u201d Reed, 30, tells PEOPLE. \u201cThe brick-and-mortar model is really sweet, and I think part of what Liz and I are trying to do with our pop up is give different communities that same opportunity to come in and see things in person.\u201d\n\nOn top of the store opening, Reed is busy as a mom to her 16-month-old daughter Bodhi Soleil, whom she shares with her husband and former Vampire Diaries actor Ian Somerhalder. At one point during her conversation with PEOPLE, she jokingly admits, \u201cI have a 1-year-old \u2014 putting together a sentence is challenging.\u201d\n\nThe former Twilight actress is notoriously private when it comes to sharing anything about her daughter in the public eye (she has only ever shown her baby\u2019s feet in photos posted to her Instagram), but she says Bodhi is \u201cjust the most spectacular thing.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

Before Bodhi was born, Reed says, she and Somerhalder would typically be on planes every month or so flying back and forth to visit each other. But now that they\u2019re a family, they all travel together.\n\nBaYou with Love and Earth and Element\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re ready to have our feet planted on the ground and just nest again,\u201d she says. \u201cWe live such crazy nomadic lifestyles all over the place, on planes, and [we\u2019ve had] to uproot and move. Now that we\u2019re a family, the whole family goes together so that Mom and Dad can both be there at every second to witness every milestone and everything that\u2019s happening.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s kind of like you pick up the whole house and move it and set the house down,\u201d she continues. \u201cWe definitely are feeling right now like we miss home.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Nikki Reed Knows She Looks Like a \u201cTotally Different Person\u201d but Swears: \u201cI Haven\u2019t Done a Single Thing to My Face\u201d\n\nReed says she got back to her home in Los Angeles recently, and after being away for a while, she felt like it was time to check in on the animal rescues she has worked with for over a decade to see if they needed anything.\n\n\u201cWhen it rains, it pours,\u201d she says with a laugh. \u201cSo now we\u2019ve got so many fosters at the house and we actually can\u2019t travel because we have too many foster animals right now.\u201d\n\nReed says that her brood is a \u201cbig camping family,\u201d and that they love being in the outdoors.\n\n\u201cI think that\u2019s part of what Ian and I connected on the most when we got together, in fact, was how much we love to just strip it all away and be in nature,\u201d she says. \u201cWe probably spend 100 days out of 365 in our Airstream camping.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Ian Somerhalder and Nikki Reed Expecting First Child\n\nReed and Somerhalder got engaged in January 2015, just six months after they started dating. She says they love to drive across the country and participate in \u201call kinds of adventures.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe go down to Joshua Tree and New Mexico and all over the place,\u201d she says.\n\nWhen it comes to gift-giving, Reed says \u201ceverything\u201d Somerhalder gets her \u201cis really special.\u201d\n\n\u201cHis gifts come at random times,\u201d she says. \u201cWe\u2019re not always so big on obligatory shopping for each other. To me, it\u2019s about the random thought. There\u2019s something so sweet about coming home and there\u2019s a sunflower lying on the table with a note. We love to make each other things.\u201d\n\nSplash News\n\nReed\u2019s love for the outdoors extends to her eco-friendly jewelry collection, which she hopes shows customers that sustainably made pieces can be just as luxurious as those that are not.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really nice to have people touch things and see them in person because I think there\u2019s a misconception that sustainable goods are somehow considered, at times, less than,\u201d Reed says. \u201cThere\u2019s the illusion of luxury with virgin materials, which I think is becoming less and less common, which is great. But it\u2019s wonderful to see people pick up a diamond ring that\u2019s made from recycled gold and go, \u2018Oh wow, this doesn\u2019t feel any less luxurious than any other diamond ring that I would pick up.\u2019 \u201d\n\nReed wears all the jewelry she designed herself for the collection on a daily basis, but has had to forego wearing some rings because of her daughter. \u201cWhen you have a 1-year-old, I don\u2019t generally wear too much on my hands anymore because I\u2019m picking her up all day long,\u201d she says. \u201cBut I don\u2019t take any of it [off], honestly.\u201d",
