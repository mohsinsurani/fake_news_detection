But maybe there's a more modern version: have it cloned so you get to keep it around a little longer.\n\nAfter all, that's what iconic singer and actress Barbra Streisand did, as she revealed to Variety on Tuesday. When her beloved 14-year-old Coton du Tulear dog Samantha wasn't doing well, she had her cloned ... twice!\n\nSamantha died in May 2017, and over the new year Streisand welcomed adorable new pups into her life: Miss Violet and Miss Scarlet, who are clones of Samantha. Before their \"mama\" passed, Streisand had cells taken from Samantha's mouth and stomach, and ... voila! Adorable fluffy pups that match her DNA.\n\n\"They have different personalities,\" she told Variety. \"I'm waiting for them to get older so I can see if they have (Samantha's) brown eyes and seriousness.\"\n\nShe's also got a third dog named Miss Fanny, who is a distant cousin of Samantha's and is named after Streisand's Oscar-winning turn as Fanny Brice from 1968 film \"Funny Girl.\"\n\nOur new basket of adorables A post shared by Barbra Streisand (@barbrastreisand) on Dec 25, 2017 at 11:25am PST\n\nWhen the three first arrived, she dressed them in different-colored sweaters to tell them apart.\n\nPrices for the procedure vary; Time reports that in 2015 one leading company was reportedly charging $100,000 to clone a dog while others report the procedure costs $50,000 for a dog and $25,000 for a cat.\n\nWhether for financial or emotional reasons, fans told TODAY that they would not choose to clone their pet.\n\nBarbra Streisand recently revealed that she cloned her late dog. Would you want to clone your pet? \u2014 TODAY (@TODAYshow) February 28, 2018\n\nStreisand has completely embraced the clone lifestyle, dressing her new canine friends in designer clothing and buying cute toys for them. According to Variety, she wanted a portrait taken of herself with the dogs that could be called \"Send in the Clones.\"\n\nThere's still a part of Streisand, however, that will always miss Samantha, the \"mom\" of her pet family.\n\nHere's to Miss Violet and Miss Scarlet and Miss Fanny carrying on her memory.\n\nFollow Randee Dawn on Twitter.", "images":
