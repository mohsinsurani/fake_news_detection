Though she said Fergie was \u201cthe best,\u201d Williams said the singer \u201cneeds auto-tune.\u201d\n\n\"There are only a few people who can sing raw... and Fergie is not one,\" Williams said during her show. \"She needs auto-tune. Jen Lopez needs auto-tune. Janet [Jackson] needs auto-tune. Beyonc\u00e9 needs auto-tune.\"\n\nFergie said she was sorry for the panned performance.\n\n\u201cI've always been honored and proud to perform the national anthem and last night I wanted to try something special for the NBA. I'm a risk taker artistically, but clearly this rendition didn't strike the intended tone. I love this country and honestly tried my best,\u201d the Black Eyed Peas singer told TMZ.\n\nWilliams said she felt that Fergie \u201cdidn\u2019t need to apologize\u201d and the backlash over the performance would simmer down by next week.\n\nMARIAH CAREY GIVES FERGIE ADVICE AFTER DISASTROUS NATIONAL ANTHEM PERFORMANCE\n\nWilliams isn\u2019t the only one mocking Fergie for the sultry rendition. Roseanne Barr, who sang the national anthem at a 1990 Padres game, chimed in about the debacle on Twitter Monday, saying: \u201cWho saw Fergie\u2019s national anthem performance at the NBA All Star Game? I think mine was better lowkey.\u201d\n\nOther people, including A-list celebrities and basketball players, were caught laughing Sunday during the singer\u2019s performance. On social media, Fergie faced an onslaught of criticism.\n\nMariah Carey, however, had nicer things to say to Fergie, including some advice amid the backlash.\n\n\u201cDarling, nobody needs to listen to that,\u201d Carey told TMZ while waving her hand back and forth while walking out of a Los Angeles restaurant.", "images": ["https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/untitled-design-3.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/kevinSpacey.jpeg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/GettyImages-597569672.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/untitled-design-3.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/340/340/i-6nn3jxm-l.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/436b45c1-kushner-kloss-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-411.svg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/sly-wife.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/Kesha-Dr-Luke.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/06/348/196/beyonce.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/untitled-design-3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Lam", "Katherine Lam Is A Breaking", "Trending News Digital Producer For Fox News.
