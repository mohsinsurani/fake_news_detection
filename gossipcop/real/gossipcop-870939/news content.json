But what exactly is it about that Canadian crooner that she loves and admires so much? Well, now we know.\n\nWhen her interviewer for InStyle's September cover casually commented that the duo seemed very \"happy\" together, Selena was quick to agree, but also noted that other parts of her life make her equally happy, too.\n\n\"I really am. It's great,\" she said. \"I don't depend on one area of my life to make me happy. It's really important for me to love and nourish my friends and family and to make sure that I never get influenced by a guy. I've wanted to be in a strong headspace for years, and I really wasn't. Before, I was so young and easily influenced, and I'd feel insecure. You want someone to add to your life, not to complete you, if that makes sense. I'm lucky because he's more of a best friend than anything else.\"\n\nBeing able to control her narrative on her own terms \u2014 romance and all \u2014 is very important to Selena, especially when it means caring less about what other people think. She was asked about an Instagram post from 2016 which she captioned with, \"I finally fought the fight of not being enough.\"\n\n\"That just goes back to where I am in my life \u2014 of course I care, but I care less and less, and that\u2019s so freeing,\" she responded. \"My livelihood can\u2019t depend on 'Am I liked?' When I was on Disney, it was like, 'Oh, they didn\u2019t like it?' It hurts your feelings. \"", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831a332200ef0be49bebf1/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/selena-wknd.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631f2cef8bb2855c92d3a84d/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631f3d4eb05319bd1c71bf11/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6333158d3711910049c15153/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633731991d0a88c2c0e4dad7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831c4d4077d013e01362e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-fb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831c4d4077d013e01362e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Devon Elizabeth"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-speaks-about-the-weeknd-instyle", "title": "Selena Gomez Calls The Weeknd \u201cMore of a Best Friend Than Anything Else\"", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Selena Gomez has opened up about her romantic relationship with the Weekend in a new interview, and she clearly likes him a lot.", "id": "598319239062cb124d602415", "keywords": "snd,selena gomez,the weeknd", "news_keywords": "snd,selena gomez,the weeknd", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "598319239062cb124d602415", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Selena Gomez has opened up about her romantic relationship with the Weekend in a new interview, and she clearly likes him a lot.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831a332200ef0be49bebf1/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/selena-wknd.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831a332200ef0be49bebf1/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/selena-wknd.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "No, you're crying!", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831c4d4077d013e01362e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Selena Gomez Says The Weeknd Is \u201cMore of a Best Friend Than Anything Else\u201d", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/selena-gomez-speaks-about-the-weeknd-instyle"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-03T13:17:23.201Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-03T13:17:23.201Z", "author": "Devon Elizabeth"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "No, you're crying!", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59831c4d4077d013e01362e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/selena-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Selena Gomez Says The Weeknd Is \u201cMore of a Best Friend Than Anything Else\u201d"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501766243.201, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
