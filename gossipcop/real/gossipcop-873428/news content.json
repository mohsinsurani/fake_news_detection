In the sneak-peek from Sunday\u2019s new episode of Life of Kylie, she is feeling depressed, and Caitlyn Jenner is doing her best to cheer her up.\n\n\u2018What\u2019s going on? Do you have any life left in you?\u2019 Caitlyn asks sad Kylie. \u2018We gotta do something; you can\u2019t sit around here and mope.\u2019\n\nIn her confessional, Kylie explains the reason for her depression. \u2018The hardest part about having a relationship for me is just that it\u2019s blasted all over the Internet,\u2019 she says.\n\n\u2018You have to hear about other people\u2019s opinions on who you\u2019re with. It\u2019s a lot. Most of the time it\u2019s just not true. Like you have no idea what I\u2019m like in a relationship, what kind of bond I have with somebody else.\u2019\n\nShe believes that you cannot win with the Internet and all that haters do is spread unnecessary negativity.\n\nShe also confessed the fact that she sometimes feels like she is in a relationship with the world.\n\nKylie recently turned twenty, and she celebrated this great occasion the night before with a small group of friends and with her family.\n\n\ud83c\udf3b A post shared by Kylie (@kyliejenner) on Aug 14, 2017 at 3:48pm PDT\n\nThere was also a giant ice sculpture of herself. The reality star and business woman is on her way to becoming a billionaire, and this is happening thanks to her multi-million dollar makeup company.\n\nKylie had an ice sculpture resembling her butt and a chocolate fountain and birthday cake.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nBut, her best presents may have come from her boyfriend, Travis Scott. The rapper spoiled her with a diamond necklace and a full-string orchestra right on the morning of her birthday. Now there are officially no more teenagers in the Jenner family.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kylie-Jenners-Family-Prefer-Travis-Scott-To-Tyga-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/the-kardashians-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BrandonFitch-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tiny-Harris-Outfit-Video-300x242.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Tiny-And-T.I.-Saving-Marriage-After-Drama-300x183.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Brad-Pitt-Angelina-Jolie-Divorce-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kylie-Jenner-Says-the-Hardest-Part-Of-Dating-Is-Hearing-Unnecessary-Negativity-From-Haters-Online.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kim-Kardashian-Tells-The-Truth-About-Her-72-Day-Marriage-To-Kris-Humphries-I-Physically-Couldnt-Do-It-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Bernice-Burgos-Hot-Bikini-T.I.-Tameka-Tiny-Harris-300x219.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kourtney-Kardashian-Flaunts-Underboob-In-Tiny-Bikini-In-Sexy-Photo-From-Romantic-Getaway-With-Younes-Check-Out-The-Steamy-Pics-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Miley-Cyrus-Embraces-The-Woman-She-Is-Today-In-Epic-Retro-Themed-Video-For-\u2018Younger-Now\u2019-Watch-It-Here-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Kylie-Jenner-Says-the-Hardest-Part-Of-Dating-Is-Hearing-Unnecessary-Negativity-From-Haters-Online.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Fitch"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170818130249/http://celebrityinsider.org/kylie-jenner-says-the-hardest-part-of-dating-is-hearing-unnecessary-negativity-from-haters-online-59583/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Says The Hardest Part Of Dating Is Hearing Unnecessary Negativity From Haters Online", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Brandon Fitch", "news_keywords": "caitlyn jenner, kylie jenner, travis scott,", "keywords": "celebrity news, caitlyn jenner, kylie jenner, travis scott,", "description": "Kylie Jenner is not afraid to admit the haters can get to her sometimes online.
