Winning or losing is all one organic mechanism, from which one extracts what one needs.\u201d\n\nBut that was just a movie character named Gloria Clemente, who was played masterfully by Rosie Perez in 1992\u2019s \u201cWhite Men Can\u2019t Jump.\u201d Aside from those massive \u201cJeopardy!\u201d winnings (\u201cWhat is a Quahog?\u201d), what does she know anyway? Plus, we\u2019re talking about TV here, where when you win, you win. And when you lose, well, just ask ABC.\n\nTheWrap digged through the data (and relied heavy on circumstantial observation) to come up with Summer 2017\u2019s nine small-screen winners and losers. Check out our list and reasons below.\n\nAlso Read: 2017 Creative Arts Emmys: The Complete List of Night 1 Winners\n\nWinner: The Actual Winner\n\nOur first winner is an easy one, as NBC was the No. 1 broadcast network for another summer in Nielsen\u2019s TV ratings \u2014 its seventh in a row for the key 18-49 demo, and third among total viewers.\n\nAlong the way, NBC launched a new legit hit in \u201cWorld of Dance,\u201d which proved a terrific partner for summer crown jewel \u201cAmerica\u2019s Got Talent.\u201d Expect those two to dominate together for years to come.\n\n\u201cWeekend Update: Summer Edition\u201d was no slouch performer either and \u201cAmerican Ninja Warrior\u201d stayed doing its thing.\n\nBut don\u2019t worry for NBC when the leaves change color: \u201cThis Is Us\u201d will be back, and \u201cSunday Night Football\u201d is set to again be the biggest show of the season. Plus, the Peacock\u2019s got a killer combination coming up in 2018: Super Bowl LII and a little TV show called the Winter Olympics. Good luck, everyone else.\n\nAlso Read: Summer 2017 Movie Winners and Losers, From 'Spider-Man: Homecoming' to 'The House' (Photos)\n\nLoser: Every Rose Has Its Thorn(s)\n\nThere was very little love surrounding the \u201cBachelor\u201d franchise this summer.\n\nFirst up, Rachel Lindsay\u2019s \u201cBachelorette\u201d finale slipped double digits in ratings from the prior year\u2019s version. Then there was the ugly \u201cBachelor in Paradise\u201d sex scandal, when Corinne Olympios called herself a \u201cvictim\u201d after a sexual encounter with DeMario Jackson. A tone-deaf promo ahead of the show\u2019s return didn\u2019t help fans forget the controversy and hop back on board.\n\nFinally, the ABC franchise finished the summer with an unpopular choice for its next \u201cBachelor.\u201d Peter Kraus was RIGHT THERE, you guys.\n\nAlso Read: 43 Summer TV Premieres Ranked by Total Viewers (Photos)\n\nWinner: Cup a Joe\n\nAnd Joe and Mika thought a May engagement would be the highlight of their year\u2026\n\nPerhaps no one on television has directly benefitted more from the President Trump era than MSNBC\u2019s morning show, \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski have become NBCU\u2019s new \u201cMust-See TV,\u201d generally spending their weekday mornings shredding the hapless White House administration from 6 a.m. (or 5, if you\u2019re into \u201cFirst Look\u201d) to 9.\n\nThese months, it\u2019s the rare day one wakes up, checks the Twitter trends and doesn\u2019t see \u201cMorning Joe\u201d among the Top 10. So yeah, good summer guys.\n\nAlso Read: ABC's 'In an Instant' Is Summer's Lowest-Rated Broadcast TV Show\n\nLoser: Keep Your Pants on, Fox\n\nThis has been a summer to forget for Fox\u2019s cable networks, and it would have been even worse if Bill O\u2019Reilly had made it to the warmer months.\n\nIn June, Fox Sports National Networks president Jamie Horowitz exited amid claims of misconduct, which he denied. A month later, Fox News\u2019 Eric Bolling was benched for reportedly sending unsolicited, lewd text messages to female colleagues. Bolling would be fired weeks later.\n\nAdditionally, Fox Business Network\u2019s Charles Payne was suspended from July 6 through Sept. 8 as the company investigated sexual harassment allegations into yet another on-air personality. Considering he returned, it stands to reason that Payne was cleared behind-close-doors of the former guest\u2019s behind-closed-doors accusations.\n\nAlso Read: Why NBC Will Win Its 7th Straight Summer in TV Ratings\n\nWinner AND Loser: HBO\u2019s \u201cCrown\u201d Jewel\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d is pretty popular, in case you hadn\u2019t heard.\n\nThe HBO juggernaut\u2019s second-to-last season, which signed off last month, was rewarded with widespread praise and numerous series highs in ratings. No dragons were circling here.\n\nAlas, things didn\u2019t entirely go off without a hitch, as hackers informed the network in July that they had breached its system. When HBO declined to heed the $6 million-plus ransom demand, the thieves leaked details and scripts for then-unaired \u201cThrones\u201d episodes, along with other company information.\n\nBut given the massive viewership despite the leaks for the show based on George R.R. Martin\u2019s books, HBO appears to have made the right call in its refusal to kowtow.\n\nAlso Read: Fall TV Premiere Calendar: 164 New and Returning Shows (Photos)\n\nLoser: The Worldwide Leader in Bad PR\n\nESPN continued to see its power diminish this summer, as the network shed hundreds of thousands of subscribers as it continues to be hit hard by cord-cutting. Parent company Disney announced an ESPN-branded streaming service to stem the bleeding, but that won\u2019t launch until next year.\n\nIf that wasn\u2019t bad enough, the cable giant was accused of mishandling a tweet by \u201cSportsCenter\u201d anchor Jemele Hill, turning it into a national story that even prompted the White House to call for her firing.\n\n\n\nAdding to the hits: ESPN radio host Ryen Russillo was suspended and forced to pay $250 after wandering into the wrong Wyoming hotel room while drunk, and the network pulled announcer Robert Lee off of a University of Virginia telecast following the protests in Charlottesville. Because, you know, same name as Robert E. Lee.\n\nAlso Read: 47 Fall TV Actors Ranked Most to Least Liked, From Michael Weatherly to Matt LeBlanc (Photos)\n\nWinner: \u201cSeacrest, In!\u201d (Everything)\n\nIt was a good time to be Ryan Seacrest, as if there\u2019s ever a bad time to be the wildly prolific multi-hyphenate.\n\nIn addition to scoring solid ratings on \u201cLive\u201d after landing the coveted co-hosting gig opposite Kelly Ripa, he finalized his deal in July to return as the face of \u201cAmerican Idol,\u201d picking up a substantial payday for ABC\u2019s reboot ahead of its likely 2018 launch.\n\nThe always-busy Seacrest also continues to launch new properties in the polarizing Kardashian empire (yes, he has an EP credit on this summer\u2019s E! unscripted series \u201cLife of Kylie\u201d), and he still hosts his morning radio show, thanks in part to ABC building him his own radio studio to cut down on his commute.\n\nAlso Read: 34 Fall TV Actresses Ranked Most to Least Liked, From Pauley Perrette to America Ferrera (Photos)\n\nLoser: Not Quite \u201c60 Minutes\u201d\n\nMaybe Megyn Kelly\u2019s fans all spent the summer camping and away from TV access?\n\nThe Fox News alum launched \u201cSunday Night With Megyn Kelly\u201d in June, and despite a hot start thanks to star guest Russian President Vladimir Putin, her primetime talker\u2019s ratings were unimpressive, as the show often had trouble topping reruns of CBS\u2019 venerable \u201c60 Minutes.\u201d\n\nGiven that she takes over for the third hour of \u201cToday\u201d in the fall, NBC brass are presumably holding their breath that Kelly is just taking a little time to find her audience.\n\nAlso Read: 'Will & Grace' Revival to Actor Mixup: 7 Things We Learned at TCA and 7 Unsolved Mysteries (Photos)\n\nWinner: It\u2019s Showtime!\n\nFloyd Mayweather\u2019s final bout might not have been his most impressive, but it was certainly a big win for the premium cable network behind it.\n\nShowtime\u2019s telecast of the highly anticipated match between the undefeated boxer and UFC standout Conor McGregor is expected to have broken pay-per-view records, with final numbers still to come. Plus, despite concern from fans that the seemingly uneven matchup would be a snooze-fest, the fight actually didn\u2019t suck.\n\nIt wasn\u2019t just fisticuffs that gave Showtime a boost. \u201cTwin Peaks\u201d was back in all its head-scratching glory, with the return to Washington bringing solid ratings and plenty of watercooler buzz.\n\nAlso Read: 15 New Fall TV Shows You'll Want to Catch, From 'Inhumans' to 'Star Trek: Discovery' (Photos)\n\nDid we miss anyone of consequence?
