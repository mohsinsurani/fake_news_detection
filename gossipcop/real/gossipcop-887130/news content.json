News.\n\nThe baby boy was born via C-section on Monday, according to the outlet, and is named Logan Alexander. He weighed 7 lbs. and 2 oz., and was 19 inches long.\n\n\u201cWe are so overjoyed and happy to welcome baby Logan into our family,\u201d Stage and husband Kris Jason told E! in a statement.\n\nThe proud parents additionally told E!, \u201cSarah, husband Kris and baby Logan are resting. Sarah delivered Logan this afternoon and is resting with new baby per the Doctors orders. Her toddler James is with family, has met his baby brother and the family is very excited. Sarah and family thanks everyone for their overwhelming amount of support, and promises everyone will get to see baby Logan soon.\u201d\n\nStage and Jason also share son James Hunter, 2.\n\nThe 33-year-old fit mom has faced criticism for her small belly during both pregnancies, but continued to keep up with her workouts. At eight months pregnant in August, Stage revealed she had only gained 18 pounds.\n\nTaking on the critics in an Instagram post that month, Stage wrote, \u201cSince I\u2019ve announced my second pregnancy, I\u2019ve had certain \u2018Instagram medical experts\u2019 tell me what I should and shouldn\u2019t do.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Model Sarah Stage Keeps Up Her Workouts as She Hits Her 9th Month of Pregnancy\n\n\u201cAnd while I find some of the comments hilarious, I choose to only listen to my OBGYN and of course I also listen to MY body. If something feels off, I don\u2019t do it! I always do what\u2019s best for my growing baby and put him first!\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cIt\u2019s a proven medical fact that continuing exercising while pregnant has many health benefits for you and baby. There are also some people who assume that since I am exercising while pregnant, that I\u2019m obsessed with how I \u2018look\u2019 but in fact I\u2019m obsessed with maintaining a healthy lifestyle that will give my baby and myself the best possible quality of life.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/X0qjoWsj9R3dxVHMoQ61akpSHL8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(216x0:218x2)/sarah-stage-435-ef879c9546ed4108b9d3264ef574c083.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ZOpQVp7Obtr-TADlfBt8zhlzEoU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(674x286:676x288)/criss-angel-baby-daughter-0c24bf2077a14602a90e9029442947ef.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/tKLEKGAX6jzgMY_xdleH_Hs7Tmc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(299x0:301x2)/sarah-stage-600-2-a784e2927816435d9be588f191b0d11d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0z3DVhzgUZHa1Aq_XFoUPucPrq8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(1179x332:1181x334)/Morgan-Stewart-2000-36e101f928d04d1b9624d770b5f9716f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/aSqDNkqo81HMzHWy8c02fS9AfTE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/sarah-stage1-ff580c602fa84b7f9e3608577ba1f073.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/d3TGbFzoktw3ptSuUu6OrhM6eXY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(640x539:642x541)/katherine-schwarzenegger-chris-pratt-2000-e706516a209f47f5a3aca3cf6490f194.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vkXNBxV868QwhSLzmRJLUDRDxmk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/Lindsay-Ellingson-baby-1-9f0a9ce158e64a4d94fc099eeb4d460f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6sVToENMHlyKL1KGfdTp2XL1kKg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(559x59:561x61)/jessica-hart-28a3af502431461f82478900d3606019.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/M9oxrsoeziHN7UUD9UEi3ZOnUo0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(436x0:438x2)/sarah-stage3-17c717f5d78349fd92021e0c0ca72627.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6Qg-7esdQ88GG5HAKkAhWgvaSXc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(485x247:487x249)/cardi-b-65d3e8b3c82f4d7694a3ea7f91e20e84.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/6C1si9FuAEVMRL5BfzBVOikgtKU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(852x0:854x2)/rob-dyrdek-baby-2000-de0d98e535ca42dab0404512922b55ad.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/QKoZ3IHp4iQsn2qhOVwRYyzQA2k=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(657x279:659x281)/tyler-joseph-a4e71c2a06b941ffa8e109ebe6d783cf.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/EB9LI9gOJLowXlBuxngivvgowXU=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(598x0:600x2)/sarah-stage-1-1-91e95392ae4d4557b3301ea0581ef8af.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NcgdxbDw8l-mF_ZVGQRXn4D98ag=/860x1034/filters:fill(auto,1)/sarah-stage-860554fd2e4b477eb02073ff54d0f643.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/yU-wMK_zmAmhhTSQXuE3ZUPbqPo=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x0:541x2)/sarah-stage-2-0a66b6a5c1a44fa8801036f3c8b9b51d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/fJm9k7aTCUV-7-VoPiMs0XQ-Gsw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(506x284:508x286)/john-mulaney-62d31ea5169e4255ade0e314aee0b838.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/F0YFiMY5hP1CAXbPz8xbVdtBJh0=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(824x351:826x353)/amy-slaton-baby-3-89b5ee4d36ce477a8068657f70f8b49c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7gA6Efqf5J9Uf6EcdMlMCxailSM=/900x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(429x0:431x2)/sarah-stage-860554fd2e4b477eb02073ff54d0f643.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/NcgdxbDw8l-mF_ZVGQRXn4D98ag=/860x1034/filters:fill(auto,1)/sarah-stage-860554fd2e4b477eb02073ff54d0f643.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lindsay Kimble", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/health/six-pack-mom-sarah-stage-gives-birth-second-child/", "title": "Sarah Stage Welcomes Second Child", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Sarah Stage's second child, a boy, was born via C-section on Monday and is named Logan Alexander, according to E!
