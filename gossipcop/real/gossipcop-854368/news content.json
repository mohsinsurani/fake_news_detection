How did that happen? Did they flip a coin and he said, \u2018Listen, I\u2019m doing the rap one\u2019.\u201d\n\nLiam recently said that he \u201cwouldn\u2019t dare\u201d anger One Direction fans. Speaking to Pitchfork, Gallagher said: \u201cI may look stupid but wouldn\u2019t dare get on the wrong side of One Direction fans.\u201d\n\nDespite Liam\u2019s warm words about Styles, brother Noel Gallagher has spoken less favourably of the ex-1D star, saying: \u201cPeople of my age have let themselves go, they\u2019re fat, balding idiots with fading tattoos. They sit in their garage and write shite like \u2018Sign of the Times\u2019 for Harry Styles. Which, quite frankly, my cat could have written in about 10 minutes!\u201d\n\nHe added: \u201cI don\u2019t mind the song, my wife was falling over herself, \u2018Have you heard Harry Styles\u2019 new song? It\u2019s like Prince\u2019, I was like, \u2018Without even hearing it, I can assure you it\u2019s not like Prince!\u2019\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nLiam is expected to release his debut solo album \u2018As You Were\u2019 in October. Noel\u2019s next album is coming out a month later in November.", "images": ["https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Liam-Payne-Liam-Gallagher.jpg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/logo-nme-white.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/logo-nme.svg", "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Liam-Payne-Liam-Gallagher-696x442.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Liam-Payne-Liam-Gallagher.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Luke Morgan Britton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/liam-gallagher-disses-one-direction-star-liam-paynes-solo-career-2090359", "title": "Liam Gallagher disses One Direction star Liam Payne\u2019s solo career", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ex-Oasis man Liam Gallagher disses the musical direction of former One Direction star Liam Payne's solo career", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "type": "article", "title": "Liam Gallagher disses One Direction star Liam Payne's solo career", "description": "Ex-Oasis man Liam Gallagher disses the musical direction of former One Direction star Liam Payne's solo career", "url": "https://www.nme.com/news/music/liam-gallagher-disses-one-direction-star-liam-paynes-solo-career-2090359", "site_name": "NME", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.nme.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/Liam-Payne-Liam-Gallagher.jpg", "width": 1000, "height": 635, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/nmemagazine/", "published_time": "2017-06-19T20:03:02+00:00"}, "author": "Luke Morgan Britton", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@nme", "site": "@nme", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Luke Morgan Britton", "label2": "Estimated reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/vSW2M-BB1NE?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1497902582.0, "source": "https://www.nme.com", "summary": ""}
