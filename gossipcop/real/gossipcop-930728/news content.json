Kylie Jenner went all-out for boyfriend Travis Scott\u2019s birthday. The makeup mogul rented out Six Flags Magic Mountain on Saturday, April 28, just a few days before the rapper turns 26 on Monday, April 30.\n\nThe couple and their friends headed to the amusement park wearing matching customized hoodies with the \u201cGoosebumps\u201d rapper\u2019s birthday printed on them. The group enjoyed a customized cake shaped like a roller coaster, which had tiny replicas of the pair with their 2-month-old daughter, Stormi Webster, on the ride.\n\nThe Life of Kylie star, 20, also gave an ode to Scott\u2019s hometown of Houston, Texas, by turning Magic Mountain park in California into AstroWorld, which closed down in his city in 2005. Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian, Jordyn Woods and Jenner\u2019s assistant Victoria Villarroel Gamero were all there for the celebration, as well the Grammy nominee\u2019s friends. Kanye West, who was also at the celebration, shared a photo of the cake on Twitter, writing: \u201cHappy birthday Trav.\u201d\n\nScroll down below to see more photos from the rapper\u2019s birthday celebration.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.png?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2000px%2C1048px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.png?w=1600&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.png?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2000px%2C1048px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kylie-jenner-rents-out-six-flags-for-travis-scotts-birthday/", "title": "Kylie Jenner Rents Out Six Flags for Travis Scott\u2019s Birthday", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "gallery", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kylie Jenner showed her love for boyfriend Travis Scott on his birthday by renting out Six Flags for him on Saturday, April 28 \u2014 see the pics", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kylie Jenner Rents Out Six Flags for Travis Scott\u2019s Birthday", "description": "Kylie Jenner showed her love for boyfriend Travis Scott on his birthday by renting out Six Flags for him on Saturday, April 28 \u2014 see the pics", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/pictures/kylie-jenner-rents-out-six-flags-for-travis-scotts-birthday/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-29T16:11:25+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.png?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2000px%2C1048px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.png?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2000px%2C1048px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-04-29T14:54:23+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-29T16:11:25+00:00"}, "author": "Karla Rodriguez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kylie Jenner Rents Out Six Flags for Travis Scott\u2019s Birthday", "description": "Kylie Jenner showed her love for boyfriend Travis Scott on his birthday by renting out Six Flags for him on Saturday, April 28 \u2014 see the pics", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/kylie-jenner-travis-scott.png?crop=0px%2C34px%2C2000px%2C1048px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525013663.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
