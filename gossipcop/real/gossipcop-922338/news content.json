Below, Kate meeting students who welcomed the couple to the Copper Box Arena at London\u2019s Olympic Park.\n\nToday\u2019s events are designed to celebrate the Commonwealth as part of the ramp-up to the April Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting (CHOGM) in London. The first engagement was with SportsAid.\n\nPrince William played some wheelchair basketball with athletes hoping to compete at the 2022 Commonwealth Games in Birmingham.\n\nMore from the Newham Recorder:\n\nThe royals watched a wheelchair basketball session before meeting the players, including television presenter Ade Adepitan, who won a Paralympic bronze at Athens in 2004. Prince William then had a go at the sport himself, taking three attempts to net a basketball from a wheelchair as his wife Kate, who is due to give birth to the couple\u2019s third child in the next few weeks, watched on.\n\nPerhaps the Duchess is offering a few tips\u2026.?\n\nKate and William also spent time speaking with the athletes.\n\nBack to the Recorder story:\n\nAnnually, SportsAid supports more than 1,000 athletes, mainly teenagers, with money towards training and competing costs. The charity also helps develop other vital skills for professional athletes by providing media training, nutritional advice and performance lifestyle guidance.\n\nThere was a quiz this morning testing everyone\u2019s knowledge of the Commonwealth.\n\n?The Duke and Duchess get involved in a Commonwealth Quiz! Today\u2019s visit comes less than a month before the 2018 Commonwealth Games get underway on the Gold Coast of Australia. #GC2018 pic.twitter.com/CXhY5Ln0jZ \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) March 22, 2018\n\n\n\nThe second stop was at St. Luke\u2019s Trust, a community center located in Clerkenwell, London. Simon Perry of People posted this video of the couple arriving and being given a posy by 4-year-old Rhea Richards.\n\nKate receives a posy from a little girl on the couple\u2019s next stop of the day at a community center in Clerkenwell, London pic.twitter.com/p5cwoEAB5N \u2014 Simon Perry (@SPerryPeoplemag) March 22, 2018\n\nKate and William spent time with those who use the center.\n\nKate seemed to be enjoying herself at both engagements today; this video from Rebecca English shows her wrapping up a conversation with visitors at the center.\n\nVideo: William and Kate chatted with users of @StLukesTrust after their cookery session biglunch pic.twitter.com/FyEIPx13vK \u2014 Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) March 22, 2018\n\nKensington Palace reports the center \u201cprovides services and activities for locals, including a fully-equipped cookery school, which runs community classes on healthy, home cooking & avoiding good waste.\u201d The Duke and Duchess helped prepare a Commonwealth Big Lunch while at the center.\n\nOverseen by The Eden Project, Big Lunches are community events generally taking place between Commonwealth Day and the start of the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting.\n\nThe Eden Project posted a video of the royals at work in the kitchen.\n\nIt\u2019s been such a fantastic day with TRH Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@KensingtonRoyal) who have been getting stuck in with the cooking at @StLukesTrust for our #CommonwealthBigLunch. \u2013 @Commonwealth18\n\nDoes anyone recognise the dishes we\u2019ve made? pic.twitter.com/EzBHOpz8pA \u2014 Eden Project Communities (@edencommunities) March 22, 2018\n\nThis was vintage Kate: relaxed, laughing, enjoying herself.\n\nThe Daily Mail\u2019s Rebecca English posted a video of Kate chatting with Yolanda from Bolivia; the Duchess spoke about how much Prince George and Princess Charlotte love making pizza dough and getting their hands messy.\n\nKate tells Yolanda from Bolivia how much Prince George and Princess Charlotte love making pizza dough and getting their hands messy. pic.twitter.com/4BnGnVFQuZ \u2014 Rebecca English (@RE_DailyMail) March 22, 2018\n\nNow to what Kate wore at today\u2019s engagements.\n\nMany immediately recognized the Goat Redgrave coat. The collarless style has an A-line silhouette and is made of heavy crepe wool; there are concealed buttons on the front closure. The Duchess was in a new piece from a favorite retailer, Hobbs London. The style is called the Rosie, and it is available at Hobbs online ($165), and selling quickly, as one would expect.\n\nA look at Kate in the top, this photo is also via Rebecca English.\n\nMade from 100% rayon, the Rosie features a small floral print, squared boat neckline, and three-quarter sleeves with a notch at the cuff. Our thanks to Annabelle Gonzalez for her speedy ID of the top.\n\nThe Rosie is still available in limited sizes and at vastly different prices at the following retailers:\n\nThe print is also offered in the Dana Silk Scarf (\u00a335, about $50); we show the piece at Debenhams.\n\nThe print was also used for the Rosie Dress; we show it at Bloomingdale\u2019s, where it is $270. The frock is also offered at Debenhams, where it is \u00a371, roughly $100.\n\nKate\u2019s jeans are not yet IDed. It\u2019s possible she is wearing the jeans first seen at a Brooklyn Nets game in 2014.\n\nThis view shows Kate\u2019s jeans in 2014 (L and R) and those worn today (C).\n\nI\u2019m still looking for additional photos that may help us better determine if the Duchess was in the same trousers worn when visiting New York, or if it is a pair we\u2019ve not previously seen.\n\nUPDATE MAR 30: A WKW Facebook friend suggests the jeans are by Topshop, saying they are either the label\u2019s Jamie or Joni style.\n\nKate carried her trusty Bayswater Wallet Clutch by Mulberry.\n\nWe saw the return of the Stuart Weitzman \u2018Power\u2019 pumps in black suede.\n\nThe Duchess wore her Annoushka Pearl Drops and Kiki McDonough hoops.\n\nKate wore her hair down.\n\n\n\nAs with the Duchess\u2019s previous maternity leaves, we will continue with blog posts. I\u2019m excited that we\u2019ll have time to cover some of the topics suggested here and also on the Facebook page.\n\nLINKAGE:", "images":
