What\u2019s more, it appears that the two plaintiffs have gained a significant share of royalties. Before the lawsuit, 100 percent of the work was controlled by BMI, which administers the public performance of McDaid\u2019s works, but now that percentage has dropped to 82.5 percent as Leonard has an ASCAP affiliation.\n\nHarrington and Leonard, along with their publishing company HaloSongs, filed the lawsuit in June 2016, alleging that \u201cPhotograph\u201d derived from their 2009 work \u201cAmazing,\u201d which was recorded and released as a single by Matt Cardle, the winner of the 2010 season of the television competition show The X Factor.
