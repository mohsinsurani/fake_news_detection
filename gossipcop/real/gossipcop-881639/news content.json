It\u2019s like with the dog. My biggest thing to Nicole about the dog was: Love dogs, but I can\u2019t contribute to taking care of one. I don\u2019t have the time.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I just have things I need to get done. It\u2019s not negotiable. We\u2019ve been to therapy over it. I don\u2019t think it will ever be over with. I\u2019m stubborn as f\u2014 and extremely selfish as well. I don\u2019t want kids, I don\u2019t want marriage. That\u2019s me just saying, \u2018Hey, this is my life and this is how I\u2019m going to live.'\u201d\n\n(Nikki\u2019s twin sister Brie\u2019s own Frenchie, Josie, also bit Cena\u2019s leg in a Total Bellas episode aired in October 2016. \u201cYou should call animal control, and they should come out and take the dog away,\u201d he told his girlfriend.)\n\nEventually, they gave their pup to Brie, though she still visits him at her sister\u2019s house.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: John Cena and Nikki Bella End Engagement Weeks Before Destination Wedding\n\n\u201cNicole\u2019s a very busy human being who may or may not have enough time for a Frenchie as needy as Winston, so with me retired and Brie retired, we have taken over the reins of Winston,\u201d Brie\u2019s husband Daniel Bryan explained in a video posted to the sisters\u2019 YouTube channel.\n\nStill, the decision was difficult for Nikki.\n\n\u201cI miss him. I think with John being gone, too, so much, I\u2019m just back to being alone again,\u201d she told Brie in a September 2017 episode of Total Bellas. \u201cIt\u2019s just tough, because for a while, Winston filled that void so much. I just will always look at him as like my firstborn.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe other reason why it\u2019s so hard \u2014 you have a baby, and that\u2019s my baby,\u201d she said, pointing to Winston. \u201cAnd that\u2019s gonna be my only baby, ever. I\u2019m not gonna have a child, a human being, that will replace what a dog fills.\u201d\n\nCena, 40, and Nikki, 34, announced that they called off their engagement on Sunday, a year after he proposed during WrestleMania 33. The couple had planned to marry on May 5 at a destination wedding.\n\n\u201cOn one level, Brie wants to kill him, sure,\u201d a source told PEOPLE about Brie\u2019s feelings to the man who was supposed to become her brother-in-law. \u201cNo one should be allowed to hurt her sister like this. But honestly, on another level, there\u2019s relief. Nikki was bending over backward to accommodate this guy and everyone, especially Brie, was worried that she was sacrificing way, way too much \u2014 most of all, motherhood.\u201d", "images":
