She also revealed she has not spoken to Bieber in \u201cyears,\u201d not even via text message.\n\nAfter splitting from The Weeknd (n\u00e9e Abel Tesfaye) in October, Gomez began spending time with Bieber, whom she first started dating in 2010.\n\nBut despite Teefey\u2019s feelings about her daughter\u2019s decision to give her on-again off-again ex another chance, she told Gossip Cop she knows Gomez is old enough to \u201cmake her own choices.\u201d\n\n\u201cSelena can live her life however she wants as long as she is happy, safe and healthy,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cShe is 25-years old and knows what is at stake with her health,\u201d she continued, adding that Gomez \u201cis an adult and can make her own choices.\u201d\n\nSteve Cohn/Invision for Netflix/AP\n\nIn December, Gomez and her mother made headlines for unfollowing each other on Instagram, but a source close to the family told PEOPLE at the time that their recent estrangement wasn\u2019t solely because of the singer\u2019s reunion with Bieber.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s more complicated than just fighting over a guy,\u201d said the source. \u201cMandy and Selena have had their ups and down before. This isn\u2019t the first time.\u201d\n\nTeefey has since begun following her daughter on the social media platform again.\n\nMultiple sources previously told PEOPLE Gomez\u2019s family was concerned about the on-again romance and that Bieber was determined to show her loved ones he had matured.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Is a \u2018Very Different Person\u2019 Now and Wants to Prove to Selena Gomez\u2019s Loved Ones That He Has Changed\n\nAn insider confirmed in December that Teefey, 41, had voluntarily sought treatment at a hospital in L.A. but dismissed a report that it was because of an argument with her daughter over Bieber. \u201cIt\u2019s been a stressful time for Mandy and she made the decision herself to go to the hospital and make sure everything was okay,\u201d said the insider.\n\nThough Gomez and Teefey aren\u2019t on speaking terms, the singer \u201calso wants to give her mom some space,\u201d added the source close to the family. \u201cWhen they fight, they fight hard. But when they love, they also love hard.\u201d\n\nBut while Teefey\u2019s not ready to give Bieber the official seal of approval, the \u201cWhat Do You Mean\u201d singer\u2019s mother Pattie Mallette has plenty of kind words to say about Gomez.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know so much about their personal relationship because he doesn\u2019t share a whole lot, but I love her,\u201d Mallette told PEOPLE at the Justice Speaks Holiday Benefit Luncheon in L.A in December.\n\n\u201cI support anything [he does], if he loves her I love her, and I\u2019ve met her and we have a special bond so I think she\u2019s precious. I can\u2019t really speak on their relationship, that\u2019s between them.\u201d", "images":
