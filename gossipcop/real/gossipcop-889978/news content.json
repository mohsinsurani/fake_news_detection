And when I came home, he said, \u2018We\u2019re done,\u2019\u201d Shannon told host Andy Cohen.\n\n\u201cI said to David, when he told me it was over, \u2018What happened? We had a couple of amazing years,\u2019\u201d she recalled of the conversation. \u201cAnd he goes, \u2018We had a couple good months.\u2019 It was just a knife in the heart.\u201d\n\nShannon wasn\u2019t totally shocked by David\u2019s gut-wrenching announcement. There were warning signs that their relationship was circling the drain. \u201cI did have a conversation with him at the beginning of the summer that I just couldn\u2019t keep living this way,\u201d she said, adding that he lived in a separate wing of the house.\n\nThough Shannon called the breakup \u201cheartbreaking,\u201d the mom of Sophie, 15, and 12-year-old twins Stella and Adeline sees a silver lining.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a role model for my kids and and it got to the point where I wasn\u2019t teaching my daughters positive lessons,\u201d she explained. \u201cThey deserve a happy and joyful home and that\u2019s where we are now . . . it\u2019s my job now to show the girls \u2014 I\u2019m scared, I\u2019m 53 years old, it\u2019s the first time I\u2019ve been out on my own, but I can do it.\u201d\n\nSophie, Stella and Adeline have been living with Shannon full-time since the separation, but see their dad regularly. \u201cWe\u2019ve agreed for the benefit of our daughters to be amicable,\u201d Shannon said. \u201cIt was always a tradition to go to Sunday night dinner so we meet him for dinner on Sunday nights. And we still go to the USC games and take the kids, which is hard, but it\u2019s a benefit for them.\u201d\n\nThe former couple\u2019s tumultuous marriage has been chronicled on RHOC since Shannon joined the cast in 2014. Though David was allegedly unfaithful, the two spent time in therapy and even renewed their vows in August 2016.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tamra-judge-shannon-beador.jpg?crop=888px%2C81px%2C912px%2C515px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tamra-judge-shannon-beador.jpg?crop=877px%2C83px%2C921px%2C483px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tamra-judge-shannon-beador.jpg?crop=877px%2C83px%2C921px%2C483px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shannon-beador-reveals-how-david-beador-asked-for-a-divorce/", "title": "Shannon Beador Reveals How David Beador Asked for a Divorce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Shannon Beador revealed during the season 12 reunion show on Monday, November 20, that her husband asked for their separation \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Shannon Beador Reveals How David Beador Asked for a Divorce", "description": "Shannon Beador revealed during the season 12 reunion show on Monday, November 20, that her husband asked for their separation \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/shannon-beador-reveals-how-david-beador-asked-for-a-divorce/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-11-21T16:20:54+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tamra-judge-shannon-beador.jpg?crop=877px%2C83px%2C921px%2C483px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tamra-judge-shannon-beador.jpg?crop=877px%2C83px%2C921px%2C483px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-21T16:19:59+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-11-21T16:20:54+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Shannon Beador Reveals How David Beador Asked for a Divorce", "description": "Shannon Beador revealed during the season 12 reunion show on Monday, November 20, that her husband asked for their separation \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tamra-judge-shannon-beador.jpg?crop=877px%2C83px%2C921px%2C483px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@rachelpaula", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1511281199.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
