Ten years and two movies later, the show has ceded its cultural prominence, as a new generation fixes its eyes on an entirely different kind of aspirationalism. What that aspiration is, exactly, isn\u2019t yet clear, but the days when thousands, if not millions, of young women trained their gaze on a city life of flashy careers and upscale brunches and fabulous parties seem decidedly over.\n\nIf, of course, they ever existed in the first place. There\u2019s no doubt that Sex and the City had some pretty hefty cultural influence, elevating once-niche luxury brands to household-name status, serving as inspiration for countless blogs and articles about dating and city life and, anecdotally anyway, leading to a huge uptick in brunching. But really, who knows how many people actually followed the show's siren call to Manhattan, only to face inevitable disappointment.\n\nA decade later, those trends are largely gone, but there\u2019s still the show\u2014this great, thrilling, maddening, occasionally dumb show. As a longtime fan of the show who hadn\u2019t watched an episode in some time owing to exhaustion\u2014I probably tore through the whole series at least twice in 2005 and 2006\u2014I decided to re-watch the entire thing recently to see how it looks now that its of-the-moment modernness has given way to vintage charm. Here\u2019s a ranking of the seasons, from worst to best, as it looks a decade later.\n\nSeason 1\n\nHulton Archive/Getty Images\n\nWhat\u2019s Good: Well, this is the season that started it all, that introduces us to Carrie, Samantha, Miranda, and Charlotte, and Big and a few other recurring characters. You have to admire the strange moxie it took, for HBO to put together a half-hour sex comedy, starring Sarah Jessica Parker and two other women in their 30s (and one in her 40s), run by gay men. The casting is perfect, the writing is flirty and sharp, and Carrie still smokes. It's important that Carrie smokes. I can\u2019t exactly explain why, but it is.\n\nWhat\u2019s Not: Oof, well, it\u2019s obviously the most dated, in terms of both its cultural references and its social viewpoint. It\u2019s all too easy to forget that Season 1 of SATC feels derivative partly because so many shows and movies that came after it were imitations. It\u2019s like watching Pulp Fiction now and trying to separate it from every hip crime movie it inspired. Aside from the problems of time, the first season relies heavily on not only the corny people-on-the-street interviews, but Carrie\u2019s direct address to the camera. It\u2019s hard to say which gimmick I like less, but certainly neither has aged well.\n\nBest Episode: \u201cThe Baby Shower\u201d Oddly, it took Carrie and friends getting out of Manhattan to get the show moving toward its thematic groove\u2014Carrie is skeptical about the settled-down life, Miranda is caustic (and correct), Samantha is brassy, and Charlotte is a pinched bore, but not yet the insane person she would later become.\n\nWorst Episode: \u201cModels and Mortals\u201d The series\u2019s second episode is way too enamored of its own supposed edginess, presenting us with a narrow sliver of a male demographic that only sleeps with models. Sure, there are guys like that out there, but this \u201ctype\u201d is played up as such a universal fact that the show has rarely felt more extra-dimensional.\n\nSeason 5", "images":
