Things didn\u2019t come out the way I wanted this to,\u201d he said. \u201cI wanted to make this video first and for everyone to understand me but my boyfriend, as you all know, Joaqu\u00edn, we both got a little too excited, and he posted a few pictures of us, and I retweeted them, and it went viral.\u201d\n\nLopez, 16, said Joaqu\u00edn and he have been a pair for two years. \u201cPeople began noticing that we were together. I am in a gay relationship right now and I am in love with this person. I\u2019ve been dealing with this part of myself for a long time now,\u201d he said.\n\nThe teen also posted a photo with his boyfriend on Instagram on Nov. 24 with the caption: \u201cthankful.\u201d Lopez, who self-identifies as bisexual, admitted he has struggled with his sexuality for years.\n\n\u201cAnd for so long I wanted to be completely straight or completely gay because I honestly didn\u2019t know where I am,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cI\u2019m bisexual. I know that some people don\u2019t necessarily believe in that, but all I know is that I love this person and I don\u2019t necessarily have a preference, I love who I love.\u201d\n\nHis sister Chiquis Rivera, who appears with him on the video and stars with Lopez and their other three siblings on Universo\u2019s reality show The Riveras, is standing by her brother amid a nasty online backlash. \u201cI want people to know that I support him 100 percent. He is my brother, he is my baby, he is my son,\u201d she told Univision\u2019s El Gordo y La Flace. Chiquis helped raise Lopez after her mother\u2019s fatal plane accident in 2012.\n\n\u201cI have seen comments that say: \u2018If Jenni was alive she wouldn\u2019t approve. Chiquis did not do a good job with him and that\u2019s why he\u2019s gay\u2019,\u201d she added. \u201cThat\u2019s not how things are.\u201d\n\n(Photo by John Parra/Getty Images for Univision)\n\nRumors about Johnny\u2019s sexuality began to circulate last week when Joaquin shared affectionate images of the duo on social media. \u201cYes, it\u2019s true,\u201d Chiquis confirmed on the entertainment show on Nov. 27. \u201cI support him and I have always supported the gay community. I\u2019m spiritual and my religion is love. He is happy. I am happy for him and I support him. When he is ready, he will say certain things.\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old singer admitted that cruel remarks online upset her. \u201cDon\u2019t judge,\u201d she said. \u201cIt makes me sad to see so many ugly comments. Love is love. He is not hurting anyone.\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/Bb\u2013ZaEApR6/\n\nChiquis finds the prejudice that persists toward homosexuals in Latino culture disheartening and believes that intolerance is spiking suicide rates among young LGBT people: \u201cWe have to guide them and tell them we will always love them,\u201d she said.\n\nThe day before she confirmed her brother\u2019s sexuality, she wrote a post affirming the importance of self-discovery and acceptance: \u201cEmbrace who you are! Find your who.\u201d", "images":
