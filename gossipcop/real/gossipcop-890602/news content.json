It\u2019s going to be cheap!\n\n\u2018I\u2019m not sure what they\u2019re going to do with my character. My character is very, very broad and I don\u2019t know who they\u2019re going to find to play that.\u2019\n\nTo view this video please enable JavaScript, and consider upgrading to a web browser that supports HTML5 video\n\nAnyone crossing their fingers for a surprise appearance from Midler or her co-stars Kathy Najimy and Sarah Jessica Parker are going to be disappointed.\n\nMidler said it would be hard to recast her role (Picture: SNAP/REX/Shutterstock/Disney)\n\nDespite having previously expressed interest in reprising her role with Parker and Najimy, when asked if she would make a cameo appearance in the remake for the right amount of money, she said: \u2018No, no, no!\u2019\n\nIt is hard to imagine anyone else performing I Put A Spell On You quite as well as Midler.\n\nThe remake is still in development and is being written by Scarlett Lacey. Original producer David Kirschner is also on board, however original director Kenny Ortega is not involved.\n\nMORE : 13 reasons Hocus Pocus is the best Halloween film ever\n\nMORE : Queen of Sass Bette Midler rules on the Tony Awards stage, tells the orchestra to \u2018shut that crap off\u2019", "images": ["https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pri_58460892.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C269px%2C2500px%2C1313px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/ipso-logo.jpg", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Metro-56e2.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/hocus-pocus-pic.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C459", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michaels-Bar-6a30.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BHM-0569.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png"], "top_img": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pri_58460892.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C269px%2C2500px%2C1313px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Deen"], "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/11/01/bette-midler-isnt-here-for-the-hocus-pocus-remake-its-going-to-be-cheap-7046587/", "title": "Bette Midler slams 'cheap' Hocus Pocus remake", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pri_58460892.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C269px%2C2500px%2C1313px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "title": "Bette Midler slams 'cheap' Hocus Pocus remake", "description": "Bette starred in the original 1993 film.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160}, "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "description": "Bette Midler has slammed the Hocus Pocus remake as 'cheap'.
