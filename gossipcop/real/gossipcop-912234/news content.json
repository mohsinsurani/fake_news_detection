And that includes the film\u2019s climatic helicopter chase scene.\n\nIn an interview for the film\u2019s upcoming Blu-Ray release, Cruise\u2019s leading lady in the film, Rebecca Ferguson, discussed a scene where Cruise\u2019s character, Ethan Hunt, dangles from the underside of a flying helicopter. Then, Ethan loses his grip on the helicopter, dropping onto a cargo load being lifted by the helicopter and grabbing onto it to avoid plummeting to his death in the canyon below.\n\nAlso Read: 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout': How Tom Cruise Pulled Off That Insane Skydive\n\nFerguson saw Cruise as he did the fall and, not noticing that he had a safety harness, thought that he had just killed himself.\n\n\u201cI heard myself scream. I actually thought he fell,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cThere was an audible gasp from the crowd. That\u2019s a huge drop,\u201d co-star Henry Cavill added in the Blu-Ray interview.\n\nWhat was worse for Cruise is that he shot that stunt five times, only to move on to another death-defying sequence in which he flew a helicopter through the mountains at low-altitude for a chase scene that required him to get dangerously close to another helicopter.\n\nAlso Read: Did Tom Cruise Really Do All the Stunts in 'Mission: Impossible - Fallout'?\n\nOh, and he also performed the highest free fall skydive ever filmed for a movie and broke his leg while jumping between buildings in London. As we noted this past summer, you wouldn\u2019t be faulted for thinking that Tom Cruise might have a death wish.\n\n\u201cMission: Impossible \u2014 Fallout\u201d is available on Digital Nov. 20, and on 4K Ultra HD, Blu-ray and DVD on Dec. 4.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thewrap-film-slate.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/MI5.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo_Small.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo-Stacked.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Jeremy-Fuster-96x96.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Image-2022-04-26-at-3.00.43-PM-300x81.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeremy Fuster"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/mission-impossible-fallout-cast-thought-tom-cruise-killed-himself-during-helicopter-stunt/", "title": "\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u2019 Cast Thought Tom Cruise Killed Himself During the Helicopter Climax", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f9f9f9", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-title": "\u2018Mission: Impossible \u2013 Fallout\u2019 Cast Thought Tom Cruise Killed Himself During the Helicopter Climax", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/mission-impossible-fallout-cast-thought-tom-cruise-killed-himself-during-helicopter-stunt/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-11-18T13:09:01-08:00", "parsely-section": "movies", "parsely-author": "Jeremy Fuster", "parsely-tags": "mission%3A_impossible, rebecca-ferguson, tom_cruise, tom-cruise-stunt", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/MissionImpossibleFalloutTomCruise-1-160x105.jpg"}, "description": "\"I heard myself scream.
