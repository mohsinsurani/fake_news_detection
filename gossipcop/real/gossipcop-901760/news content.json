And, in our opinion, that's where Jessica Alba truly excels.\n\nA girl after our own heart, it seems Jessica tends to steer towards jeans as the key ingredient to the majority of her off-duty looks.\n\nFrom boyfriend-fit white jeans in summer, to distressed denim, vintage-wash wide-legs, indigo flares and even super skinny black jeans (hey, we all went there at some stage), Jessica Alba's denim wardrobe is seriously extensive.\n\nWhether she's pairing her jeans with a simple white t-shirt and a throw-over striped shirt, or she's elevating them via a super structured blazer or a very special embroidered longline coat, Jessica's natural knack for effortless elegance ensures that even her most casual looks feel polished.\n\nTake a look at our Fashion Editor's pick of Jessica Alba's 10 chicest off-duty wardrobe moments over the years\u2026\n\nFor more from Glamour UK's Fashion Editor Charlie Teather, follow her on Instagram @charlieteather", "images": ["https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dcae33811141424ae32/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25202.jpg", "https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-header.b4cc6108dd2e242eb0e486e2c46c586c606e48ac.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6200f14ee030b3312adf6cd2/master/w_775%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520070222%2520%2520%2520GettyImages-1353208291_SQ.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633c13b2e878d221f9f5ff31/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/632af86b57b6fe63784007db/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dd10bfabe416792e5ee/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%252010.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d82135624f9a16da38e57d/16:9/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%2520Untitled-1_SF.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dca2a13ade0460c18e1/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25203.jpg", "https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo.b4cc6108dd2e242eb0e486e2c46c586c606e48ac.svg", "https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/verso/static/glamour-international/assets/logo-reverse.3f0191bfffefe68806346fb250bf5976c111a9de.svg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633eab667e1bb30bf7374ccf/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6336c54a0cfa7e5873780f0a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d82135624f9a16da38e57d/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/JESSICA%20ALBA%20BEST%20LOOKS%20200722%20Untitled-1_SF.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6170426ecb7ff2e8dec7f8c0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/6319c0ba354bcad4dc703ead/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dcd0bfabe416792e5ec/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25206.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dc90bfabe416792e5e8/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25201.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dcf19657afb80d5f39c/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25208.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dcc19657afb80d5f39a/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25205.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dd0f5683c5bc191c154/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25209.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/633eb1ea5754f406be4d42b4/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dcd0bfabe416792e5ea/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25204.jpg", "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d81dcf70da875ef4af78a1/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/JESSICA%2520ALBA%2520BEST%2520LOOKS%2520200722%25207.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamourmagazine.co.uk/photos/62d82135624f9a16da38e57d/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/JESSICA%20ALBA%20BEST%20LOOKS%20200722%20Untitled-1_SF.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Charlie Teather", "Emily Tannenbaum"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamourmagazine.co.uk/gallery/jessica-alba-look-book", "title": "10 times Jessica Alba served up a lesson in perfecting the polished off-duty wardrobe", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Jessica Alba always looks great on the red carpet, but it's her off-duty, casual looks that we really love.
