The onlooker tells Us the group ordered fun dishes such as Studio 54 \u2014 The Disco Ball Pasta dish with meatballs, Lobster Pop Tarts and a Marie Antoinette\u2019s Head dessert topped with three feet of cotton candy.\n\nIt seems the 13 Going on 30 star, 45, may have played a part in the planning, too. Earlier in the day, Garner was spotted picking up a cake from her go-to store, Brentwood Country Mart. She looked chic in a simple white top, jeans and oversized sunglasses.\n\nAffleck and Garner officially announced their split in June 2015, but they have been spotted out together on many occasions \u2014 even taking family vacations. \u201cThat is all part of Ben and Jen working together as coparents,\u201d a source previously told Us. \u201cHe\u2019s trying to live a normal life and is focused on putting his family first.\u201d\n\nAlthough they\u2019re coparenting with ease, the Argo director has moved on with girlfriend Lindsay Shookus.
