Earlier this month, he won Best Actor in a Motion Picture Musical or Comedy at the Golden Globe Awards for his role in the biographical dramedy, which chronicles the making of Tommy Wiseau\u2019s 2003 cult film The Room.\n\nFranco attended the Globes on January 7, but skipped the Critics\u2019 Choice Awards on January 11.\n\nThe Deuce star was first accused of sexual misconduct by several women on Twitter during the Globes broadcast. Many of the evening\u2019s A-list attendees wore black in solidarity with the Time\u2019s Up movement, which raises money to fight sexual harassment, assault and inequality in the workplace. Franco wore a Time\u2019s Up pin on the lapel of his suit jacket.\n\nJust a few days later, the Los Angeles Times published a report in which five women claimed that Franco had behaved inappropriately with them. Four of the women were former students at the actor\u2019s film school Studio 4 in Hollywood. One woman, aspiring filmmaker Violet Paley, told the newspaper that she and Franco were involved in a consensual romantic relationship, but alleged that he once pressured her into performing oral sex on him in her car. In response, Franco\u2019s business partner Vince Jolivette told Us Weekly on January 11 that their school \u201cwas always run professionally.\u201d\n\nFranco\u2019s attorney disputed the allegations published by the Times, while the Oscar nominee himself addressed the Twitter claims during a January 9 appearance on The Late Show With Stephen Colbert.\n\n\u201cThe things that I heard that were on Twitter are not accurate, but I completely support people coming out and being able to have a voice because they didn\u2019t have a voice for so long,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t want to shut them down in any way. It\u2019s, I think, a good thing and I support it.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james-franco-sags.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james-franco-sags.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/james-franco-to-attend-sag-awards-2018-amid-misconduct-scandal/", "title": "James Franco to Attend SAG Awards 2018 Amid Misconduct Scandal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Sag Awards", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "James Franco will attend the SAG Awards 2018 on Sunday, January 21, despite the recent sexual misconduct allegations made against him \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "James Franco to Attend SAG Awards Amid Sexual Misconduct Scandal", "description": "James Franco will attend the SAG Awards 2018 on Sunday, January 21, despite the recent sexual misconduct allegations made against him \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/james-franco-to-attend-sag-awards-2018-amid-misconduct-scandal/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-01-19T14:40:45+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james-franco-sags.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james-franco-sags.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-19T14:40:45+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "James Franco to Attend SAG Awards Amid Sexual Misconduct Scandal", "description": "James Franco will attend the SAG Awards 2018 on Sunday, January 21, despite the recent sexual misconduct allegations made against him \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/james-franco-sags.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516372845.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
