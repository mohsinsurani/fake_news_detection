{"url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/katy-perry-says-taylor-swift-started-their-feud", "text": "One of pop culture's longest-running narratives is the so-called beef between Katy Perry and Taylor Swift. It kicked off in 2014 when Swift released her song \"Bad Blood,\" which allegedly detailed her contentious relationship with Perry. Up until this point, though, that was only half-confirmed. Swift told Rolling Stone in 2014 the song was about another female artist who tried to \"sabotage an entire arena tour,\" but she didn't get specific; two years later, Perry responded to a fan on Twitter that she'd be down to collaborate with Swift \"if she [said] sorry.\" Fans filled in the blanks.\n\nBut now we have confirmation that a Perry\u2013Swift feud actually exists. According to E! News, Perry finally opened up about the squabble during her Carpool Karaoke segment with James Corden on Monday, May 23\u2014and, if her testimony holds water, everything we've previously heard about their relationship is true. Perry confirmed there is a \"situation\" with Swift, and it's rooted in professional drama.\n\n\"Honestly, [Swift] started it, and it's time for her to finish it,\" Perry said. \"It's about backing dancers. It's so crazy. There [are] three backing dancers that went on tour with her tour, and they asked me before they went on tour if they could go. I was like, 'Yeah, of course. I'm not on a record cycle. Get the work. She's great. But I will be on a record cycle, probably, in about a year, so be sure to put a 30-day contingency in your contract so you can get out if you wanna join me when I say I'm going back on.' So that year came up, and I texted all of them because I'm very close with them. I said, 'Look, just FYI: I'm about to start. I want to put the word out there.' They said, 'OK. We're gonna go talk to management about it.' They did, and they got fired. I tried to talk to [Swift] about it, and she wouldn't speak to me. I do the right thing anytime that it feels like a fumble. It was a full shutdown, and then she writes a song about me. And I'm like 'OK, cool, cool. That's how you wanna do it? Karma.'\" (You can watch this portion of Perry's Carpool Karaoke segment here.)\n\nPerry isn't trying to stir the pot, though. She's quite ready for this feud to end and said it would only take a text-message apology from Swift for her to bury the hatchet.\n\n\"I'm ready for that B.S. to be done,\" she said. \"I think, personally, that women together\u2014not divided, none of this petty sh-t\u2014will heal the world.\" (Cheers to that.)\n\nOf course, Perry's confession is just one side of the story. We'll probably never know 100 percent what happened between them, but let's not waste any more energy on it. As Perry said, women are stronger together than apart. That's the motto we all should live by. Sure, \"Bad Blood\" and \"Swish Swish\" are great, but imagine the smash Perry and Swift would create if they joined forces. Let's start a petition for that (instead of more tea on this annoying beef).\n\nRELATED: Katy Perry Just Dropped Her \"Bon App\u00e9tit\" Music Video", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1495059317/glamour_c-section-stories.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/592439e5c1c0f53a7e49ef66/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katy%20perry%20taylor%20swift.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632a1c0b82d2c7a98fa2e85b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/63388f01406c4a7b0984e0d2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/630c2f5e8e9d0a50459956f1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/592439e5c1c0f53a7e49ef66/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/katy%2520perry%2520taylor%2520swift.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/592439e5c1c0f53a7e49ef66/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katy%20perry%20taylor%20swift.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Christopher Rosa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/katy-perry-says-taylor-swift-started-their-feud", "title": "Katy Perry Says Taylor Swift Started Their Feud: 'It's Time for Her to Finish It'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "During her 'Carpool Karaoke' session with James Corden, Katy Perry majorly opened up about her feud with Taylor Swift.", "id": "59243838008f2771fe70d785", "keywords": "katy perry,taylor swift,bad blood,music", "news_keywords": "katy perry,taylor swift,bad blood,music", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59243838008f2771fe70d785", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"During her 'Carpool Karaoke' session with James Corden, Katy Perry majorly opened up about her feud with Taylor Swift.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/592439e5c1c0f53a7e49ef66/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/katy%20perry%20taylor%20swift.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/592439e5c1c0f53a7e49ef66/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/katy%20perry%20taylor%20swift.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "\"She started it, and it's time for her to finish it.\"", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/592439e5c1c0f53a7e49ef66/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katy%20perry%20taylor%20swift.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Katy Perry Finally Confirms She and Taylor Swift Have a 'Situation'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/katy-perry-says-taylor-swift-started-their-feud"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-23T14:37:30.408Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-23T14:37:30.408Z", "author": "Christopher Rosa"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "\"She started it, and it's time for her to finish it.\"", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/592439e5c1c0f53a7e49ef66/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/katy%20perry%20taylor%20swift.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Katy Perry Finally Confirms She and Taylor Swift Have a 'Situation'"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495550250.408, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
