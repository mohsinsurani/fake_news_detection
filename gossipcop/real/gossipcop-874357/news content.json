There are several costume changes, hairstyles, extras (including some incredibly cool senior extras), a baby Miley puppet, mimes, and a dance sequence at a sock hop. It's totally Miley and it fits Miley\u2019s current narrative: change. On \u201cYounger Now,\u201d she sings, \u201cNo one stays the same / You know what goes up must come down / Change is a thing you can count on / I feel so much younger now\u201d in the chorus.\n\nIn recent months, Miley has openly discussed her sobriety, growth, and sense of self. \u201cWho I was on the last record was really who I am,\u201d she told Harper\u2019s Bazaar. \u201cIt\u2019s just myself has been a lot of different people because I change a lot.\u201d She also spoke about the upside of change in the September 2017 issue of Cosmopolitan: \u201cNothing and no one stays the same,\u201d she said of one thing she\u2019s learned from her parents about marriage. \u201cGrow, evolve, change with each other and celebrate your love\u2019s journey!\u201d On the Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon in June, she said, \u201cAnytime I say I\u2019m being myself, whether I look like this or look completely different, or I\u2019m a panda, that is myself. I\u2019m always being myself. It just depends what that is.\u201d\n\nMiley also announced the full track list and cover art for Younger Now and yes, that\u2019s godmother Dolly Parton\u2019s name you see for song no. 3, \u201cRainbowland.\u201d\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.
