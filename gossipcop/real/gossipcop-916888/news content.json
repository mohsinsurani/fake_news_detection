And Lambert may have recently hinted at the split on stage to her fans.\n\nBefore performing \u201cTin Man\u201d during a concert in Knoxville in March, Lambert talked about how she channels heartbreak into her music, according to Knox News. \"I make it my mission every single time I step on the stage that no matter what, no matter where I am, I want to make you feel everything you could possibly feel. I want you to feel sad, mad, happy and nostalgic and really pissed sometimes. That's my favorite,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd part of feelings is also heartbreak unfortunately, but fortunately for me, I can use it for my art or whatever. I like to write sad songs. I like to listen to sad songs, so I want to sing y'all one. It's called 'Tin Man.'\"\n\nEast also opened up about the struggles of dating as a touring musician. \"There's a true admiration there and a large level of understanding on both sides, for sure,\" he told InStyle in January. \"It's always difficult to be a traveling musician and still keep things together. Understanding is definitely a huge factor.\"\n\nThe two started dating in 2015 after Lambert\u2019s divorce from Blake Shelton earlier that year. They met after she went to one of East\u2019s shows and got introduced to him through a friend. Throughout their relationship, they wrote songs together and supported each other on red carpets.\n\nBut fans noticed that lately, the two had not talked about their relationship or posted about each other on social media; East hadn\u2019t posted a photo of Lambert since her birthday in November, and Lambert hadn\u2019t posted an image of East since January. Representatives for Lambert and East did not respond to People\u2019s request for comment on the split.\n\nThere might still be hope for the two, though. \u201cThey have spent a lot of time apart, but potentially could end up back together,\u201d a source told Us Weekly. \u201cThe love is still there.\u201d", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ghost-movie-index-1659663027.jpg?crop=0.470xw:1.00xh;0.0817xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jeffrey-dahmer-monster-netflix-victim-polaroid-photos-1664476700.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.748xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.countryliving.com/_assets/design-tokens/countryliving/static/images/logos/network-logo.77e98e3.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/miranda-lambert-anderson-east-breakup-1523297022.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.756xh;0,0.0169xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kelsea-ballerini-topless-instagram-photo-1664983507.jpg?crop=0.829xw:0.610xh;0.0881xw,0.139xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/wynonna-judd-performs-onstage-during-cmt-and-sandbox-lives-news-photo-1654012980.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/netflix-the-watcher-1664558369.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/787dcfa8-029c-4ade-acab-5650f77a019f.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/new-halloween-movies-2022-1665165400.jpg?crop=0.468xw:1.00xh;0.345xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/16/13/1600x800/landscape-1459727619-anderson-east-l-and-miranda-lambert-gettyimages-518941236-1.jpg?resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-voice-2022-blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-audition-1664477599.jpg?crop=0.495xw:1.00xh;0.0288xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-620654896-1523276665.jpg?crop=0.6666666666666666xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664976504.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.692xh;0,0.0432xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/meg-1663866902.jpg?crop=0.671xw:1.00xh;0.160xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/lady-gaga-bradley-cooper-a-star-is-born-table-read-1598454300.jpg?crop=0.471xw:0.942xh;0.506xw,0.0321xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-620654896-1523276665.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-08-19-at-1-40-21-pm-1566236424.png?crop=0.9610422147062508xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hallmark-gac-lori-loughlin-movie-news-instagram-1664540201.jpg?crop=0.365xw:0.277xh;0.319xw,0.0948xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hocus-pocus-quiz-max-dani-1664821670.jpeg?crop=0.543xw:1.00xh;0.141xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/clv.h-cdn.co/assets/17/45/2048x1024/landscape-1509985259-miranda-lambert-tin-man.jpg?resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-620654896-1523276665.jpg?crop=1xw:0.75xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a19717111/miranda-lambert-anderson-east-break-up/", "title": "Miranda Lambert and Anderson East Have Broken Up, Report Says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Miranda Lambert and Anderson East Have Broken Up, Report Says", "description": "Miranda Lambert and Anderson East have broken up after more than two years together, Us Weekly reports.
