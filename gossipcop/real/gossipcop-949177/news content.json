revealed to Oprah that it particularly took a toll on Craig, who \u201cwas a very emotional kid.\u201d\n\nStephane Cardinale/Corbis via Getty\n\n\u201cHe\u2019d always look down in sadness,\u201d she said of her son\u2019s response to her abuse. \u201cOne day when Ike was fighting me, Craig knocked on the door and said, \u2018Mother, are you all right?\u2019 I thought, \u2018Oh, please, don\u2019t beat me at home.\u2019 I didn\u2019t want my children to hear.\u201d\n\nThe singer recently launched a musical based on her life, Tina, in London \u2014 which details every turbulent moment of her 50-year singing career.\n\nTMZ was first to report the news of Craig\u2019s tragic death.\n\nIf you or someone you know is considering suicide, please contact the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline
