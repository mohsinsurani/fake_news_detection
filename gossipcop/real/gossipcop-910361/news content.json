The video shows the new mom focused intently on a round of glute kickback exercises while her German shepherd, Max, calmly chews a toy at her feet. \u201c#monday #backatit,\u201d she captioned the 'gram alongside a flexed bicep emoji.\n\nNicholas and Lucy, the couple's first children, were reportedly born on Saturday, Dec. 16 in Miami. Dressed in snug black workout clothes and with her signature blonde ponytail in full effect, it's hard to believe the Russian beauty gave birth less than two months ago.\n\n\u201cIt was a perfectly normal pregnancy, she didn\u2019t have to do mandatory bed rest at any time,\" Iglesias's mother, Isabel Preysler, recently told Hola magazine of Kournikova's decidedly clandestine pregnancy. \"Anna hasn\u2019t had to hide. She has a very simple and homey life.\"\n\nGet it, mama!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/013018_anna_kournikova.png?itok=L9wMr1gB", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2018/01/013018_anna_kournikova.png?itok=SzJwl7pH", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/013018_anna_kournikova.png?itok=L9wMr1gB", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meghan Overdeep"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816/http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kournikova-post-baby-work-out", "title": "Anna Kournikova Hits the Gym a Month After Twins's Birth", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "News,Celebrity Moms,Celebrity,Social Media,Anna Kournikova", "news_keywords": "anna kournikova,\u00a0anna kournikova instagram,\u00a0anna kournikova twins,\u00a0anna kournikova workout,\u00a0anna kournikova pregnancy", "description": "It's been barely one month since she and Enrique Iglesias\u00a0announced the birth of twins,\u00a0Nicholas and Lucy, and tennis legend Anna Kournikova is already back at the gym.", "og": {"title": "Anna Kournikova Hits the Gym a\u00a0Month After Giving Birth to Twins", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816/http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kournikova-post-baby-work-out", "description": "Back at it!", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/013018_anna_kournikova.png?itok=L9wMr1gB"}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kournikova-post-baby-work-out", "description": "It's been barely one month since she and Enrique Iglesias\u00a0announced the birth of twins,\u00a0Nicholas and Lucy, and tennis legend Anna Kournikova is already back at the gym.", "media": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/013018_anna_kournikova.png?itok=L9wMr1gB"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://www.instyle.com/news/anna-kournikova-post-baby-work-out", "title": "Anna Kournikova Hits the Gym a\u00a0Month After Giving Birth to Twins", "description": "Back at it!", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180130165816im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/013018_anna_kournikova.png?itok=L9wMr1gB"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
