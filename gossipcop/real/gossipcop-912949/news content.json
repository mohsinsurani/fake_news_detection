The hip-hop performer pitched the concept of going on a world tour with three powerhouses in the music industry: Beyonce, Bruno Mars and, get this, Rihanna.\n\n\u2014 Mathew Knowles says Beyonc\u00e9 and Solange\u2019s light complexions helped their music careers \u2014\n\n\u201cJust thinking\u2026. A CRAZY WORLD TOUR would Beyonc\u00e9, Rihanna, Bruno Mars, CHRIS BROWN. \u20182 for 2\u2019. And if y\u2019all decide to do it without me\u2026 give me 10%,\u201d Brown posted on Twitter.\n\nOf course, his mention of Rihanna didn\u2019t go without notice considering their relationship ended with him viciously beating her in a car and leaving her with some very serious looking bruises.\n\n\u2014 WATCH: Sterling K. Brown and Omari Hardwick talking about how much they love their wives in PJ Morton\u2019s new music video is giving us all the feels today \u2014\n\nJust thinking\u2026. A CRAZY WORLD TOUR would BEYONCE, RIHANNA, BRUNO MARS, CHRIS BROWN. \u201c2 for 2\u201d. And if y\u2019all decide to do it without me\u2026 give me 10%. ? \u2014 Chris Brown (@chrisbrown) February 9, 2018\n\nOthers focused on the Bruno Mars angle, stating that Mars is already going on tour with Cardi B. Then there is Beyonce, the Queen is probably busy being well, awesome on her own.\n\nChris Brown dropped his eighth album, titled Heartbreak on a Full Moon, last October. It has been three whole years since he last went on tour and that was with Trey Songz and Tyga for Between the Sheets. One could definitely argue that he is long overdue for some stage dates. The problem is his criminal record, it could, and almost definitely would, throw a wrench into a world tour as some countries would probably not let him past the border.\n\n\u2014 Rihanna slays THREE different covers of \u2018Vogue Paris\u2019 \u2014\n\nIn the past Brown has had trouble getting into both Canada and Australia so unless he can go back in time and not commit some of his crimes, he might just be out of luck for a true world tour.\n\nWhat do you think about Chris Brown\u2019s idea of touring with the megastars on his list, including ex-girlfriend Rihanna?
