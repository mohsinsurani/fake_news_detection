{"url": "https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/high-spf-sunscreens-are-they-better", "text": "When you've shopped for sunscreen , you have probably noticed products with very high sun protection factor (SPF) ratings.\n\nBut is a 100+ or a 90+ sunscreen really that much better than one with an SPF of 30?\n\nSPF refers to the ability of a sunscreen to block ultraviolet B (UVB) rays, which cause sunburns, but not UVA rays, which are more closely linked to deeper skin damage. Both UVA and UVB contribute to the risk of skin cancer.\n\nThe SPF rating is a measure of the time it would take you to sunburn if you were not wearing sunscreen as opposed to the time it would take with sunscreen on.\n\n\"SPF is not a consumer-friendly number,\" says Florida dermatologist James M. Spencer, MD. \"It is logical for someone to think that an SPF of 30 is twice as good as an SPF of 15 and so on. But that is not how it works.\"\n\nAccording to Spencer, an SPF 15 product blocks about 94% of UVB rays; an SPF 30 product blocks 97% of UVB rays; and an SPF 45 product blocks about 98% of rays.", "images": ["https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/woman_experiencing_chest_discomfort_other/1800x1200_woman_experiencing_chest_discomfort_other.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/vaccine_covid19_other/1800x1200_vaccine_7_other.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/slideshows/surprises_about_dogs_and_cats_slideshow/1800x1200_surprises_about_dogs_and_cats_slideshow.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/features/_2016/10_2016/diabetes_grocery_shopping_features/110x70_diabetes_grocery_shopping_features.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/logos/webmd/web/webmd_logo.svg", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/other/vitamins_alt11_other/110x70_vitamins_alt11_other.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/article_thumbnails/centerpieces/memory_loss_centerpiece/1800x1200_memory_loss_centerpiece_header.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://privacy-policy.truste.com/privacy-seal/seal?rid=07326333-3522-463d-81bf-f00fd7171fff", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/thumbnails_daily_images/2009/May_2009/are_high_spf_sunscreens_better.jpg", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/guide_raynauds_phenomenon_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_typing.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/pregnancy_snacks_slideshow/thinkstock_rf_apple_slices_and_peanut_butter.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://www.honcode.ch/HONcode/Seal/HONConduct298987_s1.gif", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/sitefronts/branding/radiance/radiance_logo.svg", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/rich_media_quiz/topic/rmq_benefits_of_walking/405rmq_thinkstock_woman_walking_sneakers.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/health_tools/headache_types_slideshow/1800ss_getty_rf_migraine.jpg?resize=110px:*&output-quality=50", "https://sb/p?c1=2&c2=6035829&cv=3.6&cj=1", "https://choices.trustarc.com/get?name=admarker2.png", "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/layout/shared/tag-registered.png?resize=*:60px"], "top_img": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/thumbnails_daily_images/2009/May_2009/are_high_spf_sunscreens_better.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/high-spf-sunscreens-are-they-better", "title": "High SPF Sunscreens: Are they Better?", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "WebMD discusses the pros and cons of high SPF sunscreens.", "keywords": "sunscreen, high SPF, SPF 100+, UVB, UVA", "fb": {"pages": 1802823663331514, "app_id": 385978254785998}, "og": {"title": "High SPF Sunscreens: Are they Better?", "description": "WebMD discusses the pros and cons of high SPF sunscreens.", "image": {"identifier": "https://img.webmd.com/dtmcms/live/webmd/consumer_assets/site_images/articles/thumbnails_daily_images/2009/May_2009/are_high_spf_sunscreens_better.jpg", "alt": "Logo for WebMD"}, "url": "https://www.webmd.com/beauty/features/high-spf-sunscreens-are-they-better", "site_name": "WebMD", "type": "article", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/WebMD"}, "topicid": 3621}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.webmd.com", "summary": ""}
