News.\n\nJenner shared a photo on Snapchat of herself and Woods traveling on a private jet before arriving at Tsakopoulos Library Galleria for the dance. The star wore a one-shoulder, blush-colored dress and a white corsage.\n\n\"TELL ME WHY MY BROTHER TOOK KYLIE JENNER TO PROM 2NIGHT !!!!!!!\" Ochoa's sister, Selena Ochoa, excitedly tweeted.\n\nOchoa's friend Chayse Rothchild-Bruno told the Sacramento Bee someone on Jenner's staff had seen on social media that Ochoa was looking for a date. The star showed up after 10 p.m. to dance and take photos with Ochoa.\n\n\"Everyone started screaming, 'It's Kylie Jenner!'\" Rothchild-Bruno recalled. \"I think I was in denial, like no way is it Kylie Jenner. It was pretty crazy.\"\n\nSeveral students, including Sam Adams, shared videos of Jenner on social media. The Keeping Up with the Kardashians star, who was homeschooled after the ninth grade, discussed her dream prom with Seventeen in 2013.\n\n\"I don't have a boyfriend, but I do really want that boyfriend prom experience,\" she said at the time. \"I would want to go with someone who's not afraid, or doesn't think that he's too cool, to show up at my house with a rose corsage.\"\n\n\"It would be nice for the guy to come over and be respectful and nice while my mom takes prom pics,\" the star added.", "images":
