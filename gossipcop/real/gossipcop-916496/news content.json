In fact, he made a big enough impression to win America\u2019s Favorite Houseguest, and the cash award of $25,000.\n\nThough he didn\u2019t take home top honors, Mathews was thrilled to find out he wasn\u2019t \u201cthe villain\u201d of the season. And anyone who watched could tell that he\u2019s is a superfan of the long-running CBS show\u2014he was even in the audience during its first season!\n\nThis season has certainly changed what most viewers know about Big Brother by not sequestering the jury and shortening the play time, so TV Insider was curious what the houseguest thought about it all. Read on to see what Mathews had to say about the once in a lifetime opportunity, his fellow houseguests, and if he\u2019d consider playing again.\n\nSee Also 7 Reality Shows That Produced Celebrity Editions CBS' upcoming 'Celebrity Big Brother' is the latest in a trend of shows pitting stars in head-to-head reality competitions.\n\nHow did this compare to your other TV experiences?\n\nEvery single thing set it apart from anything I\u2019ve ever done in my entire life. It was so discombobulating to be cut off from the outside world, it felt like being dizzy. And then you\u2019re in a house with a bunch of people you don\u2019t know and you can\u2019t trust any of them. It was so unsettling, the entire experience, and the worst part is, it started to feel normal. That was weird.\n\nWhat was the casting process like prior to entering the house? Did it take long? Were there limitations to social media?\n\nThere were discussions earlier on, and then we found out a couple of weeks before that it was official. They didn\u2019t put any restrictions\u2014of course, they said \u2018don\u2019t tell anybody,\u2019 but it gave me some time to get my social game in place so that there could be a conversation going on while I was in the house.\n\nThey took us away three days before we went into the house to be sequestered, and it was the Sunday of the Grammys when they made the cast announcement. They didn\u2019t want us to see who else was in the cast. I was cut off from the outside world, no TV, no music, no anything.\n\nYou won two HOH and three Veto competitions. Do you think any of the houseguests underestimated you?\n\nYes, I love that they underestimated me. I knew they would, so I was playing to win in the fourth quarter. I wanted to just sort of stay under the radar as much as I could for as long as I could. Make enough moves to be noticed but never to be a threat. That was my plan, and once it was time to start winning competitions and saving my ass, that\u2019s exactly what I did.\n\nI didn\u2019t want to play to the jury, I wanted to play the Big Brother game that I, for 19 seasons, have said I would play if I ever had the chance. If the jurors wanted to vote on their personal feelings about it, then they\u2019re not true Big Brother superfans.\n\nYour face when Omarosa walked in was priceless. What were you thinking in that moment? Did your opinion of her change over the course of the game?\n\nI thought, \u2018Oh, holy good God no.\u2019 That was really what went through my head, like \u2018Oh my god, no.\u2019 Because I didn\u2019t want to be in a house full of toxicity, you know? I just don\u2019t play that game very well. And then I quickly understood who Omarosa is and I became fascinated by it. She is able to turn it on and turn it off.\n\nWe were really good at sparring and going back and forth to each other, and as soon as it was over, she would say, \u2018That was great TV. Good job.\u2019 It was like, \u2018Oh my god, this is what she does.\u2019 And so it just became fascinating to me and I had her number from the get-go and she knew it. So she was trying to get me out and I wanted to get her out first, which I totally did.\n\nMany have said Shannon was the strongest player this season, but your social game was on point. How do you think that worked to your advantage?\n\nWell, you have to have a social game to win Big Brother. Shannon, I think, is the best player in Big Brother history. But the problem is, she told us all way too soon that she was the best player in Big Brother history. Responsibilities? Sixteen-letter words\u2013didn\u2019t need to do that, OK? So, could she have won the whole thing? Absolutely.\n\nAnd it is a huge compliment that we had to get her out right away, because in Big Brother, there are two types of people: people that you can\u2019t beat in the end and people coming after you. Shannon eventually would have been both of those things for me. I don\u2019t know why she\u2019s taking it so personally\u2014for a superfan of the show, she should get it. I honestly thought she would say to me, \u2018Great job, great move\u2019\u2026 I\u2019m shocked she didn\u2019t do that. She\u2019s still upset about it, and, you know, sorry.\n\nWhat does slop really taste like?\n\nIt\u2019s awful. It\u2019s like a negative flavor. It\u2019s like less than no flavor. But I cooked with it every day and people ate everything I made.\n\nYou and Marissa became really close, and it seems like everyone became friendly. Do you think those relationships will last outside of the house?\n\n[Sunday] night we left the house. [The next day] at 3 p.m., I\u2019m going to Marissa\u2019s house. Omarosa\u2019s coming [Laughs], Brandi\u2019s coming, Ari\u2019s coming, and everyone else is invited. So it\u2019s the truth, we just kind of love each other. We went at it, we were honest with each other, and we went there, but there is great camaraderie between all of us. We feel like people who have been through something together that no one else will ever understand. There\u2019s a bond that we will have forever\u2014even Omarosa and I. Yes it was authentic. I mean, Mark and I\u2026 I know we\u2019ll be friends forever now [also].\n\nHave you had a chance to watch any of the episodes from the show? If not, will you?\n\nI haven\u2019t seen anything yet and I don\u2019t know that I will. I lived it, so anything that they put together, I know will be entertaining and cut together funny. I know what happened in that house, I saw it with my own eyes, I know my experience. I might just want to hold onto that.\n\nThere may be clips I want to watch, I\u2019d love to see me win those power of vetos because I was so proud of myself, I really earned them. When I was on the block and when I wanted to get Omarosa out, I won every single time, and so I\u2019d love to see those.\n\nIf asked, would you ever consider going back into the Big Brother house to compete?\n\nWhen I first walked out of the house, I said \u2018There\u2019s no way I\u2019m going back in that house.\u2019 But, if they asked me, I\u2019d think about it. I don\u2019t know if I could ever play a better game than I played this season, but you never know.\n\nWhat is one thing viewers don\u2019t know about the Big Brother house that you think they should?\n\nIt\u2019s filthy. Not when you first walk in. But by day two, it is disgusting and there\u2019s not a damn thing you can do about it. It\u2019s the recycled air-conditioned air, there are multiple people who are kind of spoiled and sloppy living in it. It just gets a thick filth\u2014thick and disgusting. I would sweep all the time, we tried to wipe it down, but there\u2019s nothing you can do. It was disgusting.\n\nHow did you feel after finding out that you were voted America\u2019s Favorite Houseguest?\n\nWinning America\u2019s Favorite Houseguest meant more to me than winning the game ever could, because the jury was filled with a bunch of celebrities who had seen everything that went down. So I knew I probably couldn\u2019t win their votes. But the fans saw what I was doing in the house, they knew the kind of game I was playing. I was playing the game a true fan of Big Brother would play if they ever got to go into the house. The fact that they recognized that meant the world to me.", "images": ["https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tvi-white.png",
