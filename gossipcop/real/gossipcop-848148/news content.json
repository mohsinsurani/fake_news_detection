It all changed this week when his first interview post the split appeared in GQ.\n\nPitt had been accused of beating his 15-year-old son Maddox on a plane in September, which prompted Jolie to file for divorce. The FBI and Child Services investigated him for child abuse. He was romantically linked to his Allied co-star Marion Cotillard, which she immediately denied.\n\nThe GQ spread, apart from the interview, includes a massive 8-day photoshoot of Pitt, 53, \u201ctumbling through\u201d three national parks, and a music video.\n\nBut according to the BBC, it was all a planned move by Pitt to correct his faltering image. In the interview, the actor admitted to having an alcohol problem, and how it might have caused the problems in his life. He said he is undergoing therapy and is on a road to recovery after coming to terms with the \u201cself-inflicted\u201d situation he\u2019s in.\n\nBut instead of being called out for his behaviour, which, by his own admission is the reason his family was jarringly \u201cripped apart\u201d the Internet has sided with him.\n\nAn article titled \u201cWhy Brad Pitt won the Jolie-Pitt war by throwing himself on his sword\u201d published on E! said, \u201cThrowing caution to the wind - and simultaneously capitalizing on 30 years of goodwill built up in Hollywood - Brad went for it, translating what he\u2019s gleaned from his newfound love of therapy into a painfully self-aware, self-deprecating, oft-poetic and at times rambling discourse on a charmed life that veered off course and what he\u2019s doing to right the ship.\u201d\n\nVanity Fair said, \u201cPitt clearly studied the lay-it-all-bare, heart-on-my-sleeve, owning-my-flaws interview section of the post-celebrity-divorce playbook. Learning from his tumultuous year is a theme of the talk, especially regarding the divorce, which is still under way. He comes across candid, remorseful, and keen to let the world know that he\u2019s doing a lot of work on himself.\u201d\n\nAnd Huffington Post completes the trifecta of acceptance: \u201cPeople like (Brad) do so much to give a face to the addiction crisis that claims so many lives. Thank you for your honesty, your courage, and your willingness to open up about your recovery.\u201d\n\nThe BBC quotes PR guru Mark Borkowski as saying that Pitt would have \u201cTotal copy approval, total picture approval, total headline approval,\u201d on the interview.\n\n\u201cBut of course the timing is calculated,\u201d Borkowski continues. \u201cThe language is calculated. Everything is calculated. And everything is a gamble.\u201d\n\n\u201cA lot of people prefer to stay before the waterline and not do it. He\u2019s taken a massive risk and I can think of many who just wouldn\u2019t go this far.\u201d\n\nFollow @htshowbiz for more", "images": ["https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/2021/premium-icon-1.svg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/2021/quick-read-icon-1.svg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/2021/epaper-icon-1.svg", "https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_630x354/HT/p2/2017/05/05/Pictures/_6f843670-314b-11e7-9a19-4de5eae5ad18.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/white-close-icon.svg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/ht-logo.svg", "https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/05/05/Pictures/_6f843670-314b-11e7-9a19-4de5eae5ad18.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/exciting-deals.svg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/2021/crown-icon.svg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/close_game.svg", "https://images.hindustantimes.com/default/550x309.jpg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/2021/ad-free-icon.svg", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/static-content/1y/2021/subc-pop-img.png", "https://www.hindustantimes.com/res/images/quickread-quicklink-icon.svg"], "top_img": "https://images.hindustantimes.com/rf/image_size_960x540/HT/p2/2017/05/05/Pictures/_6f843670-314b-11e7-9a19-4de5eae5ad18.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.hindustantimes.com/hollywood/how-brad-pitt-overcame-allegations-of-adultery-child-abuse-and-corrected-his-image/story-OPUleLzaDAeF4XtU3ZnIUO.html", "title": "How Brad Pitt overcame allegations of adultery, child abuse, and corrected his image", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=5.0, user-scalable=1", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "google-site-verification": "U3xIlrlaetYrU7V1lNSFthKZzBFJ_S6qVzdn_gpMNjc", "keywords": "Brad Pitt,Angelina Jolie,Brad pitt GQ,Brad Pitt Interview,Brad Pitt Divorce,Brangelina,Brad Pitt Kids", "news_keywords": "Brad Pitt,Angelina Jolie,Brad pitt GQ,Brad Pitt Interview,Brad Pitt Divorce,Brangelina,Brad Pitt Kids", "description": "Brad Pitt has battled allegations of adultery and child abuse in the seven months since his separation from Angelina Jolie.
