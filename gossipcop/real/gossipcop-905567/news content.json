Here\u2019s my proof.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Celebs Slam Logan Paul Over Another Insensitive And Disrespectful Video From Japan Trip\n\nIn the accusation video, Dawson, who has 11 million subscribers, jokes about babies being \u201csexy.\u201d\n\nDawson posted his response later that day, apologizing for the nature of his humour back. He played the full podcast clip in context, making clear his remarks were simply tasteless jokes.\n\n\u201cI went to Google and I didn\u2019t want to see child porn. I just wanted to see, let me pretend I\u2019m a pedophile for a second,\u201d Dawson said in the clip. \u201cSo I typed in \u2018naked baby\u2019. First of all, I don\u2019t understand why anybody would be turned on by that. But, they were sexy. I\u2019m kidding.\u201d\n\nIn his 14-minute response video, Dawson said, \u201cI wanted to play that clip in full\u2014that moment especially in full\u2014just for context because that seems to be missing nowadays. I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m having this make this video.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to start by saying I\u2019m not a f***ing pedophile. I go on record saying I am not a f***ing pedophile. Got it? Great. There\u2019s my statement. It\u2019s disgusting that people are saying I\u2019m a f***ing pedophile because of some s***ty ass f***ing jokes from six years ago on a podcast.\u201d\n\nDawson then apologized for his old YouTube and podcast work.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry that I used to make really s***ty f***ing jokes. I\u2019m sorry that I was so f***ing insecure and playing this character of this guy who\u2019s crazy and will say anything and tries to make people laugh by shocking them. That was my thing. That is what I did on YouTube,\u201d Dawson said.\n\n\u201cBack in the day, 2008 \u2013 2012-ish, that was my thing. I loved the feeling of making somebody shocked and laugh because they couldn\u2019t believe what was coming out of my mouth. I wasn\u2019t confident enough to make smarter jokes. I was making the easy jokes\u2026 I was doing some f***ed up comedy stuff that I\u2019m not proud of.\u201d\n\nRELATED: Logan Paul Removed From YouTube Top Content Package\n\nThe \u201cPop Blast\u201d channel, which posted the accusation video, has been terminated by YouTube \u201cdue to multiple or severe violations of YouTube\u2019s policy against spam, deceptive practices, and misleading content or other Terms of Service violations.\u201d", "images": ["https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/royals-brick-340x150-1.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1131311335.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1428861897.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-etcanada-blue.png?w=32", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1428861897.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/ad-choices.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/christian-bale-feature-gq.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC100722NicoleRichieComedy_Nicole_Richie.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC100622MELCNAMEGAME_2_YOUTUBE.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/global.png", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1192256157.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=387&h=258&crop=1", "https://i1.wp.com/assets.vms.corusappservices.com/upload/ETC10722STEPUP3CHRISITINA.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1081213698.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&crop=1268px%2C598px%2C1515px%2C1010px&resize=387%2C258", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/newsletter/newsletter-large.jpg", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/5b7753aa-7d67-4aee-a43e-ade8290ecb41.jpg?quality=80&strip=all", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1389388354.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=145&h=97&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/themes/shaw-et-canada/img/logos/corus.png", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/x1r6adcqgy-bska8otyjs/image.jpeg.jpg?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://i1.wp.com/media.globaltv.com/videostatic/vms/ubgtg9uq24-9fp8wwineq/ETC100722TaylorSwiftMidnightsTracklistYoutube.png?w=145&h=97&quality=60", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=82", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ford_CCMA_ETC_Country_Club_340x150.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/etcanada-blue.png?w=90", "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/web-MYSTIC-RAISIN-BRICK-340x150-co-brand.jpg?quality=80&strip=all&w=340&h=150&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://etcanada.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/06/cropped-etcanada-blue.png?w=32", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Corey Atad", "Published"], "canonical_link": "https://etcanada.com/news/288264/youtuber-shane-dawson-apologizes-after-really-sty-fking-pedophilia-jokes-emerge/", "title": "YouTuber Shane Dawson Apologizes After \u2018Really S***ty F**king\u2019 Pedophilia Jokes Emerge", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "x4SpOp2Us67I6MlQN2uFse9KXvwgu1d8_r5F2qkIbYc", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "theme-color": "#0060b6", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "ET Canada", "application-name": "ET Canada", "title": "YouTuber Shane Dawson Apologizes After \u2018Really S***ty F**king\u2019 Pedophilia Jokes Emerge", "author": "Corey Atad", "description": "YouTuber Shane Dawson is apologizing for jokes he made several years ago on the subject of pedophilia.
