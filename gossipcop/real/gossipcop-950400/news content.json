After resurfacing on social media over the weekend, the clip sparked outrage.\n\nA Twitter user shared the video clip on Sunday (July 8), writing \u201csexual harassment on live TV folks.\u201d\n\nThe clip shows the Spice Girl, Walsh, Simon Cowell and Cheryl Cole being interviewed by Sarah-Jane Crawford on the reality show. During the interview, Walsh places his hand on Mel\u2019s butt. He then cups it before giving it a tap.\n\nAs noted by ebony.com, the discomfort can be seen on Mel B\u2019s face as she stops the interview, telling Crawford, \u201chold on a second.\u201d She then asks Walsh, \u201cWhy are you grabbing my butt?\u201d\n\nMel B\u2019s cohosts laugh off the gesture and try to reassure her that she\u2019s \u201csafe.\u201d She moves away from Walsh, who says he\u2019s only looking after her.\n\nSome online users defended Walsh because he\u2019s a homosexual and others justified his actions because he was unaware of what he was doing.\n\nMany noted that if it can happen so openly in a public setting then there should be little doubt about how frequently sexual harassment occurs behind closed doors.\n\nMel B nor Walsh have commented on the resurfaced video.\n\nREAD MORE STORIES ON BLACKAMERICAWEB.COM:\n\nSIGN UP FOR OUR NEWSLETTER:\n\nClose Thank you for subscribing!
