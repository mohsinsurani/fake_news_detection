{"url": "http://screencrush.com/beauty-and-the-beast-toilet-deleted-scene/", "text": "There\u2019s no easy way to say this, but if you saw Beauty and the Beast in theaters, you were ROBBED. All week long Disney has been dropping additional content from the hit live-action remake online to promote the upcoming Blu-ray release, including some pretty darn cute behind-the-scenes footage. But in the latest clip, director Bill Condon reveals a scene that was unjustly deleted from the film. That sneaky dude has been holding out on us.\n\nThis whole time we\u2019ve been missing out on some of the sweetest schadenfreude a fictional family film can offer: Courtesy of Entertainment Weekly, behold the glorious scene in which one of the most insufferable actors is locked in a bathroom and tormented by an enchanted CG toilet \u2014\n\nIt\u2019s cinematic justice for everyone who finds Gad vaguely annoying despite his pleasant antics. Dreams really do come true \u2014 or they almost did, until Condon inexplicably cut the scene from the film, a decision made all the more confusing when EW reveals that this brave vigilante toilet (named Monsieur Toilette, but of course) was voiced by the great Stephen Merchant.\n\n\u2026Which leaves us with even more questions, like if the toilets are also enchanted castle staff members, where do Belle and the Beast, you know, go? Surely they wouldn\u2019t, I mean\u2026Then again, the Beast\u2019s household employees remained weirdly, almost aggressively hospitable despite their cursed state.", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/Josh-Gad-Beauty-and-the-Beast.jpg?w=630&amp;h=420&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89&w=980&q=75", "http://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2018/04/screencrush-high-rez.png", "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/Josh-Gad-Beauty-and-the-Beast.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/Josh-Gad-Beauty-and-the-Beast.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Britt Hayes"], "canonical_link": "https://screencrush.com/beauty-and-the-beast-toilet-deleted-scene/", "title": "\u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 Deleted Scene Reveals Magical Toilet", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "screencrush", "description": "We were totally robbed of Stephen Merchant as an enchanted CG toilet named Monsieur Toilette (because of course).", "keywords": "beauty and the beast deleted scene, beauty and the beast stephen merchant deleted, beauty and the beast toilet scene, beauty and the beast josh gad toilet scene, beauty and the beast lefou toilet scene,movie news,videos", "fb": {"app_id": 234630989968140, "admins": 100002025987268, "pages": 335338213173624}, "og": {"title": "\u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019 Deleted Scene Reveals Magical Toilet", "description": "We were totally robbed of Stephen Merchant as an enchanted CG toilet named Monsieur Toilette (because of course).", "url": "https://screencrush.com/beauty-and-the-beast-toilet-deleted-scene/", "site_name": "ScreenCrush", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/Josh-Gad-Beauty-and-the-Beast.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@screencrushnews"}, "sailthru.description": "We were totally robbed of Stephen Merchant as an enchanted CG toilet named Monsieur Toilette (because of course).", "sailthru.date": "2017-06-02 14:06:21", "sailthru.title": "An Enchanted CG Toilet Terrorizes Josh Gad in This Great \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019\u00a0Deleted Scene", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-screencrush, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, beauty-and-the-beast, bill-condon, josh-gad, stephen-merchant, movie-news, video", "sailthru.author": "britthayes", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/Josh-Gad-Beauty-and-the-Beast.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/442/files/2017/06/Josh-Gad-Beauty-and-the-Beast.jpg", "google-site-verification": "kqgt6282H0LW80r-QpVAiqBiFEvZa7cPdgB0F3OCHdU", "msvalidate.01": "38FB0DB5D97FA0CEE1853CB708082BF1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496408781.0, "source": "http://screencrush.com", "summary": ""}
