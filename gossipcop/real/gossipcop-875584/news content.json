The music icon was taking questions from reporters at the launch of her new handbag collection in her home city of Montreal Wednesday when one male journalist decided to dive a little deeper.\n\n\u201cHow are things going? It\u2019s a whole new world for you,\u201d the reporter said. \u201cYou\u2019re a single woman now.\u201d\n\nDion didn\u2019t miss a beat when she quipped back, \u201cAre you asking me out?\u201d Before the journalist could formulate a full answer, she burst into song, crooning Rihanna\u2019s \u201cDiamonds\u201d as a way to answer his question.\n\nWhen the same reporter then attempted to ask her once more about her love life, Dion didn\u2019t relent. \u201cWe going out or what?\u201d she asked with a smile, to which he asked, \u201cAre you free tonight?\u201d\n\nAt that cue, Dion burst out in song again, this time belting out the chorus to Tom Petty\u2019s \u201cFree Fallin\u2019.\u201d\n\nDion even gave a nod to Marvin Gaye\u2019s 1971 track, \u201cWhat\u2019s Goin\u2019 On\u201d when another reporter asked the question aloud in confusion.\n\nFinally, though, the singer managed to eke out a more serious answer, telling the gathered fans that she\u2019s been taking life one day at a time since her husband, Rene Angelil, and her brother, Daniel Dion, died within days of one another in January 2016.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m enjoying myself,\u201d she said. \u201cI went through a lot. At this time of my life, going back a few years back when it was so hard, I feel as though I can spread my wings. \u2026 There is a force that takes over when you believe, and I\u2019m a believer.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celine-dion-199600e1-ec03-4773-aa83-f84fc7e6b019.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celine-dion-199600e1-ec03-4773-aa83-f84fc7e6b019.jpg?w=1401&h=788&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celine-dion-199600e1-ec03-4773-aa83-f84fc7e6b019.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joyce Chen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-news/celine-dion-sings-rihanna-tom-petty-songs-when-asked-about-her-love-life-202560/", "title": "Celine Dion Sings Rihanna Song When Asked About Love Life \u2013 Rolling Stone", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#df3535", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Celine Dion, whose husband Rene Angelil died last year, keeps the mood light during event after reporter asks her whether she's still single.", "news_keywords": "Celine Dion", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "rollingstone", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 202560, "author": "Joyce Chen", "pmc-category": "Music,Music News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-08-24T21:46:00"}, "pmc-tag": "Celine Dion", "title": "Celine Dion Sings Rihanna, Tom Petty Songs When Asked About Her Love Life", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Joyce Chen", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RS", "application-name": "RS", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 202560, "title": "Celine Dion Sings Rihanna, Tom Petty Songs When Asked About Her Love Life", "published_at": "2017-08-24 21:46:00", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/celine-dion-199600e1-ec03-4773-aa83-f84fc7e6b019.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Celine Dion", "topics": "Music News", "body": "Celine Dion had the perfect response to one nosy reporter's questions about her personal life: with song.
