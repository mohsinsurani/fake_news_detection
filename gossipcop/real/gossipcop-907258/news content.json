Tyler Posey has been dating actress Sophia Taylor Ali since August, and the pair recently made their romance Instagram official. The Teen Wolf actor opened up to Us Weekly about the story behind the first photo they shared as a couple on social media.\n\nThe duo attended the Universal Studios\u2019 Halloween Horror Nights in October, and Posey, 26, posted a snap of himself and Ali from that night on Instagram, writing: \u201cGot spooky with the spookiest lady around.\u201d\n\nWhen Us spoke to Posey about their Halloween outing at the Noods Before Dark party, he said: \u201cYeah, it was a lot of fun. She was real scared. Yeah, I\u2019m a big guy. I can protect her. I got scared a couple times. It\u2019s fun to play into it.\u201d\n\nSince then, the pair have not been shy about posting about each other on social media. The Maid in Manhattan star shared a photo of her sleeping inside a car on Tuesday, November 7, writing: \u201cWhat a beautiful young lady.\u201d\n\nWhat a beautiful young lady A post shared by Tyler Posey (@tylerposey58) on Nov 7, 2017 at 8:55am PST\n\nMeanwhile, the couple took a trip to Paris together last month, and he shared a photo of Ali, alongside the caption, \u201cBest view in the house.

It\u2019s so fresh,\u201d Posey, 25, told Us of his new relationship at Variety\u2018s Power of Young Hollywood event back in August. \u201cI\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\n\u201cI really admire her,\u201d he added. \u201cI think she\u2019s extremely talented and a great person. I\u2019m inspired by her a lot and she intimidates me sometimes, which I\u2019m not really used to. I\u2019m nervous right now talking about it. She\u2019s beautiful, really cool, has a lot of my same interests. Yeah, I could go on about that, too.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like a secret or anything. It\u2019s just really new,\u201d he told Us then. \u201cI\u2019ll talk about it in a couple of months or something like that.\u201d\n\nAlthough the actor hadn\u2019t confirmed who his girlfriend was at the time, he was spotted with his arm around the actress at a restaurant in Studio City, California, that same month. The stars filmed the upcoming horror flick Truth or Dare together and have been an item ever since.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tyler-posey-sophia-taylor-ali-instagram-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tyler-posey-sophia-taylor-ali-instagram-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez", "Gabrielle Bernardini"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tyler-posey-talks-about-dating-new-girlfriend-sophia-taylor-ali/", "title": "Tyler Posey Talks About Dating New Girlfriend Sophia Taylor Ali", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Tyler Posey is dating fellow actress Sophia Taylor Ali and he told Us Weekly about being protective of her during a recent outing \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Tyler Posey Talks About His New Relationship With Sophia Taylor Ali", "description": "Tyler Posey is dating fellow actress Sophia Taylor Ali and he told Us Weekly about being protective of her during a recent outing \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/tyler-posey-talks-about-dating-new-girlfriend-sophia-taylor-ali/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-11-10T00:22:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tyler-posey-sophia-taylor-ali-instagram-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tyler-posey-sophia-taylor-ali-instagram-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-11-10T00:22:55+00:00"}, "author": "Karla Rodriguez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Tyler Posey Talks About His New Relationship With Sophia Taylor Ali", "description": "Tyler Posey is dating fellow actress Sophia Taylor Ali and he told Us Weekly about being protective of her during a recent outing \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/11/tyler-posey-sophia-taylor-ali-instagram-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1080px%2C567px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510273375.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
