The resemblance is crazy! It\u2019s always neat to see who kids end up looking more like. So cute.\u201d\n\nAnother posted: \u201cHe looks more and more like Louis every time I see him.\u201d\n\nA third wrote: \u201cHe takes after his father, he's like a little Louis.\u201d\n\nTomlinson and Jungwirth welcomed their first child together in January 2016. He later rekindled his relationship with Eleanor Calder.\n\nTomlinson has been busy putting his debut solo album together and recently released his latest single Just Like You which he described as \u201cvery autobiographical and obviously about me.\u201d\n\nSpeaking to Zane Lowe on Beats 1 Radio he said: \u201cThe fans have seen so much and got to know us so well, but I\u2019ve never really had a chance to be as honest like that with music, so that was really refreshing.\u201d\n\nHe continued: \u201cIt felt good to have a real advert there that was 100 per cent me. The important thing to me was that, I\u2019ve read a lot of press stories about myself and the press and everyone naturally puts this spin on fame and celebrity, and I kind of just wanted to show the other side of it.\u201d\n\nTomlinson said he has \u201calways kind of struggled with the concept of fame\u201d and that it was \u201cimportant to me to write a song that could humanise me as much as possible and that the fans can really feel I\u2019m just like them.\u201d", "images": ["https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/16/16/brianajungwirth.jpg?width=968&auto=webp&quality=50&crop=968%3A645%2Csmart", "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/16/16/brianajungwirth.jpg?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75"], "top_img": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/16/16/brianajungwirth.jpg?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Powell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/the-resemblance-is-crazy-louis-tomlinson-fans-gush-over-rare-picture-of-son-freddie-a3659871.html", "title": "\u2018The resemblance is crazy!\u2019: Louis Tomlinson fans gush over rare picture of son Freddie", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "description": "The adorable tot will turn two in January", "theme-color": "#FFFFFF", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 193840110715213, "pages": 165348596842143}, "category": "Celebrity News", "sitename": "Evening Standard", "page path": "/showbiz/celebrity-news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "site_name": "Evening Standard", "updated_time": "2017-10-16T15:13:22.000Z", "title": "Louis Tomlinson fans gush over rare picture of \u2018adorable\u2019 son Freddie", "url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/the-resemblance-is-crazy-louis-tomlinson-fans-gush-over-rare-picture-of-son-freddie-a3659871.html", "type": "article", "description": "The adorable tot will turn two in January", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/16/16/brianajungwirth.jpg?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75", "secure_url": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/16/16/brianajungwirth.jpg?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@EveningStandard", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The adorable tot will turn two in January", "image": "https://static.standard.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/10/16/16/brianajungwirth.jpg?width=1200&width=1200&auto=webp&quality=75", "title": "Louis Tomlinson fans gush over rare picture of \u2018adorable\u2019 son Freddie"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-16T15:13:22.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-16T15:13:22.000Z", "section": "Showbiz", "subsection": "Celebrity News", "author_name": "Emma Powell", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 400, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 4, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2017-10-16T15:13:22.000Z", "author": "Emma Powell", "publisher": "Evening Standard", "vf": {"url": "https://www.standard.co.uk/showbiz/celebrity-news/the-resemblance-is-crazy-louis-tomlinson-fans-gush-over-rare-picture-of-son-freddie-a3659871.html"}, "keywords": "louis tomlinson, Instagram"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508166802.0, "source": "https://www.standard.co.uk", "summary": ""}
