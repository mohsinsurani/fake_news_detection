According to ET Online, the couple married yesterday in front of family and friends at Paltrow's Hamptons home. The guest list was predictably star studded, with celebs like Robert Downey Jr., Jerry Seinfeld, Cameron Diaz, and Benji Madden in attendance.\n\nThe wedding was dreamt up by Paltrow and made special due to new renovations in her home. \"They have been planning this wedding all year,\" a source said. \"Gwyneth pays attention to every details so we are all set for a fairytale wedding.\"\n\nIt's understandable that Paltrow wanted to get the details right. According to People, the actress considers this to be her first wedding, despite her marriage to Chris Martin. Paltrow and Martin opted out of an elaborate wedding and eloped in 2003, before \u201cconsciously uncoupling\u201d in 2014. \u201cI\u2019m excited about everything! I\u2019ve never had a wedding before. So even though I\u2019m 45, I sort of feel like a 21-year-old,\u201d she told PeopleStyle.\n\nMartin was not in attendance, but the actress' children Apple and Moses were a big part of the special day. \"Gwyneth has included her kids in some of the planning and they can\u2019t wait. They adore Brad and are excited for their mom,\" the source added to ET Online.", "images": ["https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/stephanie-grisham-1633436922.jpeg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gwynethbrad-jpg-1538320500.jpg?crop=0.556xw:1.00xh;0.0674xw,0&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/taylor-swift-and-joe-alwyn-arrive-at-zuma-on-october-06-news-photo-1665150988.jpg?crop=0.591xw:0.531xh;0.226xw,0.0403xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-494886950-1538585114.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.295xh;0,0.160xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/8bc9607c-71ae-4c5b-a8fa-eeabb5a808b9_1558019963.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elle-escapes-lisbon-lead-1663611977.jpg?crop=0.553xw:0.983xh;0.212xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/jennifer-lopez-and-ben-affleck-are-seen-on-september-04-news-photo-1665077679.jpg?crop=0.758xw:0.569xh;0.143xw,0.0276xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tmc-107-unit-04108r-1665178520.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.151xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emma-d-arcy-1665164132.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.245xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ciw-unit-12862-r-jpg-1664898600.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/luckiest-girl-alive-jessica-knoll-1665088185.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2019-elle-songassociation-ep93-lewiscapaldi-jp-cm-kk-v3-ap-v2-1575927996.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078833.jpg?crop=0.388xw:0.259xh;0.304xw,0.0578xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leo-gigi-gettyimages-1662584674.jpg?crop=0.492xw:0.984xh;0.508xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dragons-hotd-1-1663005412.png?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.259xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/te-le-chargement-1665080515.png?crop=0.505xw:1.00xh;0.162xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-494886950-1538585114.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.295xh;0,0.160xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/a23531971/gwyneth-paltrow-brad-falchuk-married-report/", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk Are Married", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow and Brad Falchuk Are Married", "description": "\ufeffGwyneth Paltrow and producer Brad Falchuk are finally hubsand and wife\ufeff.
