While Kelble got down on one knee to pop the question to Roll, baby Fiona pressed herself up against the glass, got a front row seat to the sentiments and gave the photobomb of a lifetime.\n\nThe blissful bride-to-be later posted a series of photos to her Instagram page of the happy couple and the photogenic animal captioned: \u201cWe\u2019re so happy Fiona could be there on our special day \u2764 here\u2019s to many more years of going to zoos with you \ud83d\ude19 @cincinnatizoo #cincinnatizoo #fionathehippo #fionafix #keepingupwiththekelbles #cincyzoopic\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s been a big year for baby Fiona. After her birth in January 2017, she was the first Nile hippopotamus in captivity to survive being born six weeks prematurely.\n\nDedicated Cincinnati Zoo caretakers hand-raised her and gave her 24-hour care so that she would grow strong enough to be able to live at the zoo with her parents. She grew from 29 pounds to 500 pounds by September 23. Since then, she has inspired two books, an ice cream flavor and has gained worldwide attention.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/10/hippo-photobombs-marriage-proposal-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1077px%2C566px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/10/hippo-photobombs-marriage-proposal-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1077px%2C566px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Vacco-Bolanos"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/baby-hippo-fiona-perfectly-photobombs-proposal/", "title": "Baby Hippo Fiona Perfectly Photobombs Zoo Proposal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Celebrity Pets,direct", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "A Cincinnati couple got the surprise of a lifetime when the zoo's baby hippo photobombed their proposal \u2014 see the pic", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Baby Hippo Fiona Perfectly Photobombs Zoo Proposal", "description": "A Cincinnati couple got the surprise of a lifetime when the zoo's baby hippo photobombed their proposal \u2014 see the pic", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/baby-hippo-fiona-perfectly-photobombs-proposal/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-24T21:42:02+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/10/hippo-photobombs-marriage-proposal-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1077px%2C566px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/10/hippo-photobombs-marriage-proposal-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1077px%2C566px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-10-24T21:42:02+00:00"}, "author": "Jessica Vacco-Bolanos", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Baby Hippo Fiona Perfectly Photobombs Zoo Proposal", "description": "A Cincinnati couple got the surprise of a lifetime when the zoo's baby hippo photobombed their proposal \u2014 see the pic", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/2017/10/hippo-photobombs-marriage-proposal-01.jpg?crop=0px%2C43px%2C1077px%2C566px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508881322.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
