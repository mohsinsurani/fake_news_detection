And on Tuesday, she decided to pull it out for another wear in honor of her close friend\u2019s wedding day.\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty\n\nWhile the star paired the dress with a pair of black pumps the first time around, she styled the design to look a bit more casual for Schumer\u2019s Malibu wedding bash by opting for a pair of black wedges, unbuttoning the bodice and adding a simple black choker and heart necklace.\n\nShe did address that undone look to Entertainment Tonight, saying, \u201cNotice my shirt was accidentally undone the whole time \u2026 In every wedding photo, all of my buttons were undone. It looks like I was like, \u2018Oh, you thought this was gonna be about you?'\u201d\n\nLooking for more style content?

It was very sudden, but it was, I was sobbing the whole [time],\u201d the actress told Entertainment Tonight on Thursday while promoting her new film Red Sparrow. \u201cHis vows were stunning. It\u2019s when two people really love each other and they really mean it, it shows, and it was a beautiful ceremony and an amazing time. I couldn\u2019t be happier for them.\u201d\n\nSchumer and Fischer tied the knot in a private ceremony in Malibu, California, on Tuesday and exchanged vows in front of about 80 people including Jennifer Aniston, Jake Gyllenhaal, Larry David and David Spade.\n\nAmy Schumer/Instagram\n\nThe comedian, 36, wore a timeless white wedding dress by Monique Lhuillier described by the brand as a \u201cre-embroidered lace and tulle A-line gown with a ballet bodice,\u201d which was the first (and only!) gown she tried on.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Surprise! Amy Schumer and Chef Chris Fischer Are Married!\n\n\u201cIt was kind of an amazing and effortless experience,\u201d Schumer\u2019s stylist Leesa Evans told PeopleStyle. \u201cAmy said, \u2018Text me when you wake up, Chris and I want to get married.\u2019 And then I called her when I woke up and she was like, \u2018Let\u2019s try on dresses today.\u2019 It was literally that of spur of the moment.\u201d\n\nAmy Schumer/Instagram\n\n\u201cIt felt effortless and comfortable and that\u2019s really what she wanted,\u201d Evans added. \u201cShe wanted it to be easy, she wanted to feel like herself and she wanted to have a great time and a great experience while wearing it. She wore flats, she didn\u2019t need to wear a bunch of undergarments and it was just so easy and it felt right. So we both kind of looked at each other and giggled and said, \u2018Well, let\u2019s just go with it. Why try any more?\u2019 and that\u2019s what we did.\u201d\n\nSaveSaveSaveSave", "images":
