Are you not over it? As it turns out, he is\u2026 because he\u2019s married to supermodel Kate Moss. He just wanted to let Juliet know. Petty much?\n\nSource: BBC Pictures/Nick Briggs\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDavid (Hugh Grant) is Prime Minister once more, and dances to Hotline Bling\n\nSource: Twitter/@VeronicaMag\n\nYou will remember that in the original it was Jump by the Pointer Sisters. But OF COURSE it\u2019s Hotline Bling this time.\n\nSource: BBC/Comic Relief\n\nMartine McCutcheon pops up again as Natalie, and it appears that she and David are still very much together.\n\nBilly Mack (Bill Nighy) has slept with a Kardashian, but lost his manager\n\nSource: Twitter/@lucybrown\n\nThis was a bit of a curveball \u2013 in a radio interview, Billy brags of bedding a Kardashian (he doesn\u2019t know which one, however) and reveals that the long-suffering Joe died of a heart attack. Rude, Richard Curtis.\n\nJamie (Colin Firth) and Aur\u00e9lia (L\u00facia Moniz) are married with three cute kids\n\nSource: BBC/Comic Relief\n\nHe\u2019s still wearing a woolly turtleneck, and his Portuguese is still terrible. At the end of their segment, Aur\u00e9lia reveals she\u2019s pregnant with their fourth child.\n\nSam (Thomas Brodie-Sangster) and Joanna (Olivia Olson) are very serious about each other\n\nSource: Twitter/@lucybrown\n\nThey reconnected in New York in the years since the first film, and returned home to London so Joanna could ask Daniel (Liam Neeson) for Sam\u2019s hand in marriage. N\u2019yaww.\n\nAnd Rufus (Rowan Atkinson) now works in a Sainsburys\n\nSource: BBC/Comic Relief\n\nWhere his instincts for gift wrapping aren\u2019t quite as welcome, unfortunately.\n\nThe short ended with David (Hugh Grant) making a speech that has become quite poignant after the week\u2019s events:\n\nWhenever you see tragedy, you see bravery. Whenever you see ordinary people in need, you see extraordinary ordinary people come to their aid. Most people, every day, everywhere, still have enough love in their hearts to help human beings in trouble. Good is going to win, I\u2019m actually sure of it.\n\nLove Actually fans were DELIGHTED by the whole thing:\n\nSource: Becky Bedbug/Twitter\n\nI still think that Hugh Grant is the best Prime Minister that we never had \ud83d\ude02 #rednosedayactually #RedNoseDay \u2014 .
