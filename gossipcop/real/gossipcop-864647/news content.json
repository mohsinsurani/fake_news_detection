Super excited for July,\u201d she captioned photos on her Story.\n\nJust a few weeks ago, Briana updated her Instagram with an ultrasound picture of her newest child. \u201cMy lil Dominican bae is 6lbs, healthy & hairy (lol) few more weeks well actually she can come any day now,\u201d DeJesus wrote.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BVP66M7jkSt/\n\n\u201cWe are ready for you,\u201d she added with a heart emoji.\n\nDeJesus was first introduced to viewers on 16 and Pregnant and then on Teen Mom 3 as she waited expectantly for daughter Nova and navigated a tricky relationship with on-again, off-again boyfriend Devoin Austin.\n\nDeJesus would joined the cast of Teen Mom 2 back in March.\n\nFROM PEN: HGTV\u2019s Chip and Joanna Gaines Discuss Their Newfound Fame\n\nHer new daughter is the result of relationship she had with a new boyfriend, a man named Luis, and was \u201cthe last thing that I expected to happen,\u201d she said. By the end of the latest teaser for Teen Mom 2, Briana is seen breaking down in tears explaining that \u201c[Luis] been cheating on me this whole time, so I don\u2019t know what I\u2019m gonna do.\u201d\n\nWhile it looks like Briana will be raising both her childrenwithout much help from their fathers, this is nothing new for the Teen Mom veteran. She revealed in the Teen Mom OG After Show that she and her ex Devoin barely talk and that he\u2019s \u201cnot the best father he should be to Nova.\u201d\n\nHowever, despite the challenge, it doesn\u2019t seem to have held back little Nova, who recently graduated pre-school.\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUK_Si7jdjy/\n\nTeen Mom 2 returns July 18 to MTV.", "images":
