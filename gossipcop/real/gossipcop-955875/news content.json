One month after Hilton revealed that Lohan will not be invited to her upcoming wedding with Chris Zylka, explaining \u201cIf you don\u2019t have anything nice to say, don\u2019t say anything at all,\u201d Hilton has become more specific about her issues with Lohan.\n\nThe heiress called the actress a \u201cpathological liar\u201d on Instagram after the fan account @paris2000s posted a few old videos of Lohan talking about their relationship. The videos, taken in 2006, show Lohan exhibiting conflicting feelings about Hilton. In one clip, Lohan says, \u201cThis is a video that Paris Hilton\u2026 and I\u2019m saying this on tape\u2026 she hit me last night, for no reason, apparently at my friend\u2019s house and I didn\u2019t know she\u2019d be there. She hit me; she hit me with a drink and poured it all over me and it hurts and it\u2019s not okay.\u201d\n\nIn another video, though, the pair are still together. As Hilton is getting into a car, she shouts at Lohan who is approaching the vehicle, \u201cLindsay, tell them the truth,\u201d to which Lohan replies, \u201cParis is my friend,\u201d Lohan says, \u201cShe\u2019s a nice person. Please leave us alone\u2026she never did that, she\u2019s a good girl.\u201d\n\nThen, in another clip, Lohan calls Paris a \u201cc-nt,\u201d before a friend of her whispers something to the actress and Lohan clarifies her stance, saying, \u201cI never said that. Paris is my friend. I love her. I\u2019ve known her since I was 15 years old.\u201d\n\nHilton left her own opinion in the comments section of the video, which was posted with the caption, \u201cThe chronicles of the \u201900s troubled star Lindsay Lohan and her chaotic backtracking situations,\u201d writing, simply, \u201c#pathologicalliar.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that 2006 was the year Lohan and Hilton\u2019s rumored feud began, after a video of Hilton laughing at their mutual friend Brandon Davis calling the actress a \u201cfire crotch\u201d went viral. Last month, Hilton clarified their current relationship status, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t have any drama with anyone but I choose to not surround myself with certain people. Life is too short.\u201d\n\n\u00a9 Instagram\n\nLohan is more or less attempting to do the same as she has stepped away from the spotlight to work on a film with an all-female team in Saudi Arabia. (She\u2019s currently based in Dubai.) Lohan recently reflected on how much life has changed since the aughts, telling W, \u201cIt\u2019s [called] an iPhone. We didn\u2019t have Instagram.\u2026 It would have been a lot calmer for me. When you think about it, paparazzi are not as crazy as they used to be when I used to be in New York. Now I can just [take a picture] before I walk out the door and then there is no story. It\u2019s good, but it\u2019s a little in-genuine.\u201d One thing about that does seem to be genuine: her and Hilton\u2019s feud.\n\nRelated: Reintroducing Lindsay Lohan: The Actress Has Found a Sense of Calm, and Is Now Ready to Launch a Beauty Brand", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/18/5b4f84be01e50e0b71b6fb3d_Lindsay-Lohan-and-Paris-Hilton-feud-.jpg?w=414&h=352&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/18/5b4f84be01e50e0b71b6fb3d_Lindsay-Lohan-and-Paris-Hilton-feud-.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/18/5b4f88a357e4ab30c538f5d1_paris-hilton-lindsay-lohan-feud-.jpg?w=374&h=58&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/5/47b5fa0f-fc48-4cb1-9604-6f5821fa832d-getty-1430611960.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5093&fp-y=0.3502", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/8/29/9f122c0b-8ad0-4d04-b2cf-3379547870db-tswifty.jpeg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.532&fp-y=0.228"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/18/5b4f84be01e50e0b71b6fb3d_Lindsay-Lohan-and-Paris-Hilton-feud-.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/lindsay-lohan-paris-hilton-feud-instagram-pathological-liar", "title": "Lindsay Lohan and Paris Hilton\u2019s Feud Continues as the Heiress Calls Her Former Friend a \u2018Pathological Liar\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marissagmuller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/lindsay-lohan-paris-hilton-feud-instagram-pathological-liar", "type": "article", "title": "Paris Hilton Just Called Lindsay Lohan a \"Pathological Liar,\" and, No, This Isn't a Headline From the Aughts", "description": "Their feud lives on.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/07/18/5b4f84be01e50e0b71b6fb3d_Lindsay-Lohan-and-Paris-Hilton-feud-.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "Their feud lives on."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
