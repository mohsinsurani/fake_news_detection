Yesterday, the mom posted her first family-of-four photo featuring Logan Alexander, her adorable baby boy who came out healthy and weighing 7 pounds, 2 ounces \u2014 with a full head of hair to boot.\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.

(FWIW, babies who weigh less than 5 pounds 8 ounces are considered low birthweight, as defined by the CDC.)\n\nAlthough you'd think the model's second successful birth would silence her haters for good, it's (unfortunately) unlikely. After all, after James was born, Sarah got flak for losing all 28 pounds of her baby weight in just two weeks. Sigh. At least Sarah's boys will grow up knowing that their mom is strong AF \u2014 with thick skin to boot.\n\nGet all the ~FiTsPiRaTiOn~ directly in your feed.
