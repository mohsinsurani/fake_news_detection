Haskell resigned, along with two more high level executives.\n\nMund is speaking out about the controversy for the first time in an interview to CNN. She also discussed the organization\u2019s future with former Miss America Gretchen Carlson now at the helm, her support for the #MeToo movement and her political aspirations.\n\nWhat went through your mind when you read the leaked emails?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate and I kept thinking, what was said about me? That shouldn\u2019t be the first thing I have to worry about, but then I knew at the same time there are all these young girls looking up [to me], and I\u2019m there to uphold morale, and I\u2019m there to let them know that the future of Miss America, we\u2019ve got another 100 years after this. It\u2019s difficult, you never want to have that said about yourself, about your fellow sisters but you can just get stronger from it.\u201d\n\nGretchen Carlson, former Miss America 1989, has been tapped to run the organization and essentially turn things around. What are your thoughts on her as the new leader?\n\n\u201cGrowing up, I was always admiring different Miss Americas but I think Gretchen Carlson has always been one of my favorites because she is a well-educated woman. She went to Stanford. She was from the Midwest, just like me. I think it\u2019s great to have a female in the role leading a women\u2019s empowerment organization. I think she is highly qualified for the job. She\u2019s going to be able to push us further on, and I can\u2019t wait to see where Miss America is going to go next.\u201d\n\nHow do you make sure things like that don\u2019t happen again within an organization like Miss America?\n\n\u201cI think accountability. What\u2019s amazing is that this organization is there to empower women. At the end of the day, it was the Miss Americas who had the courage to stand up and say this wasn\u2019t right, we need to change this. The mission of the organization \u2026 came full circle and we are giving women that power to take back what\u2019s theirs.\u201d\n\nYou are at a pivotal time, representing the country as a strong female leader in the midst of a national reckoning. Have you thought about how you\u2019ll use your platform to support the #MeToo movement?\n\n\u201cThis is so important as Miss America that I serve as a voice for those that may not be heard \u2026 I\u2019m here to say we need to stand in solidarity. We need to support these women. There\u2019s other women out there that haven\u2019t had the opportunity to be heard, but we are going to make sure we do something to change what\u2019s going on \u2026 I\u2019m not just here to wear a crown and sash and smile and wave, but I\u2019m here to make an impact. I\u2019m going to do what I can \u2013 if that\u2019s lobbying on Congress, if that\u2019s testifying, whatever it is that I need to do.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019ve said you\u2019d like to run for political office one day?\n\n\u201cI would love to be the first female governor of North Dakota. I would just love to see equal representation between men and women in Congress. Issues that are going on right now are things that are affecting both genders and when I sat at the State of the Union, I remember looking out and I was having a hard time finding the women. Women only represent about 20 percent [of Congress] and we are equal in population. So, I don\u2019t know why we aren\u2019t having our voice heard at an equal level.\u201d\n\nYou\u2019re from a state that nearly all voted for Donald Trump, is there a misconception in the media of \u2018Trump Country\u2019?\n\n\u201cI think at the end of the day, we are all similar more than we are different. Before we are Republicans or Democrats, we are Americans. We all have this goal of making our country the best that we can.\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on Donald Trump\u2019s proposal to build a wall?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think the issue of immigration is necessarily a structural one. I think it\u2019s a political one, and I think it would be a waste of funding. There are so many other issues in the United States that could use that funding, and I don\u2019t think that\u2019s going to solve the problem by just building a wall.\u201d\n\nWhat are your thoughts on same sex marriage?\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think who you love can be determined by a piece of legislation. It\u2019s not a legislative issue. It\u2019s a personal issue, and I don\u2019t think it\u2019s right for a governing body to tell you who you can and cannot love.\u201d\n\nWould you like to add or take away a portion of the Miss America pageant?\n\n\u201cI would like to see is more of the interview portion featured on the telecast.\u201d\n\nThis interview has been edited and condensed for clarity.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170126173139-chloe-melas.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170911144321-miss-america.jpg?q=x_0,y_235,h_1688,w_3000,c_crop/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170911144321-miss-america.jpg?q=x_0,y_235,h_1688,w_3000,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/entertainment/miss-america-cara-mund-email-scandal/index.html", "title": "Miss America Cara Mund on the organization's recent email controversy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Reigning Miss America Cara Mund addresses the organization's recent email controversy | CNN", "description": "A little over three months after Cara Mund was crowned Miss America, a scandal rocked the organization.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170911144321-miss-america.jpg?q=x_0,y_235,h_1688,w_3000,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/02/13/entertainment/miss-america-cara-mund-email-scandal/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Reigning Miss America Cara Mund addresses the organization's recent email controversy | CNN", "description": "A little over three months after Cara Mund was crowned Miss America, a scandal rocked the organization.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170911144321-miss-america.jpg?q=x_0,y_235,h_1688,w_3000,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "A little over three months after Cara Mund was crowned Miss America, a scandal rocked the organization.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-13T17:34:47Z", "modified_time": "2018-02-13T18:53:55Z", "tag": "contests and competitions, donald trump, females (demographic group), feminism, gender equality, miss america, pageants, political figures - us, population and demographics, scandals, sex and gender issues, society", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "contests and competitions, donald trump, females (demographic group), feminism, gender equality, miss america, pageants, political figures - us, population and demographics, scandals, sex and gender issues, society", "author": "Chloe Melas", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518480000.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
