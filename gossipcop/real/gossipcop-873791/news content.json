Earlier this summer, Teigen joined her husband on stage during a concert and suffered a wardrobe malfunction that would have left anyone else red-faced and embarrassed \u2014 but not those two.\n\nTeigen and Legend were bumping and grinding onstage while Legend sang his hit \"Slow Dance\" when Teigen's black floor-length dress moved, revealing one of her breasts. The couple laughed it off and didn't miss a beat.\n\nIt's clear that no matter the awkward situation, Legend's soulful voice will always be the star of the show.", "images": ["https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"], "top_img": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/john-legend-alicia-keys-carpool-karaoke-james-corden/", "title": "John Legend Sings About 4-Hour Long Erections on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "meta_data": {"description": "As James Corden puts it, John Legend could sing about anything and make it sound beautiful \u2014 and [...]", "keywords": "James Corden,Alicia Keys,John Legend,Carpool Karaoke", "news_keywords": "James Corden,Alicia Keys,John Legend,Carpool Karaoke", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "PopCulture", "creator": "PopCulture", "title": "John Legend Sings About 4-Hour Long Erections on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "description": "As James Corden puts it, John Legend could sing about anything and make it sound beautiful \u2014 and [...]", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200"}, "og": {"title": "John Legend Sings About 4-Hour Long Erections on 'Carpool Karaoke'", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/john-legend-alicia-keys-carpool-karaoke-james-corden/", "image": {"identifier": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/27/14024377-87b5-44da-926d-abcee03cd657/default-1.png?width=1200", "width": 640, "height": 320}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "As James Corden puts it, John Legend could sing about anything and make it sound beautiful \u2014 and [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#263240", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/tB-4fTz5DD8"], "publish_date": 1502838000.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
