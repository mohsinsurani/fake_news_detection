And, we weren\u2019t wrong.\n\nThe first trailer, narrated by Poirot, introduces us to \u201ca tangle of strangers, pressed together for days with nothing in common, but the need to go from one place to the other.\u201d We get a fleeting glimpse of some of the key characters aboard the train. When it comes to a screeching halt, we discover there\u2019s been a murder\u2026\n\nWe briefly saw Johnny Depp in that trailer, lollygagging in the train hallway, but we didn\u2019t learn his role, nor did we hear him speak. But, that\u2019s all about to change with the new trailer. Depp\u2019s character introduces himself to Poirot, saying, \u201cYou\u2019re the world-famous detective. Avenger of the innocent, is that what they call you in the papers?\u201d And, who is this gentleman across from the detective? That\u2019ll be Edward Ratchett, a.k.a, The Gangster.\n\nPoirot asks him, \u201cAre you one of the innocents?\u201d You can check out his cheeky response below:\n\nNow that we\u2019ve met the main characters \u2014 The Professor (Willem Dafoe), The Butler (Derek Jacobi), The Assistant (Josh Gad), The Count (Sergei Polunin), The Governess (Daisy Ridley), The Missionary (Pen\u00e9lope Cruz), The Widow (Michelle Pfeiffer), The Salesman (Michelle Pfeiffer), The Maid (Olivia Colman), The Doctor (Leslie Odom Jr.), The Princess (Dame Judi Dench), and, now, The Gangster (Johnny Depp) \u2014 it\u2019s apparent that everyone is a suspect\u2026 and everyone has a past.\n\nIt\u2019s not quite clear who lost his life on this fateful train ride; we may have to wait until November 10, when the film hits theaters, to find out.\n\nThe murderer is on the train \u2014 who do you think it is? If you know from the book\u2026 please no spoilers!", "images":
