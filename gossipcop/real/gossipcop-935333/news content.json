Of course, they soon wanted to know who was behind the mask, and they were in for quite a shock once they realized who that person actually was.\n\nMayhem ensued once the judges realized that the person behind the mask was the Ryan Reynolds, and to be honest, we\u2019d have the same reaction if we got serenaded by Reynolds.\n\nWatch Reynolds perform \u201cTomorrow\u201d:\n\nWatch the crowd reaction once his identity is revealed:\n\nWe know from previous trailers of the forthcoming Deadpool movie, after saving the world from the evils of gluten, Wilson has a bigger problem to face: A mutant soldier, Cable (Josh Brolin), has kidnapped a boy. Realizing he can\u2019t do it on his own, he enlists the help of a new epic team that he\u2019s named the \u201cX-Force.\u201d\n\nWith the addition of the new soundtrack, we\u2019re even more excited for the new film considering the first Deadpool became the highest grossing rated R film when it hit theaters in 2016. We\u2019re not sure if Wade Wilson and his new team could beat their previous record for highest-grossing rated R film again, but we\u2019re excited to see him attempt.\n\nBe sure to catch Deadpool 2 when it hits theaters May 18.\n\nWatch more: Escape The Fate share which songs, artists they just can\u2019t listen to anymore", "images": ["https://townsquare.media/site/1096/files/2022/06/attachment-ap-logo-v1.png", "https://townsquare.media/site/1096/files/2018/07/ryan_reynolds_south_korea_game_show.jpg?w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/1096/files/2018/07/ryan_reynolds_south_korea_game_show.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/1096/files/2018/07/ryan_reynolds_south_korea_game_show.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Beth Casteel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.altpress.com/ryan_reynolds_south_korean_tv_unicorn/", "title": "Watch Ryan Reynolds sing on a South Korean TV show disguised as a unicorn", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "altpress", "description": "The highly anticipated release of Deadpool 2 is quickly approaching, and prior to the film\u2019s release, Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds has taken on some", "keywords": "deadpool,ryan reynolds,news", "fb": {"app_id": 134615943276794, "admins": 100002025987268, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "false", "pages": 19886835651}, "og": {"title": "Watch Ryan Reynolds sing on a South Korean TV show disguised as a unicorn", "description": "The highly anticipated release of Deadpool 2 is quickly approaching, and prior to the film\u2019s release, Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds has taken on some", "url": "https://www.altpress.com/ryan_reynolds_south_korean_tv_unicorn/", "site_name": "Alternative Press Magazine", "type": "article", "image": "https://townsquare.media/site/1096/files/2018/07/ryan_reynolds_south_korea_game_show.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@altpress"}, "sailthru.description": "The highly anticipated release of Deadpool 2 is quickly approaching, and prior to the film\u2019s release, Deadpool star Ryan Reynolds has taken on some", "sailthru.date": "2018-05-14 19:39:00", "sailthru.title": "Watch Ryan Reynolds sing on a South Korean TV show disguised as a unicorn", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-altpressmag, tsmmarket-townsquaremedia, tsmtype-partner, deadpool, ryan-reynolds, news", "sailthru.author": "beth-casteel", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/1096/files/2018/07/ryan_reynolds_south_korea_game_show.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/1096/files/2018/07/ryan_reynolds_south_korea_game_show.jpg", "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526323140.0, "source": "https://www.altpress.com", "summary": ""}
