The Demogorgon of the first chapter makes way for the \"Shadow Monster\" born in Will's \"PTSD-like visions of\" his season one experience. Speaking about the new run of episodes, co-creator Ross Duffer of the Duffer Brothers previously said: \u201cIt\u2019s all connected to this singular threat, which is tied into this shape that Will sees in the sky.\"\n\nIn the final Stranger Things 2 trailer the stakes keep rising, as the survivors of season one face the horrors from their nightmares as they creep into reality. Eleven has no choice but to return.\n\nThe Duffer Brothers revealed that the forthcoming season acts as a \"movie sequel\" to the first instalment with the marketing campaign branding the new episodes as Stranger Things 2, as opposed to Stranger Things season 2.\n\nTV preview 2018: Everything to look out for Show all 16 1 /16 TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for Jessica Jones Starring:\u200b Krysten Ritter, Rachael Taylor, Carrie-Anne Moss, David Tennant Start date: 8 March, Netflix Netflix TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for The OA Starring: Brit Marling, Emory Cohen, Phyllis Smith, Patrick Gibson, Jason Isaacs Start date: 15 March, Netflix TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for Trust Starring:Hilary Swank, Brendan Fraser, Donald Sutherland, Harris Dickinson, Anna Chancellor Start date: 25 March 2018, AMC (Sky Atlantic air date TBA) FX Productions TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for A Series of Unfortunate Events Starring: Neil Patrick Harris, Malina Weissman, Patrick Warburton, Lucy Punch, Tony Hale, Nathan Fillion Start date: 30 March, Netflix TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for Atlanta Robbin Starring: Neil Patrick Harris, Malina Weissman, Patrick Warburton, Lucy Punch, Tony Hale, Nathan Fillion Start date: 30 March, FOX (UK air date TBA) Matthias Clamer/FX TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for Legion Starring: Dan Stevens, Rachel Keller, Aubrey Plaza, Jean Smart, Jemaine Clement Start date: 17 April, FOX 20th Television TV preview 2018: Everything to look out for The Alienist Starring: Daniel Br\u00fchl, Luke Evans, Dakota Fanning, Brian Geraghty Start date: 19 April, Netflix Warner Bros.
