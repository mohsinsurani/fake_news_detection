That's part of body shaming,\" she added.\n\nShe also added that she cannot understand how people can hide behind their social media accounts and tell another person that their feelings are not valid and should be considered as \"whining\" just because they believe that the other person already showed the ideal shape or figure. In another series of tweets, Reinhart said that she was sad to see other people blatantly tell her what she feels. \"Feeling really disheartened by the fact that so many people are saying 'you're skinny so shut up about embrscing [SIC] your body.' As if my body dysmorphia is irrelevant because of how I look to some people. I'm either not curvy enough or not skinny enough to feel insecure,\" the actress, who is known for portraying the role of Betty Cooper in \"Riverdale,\" stated in her post.\n\nMayo Clinic described body dysmorphic disorder as a mental disorder which makes a person believe that there are one or more flaws in their appearance even if others could not see it.\n\nThe actress then appealed to her followers to show more respect to others.", "images": ["https://cdn.christianpost.com/files/cache/image/14/64/146421_a_66_66.jpg",
