Fans saw the two hit a turning point after Logan told Brittany Cartwright\u2018s sister he was hooking up with James \u2014 who adamantly denied their romantic involvement \u2014 and confessed he was in love with the DJ even though James was (and is still) dating Raquel Leviss. Now, Logan is opening up to In Touch exclusively about how the alteration made their friendship go south.\n\nLogan first met a bunch of the SURvers during the opening party of Lisa Vanderpump\u2019s restaurant, PUMP, roughly four years ago. He started frequenting the Cali-based hot spot, and one night, James introduced himself while he was DJing. \u201cWe immediately hit it off and ended up having a great night and basically became best friends that night,\u201d Logan recalled. \u201cWe basically spent every day together for the next four years and have been best friends ever since.\u201d\n\nThings started to change when Logan was asked to film for the Bravo reality series James was a part of, thinking it would be a \u201cfun experience\u201d and allow the two to spend more time together. But after Logan sparked hookup speculation, James called the art director on speakerphone \u2014 with the cameras rolling \u2014 to \u201cshut down the rumors immediately.\u201d Since James was displeased with his pal and his cast members had varying opinions on whether or not the hookup even took place, Logan decided it was time to step back.\n\n\u201cMy drunken talk with Brittany\u2019s sister happened off camera and I never intended to make things more dramatic on camera,\u201d Logan continued. \u201cOnce I did the phone call, I decided to leave the show for a while because I wanted to have everything die down a little.\u201d\n\nThe former friends were able to patch things up around production time, though their relationship grew tense again once Season 6 started airing on television. Today, they keep things civil when they run into each other, though it doesn\u2019t sound like we\u2019ll be seeing these two getting drinks together anytime soon.\n\n\u201cHe has shown recently that he has zero interest in maturing and treating his friends with respect, so like most people around him currently I have washed my hands of his toxic behavior and want nothing to do with him,\u201d Logan shared. We can only hope to learn more about what happened during the upcoming three-part reunion.\n\nFor more exclusive content, sign up for our In Touch newsletter!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-noh-james-kennedy-friendship-vanderpump-rules.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-noh-james-kennedy-friendship-vanderpump-rules.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/logan-noh-james-kennedy-friendship-vanderpump-rules.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amber Belus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/james-kennedy-logan-noh-relationship-vanderpump-rules-159285/", "title": "Vanderpump Rules Pals Logan Noh and James Kennedy on the Outs After Season 6", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "It was tough to watch the fallout between James Kennedy and his gay bestie, Logan Noh, on Season 6 of Vanderpump Rules.
