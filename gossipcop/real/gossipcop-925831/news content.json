And, in particular, she has the most relatable thoughts about Channing Tatum and Jenna Dewan's breakup, which might make you cry a little less.\n\nRelated Story Best Tweets About Channing and Jenna's Separation\n\nSpeaking to E! at a This Bar Saves Lives event, Bell revealed, \"We're not looking at the whole picture when we sort of idolize the relationship. Like those two, that may be a better path for both of them, and they're both lovely people, and they're still friends, and that's okay.\"\n\nAs Tatum and Dewan's joint statement made clear, the love they have for one another hasn't gone, but their relationship has changed:\n\nAnd Bell thinks it's time the world accepted that not all relationships are forever, and that sometimes that's for the best. She told E!:\n\n\"It's okay to feel like, I went through 10 years with you, I love you and now I feel like I want something different and so do you. Like it doesn't have to be a heartbreak, I guess is what I mean. It could actually be the healthiest thing for both individuals to thrive and it could also be the best example for your kids.\"\n\n\n\nBut as for whether her and husband Dax Shepard will ever split, Bell thinks it's unlikely. She revealed:\n\n\"We're in too deep and I like him too much. Even when he's annoying I really like him. I'm still like, 'I still wanna be on the porch with you when I'm 80, but I really need you to get out of my face right now.'\"\n\nRelated Story Channing Tatum Makes Statement on Split Rumors",
