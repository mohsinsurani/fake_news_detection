Kendall Jenner serves as the leading lady in Fergie\u2019s epic new music video for, \u2018Enchant\u00e9 (Carine).\u2019 Even better, Fergie\u2019s son Axl sings in French on the catchy track released Sept. 22! Prepare to be wowed!\n\nWhile Fergie\u2018s, 42, new album Double Dutchess is full of sure-to-be hits, one of her coolest tracks to date is her song \u201cEnchant\u00e9 (Carine).\u201d The singer dropped the highly anticipated music video for the single today, starring none other than Kendall Jenner, 21. The model channels Sleeping Beauty while waking up from a snooze, serving up all sorts of fierceness while debuting a plethora of glamorous looks. Fergie\u2019s song adorably features vocals by her and Josh Duhamel\u2018s, 44, four-year-old son Axl Jack Duhamel. And not only does little Axl sing his heart out not once, but twice on the catchy track, he sings in a different language! Axl starts the entire song off with a bang by sweetly singing in French, and his cute little voice has totally melted our hearts. Click here to see pics from Fergie\u2019s \u201cLike It Ain\u2019t Nuttin\u201d music video.\n\nAxl sings the below lyrics, which loosely translate to: \u201cNice to meet you, it\u2019s very nice.\u201d And while we know the youngster\u2019s only four, he sounds pretty darn good! Maybe we\u2019ve got a future singer on our hands? Fergie\u2019s little boy begins the song and then repeats his part about halfway through the track. We love how the star found a creative way to incorporate her son into her work \u2014 just like how JAY-Z, 47, had daughter Blue Ivy, 5, literally rap on HIS latest album.\n\nEnchante como ta le vu\n\nTres merci beaucoup\n\nEnchante como ta le vu\n\nTres bien merci beaucoup\n\nDouble Dutchess, which was released on Sept. 22, is the second studio album by Fergie, who used to be in the Black Eyed Peas. It\u2019s also a visual album! The work comes right on the heels of Fergie and Josh announcing on Sept. 14 that they have officially split after eight years of marriage. \u201cWith absolute love and respect we decided to separate as a couple earlier this year,\u201d they explained in a statement. \u201cTo give our family the best opportunity to adjust, we wanted to keep this a private matter before sharing it with the public. We are and will always be united in our support of each other and our family.\u201d\n\nListen to Axl sing above, and let us know what you think of his adorable voice! Is he the cutest or what?\n\nTell us, HollywoodLifers \u2014 are you a fan of Fergie\u2019s new album? What do you think of Axl on \u2018Enchant\u00e9 (Carine)\u2019?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/khloe-kardashian-screaming-day-kim-told-her-lamar-died-od-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/fergie-enchante-video-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/kylie-jenner-pregnant-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2017%2F09%2F22%2Ffergie-enchante-axl-jack-new-song-kendall-jenner-music-video%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=2795707", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/love-and-hip-hop-season-7-ftr1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/09/fergie-enchante-video-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper Samanthabenitz", "Kathleen Harper"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170923132321/http://hollywoodlife.com/2017/09/22/fergie-enchante-axl-jack-new-song-kendall-jenner-music-video/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Turns Up The Glam In Fergie\u2019s New Video For \u2018Enchant\u00e9\u2019 With Vocals By Axl", "meta_data": {"description": "Kendall Jenner is the leading lady in Fergie's new music video for 'Enchant\u00e9 (Carine).'
