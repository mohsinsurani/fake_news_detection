What is being a Backstreet Boy? It\u2019s wearing a fedora and dancing on some tarmac. I think I got it.\u201d\n\nFollowing Brian Littrell\u2019s insistence that Corden could not handle the costume changes, Corden let the members vote on whom he replaces. Corden then decided that he should take Littrell\u2019s place onstage. \u201cShow me the meaning of being lonely,\u201d Corden said, referencing another song off the album, as Littrell exited the dressing room.\n\nFollowing Littrell\u2019s forced departure, Corden tried to learn the choreography for the performance. He also took the liberty of suggesting new dance moves. When asked when he should do the worm, Howie Dorough responded, \u201cMaybe after the show.\u201d\n\nDespite resistance from the bandmembers, Corden eventually took on the role of choreographer and incorporated a number of new dance moves, including the band lifting him up during \u201cLarger Than Life.\u201d When they perfected the lift, Corden instructed, \u201cAnd then you guys disappear \u2019til the end of the song.\u201d\n\nNot only did Corden take over for the performance, but he also attended the band\u2019s meet and greet. When taking a group photo with a fan, Corden flipped the iPhone camera and instead took a selfie. He then blocked a fan in another photo.\n\nCorden led a prayer circle before he and the Backstreet Boys took the stage. \u201cDear Lord, heavenly Jesus. I know what you\u2019re thinking. What\u2019s Brian doing there? We\u2019re thinking the same,\u201d he said. \u201cMake us strong. Show us the meaning of being lonely. Quit playing games with out hearts. Give us the call and know that everybody.\u201d After a moment of silence, he added, \u201cI can\u2019t think of any other Backstreet Boys songs. We want it that way. We want it that way!\u201d\n\nThe sketch then cut to the performance, in which a photo of Littrell onstage was been replaced with one of Corden. The band then appeared and began to sing \u201cLarger Than Life\u201d while the musicians are suspended on platforms in the air. Littrell eventually joined the group onstage. Corden then ran to the front of the stage and showed off his best dance moves, including the running man and the worm, as the band sang behind him.\n\nThe performance concluded when Corden thanked fans for coming and told them to drive home safe. Richardson then explained that they had 22 more songs to perform. \u201cI quit the band,\u201d Corden responded before walking offstage.\n\nAmid the release of their new single \u201cDon\u2019t Go Breaking My Heart,\u201d the band is also headlining a Las Vegas residency, Backstreet Boys: Larger Than Life. This year, the group celebrated its 25th anniversary.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/111599_0076b2_copy_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/111599_0076b2_copy_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/backstreet-boys-james-corden-perform-late-late-show-larger-life-1129668/", "title": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden Perform Revamped Single \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The Backstreet Boys and James Corden performed a revamp of their 1999 single \"Larger Than Life\" during their appearance on CBS\u2019 'The Late Late Show' Tuesday night.", "news_keywords": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden, Late-Night TV, The Late Late Show", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1129668, "title": "Backstreet Boys, James Corden Perform Revamped Single \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d", "published_at": "2018-07-25 08:38:55", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/111599_0076b2_copy_0.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The Late Late Show", "topics": "TV News", "body": "The Backstreet Boys might have found a new member in James Corden \u2014 or so he hopes \u2014 as the late-night host performed alongside the boy band for a revamped version of their hit single during Tuesday night\u2019s Late Late Show.\u00a0\r\nJokingly promoting their new boy band, dubbed \u201cJames Street,\u201d group members Nick Carter, Howie Dorough, AJ McLean, Kevin Richardson and Brian Littrell performed an mock version of their 1999 single, \u201cLarger Than Life,\u201d changing it to \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d to reflect Corden\u2019s 12:37 p.m. broadcast.\u00a0\r\nPrior to their sketch, the band teased their appearance with their mock album cover with Corden on Twitter, where they created the hashtag \"#Jamesstreet.\" \u00a0\r\n\r\n\tFeaturing @JKCorden and the hit single, \u201cLate Late-r Than Life\u201d Tune into the @latelateshow tonight 12:37/11:37c on @CBS! #Jamesstreet #BSBVegas pic.twitter.com/VakeExuqUM\r\n\t\u2014 backstreetboys (@backstreetboys) July 24, 2018\r\nIn the performance, the late-night host and singers donned their signature white attire, recognizable from their 1999 album,\u00a0Millennium, which featured the \u201cLarger Than Life\u201d single.\r\nThe sketch opened with Corden explaining that he plans to take over for one of the Backstreet Boys at their performance later that night. \"Corden's back, alright,\" he sang to the bandmembers as he stated his plan.\r\nWhile Kevin Richardson explained to Corden that no one was going to opt out of the performance, the late-night host responded, \"How hard is it?
