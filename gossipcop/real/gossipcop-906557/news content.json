So why did Javi and Briana break up? Bri said their futures \u201cdidn\u2019t line up,\u201d and that explanation would have been frustratingly vague if she had stopped there. But then Bri got much more specific, saying he didn\u2019t approve of her going under the knife.\n\n\u201cJavi and I are not together anymore,\u201d Briana told Blasting News in January. \u201cOur future just doesn\u2019t line up. He doesn\u2019t want me to get my surgery for a breast lift, lipo, and tummy tuck \u2026 because it\u2019ll look bad on his name at work. Also, I don\u2019t plan on moving in with him in the summer, and for these reasons, he broke up with me.\u201d\n\nBriana elaborated even further, adding, \u201cI have no bad things to say to about him. He wanted a wife and home right now, and I didn\u2019t see a reason to rush. I wish him the best going forward, and I am sad things panned out this way, but this is where things currently stand. Again, we are no longer together.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, Javi\u2019s statement to Radar Online mostly corroborated Bri\u2019s version of events, though he did say the surgery itself \u201cwasn\u2019t the issue.\u201d He explained, \u201cSome questions about our futures couldn\u2019t be answered because we both do have kids and live two different lifestyles, her being in Florida and me in Delaware. I didn\u2019t agree with some of her future plans being exposed for the world to see for our future and any future employers, and I wish we could\u2019ve compromised. Maybe I was overthinking, but I couldn\u2019t figure out a way to answer some of those questions \u2026 Bri is an amazing person with the biggest heart I\u2019ve ever got to hold. Everything she goes through and she\u2019s still selfless and does her best to please others. She\u2019s got a bright future, and she\u2019ll make any guy feel special.\u201d\n\nAfter the breakup, fans thought Briana was pregnant with Javi\u2019s baby, but that speculation seems unfounded these days. In fact, Javi is about to be a father again now that new girlfriend Lauren Comeau is pregnant. And Bri is being gracious about that surprising news. \u201cI\u2019m happy for them,\u201d she told Us Weekly earlier this week. \u201cI wish them nothing but the best. All he wanted was a family, and he got it. So, good for him. Like I said, I\u2019m sending my best wishes and have no hard feelings.\u201d\n\nThe lady (and the Javi) doth protest too much, we think. It wouldn\u2019t be surprising at all if the breakup wasn\u2019t as amicable as they\u2019re making it out to be!", "images": ["https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/javi-and-briana.jpg?fit=400%2C225&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C225", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/why-did-javi-and-briana-break-up.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/why-did-javi-and-briana-break-up.jpg?resize=750%2C421&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Clarendon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.intouchweekly.com/posts/why-did-javi-and-briana-break-up-161103/", "title": "Why Did Javi and Briana Break Up?
