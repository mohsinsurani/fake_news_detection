How did you create such a big persona right out of the box?\n\nA: Kitty\u2019s not as prominent in the book as she is on the TV show. When I met Sarai Walker, I asked her about Kitty. It seemed like [Writer/Executive Producer] Marti [Noxon] was very specific in how she wanted to cast Kitty, and she was very specific in how she was writing Kitty, but it didn\u2019t seem to be as big an issue in the book. I asked Sarai what her idea was when she was writing Kitty. She told me she\u2019s actually based on a real-life person and that the first character she wrote in the book was Kitty because it had the most profound effect on her in her life. What I wanted to do, most of all, was not make her an Anna Wintour or Glenda Bailey or Grace Coddington. Even though I read everything I could on them, I wanted to fit her into this world that Plum is living in and weigh the balance of what Plum is going through with the balance of what Kitty is going through. Her world is so completely superficial. She\u2019s always posing. She has to be picture perfect as if she were in a photoshoot. You\u2019ll see over the course of the ten episodes that when she forgets herself and gets emotionally involved, it goes away. It\u2019s very uncomfortable, let me tell you. [Laughs]\n\nQ: Had you read the book before signing on for the project?\n\nA: The first time I heard about it was from Marti herself. I read the book right after I read the first five scripts. I was really impressed with how true to the book it was. I think the real weight falls on Marti and on Joy [Nash] because the writing of the book and the main character are so rich. If we didn\u2019t replicate the rich life that the book has for Plum Kettle and the world you enter in the book, it really wouldn\u2019t do the book justice. Sometimes the stars just align with the right casting. Marti and Joy really nailed it. I cannot imagine another person in Plum Kettle\u2019s shoes than Joy Nash, honestly.\n\nQ: Although she\u2019s so self-involved, she does keep referring to \u201cher girls.\u201d What do they represent to her?\n\nA: She\u2019s very proud of her girls. She calls them her girls because she feels that she\u2019s created them and given them a platform. It\u2019s quite hypocritical, really, because what she\u2019s done \u2013 in her Kitty way \u2013 is create this false narrative within the magazine industry. Everyone in her magazine looks perfect, but she\u2019s opened up a venue for these girls to write letters and ask advice to become these perfect people. In Kitty\u2019s world, Kitty is perfect \u2013 except for the fact that she\u2019s aging, which kills her. She had the smarts to hire someone like Plum Kettle, who can answer these letters much better than she can. She actually found an overweight girl who can see the world the same way her girls see the world.\n\nQ: Kitty has risen to the top with Daisy Chain at Austin Media. How would you describe what she\u2019s up against and how that might shape her character?\n\nA: Smiling and being polite and saying \u201cyes sir\u201d or \u201cno sir,\u201d knowing that she was ten times better than any of the men at her job \u2013 I think that\u2019s what a lot of women face at any job. I equate it to Ginger Rogers in that she had to do exactly what Fred Astaire was doing but backward and in high heels. That\u2019s what women do in the workplace. We\u2019re constantly tap dancing backward in high heels to prove ourselves.\n\nQ: In Episode 2, Kitty denies Plum the chance to attend the plus-size fashion show. What\u2019s the underlying dynamic at play between these two?\n\nA: I think Kitty is truly aghast at what Plum looks like. They\u2019re selling makeup and diets and how to be a perfect woman, which means you\u2019re a size two, and you have flawless skin. When you first meet Kitty, and she sees Plum and says, \u201cI always forget how beautiful your eyes are,\u201d what she wants to say is, \u201cI always forget how fat you are.\u201d Kitty realizes she can cash in on the plus-size revolution, but god forbid Plum represents the magazine. That would never happen. Plum Kettle is the antithesis of Daisy Chain.\n\nQ: What was it like filming in that huge beauty closet? Any behind-the-scenes details of how it all came together?\n\nA: That beauty closet is like me in a candy store. [Laughs] I was testing everything I could. My hands were so soft while we were filming! I\u2019d actually never seen one, and I didn\u2019t realize they actually exist. I was stunned. You feel like if you stayed there, you would always come out dewy and soft. It\u2019s remarkable, but it also makes you realize what a crock of sh-t it all is.\n\nQ: What do you hope people connect to the most? What do you hope the show changes about any current narratives?\n\nA: I think the character of Plum Kettle is going to change women\u2019s lives. You start with a character who is waiting for her life to start once she becomes a certain size and what Plum develops into is a person who realizes life can start right now. To give that kind of confidence to young women in a world that is so judgmental and so critical of every single thing on a woman\u2019s body, of the way they talk, of the way they think, of the way they\u2019re supposed to act \u2013 I think that this show is actually really enlightening for so many women across the board. And I don\u2019t just think it\u2019s overweight women. I think it\u2019s all of us. We all have our hang-ups. Everyone thinks someone else\u2019s life is better. Your life started the day you were born. Isn\u2019t that good enough?\n\nI feel like this show is going to fire some people up. Even though this book came out in 2015, it could not be more timely. It\u2019s bizarre for me, having come from a show wherein we kept wondering if year after year it was going to stay relevant and year after year, yet another politician was caught with his pants down. It\u2019s the same thing now. Every month, it\u2019s another high-profile person who has abused their use of power. I feel incredibly fortunate that I keep getting led to these on-topic moments that sustain themselves through time because until we talk about it, it\u2019s just not going to change.\n\nRead an interview with Joy Nash, who plays Plum.\n\nDietland airs Mondays at 9/8c.
