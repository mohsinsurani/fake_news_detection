She beat out SZA, Julia Michaels, Khalid and Lil Uzi Vert for the honor.\n\nComing into tonight, the singer was up for four prizes in her first year at the Grammys\u2014Best New Artist, Song of the Year, Best Short Form Music Video and Best Pop Duo/Group Performance.\n\nShe first broke into the mainstream with her debut single \u201cHere,\u201d which took its time reaching its No. 5 peak in America. Not long after that song performed well, her debut full-length Know-It-All was released, and it managed to start inside the top 10 in the U.S. She went on to send another single from the record, \u201cScars To Your Beautiful,\u201d to the top 10, and her Zedd collaboration \u201cStay\u201d also broke into the region.\n\nWhile she is clearly one of the most talented and promising young musicians out there, it is odd that Cara was nominated at all, given the tight restrictions that govern what year artists can be up for this trophy. Since her debut album (the one that made her well-known to the public) was released in November 2015, she should have been eligible for Best New Artist at the 2017 Grammys, where she wasn\u2019t nominated for anything. That controversy was seemingly never addressed by the Academy, though there may be some questions now that she has not only been nominated, but has taken the gold.\n\nWhile all five names nominated this time around have contributed to popular culture and proven themselves to be incredibly talented individuals, Cara\u2019s win is deserved, and it\u2019s difficult to argue against the Academy\u2019s decision, difficult as it must have been to make.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034002im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F910379626%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034002im_/https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/853c59789c520784fcfecc68c6c34217?s=400&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034002im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F910379626%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hugh Mcintyre"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034002/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/01/28/grammys-2018-alessia-cara-is-the-best-new-artist/", "title": "Grammys 2018: Alessia Cara Is The Best New Artist", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Grammys 2018: Alessia Cara Is The Best New Artist", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034002im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F910379626%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "updated_time": "2018-01-28T19:57:51-05:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034002/https://www.forbes.com/sites/hughmcintyre/2018/01/28/grammys-2018-alessia-cara-is-the-best-new-artist/", "description": "Alessia Cara has beaten four other musicians for the only Grammy offered to performers just once in their careers.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Grammys 2018: Alessia Cara Is The Best New Artist", "description": "Alessia Cara has beaten four other musicians for the only Grammy offered to performers just once in their careers.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180129034002im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fspecials-images.forbesimg.com%2Fdam%2Fimageserve%2F910379626%2F960x0.jpg%3Ffit%3Dscale", "creator": "@hughmcintyre"}, "description": "Alessia Cara has beaten four other musicians for the only Grammy offered to performers just once in their careers.", "author": "Hugh McIntyre", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Hugh McIntyre", "section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/business/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/3113-24917", "published": "2018-01-29", "modified": "2018-01-29"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517097600.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
