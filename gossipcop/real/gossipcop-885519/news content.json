They know me. I assure you I will be vindicated. And I assure you, I will pursue every legal option to address this defaming claim. Thank you \u2014 Nelly_Mo (@Nelly_Mo) October 7, 2017\n\nRosenblum, the attorney, said the \u201callegation is devoid of credibility and is motivated by greed and vindictiveness.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am confident, once this scurrilous accusation is thoroughly investigated, there will be no charges,\u201d Rosenblum said in a statement. \u201cNelly is prepared to address and pursue all legal avenues to redress any damage caused by this clearly false allegation.\u201d\n\nNelly was scheduled to perform a concert in Ridgefield, Washington on Saturday, but he did not attend the show.\n\nRosenblum told CNN via text message that he expects Nelly will be able to make his next scheduled concert, which is slated for October 12 in Jacksonville, Florida.\n\nNelly was once one of the reigning kings of hip-hop. He shot to fame nearly 20 years ago with the track \u201cCountry Grammar.\u201d\n\nDuring the height of his career, he won three Grammy awards and regularly appeared on the Billboard 200.\n\nThe rapper has had previous run-ins with the law.
