In order to get into arrow-shooting, rock-climbing, butt-kicking shape like her impressive and adventurous video game counterpart Lara Croft, Vikander underwent a grueling exercise routine and dietary program with super-trainer Magnus Lygdback. The fellow Swedes worked together for months in order to add 16 pounds of muscle to the 5\u2032 5\u2033 Oscar-winner\u2019s slender frame. Sound like something you\u2019d like to do? Well, get ready to pay the price for those gains.\n\nTHR chatted with Lygdback to get the inside scoop on his workout routine, dietary regimen, and the program he put Vikander through for the role. Her training included \u201cmixed martial arts, rock climbing and archery\u201d to craft \u201ca modern Lara Croft, a strong, independent woman, and I think it\u2019s exactly what the world needs right now,\u201d said Lygdback. Vikander also brought her own ballet training to her character, all the better to scale cliff faces, make death-defying leaps, and take out a multitude of bad guys. So far, so good!\n\nHere\u2019s the tough part: Plan on spending seven days a week in the gym and cutting back on all sugar, eliminating most \u201cfast\u201d carbs, and eating every three hours. How\u2019d Vikander handle all this? \u201cAlicia is an amazingly hard worker,\u201d says Lygdback. \u201cThe hardest part for her was when I would force her to take a day off to recover.\u201d If you\u2019re inclined to check out Magnus\u2019 workouts and Vikander\u2019s fitness-focused food plan, be sure to head over to THR for the full rundown. It ain\u2019t easy, but the next time you\u2019re impressed by celebrity physiques on the big and small screens, just remember the amount of time, effort, and sacrifice that goes into them.\n\nAnd for more on Tomb Raider, be sure to check out our recent write-ups below:", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-01/02/5a4bedccd991ce755acdea46/5a4bedccd991ce755acdea47_o_U_v0.jpg?w=160&h=90", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://img.vidible.tv/prod/2017-12/08/5a0a8227c9f41404aab6cb4c/5a2afe78ef66945f52b35d92_o_U_v3.jpg?w=160&h=90", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/gallery/featured-thumbs-j/justice-league-the-flash.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/Collider_Logo_Light.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/themes/collider-v3/images/Collider_Logo_Dark.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://socialtrack.co/p", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/gallery/featured-thumbs-t/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/gallery/featured-thumbs-s/solo-a-star-wars-story-logo.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/tomb-raider-slice-600x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://img.vidible.tv/prod/2018-01/02/5a4bdf9124ef7875aaad6387/5a4bdf9124ef7875aaad6388_o_U_v0.jpg?w=160&h=90", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/gallery/featured-thumbs-j/head-1_11.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander-magnus-lygdback-600x338.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1628636477376373&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/gallery/featured-thumbs-a/head-avatar.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/movie-talk-deadpool-2-slice-500x167.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641im_/http://cdn.collider.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tomb-raider-alicia-vikander.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dave Trumbore"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180117003641/http://collider.com/tomb-raider-lara-croft-alicia-vikander-diet-workout-routine/", "title": "Want to Get in \u2018Tomb Raider\u2019 Shape Like Alicia Vikander?
