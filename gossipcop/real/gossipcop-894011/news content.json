Going to sleep alone kills me,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I don\u2019t know what that feels like: Being in a big empty house, and the footsteps echoing through the hallway, no one there \u2014 and no one on the pillow next to you. F\u2014. How do you make yourself happy in a situation like that?\u201d", "images":
