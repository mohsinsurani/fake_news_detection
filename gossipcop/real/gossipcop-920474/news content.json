Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik are going their separate ways after dating for seven months. Us Weekly Video takes a look back at their short-lived romance \u2014 from their adorable social media snaps to their head-turning red carpet debut. Grab a tissue and take a walk down memory lane with the video above.\n\nThe Victoria\u2019s Secret model, 21, and Malik, 23, first sparked dating rumors last November. The pair rarely spoke about their relationship publicly but didn\u2019t hide it either. Some of their more memorable moments together include a sexy May fashion spread in Vogue and a cameo from Hadid in Zayn\u2019s \u201cPillowtalk\u201d music video. (Cue the makeout session!)\n\nMore recently, the young stars coordinated in Tommy Hilfiger outfits at the Metropolitan Museum of Art\u2019s Costume Institute Gala in NYC in May. The lovebirds abided by the futuristic theme: \u201cManus x Machina: Fashion in an Age of Technology.\u201d\n\nHadid and Malik have yet to comment on their breakup. Hadid last posted about the hunky Brit when she posted a throwback selfie of the two on May 20. \u201cMissing you,\u201d she wrote.\n\nFor more on the exes, watch the video above to relive their sweetest moments!", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/527516094_zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-zoom-bbadf19a-927f-477a-a91f-81a153acc236.jpg?crop=75px%2C1px%2C1977px%2C1037px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/527516094_zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-zoom-bbadf19a-927f-477a-a91f-81a153acc236.jpg?crop=75px%2C1px%2C1977px%2C1037px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/gigi-hadid-and-zayn-malik-split-look-back-at-their-relationship-w208758/", "title": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Split: Look Back at Their Relationship", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have split after seven months of dating \u2014 look back at their sweet, short-lived romance with Us Weekly Video", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Look Back at Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik's Short-Lived Romance", "description": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have split after seven months of dating \u2014 look back at their sweet, short-lived romance with Us Weekly Video", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/gigi-hadid-and-zayn-malik-split-look-back-at-their-relationship-w208758/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-09T00:23:04+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/527516094_zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-zoom-bbadf19a-927f-477a-a91f-81a153acc236.jpg?crop=75px%2C1px%2C1977px%2C1037px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/527516094_zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-zoom-bbadf19a-927f-477a-a91f-81a153acc236.jpg?crop=75px%2C1px%2C1977px%2C1037px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2016-06-03T17:46:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-09T00:23:04+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Look Back at Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik's Short-Lived Romance", "description": "Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik have split after seven months of dating \u2014 look back at their sweet, short-lived romance with Us Weekly Video", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/527516094_zayn-malik-gigi-hadid-zoom-bbadf19a-927f-477a-a91f-81a153acc236.jpg?crop=75px%2C1px%2C1977px%2C1037px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1464975960.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
