Turns out at least one-third of those rumors that Harry Styles, Katy Perry and Taylor Swift would all perform proved to be correct. Let\u2019s break it down!\n\nHarry Styles: you know who Harry Styles is! The former One Direction member, star of Dunkirk and ex-paramour of many a Victoria\u2019s Secret catwalker (Kendall, Taylor\u2026) was rumored to be in the running for the headlining spot after the positive reception to his first solo album. Fans have already demanded that he wear wings.\n\nLeslie Odom, Jr: he won a Tony for his role as Aaron Burr in the smash-hit musical Hamilton and has since then released two albums (a Jazz record and a collection of Christmas songs). You might also recognize him from Nationwide commercials. He\u2019s great.\n\nMiguel: a Grammy-winning singer-songwriter who incorporates a range of styles into his music. His soulful, bedroom-playlist worthy are also particularly apt for a lingerie fashion show. Surely you\u2019ve heard \u201cAdorn\u201d by now.\n\nJane Zhang: After winning third place on a Chinese TV singing competition, Zhang has gone on to national pop stardom and gained notoriety for singing in something called the \u201cwhistle register.\u201d No idea what that is but maybe we\u2019ll find out at the show?\n\n\u201cWe are incredibly thrilled to have [these performers] with us,\u201d Ed Razek, executive producer of the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show told People.\n\nFor those keeping tabs, this means that the four performers mentioned have all been cleared by the Chinese government (although Zhang, being a resident of China, presumably had no problem getting around the country). A handful of models, plus would-be performer Katy Perry, were recently denied entry because of social media posts that could be construed in ways the Chinese government doesn\u2019t like. And for unknown reasons, model Gigi Hadid (girlfriend of Zayn Malik, another former One Direction member) won\u2019t be there, either.\n\nBut who cares! Harry Styles is performing!\n\nRelated: Gigi Hadid and Zayn Malik Celebrated Their Two-Year Anniversary With a PDA-Filled Instagram", "images":
