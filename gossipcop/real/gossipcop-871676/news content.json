Earlier this week, Barbara held a birthday party for Jace and didn't invite Jenelle, which the reality TV star said really hurt her son's feelings. The now 8-year-old has been stuck in the middle of a bitter custody battle between Jenelle and her mother since she gave up custody of him as a 17-year-old. The young mother was ill-prepared to care for him, but feels that she should have him back now, though the courts, unfortunately, don't agree.\n\nRival birthday parties for Jace\n\nThe women have been using Jace as a pawn to act out their resentment for one another, and his 8th birthday party was, unfortunately, no different. Barbara threw Jace what appeared to be a Hulk-themed birthday party at a children's center. Jace attends school near Barbara, and several of his friends were photographed smiling as he sat on a Hulk throne with several young boys grinning. The young boy is rather subdued when he does appear on \"Teen Mom 2\" and appears no different in the photos. Jenelle maintains that she tries to keep the fights with her mother away from Jace, but viewers of the show know that this is not the case. The mother of three is often fighting with Barbara in front of her son, and sometimes even refuses to appear on camera.\n\nHowever, Jenelle has stated that she wants both women to have equal footing in his life, despite the fact that her actions seem to point to the contrary.\n\nBarbara not invited to her wedding, either\n\nAlthough Jenelle claims that Jace was hurt over the fact that his mother was not invited to the birthday party his grandmother threw for him, Jenelle decided not to invite Barbara to her own wedding.\n\nShe claims it is because she won't \"give Jace back,\" but unfortunately for Barbara, it isn't necessarily an easy thing to do. Jace has been living with Barbara for the majority of his life and is settled into school and Scouting activities where Barbara lives. The court decided that Jenelle should legally have time with her son, but have not yet agreed that she is entitled to primary custody. This has, no doubt, enraged Jenelle, who feels that this is all Barb's fault. So, for now, the pair will continue to feud over Jace, giving him dual birthday parties as a way to snip at one another.\n\nWhat do you think of the custody situation?", "images": ["https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/7/660x290/b_502x220x75/jenelle-evans-source-mtvyoutube_1493107.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/7/660x290/b_1200x630x75/jenelle-evans-source-mtvyoutube_1493107.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/0/638/profile_638977_1468627419.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/4/316/profile_4316875_1487986521.jpg"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/7/660x290/b_1200x630x75/jenelle-evans-source-mtvyoutube_1493107.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Fiona Miller", "'Counting On' Reportedly Confirmed For A New Season", "'Teen Mom Star Adam Lind Is Behind Bars Again", "Josh Duggar Wins His Stolen Photo Lawsuit"], "canonical_link": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/08/jenelle-evans-throws-birthday-bash-for-her-eldest-son-jace-001911931.html", "title": "Jenelle Evans throws birthday bash for her eldest son Jace", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, user-scalable=0", "description": "The 'Teen Mom 2' star's mother was not invited to the party for her son.", "news_keywords": "Jenelle Evans, Jace", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956, "pages": 556225464427184}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Blasting News", "url": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/08/jenelle-evans-throws-birthday-bash-for-her-eldest-son-jace-001911931.html", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Jenelle Evans throws birthday bash for her eldest son Jace", "image": {"identifier": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/7/660x290/b_1200x630x75/jenelle-evans-source-mtvyoutube_1493107.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Jenelle Evans--Source MTV/YouTube"}, "description": "The 'Teen Mom 2' star's mother was not invited to the party for her son.", "determiner": "auto", "rich_attachment": "true"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BlastingNews/", "section": "Showbiz & Tv", "published_time": "2017-08-06T18:48:02-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Jenelle Evans throws birthday bash for her eldest son Jace", "image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/7/660x290/b_1200x630x75/jenelle-evans-source-mtvyoutube_1493107.jpg", "description": "The 'Teen Mom 2' star's mother was not invited to the party for her son....", "url": "https://goo.gl/H2pTFL", "site": "@BlastingNews", "creator": "@BlastingNews"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502059682.0, "source": "https://us.blastingnews.com", "summary": ""}
