That happily ever after witnessed in the 2003 Dawson\u2019s Creek finale may not have lasted after all. The finale revealed that Joey (Katie Holmes) chose Pacey (Joshua Jackson) and the two were living together in New York. Meanwhile, in Hollywood, Dawson (James Van Der Beek) had become a successful director and finally secured a meeting with his idol, Steven Spielberg.\n\nSo what would happen next, if creator Kevin Williamson was to bring back the series today?\n\n\u201cI think Pacey and Joey got married. I think they had a family, I think there were troubles. I think they got a divorce,\u201d the writer and producer told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cI think that when we meet them they\u2019re in a very dark place. But there\u2019s still something between them that forces them to come together and raise their children. As they seek out happiness with others, they just keep coming back to each other. And they just can\u2019t stop that magical thing that exists between them and that bond they have. I think we would sort of have to watch them fall in love all over again as middle-aged adults.\u201d\n\nHe also gave an update on where Dawson would be \u2014 and apparently that meeting with Spielberg didn\u2019t go too well.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m a man of conflict. I would want to, of course, show some conflict. I think Dawson became Spielberg, all his dreams came true. I think they shattered,\u201d Williamson said. \u201cI think he fell apart. I think he never really found love and, when we come upon him, he\u2019s just on the cusp of changing his whole life and finding the one thing that\u2019s going to make it magical.\u201d\n\nLuckily, fans will not see these heartbreaking story lines turn into reality. Williamson also revealed during the interview that he isn\u2019t interested in bringing the show back, but wouldn\u2019t mind watching a new writer take on the challenge. (Let\u2019s hope that writer is less about conflict!)\n\nVan Der Beek, Jackson and Holmes were joined by Michelle Williams, Busy Phillips, Meredith Monroe, Kerr Smith and Mary Beth Peil for a full 20th anniversary reunion.\n\nDawson\u2019s Creek is currently streaming on Hulu.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/katie-holmes-joshua-jackson-dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1282px%2C674px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/katie-holmes-joshua-jackson-dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1282px%2C725px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/katie-holmes-joshua-jackson-dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1282px%2C674px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/dawsons-creek-boss-joey-and-pacey-would-be-divorced-today/", "title": "\u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 Boss: Joey and Pacey Would Be Divorced Today", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The creator of The WB\u2019s teen soap \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 just revealed where the cast would be if the show came back today, and it\u2019s not pretty \u2014 read the interview", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 Boss: Joey and Pacey Would Be Divorced Today", "description": "The creator of The WB\u2019s teen soap \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 just revealed where the cast would be if the show came back today, and it\u2019s not pretty \u2014 read the interview", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/dawsons-creek-boss-joey-and-pacey-would-be-divorced-today/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-29T14:55:35+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/katie-holmes-joshua-jackson-dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1282px%2C674px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/katie-holmes-joshua-jackson-dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1282px%2C674px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-29T14:55:35+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Longeretta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 Boss: Joey and Pacey Would Be Divorced Today", "description": "The creator of The WB\u2019s teen soap \u2018Dawson\u2019s Creek\u2019 just revealed where the cast would be if the show came back today, and it\u2019s not pretty \u2014 read the interview", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/katie-holmes-joshua-jackson-dawsons-creek.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1282px%2C674px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522335335.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
