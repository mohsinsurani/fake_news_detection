Alicia Vikander is Lara Croft. See TOMB RAIDER in cinemas this March. #TombRaider pic.twitter.com/p1VGRqYhd0\u2014 Warner Bros. UK (@WarnerBrosUK) January 18, 2018\n\nThe trailer, set to a slowed-down cover of the Destiny\u2019s Child hit Survivor, shows Croft mourning her eccentric adventurer father, played by Dominic West, who went missing when she was a child.\n\nShe leaves her job as a bike courier in London behind to search for his last known destination, a fabled tomb on an island, after she discovers a video he left for her in which he says: \u201cThere is an organisation called Trinity that is looking to start a global genocide, you must stop them.\u201d\n\nThe footage also has her falling through the sky from an exploding aircraft, jumping between tombs, embarking on a dangerous boat journey and attacking mysterious assailants.\n\nIt also shows her meeting a mysterious occupant of the island, played by Hateful Eight star Walton Goggins, who says he was left there by Croft\u2019s father.\n\nTomb Raider, directed by Roar Uthaug, will be released in UK cinemas in March 162018.", "images":
