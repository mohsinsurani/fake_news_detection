In fact, he called her out mid-concert.\n\nHarry Styles attends the 2017 iHeartRadio Music Festival at T-Mobile Arena on Sept. 22, 2017 in Las Vegas. Kevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nIn a video Grace posted to her Twitter account, Harry can be seen asking Grace what her mother's name is and then asks the rest of the audience to quiet down so that he can record a video for her mom in which he screams, \"Tina, she's gay!\"\n\n\u201cTina says she loves ya. Congratulations, I\u2019m very happy for you,\u201d Styles says in the video.\n\nGrace went back to her hotel room and immediately showed her mom the video, according to E! News. She explained that her mom was \"overjoyed\" and told her, \"Yes I do love you and you can be whoever you want to be.\"\n\nIn a separate post, Grace explained that she's been coming out to her friends as bisexual for the past couple of months after feeling \"safe and accepted\" at Style's concerts.\n\n\"Your continuous support of the LGBTQ+ has helped me come to love myself and feel safe. Thank you for tonight,\u201d she wrote.", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/bridge-gty-ml-221008_1665242585018_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/john-lynch-points-house-damage-abc-jt-221007_1665185645263_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/uvalde-1-gty-er-221007_1665161778549_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/harry-styles-1-gty-thg-180719_hpEmbed_2x3_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/search-toddler-ht-ml-221008_1665254991886_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/harry-styles-2-gty-thg-180719_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-white-house-oval-office-gty-jt-221004_1664919462010_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/harry-styles-2-gty-thg-180719_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/harry-styles-helps-fan-mom-concert-56687675", "title": "Harry Styles helps fan come out to her mom during concert", "meta_data": {"description": "One teenager has Harry Styles to thank for an unforgettable coming out story.", "keywords": "harry styles", "copyright": "2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.
