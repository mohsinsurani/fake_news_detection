We remain deeply connected, loving friends who will continue supporting each other through the next phases of our lives,\u201d the couple confirm in a joint statement obtained by PEOPLE. \u201cThe enormous amount of love and respect that we have for each other will only increase as we move forward.\u201d\n\nThough the singer, 39, and Miguel \u2014 who is also Usher\u2019s manager \u2014 have kept their relationship largely out of the spotlight, buzz they had secretly wed spread in late 2015 when he was spotted wearing a gold band on his wedding finger while out and about in L.A.\n\nMultiple sources confirmed in January of the same year that the star, who was previously married to Tameka Foster for two years, had proposed to Miguel, 48.\n\nBertrand Rindoff Petroff/Getty\n\nGrace Miguel and Usher\n\n\u201cI have an incredible partner and manager. She has helped me through some of the hardest times in my life and my career,\u201d he previously said about her.\n\nThe star has two sons, Naviyd Ely Raymond, 9, and Usher Raymond V, 10, with Foster. Two years ago, he opened up to PEOPLE about spending quality time with his family.\n\n\u201cI went on an air balloon trip with about 15 people \u2026 both my boys were up there with me, my wife was up there with me,\u201d he recalled about a recent trip to Italy. \u201cThe whole family was up there. It was cool to just have that little moment away.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly was first to report the news.", "images":
