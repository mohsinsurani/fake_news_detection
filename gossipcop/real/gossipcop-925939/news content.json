I haven\u2019t told anybody about that before. I was grossed out. I was like, \u2018How dare you,\u2019 \u201d the Real Housewives of New York City star, 52, told The Daily Beast, according to an interview published on Friday. (A rep for de Lesseps did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.)\n\n\u201cHe invaded me, he took advantage of me, being who he is, thinking he is all \u2018it,\u2019 all everything. He thought he could just do that. I looked at him and said, \u2018Don\u2019t ever do that again,\u2019 \u201d she added of the alleged encounter, which she told the outlet occurred \u201caround three summers ago, at Soho Beach House, Miami.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he apologized, de Lesseps reportedly told The Daily Beast, \u201cNo. Of course he didn\u2019t apologize.\u201d\n\nThe reality star added that she chose not to report the alleged misconduct at the time.\n\nSimmons, 60, has been accused of sexual misconduct by several women, with allegations ranging from inappropriate behavior in business meetings to rape at his apartment \u2014 all of which he has denied. The accusations span more than three decades, according to various reports by The Hollywood Reporter, The New York Times and The Los Angeles Times.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Luann de Lesseps Says Her Arrest Cost Her Friends and Boyfriends\n\nAccording to The Daily Beast, Simmons did not respond to de Lessep\u2019s allegations directly, but reissued a statement the music producer previously gave to media outlets, in which Simmons said he \u201cvehemently\u201d denied all of the accusations that have been made against him. Simmons said his \u201crelations have been consensual\u201d and the \u201chorrific accusations have shocked me to my core.\u201d\n\nBen Gabbe/Getty Images\n\nWhen reached by PEOPLE for a response to de Lesseps\u2019 allegation in The Daily Beast piece, Simmons\u2019 rep shared a variation of statements previously given to media outlets in response to previous allegations: \u201cI am blessed to have shared extraordinary relationships, whether through work or love, with many great women and I have enormous respect for the women\u2019s movement worldwide and their struggle for respect, dignity, equality and power,\u201d said Simmons. \u201cI am devastated by any reason I may have given to anyone to say or think of me in the ways that are currently being described.\u201d\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

I have re-dedicated myself to spiritual learning, healing and working on behalf of the communities to which I have devoted my life. I have accepted that I can and should get dirt on my sleeves if it means witnessing the birth of a new consciousness about women. What I cannot accept is responsibility for what I have not done. The current allegations range from the patently untrue to the frivolous and hurtful.\u201d", "images":
