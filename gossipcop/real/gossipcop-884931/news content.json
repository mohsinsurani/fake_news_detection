Rachel Bilson purchased a $3.25 million mansion in the affluent Linda Vista neighborhood of Pasadena, California, after her split from Hayden Christensen.\n\nThe six-bedroom, four-bathroom home, known as \u201cRalph\u2019s House,\u201d was built in 1950 and designed by Gregory Ain, according to Trulia. The single-level property measures 3678-square-feet and features floor-to-ceiling windows for natural light and refurbished wood floors. The spacious living room has a cozy fireplace, built-in bookshelves and paneled walls that conceal a stereo system and wet bar.\n\nThe galley kitchen has also been renovated with new appliances and improvements to the original cabinetry. A sliding glass door leads outside to a stunning backyard that boasts rolling gardens, an open-air courtyard, a swimming pool, a dry rock stream and a deck that overlooks the city\u2019s nearby canyons and mountaintops.\n\nBilson and Christensen, both 36, previously lived in a four-bedroom and four-and-a-half-bathroom home in Sherman Oaks, California.\n\nUs Weekly exclusively confirmed in September that the O.C. alum and the Star Wars actor, who share 2-year-old daughter Briar Rose, called it quits after nearly 10 years together. \u201cShe\u2019s full time back in L.A. He\u2019s in Toronto,\u201d a source told Us. \u201cThey\u2019ve been on the outs for a couple of months. They are completely, officially done.\u201d\n\nPrior to the split, Bilson opened up about the notion of having a second baby with Christensen. \u201cI may have another child, that\u2019s still up in the air,\u201d she told Lapalme magazine. \u201cI\u2019m having so much fun with the one right now. I want to be happy and content. All the life B.S. that happens doesn\u2019t matter. You want to be happy, you want your kid to be happy and you want everyone in your life to be healthy and happy.\u201d\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rachel-bilson-new-house-db80ecdb-f59a-4315-b873-dae9c02ef751.jpg?crop=1px%2C181px%2C799px%2C419px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rachel-bilson-new-house-db80ecdb-f59a-4315-b873-dae9c02ef751.jpg?crop=1px%2C181px%2C799px%2C419px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rachel-bilson-buys-325-million-mansion-after-hayden-christensen-split-w507389/", "title": "Rachel Bilson Buys $3.25 Million Mansion After Hayden Christensen Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Rachel Bilson purchased a $3.25 million six-bedroom, four-bathroom mansion in Pasadena, California, after her split from Hayden Christensen \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Rachel Bilson Buys $3.25 Million Mansion After Hayden Christensen Split", "description": "Rachel Bilson purchased a $3.25 million six-bedroom, four-bathroom mansion in Pasadena, California, after her split from Hayden Christensen \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/rachel-bilson-buys-325-million-mansion-after-hayden-christensen-split-w507389/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-10-16T00:07:59+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rachel-bilson-new-house-db80ecdb-f59a-4315-b873-dae9c02ef751.jpg?crop=1px%2C181px%2C799px%2C419px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rachel-bilson-new-house-db80ecdb-f59a-4315-b873-dae9c02ef751.jpg?crop=1px%2C181px%2C799px%2C419px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-10-05T18:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-10-16T00:07:59+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rachel Bilson Buys $3.25 Million Mansion After Hayden Christensen Split", "description": "Rachel Bilson purchased a $3.25 million six-bedroom, four-bathroom mansion in Pasadena, California, after her split from Hayden Christensen \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rachel-bilson-new-house-db80ecdb-f59a-4315-b873-dae9c02ef751.jpg?crop=1px%2C181px%2C799px%2C419px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507229100.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
