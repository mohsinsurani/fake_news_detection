But with a hit TV show, a new album, and a new baby, the 37-year-old songstress has a lot to juggle. And by the looks of her super fit and firm physique, there\u2019s no doubt she makes serious time for her workouts.\n\nIn fact, the \u201cHips Don\u2019t Lie\u201d singer trains with fitness guru Anna Kaiser, owner of AKT InMotion Studio in New York City, who most recently helped Shakira shed baby weight and get back into sizzling shape. \u201cBeing consistent with exercise is the biggest hurdle to overcome for every woman,\u201d says Kaiser. \u201cShakira also works so hard. She gives 150 percent with everything she does.\u201d\n\nWe went one-on-one with Kaiser for more\u2014including her secrets for shaping up and slimming down, Shakira-style. From the Colombian stunner\u2019s exact workout to her specific menu, you\u2019ll be hip-shaking like a pro in no time.\n\nShape: Shakira looks fantastic! Tell us what you\u2019ve been doing with her.\n\nAnna Kaiser [AK]: We started with 30 minutes in the morning and 30 minutes in the evening. You get an added metabolism-booster in the second half of the day. After six weeks, she did an hour in the morning and another hour in the evening.\n\nShape: What does your training entail?\n\nAK: It depends on where she is. She loves to mix it up and go out and play sports like tennis, squash, and paddleboarding. One session might consist of a ballet combo and barre exercises, then kickboxing and sports training, hip-hop, or Pilates.\n\nShape: Did you help with Shakira\u2019s diet at all?\n\nAK: I did help with meal plans, especially because in the Latin culture, they love foods high on the glycemic index or with large portions of meat. I recommended small meals throughout the day to help fight against that dreaded food coma. The meals range from 200 to 300 calories each, five to six times a day. When you get very few breaks during the day and you don\u2019t get a full night\u2019s sleep, you need those small meals to keep your energy up.\n\nShape: What was on her menu?\n\nAK: One meal option is a piece of poached chicken the size of your fist with a green salad sprinkled with lemon juice, carrots, cherry tomatoes, cucumber, and celery. Another is a cup and a half of quinoa with minced veggies, all cooked at once so the quinoa absorbs the nutrients. For snacks, a vegetable pur\u00e9ed soup with pumpkin seeds, olive oil, or flaxseed oil works. We\u2019d also incorporate 125-calorie protein shakes with ice, water, stevia, and a chocolate whey protein mix that had 12 grams of protein. You can also add berries and a scoop of almond butter. Shakira also loves oranges with almonds.\n\nShape: She had a baby in January 2013. What is most important when it comes to getting in shape after pregnancy?\n\nAK: It\u2019s important to work slowly and intelligently in your strength work before revving up the intensity. Start with deep diaphragmatic breathing to reengage and reconnect with your abdominals. Cardio should remain low-impact at first. You can gradually kick up the intensity. Interval training is a great way to incorporate short bouts of strength and cardio efficiently too (moms have small windows of time!). You can even integrate yoga poses between intervals to get more out of one session.\n\nGo to the next page to try Shakira\u2019s workout!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/300x300/public/ami_instagram/images/344602f8c6a211e3a8c10002c95400c2_8.jpg?itok=E3DWJprL", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/174x174/public/abs-and-arms-700x700.jpg?itok=74n_FhKH", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/themes/shape/images/logo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/shakira-700.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/60x60/public/abs-329.jpg?itok=TmlwEeyD", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/174x174/public/tabata-abs-rotator.jpg?itok=mZPeyGjD", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://ib.adnxs.com/seg?add=962388&t=2", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/60x60/public/3.-glutes_piriformis-700x700_3.jpg?itok=RpzCDzHQ", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/60x60/public/perfectbluebella.jpg?itok=1zGgQvgA", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/60x60/public/diet-doc-how-many-cals-ro.jpg?itok=67x0qYC5", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/384xany/public/shakira-700.jpg?itok=4O-lpL2D", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-4bp1NU6fZ5af6.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/174x174/public/woman-in-sun.jpg?itok=x45p461V", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/300x300/public/stroll-700.jpg?itok=39tohI21", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/celebrities/celebrity-workouts/shakira-s-trainer-anna-kaiser-singers-diet-and-fitness-routine", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/120x120/public/powercrunchsweeps700x700.jpg?itok=HUZEfOMG", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/all/modules/contrib/print/icons/print_icon.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/60x60/public/matthew-kenney-700x700.jpg?itok=nnZYIp2G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/300x300/public/6b8d5afd71b143be51c232f5f6292507.jpg?itok=FtGG6Aan", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/60x60/public/lose-belly-fat-rot.jpg?itok=ng8K6ezD", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://assets.pinterest.com/images/PinExt.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6036076&c3=&c4=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.shape.com%2Fcelebrities%2Fcelebrity-workouts%2Fshakira-s-trainer-anna-kaiser-singers-diet-and-fitness-routine&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-5aDJR7ayfzWN6.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1066279995/?value=0&label=LLIkCP2uwgUQu8i4_AM&guid=ON&script=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/thumbnail_term_small/public/kristen-aldridge-200x200.jpeg?itok=T5FV-Jr5", "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/styles/60x60/public/kim-k-wedding-diet-700.jpg?itok=RHQa5FoF"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551im_/http://www.shape.com/sites/shape.com/files/shakira-700.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kristen Aldridge"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551/http://www.shape.com/celebrities/celebrity-workouts/shakira-s-trainer-anna-kaiser-singers-diet-and-fitness-routine", "title": "Shakira\u2019s Trainer Anna Kaiser on the Singer's Diet and Fitness Routine", "meta_data": {"generator": "Drupal 7 (http://drupal.org)", "og": {"type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20140418154551/http://www.shape.com/celebrities/celebrity-workouts/shakira-s-trainer-anna-kaiser-singers-diet-and-fitness-routine", "site_name": "Shape Magazine", "description": "As one of the sexiest pop stars on the planet, there\u2019s no doubt Shakira has a rocking bod.
