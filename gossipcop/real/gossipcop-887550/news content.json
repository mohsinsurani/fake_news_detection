Entertainment, he lobbied for the Grammy-winning superstar to appear in Disney\u2019s musical blockbuster.\n\n\u201cI even tried to get her into \u2018Beauty and the Beast,\u2019 but it wasn\u2019t a big enough part,\u201d the 61-year-old director said. \u201cShe would have been a good feather duster.\u201d\n\nCondon, who worked with Beyonc\u00e9, 36, in 2006\u2019s \u201cDreamgirls,\u201d helmed the live action version of the Disney classic, which has grossed a total of $504 million domestically. The role of Plumette, the feather duster of Lumiere\u2019s (Ewan McGregor) eye, went to British actress Gugu Mbatha-Raw.\n\nThough Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s resume has grown since \u201cDreamgirls,\u201d Condon believes the mother of three has an eye for the future of filmmaking.\n\n\u201cYou look at something like \u2018Lemonade\u2018: that is brilliant,\u201d he says. \u201cThat is a brilliant new direction for movie musicals.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/beyonce2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/beyonce2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/10/beyonce2.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["October"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/10/18/beyonce-turned-down-a-role-in-beauty-and-the-beast/", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 turned down a role in \u2018Beauty and the Beast\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
