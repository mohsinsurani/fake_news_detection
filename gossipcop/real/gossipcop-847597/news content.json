Hadid wore a show-stopping Tommy Hilfiger creation, but what really got the social media engine pumping was her $2,000 artificial, chrome nails dotted with crystals on the underside.\n\nHere\u2019s the catch \u2014 Hadid didn\u2019t have to foot that bill.\n\nIt was Kiss Nail Products, the company that made the nails based on Hadid\u2019s and her manicurist\u2019s specifications that paid the $2,000 \u2014 crystals and all \u2014 according to a representative from Kiss on Tuesday (it was also Kiss that gave the original estimate for the nails in 2016).\n\nIt\u2019s unclear who paid for her silvery Tommy Hilfiger outfit, a brand Hadid has a working relationship with and wore again at 2017 \u201cCommes Des Garcons\u201d-themed Met Gala.\n\nMoreover, while a gown by a designer can be worth around $35,610, it\u2019s common practice for the designer to pay for the material and man hours, said Michael O\u2019Connor, who has helped put jewelry on the likes of Eva Longoria and Amy Adams. For brands, its a great way to to get their name out there and associated with a well-liked face. For red carpet events, O\u2019Connor says he\u2019s approached certain designers on behalf of a celebrity, or certain celebrities on behalf of a designer about wearing a piece of jewelry.\n\nTickets for the event Monday, which was attended by roughly 550 people, cost about $30,000 this year according to the Metropolitan Museum of Art, or about $275,000 for a table.\n\nBoth are towering figures \u2014 the cost of an individual ticket is enough to put a family of four over the poverty line \u2014 but it\u2019s again, not the celebrities who always eat the cost. According to the New York Times, at least some celebrities don\u2019t have to buy the ticket, with brands often paying for the table.\n\nWhile rumors say A-list celebrities can be offered up to a million dollars to wear a designer\u2019s jewelry, the artist performing at the Met Gala may also compensated for their appearance. Rihanna, who performed at the 2015 event for instance, was paid a figure at least in the thousands after some negotiating between her team and Vogue in \u201cThe First Monday in May,\u201d a documentary about organizing the star-studded event. The actual figure was bleeped out.\n\n\u201cWe can\u2019t lose her,\u201d says Vogue\u2019s head of special projects Sylvana Ward Durrett of Rihanna ahead of the 2015 Met Gala. \u201cIt\u2019s about twice as much as any performer we\u2019ve ever had.\u201d\n\nThis year, the star on stage was Katy Perry \u2014 who can charge about $1.5 million for an appearance, said Robert Familetti of third party booking firm Platinum Rye Entertainment, although that figure can be different with Perry being a co-chair at this year\u2019s Met Gala.\n\nNot that the Met can complain too much about the costs.\n\nIt likely needed the starry performance to pull in the $16.5 million it received this year. According to the New York Times, the financially challenged museum had to postpone a $600 million wing last month, with a deficit now approaching $40 million.", "images": ["https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242585998-e1665028070836.jpg?w=256&q=75", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/met.gif?resize=1200,600", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243767517-e1665076497696.jpg?w=256&q=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243581035-e1665068106964.jpg?w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/met.gif?resize=1200,600", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://fortune.com/2017/05/02/met-gala-2017-cost-to-attend/", "title": "How Much It Costs for Celebrities to Attend the Met Gala", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "A table at the gala costs a quarter of a million dollars.
