Now there's four of us, but we're gonna make it five!\"\n\nChris and Morgane, 35, met when they were both singer-songwriters in 2003, and wed in 2007. She now sings backup on many of his songs. Besides the twins, they also have an 8-year-old son and a 6-year-old daughter. (The children's names have been kept private).\n\nChris and Morgane Stapleton at the 2016 CMT Music Awards in Nashville.
