Since the show\u2019s U.S. debut in 2000, the reality series has made headlines for an array of topics. With each season, the disputes behind the scenes only grow.\n\nOver the past 20 years, the show has been criticized for racism and discrimination, beginning with an incident that occurred in season 15. In 2013, Aaryn Gries referred to Asian people as \u201csquinty-eyed,\u201d called her Black roommate Candice Stewart \u201cAunt Jemima\u201d and asked her Korean housemate Helen Kim to \u201cgo make some rice.\u201d\n\nGinaMarie Zimmerman and Spencer Clawson were also accused of insensitive comments during the season, so much so that host Julie Chen spoke about it on The Talk.\n\n\u201cIt stung,\u201d the host said at the time. \u201cI took it personally. The really sad part was it took me back to the \u201970s when I was growing up in Queens, when I was 7, being bullied and being called a chink \u2026 the year is 2013! Then I felt ignorant. There are still people who feel that way? Yes, there is.\u201d\n\nHowever, claims of discrimination only continued. Moments before being crowned the season 21 winner in 2019, Jackson Michie was shocked when Chen informed him that his houseguests had expressed concerns about his behavior, making choices based on race or age \u2014 something he adamantly denied.\n\nAdditionally, season 21 contestant Kemi Fakunle spoke out, revealing she was \u201cdisgusted\u201d about what was happening inside the Big Brother house, seemingly alluding to aggressive comments made by Jack Matthews during the live feeds.\n\n\u201cThe audience is able to view the show during the multiple weekly broadcasts as well as on the 24/7 live, online stream, which captures unedited content of the contestants\u2019 unfiltered moments in the house,\u201d the network and the show\u2019s producers said in a statement in July 2019. \u201cAt times, the houseguests say things that we do not condone. We share some of the viewers\u2019 concerns about inappropriate behavior and offensive comments, and producers have addressed specific incidents with the houseguests involved. However, there is absolutely no truth that the casting of the show is racially motivated, that the houseguests\u2019 behavior is predetermined or that the outcome is controlled in any way.\u201d\n\nScroll through the gallery below for some of the biggest controversies from the show.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Brother-Controversies-All-Star-cast.jpg?w=1200&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Brother-Controversies-All-Star-cast.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Brother-Controversies-All-Star-cast.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/big-brother-controversies-through-the-years/", "title": "\u2018Big Brother\u2019 Controversies Through the Years", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "gallery", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Many \u2018Big Brother\u2019 houseguests have stirred up controversy since the reality series premiered in 2000 \u2014 revisit the biggest scandals", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Big Brother\u2019 Controversies Through the Years", "description": "Many \u2018Big Brother\u2019 houseguests have stirred up controversy since the reality series premiered in 2000 \u2014 revisit the biggest scandals", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/pictures/big-brother-controversies-through-the-years/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2022-09-14T15:23:27+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Brother-Controversies-All-Star-cast.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Brother-Controversies-All-Star-cast.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2022-09-14T15:16:07+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-14T15:23:27+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Big Brother\u2019 Controversies Through the Years", "description": "Many \u2018Big Brother\u2019 houseguests have stirred up controversy since the reality series premiered in 2000 \u2014 revisit the biggest scandals", "image": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Big-Brother-Controversies-All-Star-cast.jpg?w=1200&h=630&crop=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1663168567.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
