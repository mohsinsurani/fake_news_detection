It\u2019s an impressive number for an artist who utterly dominated 2016, shattering streaming records over and over again with the success of his album Views and its monster single \u201cOne Dance\u201d featuring WizKid and Kyla.\n\n\u201cLife is like toilet paper,\u201d he said while accepting his final award. \u201cEither you\u2019re on a roll, or taking sh-t from assholes.\u201d\n\nRelated Here Is the Complete List of Winners From the 2017 Billboard Music Awards\n\nCher was presented with the prestigious Icon Award and rolled back the years with a high-powered performance of her iconic songs \u201cBelieve\u201d and \u201cIf I Could Turn Back Time\u201d \u2014 sporting, fittingly, completely different looks for each performance \u2014 a day after her 71st birthday. \u201cI\u2019ve wanted to do what I do since I was four years old, and I\u2019ve been doing it for 53 years,\u201d she said with a humble air during her acceptance speech. \u201cI think luck has so much to do with with my success\u2026 I think it was mostly luck and a little bit of something thrown in.\u201d\n\nDrake also won Top Hot 100 Artist, Top Billboard 200 Artist and Top Rap Artist, and took home awards for song sales, song streams and several rap and R&B categories on his way to lucky 13. Beyonc\u00e9 earned Top Female Artist, Zayn was awarded Top New Artist and Blake Shelton (Country), Beyonc\u00e9 (R&B), Twenty One Pilots (Rock), Juan Gabriel (Latin), The Chainsmokers (Dance/Electronic) and Lauren Daigle (Christian) and Kirk Franklin (Gospel) won top artist honors in their respective genres. Twenty One Pilots and Beyonc\u00e9 were also big winners on the night, with five BBMAs apiece, while The Chainsmokers earned four.\n\nRelated The 10 Best Moments of the 2017 Billboard Music Awards\n\nThe show spent most of its three hours, fittingly, on performances and awards rather than hosting gimmicks, with 15 performances that ran the gamut of genres from hip-hop to pop to dance to rock to country. Nicki Minaj opened the show with a star-studded medley that included her Remy Ma diss track \u201cNo Frauds,\u201d which she performed with Lil Wayne, David Guetta\u2018s \u201cLight My Body Up,\u201d Jason Derulo\u2018s \u201cSwalla\u201d and her own \u201cRegret In Your Tears,\u201d bringing out each superstar in turn. Camila Cabello and Miley Cyrus both delivered the live debuts of their new singles \u2014 Cabello\u2019s first solo songs since leaving Fifth Harmony, an emotional-yet-brief \u201cI Have Questions\u201d and a heated-up \u201cCrying In the Club,\u201d and Cyrus\u2019 country-tinged comeback release \u201cMalibu\u201d \u2014 while Lorde (\u201cGreen Light,\u201d performed as if at a goofy and awkward karaoke night), Sam Hunt (\u201cBody Like a Back Road\u201d) and John Legend (\u201cSurefire\u201d), who was then joined by Florida Georgia Line for a surprise joint rendition of FGL\u2019s \u201cH.O.L.Y.,\u201d all chipped in with memorable performances.\n\nHudgens was a natural in her first year as co-host alongside veteran BBMAs host Ludacris, and their monologue would have had her in the headlines regardless of Drake\u2019s unabashed flirting. In hyping the performances to come, Hudgens showed off both her pipes and rapping skills with a cappella versions of Celine Dion\u2018s \u201cPower of Love\u201d and Nicki Minaj\u2019s verse from \u201cMonster,\u201d impressing both Luda and the crowd in the process.\n\nSpeaking of Dion, the diva performed her iconic song \u201cMy Heart Will Go On\u201d 20 years after its initial prominence as the main song from the blockbuster Leonardo DiCaprio\u2013Kate Winslet film Titanic, navigating the challenging track effortlessly and earning an extended standing ovation. (Read Billboard\u2018s oral history of the song right here.) It was easily one of the standout moments of the night, and impressive in its emotion and vocal dexterity.\n\nDiddy also took the stage to pay tribute to The Notorious B.I.G. on what would have been the rapper\u2019s 45th birthday and debuted the trailer for his upcoming Bad Boy Records documentary Can\u2019t Stop, Won\u2019t Stop. \u201cIt all started with the Notorious B.I.G.,\u201d Diddy said, referencing Bad Boy\u2019s creation and the 500 million albums it sold over the past 20-plus years. \u201cBig sold over 25 million records worldwide; his Ready to Die album, his Life After Death album, classics\u2026 Biggie was the best rapper I ever had the chance to work with. Watching him and seeing him work is something that words can\u2019t explain.\u201d\n\nBruno Mars, whose recent awards show performances have leaned more towards glitzy funk showstoppers like \u201c24K Magic\u201d and his excellent tribute to Prince alongside The Time during the Grammys earlier this year, took a different route for this one, getting passionate with his latest single \u201cVersace On the Floor\u201d as the show wound towards its conclusion.\n\nBut there was only one way it would end: with Drake complete his record-breaking evening with the top award to go with his new place in BBMA history. His huge night catapulted him into the top 10 of artists who have won the most Billboard Music Awards over the years, though he still has a way to go to catch Taylor Swift at 21. But with the March release of his playlist-album More Life already shattering records he\u2019d set last year with Views, it\u2019s hard to imagine he won\u2019t be gracing BBMA stages for years to come.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/drake-bbmas-press-room-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204652553202666&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "http://static.billboard.com/files/media/BB-Promo-bbmas.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/drake-bbmas-press-room-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Dan Rys"], "canonical_link": "https://www.billboard.com/music/awards/billboard-music-awards-2017-full-show-recap-7801226/", "title": "Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-billboard-2021/assets/app/icons/icon-144x144.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Drake stole the show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in more ways than one, taking home 13 honors and surpassing Adele's mark as the artist with the most BBMA wins in one night.", "news_keywords": "2018 billboard music awards, autoplay, BBMA, BBMAs", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "billboard", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 7801226, "author": "Dan Rys", "pmc-category": "Awards,Music", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-05-21T23:58:57"}, "pmc-tag": "2018 billboard music awards,autoplay,BBMA,BBMAs", "title": "Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-always-paywall": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-exclusive": "no", "pmc-breaking-news": "no", "pmc-prime": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Dan Rys", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Billboard", "application-name": "Billboard", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 7801226, "title": "Drake Sets Single-Year Record, Celine Dion & Cher Shine at 2017 Billboard Music Awards", "published_at": "2017-05-21 23:58:57", "image": "https://www.billboard.com/wp-content/uploads/media/drake-bbmas-press-room-2017-a-billboard-1548.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "BBMAs", "topics": "Music", "body": "Drake stole the show at the 2017 Billboard Music Awards in more ways than one, taking home 13\u00a0honors, surpassing Adele's mark as the artist with the most BBMA wins in one night, delivering a fiery performance in the middle of the famous Bellagio fountain and, maybe, getting himself a date after hitting on co-host Vanessa Hudgens during his acceptance speech for winning Top Billboard 200 Album for Views.Watch\"It's crazy that we're all here on earth for a limited amount of time, and we gotta show love while we're here,\" he said on stage midway through the telecast, before getting straight to the point:\u00a0\"Vanessa Hudgens, you look incredible tonight.\" (Hudgens acknowledged that\u00a0shortly afterward by asking if she was on the invite list for Drake's afterparty.)By then, Drake had already racked up 12 BBMAs -- 10 in the pre-telecast categories, and one earlier in the show for Top Male Artist -- on his way to a record-breaking 13 victories, which he achieved with the evening's final honor, Top Artist, to overtake Adele's previous record of 12 in 2012.
