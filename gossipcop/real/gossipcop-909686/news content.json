Chrissy Teigen and John Legend joked about their now-infamous missing toilet fiasco on the 2018 Grammys red carpet on Sunday, January 28, in New York City.\n\n\u201cWe were having a transition from a regular toilet to a Japanese toilet that washes your butt and opens itself,\u201d Legend said during an interview with Ryan Seacrest. \u201cThe contractor came in and removed the first toilet but didn\u2019t replace it immediately. We had to wait another day until the next toilet got installed.\u201d\n\nTeigen added, \u201cI laughed so hard that I peed all over myself! Of course this would happen to me. I peed!\u201d\n\nThe 32-year-old Cravings author, who is expecting her second child with the \u201cAll of Me\u201d singer, first joked on Twitter about her how her toilet disappeared on Thursday, January 25. \u201cI got home today and ran to go peepee and you know when you\u2019re so close to the bathroom so you kind of release because you know you\u2019re about to pee,\u201d she tweeted at the time. \u201cWell I did that and my toilet was gone.\u201d\n\nTeigen then shared a photo of her bathroom, and there was nothing but a sink and a toilet paper holder on the wall. \u201cLike there was no toilet,\u201d she captioned the photo. Legend responded shortly after, retweeting the image and writing: \u201cI can explain.\u201d\n\nThe 39-year-old Grammy winner tweeted, \u201cWe\u2019re upgrading our regular toilet to one of those fancy Japanese ones that opens itself and washes your butt. Apparently our contractor decided there should be a toilet-less transition period.\u201d\n\nThe 60th annual Grammy awards air on CBS Sunday, January 28, at 7:30 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/911504326_chrissy-teigen-john-legend-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1751px%2C919px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/911504326_chrissy-teigen-john-legend-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1751px%2C919px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/grammys-2018-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-talk-about-missing-toilet/", "title": "Grammys 2018: Chrissy Teigen, John Legend Talk About Missing Toilet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Grammys,Grammys 2018", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend laughed about their missing toilet fiasco on the 2018 Grammys red carpet on Sunday, January 28 \u2014 watch", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Laughs About Missing Toilet: \u2018I Peed All Over Myself\u2019", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend laughed about their missing toilet fiasco on the 2018 Grammys red carpet on Sunday, January 28 \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/grammys-2018-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-talk-about-missing-toilet/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T20:59:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/911504326_chrissy-teigen-john-legend-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1751px%2C919px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/911504326_chrissy-teigen-john-legend-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1751px%2C919px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-29T01:09:47+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T20:59:50+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Chrissy Teigen Laughs About Missing Toilet: \u2018I Peed All Over Myself\u2019", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend laughed about their missing toilet fiasco on the 2018 Grammys red carpet on Sunday, January 28 \u2014 watch", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/911504326_chrissy-teigen-john-legend-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1751px%2C919px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517188187.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
