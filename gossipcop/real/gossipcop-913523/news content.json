Maybe the best Tuesday of your life, perhaps? (It is Galentine's Day and Fat Tuesday, after all.) But gorging on all the candy and king cake in the world still doesn't compare to Ellen DeGeneres' 60th birthday f\u00eate held over the weekend.\n\nDeGeneres shared details about the extravaganza organized by her wife, actress Portia de Rossi, on her talk show Tuesday. DeGeneres, who marked the milestone birthday on Jan. 26, explained to viewers: \"My birthday is like an entire season. It's like Christmas and the flu.\"\n\nThe guest list included A-listers like Sean Combs, Pharrell Williams, Pink, Oprah Winfrey and Reese Witherspoon, who DeGeneres joked \"strongly suggested everyone should perform.\"\n\nThe comedian also quipped that Witherspoon's Wrinkle in Time co-star contributed to a tequila shortage reported by the New York Post. \"I don't want to blame anyone in particular, but I saw someone sitting at the bar drinking all night long. I'll just give her first name, Oprah,\" DeGeneres said showing a photo of her and Winfrey with wine glasses in hand. \"You can figure out which Oprah it was.\"\n\nDeGeneres' DJ tWitch was also blown away by the party. \"It was nuts,\" he told the audience. \"It's like nothing in life prepares you for those kinds of events. Like, I couldn't have been prepared to bump into Oprah.\"\n\nHear more about the epic evening in the clip above.\n\nWant more Ellen?
