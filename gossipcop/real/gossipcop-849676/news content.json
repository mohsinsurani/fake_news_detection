These aren\u2019t formal reviews. How could they be? I haven\u2019t seen the darned shows. They\u2019re just gut responses to sales pitches. If advertisers can pony up billions based on these clips, I can tell you if they\u2019re good or bad. My annual Take Me to the Pilots series will begin in a month and then real reviews will start in September. It\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint.\n\nOne day after CBS took advertisers back to the \u201880s with shiny new versions of Murphy Brown and Magnum P.I., The CW closed out broadcast TV\u2019s upfronts week with another healthy dose of nostalgia.\n\nExpanding to six nights of original programming in the fall, the network presented a schedule with five new shows premiering between fall and midseason, two of which \u2014 Charmed and Roswell, New Mexico \u2014 will induce young adult soap opera flashbacks. Another of the shows, Legacies, didn\u2019t have any footage to show yet, but as a spinoff of The Originals (itself a spinoff of The Vampire Diaries), it also brings a measure of familiarity.\n\nWithout further ado, let\u2019s get to The CW\u2019s trailer rankings.\n\n4) In the Dark | I don\u2019t pay as much attention to development as I used to, so I hadn\u2019t heard a word about In the Dark. I have to admit that my first instinct after seeing the ridiculous poster for this dramedy was to think it was a parody show. A parody of what? For what? I have no idea. I didn\u2019t get that far. And my first instinct after watching the first half of the trailer was to think that this had to be some sort of hastily made filler programming for CW Seed. It was only when I saw John From Cincinnati himself (Austin Nichols, who is no longer on the show) in the trailer that I began to realize that this story of a sex-addicted blind misanthrope attempting to solve a murder with the help of her nosey support dog Pretzel was a real series that will air on real television. I\u2019m still not completely convinced. The trailer was tonally muddled, extremely cheap-looking and made me giggle in several totally inappropriate places. Pretzel looks like a very good dog, though. Good dog, Pretzel!\n\n3) Charmed | I was not a Charmed viewer. I must have watched two full episodes ever. The only time I\u2019m aware of the show is when I watch basketball at night on TNT and there\u2019s a repeat of Charmed on the next morning. I\u2019ll probably watch more episodes of this remake, which pushed its female empowerment message hard in its first trailer. Jennie Snyder Urman\u2019s Jane the Virgin track record has definitely bought this one a few extra hours from me, though I wish more of Urman\u2019s sense of humor was pushed to the forefront, because that\u2019s what I\u2019ll be watching and hoping for. I think stars Melonie Diaz, Sarah Jeffery and Madeleine Mantock all seem OK, though the magical effects look mighty middling.\n\n2) Roswell, New Mexico | Wasn\u2019t this one supposed to come with some sort of immigration subtext? I was looking forward to that. The trailer eschewed that angle, if it still exists, in favor of sudsy supernatural romance. As it should. It\u2019s a sales pitch and not one aimed at me. I\u2019m a Jeanine Mason fan dating back to her run on So You Think You Can Dance and her small part on Bunheads, so I\u2019m definitely the target demo for her debut as a TV lead (assuming you forget the ABC sword-and-sandals epic she did a couple years back and her brief stint on Grey\u2019s Anatomy this season). As with Charmed, I\u2019d love to have seen a shade more humor in a trailer that is very, very, very earnest. Other than a little Southwestern ambiance, this trailer looked interchangeable with The CW\u2019s very short-lived Star-Crossed from a couple years ago, and I refuse to exist that all alien-human love stories are identical!\n\n1) All American | This is one of the best-cut trailers I\u2019ve seen all upfronts week, perhaps the best. I\u2019m pumped enough for this show that I\u2019m going to get over my punctuation anxiety that makes me desperately want to add a hyphen. Unlike In the Dark \u2014 still not convinced it\u2019s a real show \u2014 I\u2019d heard about this one, but I hadn\u2019t fully realized how completely it\u2019s The O.C. only with football. Watch the trailer again. It\u2019s so nearly a beat-for-beat remake that Josh Schwartz should be getting a tiny slice of residuals, right down to the rich kids\u2019 bacchanal party and somebody sneering \u201cWelcome to\u2026\u201d (in this case \u201cBeverly Hills\u201d) to our main character. Plus, Taye Diggs as Peter Gallagher! Yes, the mustache-twirling racism of the adversarial white characters looks over-the-top, but I appreciated the one joke undercutting gang stereotyping. This looks fun, emotional, corny and inspirational in equal measures and I am there for it! Or at least now I\u2019m excited to watch a full pilot.\n\nCheck back in around a month for the start of my annual Take Me To The Pilots series.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/all_american.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/all_american.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/all_american.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Fienberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/cw-trailer-rankings-upfronts-2018-1112952/", "title": "The CW\u2019s New Show Trailers: A Critic\u2019s Ranking", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The CW takes us back to 'Roswell' and 'Charmed' and introduces a new high school football drama that may look familiar to fans of 'The O.C.'", "news_keywords": "Upfronts 2018", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Daniel Fienberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1112952, "title": "The CW's New Show Trailers: A Critic's Ranking", "published_at": "2018-05-17 14:42:02", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/all_american.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Upfronts 2018", "topics": "TV News", "body": "Time for your regular reminder that over the next four days, I'll be giving my quick reactions to the trailers presented to advertisers in New York City.
