I married Rock&Roll instead so I hopped on tour with EAGLES OF F\u2013KING DEATH METAL,\u201d King shared on Instagram.\n\nThe daughter of comedian Rob Schneider, King, 27, accepted Ferguson\u2019s proposal last February after he popped the question on a sailboat under the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. As King recalled on a March episode of \u201cSay Yes to the Dress,\u201d Ferguson proposed 12 days after they met.\n\n\u201cWe met in London in the lobby of my hotel, and it was like we had known each other for 10 years,\u201d she said. \u201cWe hung out all night, it was my last day in London, and he was like, \u2018You can\u2019t go home.\u2019 And I didn\u2019t get on my flight, and I stayed in London. Two days later, he quit his job and moved to America.\u201d\n\nWhile she found her dream dress, King hinted the pair had split following a cryptic Instagram post from March 28.\n\n\u201cGotta say \u2026 no matter how heartbreaking one day may be, it\u2019s hard to not smile in this California sunshine,\u201d she wrote.\n\nEarlier this month, King penned a lengthy note detailing the importance of self-worth.\n\n\u201cBeen a really rough and insane start to this year,\u201d King shared, along with a snapshot of her puppy. \u201cLately I don\u2019t cry very much. I feel like it will just be an explosion if I did. But seeing my little baby girl again, and having her by my side, well I lost it. She\u2019s my best friend and the only true loyalty I\u2019ve ever known.\n\n\u201cToday someone tried to make me feel a certain way about myself. But we have to remember, no one can make you feel anything unless you let them. Don\u2019t give people power over you. As a human, other people may try to be threatening in more ways than just verbal or physical acts,\u201d she continued. \u201cAlways be strong. Always have dogs. Never forget your rights and your worth. If no one has told you today, I love you and I think you\u2019re beautiful and are worthy of love and kindness. Be safe. Be smart. Don\u2019t let anyone make you feel fearful or small. Love yourself.\u201d\n\nA rep for King did not immediately return a request for comment.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/elle1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/elle1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/elle1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["April"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/04/17/elle-king-skips-out-on-her-own-wedding/", "title": "Elle King skips out on her own wedding", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
