Let's take a look at some highlights before moving on to the big list of releases.\n\nUndoubtedly the biggest release of the month is Avengers: Infinity War (pictured above) which lands on Netflix Christmas Day. Watching Thanos do battle against the arrayed forces of good on our planet and across the galaxies should be a nice way to relax after Christmas dinner. It should also get audiences in the mood for Avengers 4 which is slated for a May 3rd 2019 theatrical release. I liked Infinity War a lot more than Age of Ultron, though I did have a few quibbles with the film.\n\nI'm even more excited for the release of the eighth and final season of Voltron: Legendary Defender, though the \"final\" part is kind of bumming me out. All good things must come to an end, but I feel like the show was really hitting its stride in Season 7 and it's so soon now that it will all be coming to an end. Just 13 episodes remain. If you're not watching Voltron on Netflix, you really should be. It's fun for kids and grown-ups alike.\n\nOther fantastical fare for December includes 2004's Hellboy (December 1st) and the 2009 sci-fi drama District 9 (Dec 4th) a clever dystopian film that cuts rather close to the bone.\n\nPerhaps just as exciting---if not more so---than Voltron, we have Season 1 of 3 Below: Tales of Arcadia which comes to Netflix on December 21st. This is the second series in Guillermo del Toro's animated project that began with the absolutely wonderful Trollhunters. We were introduced to the star characters of 3 Below in the final few episodes of that show. I'm so excited to see what happens here. I adored Trollhunters as did my kids. This time around, instead of trolls we get aliens. Should be neat.\n\nHere's the trailer:\n\nI'm also looking forward to the 4-part miniseries Watership Down, produced by Netflix and the BBC. The animated show includes voice actors like Sir Ben Kingsley (Gandhi), John Boyega (Star Wars) and many more. I remember the original movie adaptation of the excellent book frightening me quite a lot. Rabbits aren't supposed to be this twisted. It lands on Netflix on Christmas Day.\n\nFor more comedic titles both Friday and Friday After Next hit Netflix on December 1st. The hilarious British zombie comedy, Shaun of the Dead lands the same day.\n\nMeanwhile, Mowgli: Legend of the Jungle, a Netflix original that follows fairly close on the heels of Disney's live-action Jungle Book, finds its way to the streaming service on December 7th. The movie was directed by Andy Serkis (Gollum from Lord of the Rings, Snoke in the new Star Wars movies, Caesar in Planet of the Apes, and so on and so forth) and was originally a Warner Bros. film slated for theatrical release.\n\nThe rights were sold to Netflix, however, so we can save a buck or two and see this from the living room couch. I'm honestly not sure what to expect, but I have nothing but admiration for Serkis as a creative. There's a bunch of big names attached as voice actors, but I'm particularly glad to see The Americans star Mathhew Rhys who was simply outstanding in that show (as was Keri Russell.)\n\nHere's the trailer:\n\nI think it looks quite good---and quite different from The Jungle Book.\n\nThere's tons more, including a plethora of new Netflix Originals.
