But when I do leave, I actually dress up more because it feels like a special occasion for me \u2026 I\u2019ve also tucked all my dry-clean-only pieces to the back of my closet.\u201d\n\nThe best-selling author also mentioned that she has ditched stilettos for sneakers since turning 30. \u201cI stopped wearing heels regularly. I wore heels a lot more regularly a few years ago. It\u2019s just the realities of my job now. I run around a lot more. I\u2019m on set a lot. I\u2019m just tired of having sore feet \u2026 if I\u2019m working and running around, I\u2019m usually in tennis shoes. I do a Jack Purcell sneaker or a Chuck Taylor sneaker. I also have some ballet or almond-toe flats.\u201d\n\nConrad and Tell, who had their first date on Valentine\u2019s Day in 2012, married in September 2014.\n\nFor the latest celebrity entertainment, news and lifestyle videos, subscribe to Us Weekly\u2019s YouTube Page.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lauren-conrad-9f9fc8e7-860c-4c12-bccc-c67ad4755c56.jpg?crop=302px%2C0px%2C903px%2C475px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lauren-conrad-9f9fc8e7-860c-4c12-bccc-c67ad4755c56.jpg?crop=302px%2C0px%2C903px%2C475px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/lauren-conrad-enjoys-sunday-snuggles-with-son-liam-pic-w506552/", "title": "Lauren Conrad Enjoys \u2018Sunday Snuggles\u2019 with Son Liam: Pic", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Lauren Conrad captured her 2-month-old son Liam\u2019s cute snooze on Sunday, October 1\u2014 see the adorable pic!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lauren Conrad Enjoys \u2018Sunday Snuggles\u2019 With Son Liam: Pic", "description": "Lauren Conrad captured her 2-month-old son Liam\u2019s cute snooze on Sunday, October 1\u2014 see the adorable pic!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/lauren-conrad-enjoys-sunday-snuggles-with-son-liam-pic-w506552/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-29T14:13:57+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lauren-conrad-9f9fc8e7-860c-4c12-bccc-c67ad4755c56.jpg?crop=302px%2C0px%2C903px%2C475px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lauren-conrad-9f9fc8e7-860c-4c12-bccc-c67ad4755c56.jpg?crop=302px%2C0px%2C903px%2C475px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-10-02T16:16:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-29T14:13:57+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lauren Conrad Enjoys \u2018Sunday Snuggles\u2019 With Son Liam: Pic", "description": "Lauren Conrad captured her 2-month-old son Liam\u2019s cute snooze on Sunday, October 1\u2014 see the adorable pic!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/lauren-conrad-9f9fc8e7-860c-4c12-bccc-c67ad4755c56.jpg?crop=302px%2C0px%2C903px%2C475px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1506960960.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
