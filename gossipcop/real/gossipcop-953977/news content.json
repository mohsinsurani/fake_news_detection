And if the fictional country's reigning leaders have anything to say about it, \"Princess Diaries 3\" will make it to the big screen.\n\nJulie Andrews, who played Mia's grandmother -- Queen Clarisse Renaldi, obviously -- told Buzzfeed that both she and Anne Hathaway would love to do a third installment of the franchise.\n\n\"There's talk about it,\" she said. \"And [Hathaway]'s very keen to do it. I would very willingly and happily do it.\"\n\nThe last the world heard such an update was in March 2016, when beloved director Garry Marshall told People that he, Andrews and Hathaway were actively discussing the exciting subject: \"I was with Anne Hathaway a few weeks ago,\" he said. \"It looks like we want to do 'Princess Diaries 3' in Manhattan.\"\n\nUnfortunately, Marshall unexpectedly passed away in July 2016 at age 81, and discussions, of course, paused indefinitely. But Andrews now confirms that she and Hathaway have had at least one conversation about it -- and it's pretty promising!\n\nPREMIERE\n\n\"I think we might do it in honor of him,\" she said of Marshall. \"Annie had an idea that she wanted to pursue about it, and I'm all for it, so if she'd like to...\"\n\nIf it moves forward, the film would be absent of another big name: Legendary singer Whitney Houston co-produced both the original film and its sequel. She died in February 2012.\n\nBut -- and this is mostly wishful thinking -- there could be a totally unexpected hero: None other than Shonda Rhimes wrote the screenplay for \"The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement.\" Come on, Shonda! Get on board for \"Princess Diaries 3\"!\n\nRELATED: See photos of Anne Hathaway through the years", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190830/aol-logo.svg",
