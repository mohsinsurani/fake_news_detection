Also, Miz and Maryse sold their house by accident. This week: NONE OF THAT MATTERS, BECAUSE RUSEV WITH A PIG. And now, the most bizarre and wonderful moments from season seven, episode five of Total Divas.\n\nPIGS In a move that immediately puts Alexa and Nia into the Total Divas Hall of Fame (not that they weren\u2019t already in there through four strong, STRONG episodes), Alexa wants to go to a pig farm and get a pet pig. After some wonderful pig farm footage, including Alexa\u2019s privates being endangered by a spiky fence, she adopts a pig named Larry Steve. They later bring this pig to Rusev\u2019s Name Day party (more on that shortly), and the name \u201cLarry Steve\u201d tickles Rusev no end. Everything about the pig tickles Rusev. \u201cHe makes like pig noises! He\u2019s so small! It\u2019s hilarious!\u201d Can\u2019t get enough of Rusev with a damn pig. As you\u2019d expect. PERFECT. Horses Are Just Like Wrestling The Bellas are really missing being in a WWE ring, so they think maybe they\u2019ll get their competition fix by doing a bunch of different activities. They try skateboarding, with predictably disastrous results, and then go with a big group to the race track to watch the horsies. JJ\u2019s weird fascination with red suits make a return here, and the JJ stuff has really been missing since Total Bellas wrapped up its second season. Just kidding; JJ can go pound sand. Being at the race track really ramps up the Bellas homesickness for WWE, because of \u2026 the crowd? Big beefy animals? Who can say. Brie is so bitten by the wrestling bug that she goes to train with Nia under the watchful eyes of Bryan and Nikki. Brie is determined to make her comeback as soon as humanly possible, and she and Nikki celebrate by toasting hilariously enormous wine glasses and Nikki saying that this will be like the \u201cChinese dictionary\u201d (she means \u201ccalendar\u201d) and this will be the Year of the Bella. This is the best show, everyone. AIN\u2019T NEVER LOST.\n\n", "images": ["https://uproxx.com/wp-content/themes/uproxx/assets/images/logo-prowrestling.png?v=1.1.21", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rusev-never-wave.jpg?w=650", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8430760&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cj=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/snoop-dogg-all-elite-wrestling-grid.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Meiko-Satomura.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/wrestlers-grid-uproxx.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/NXT.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/vaccine-delivery.jpg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/FaaDKjVUEAE1pxB.jpeg?w=328&h=185&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-73t-O7FWprUTo.gif"], "top_img": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rusev-never-wave.jpg?w=650", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bill Hanstock", "Raj Prashad", "Jessica Toomer", "Derrick Rossignol", "Elle Collins", "Contributing Writer"], "canonical_link": "https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/total-divas-season-7-episode-5-recap/", "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2018Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week", "meta_data": {"description": "This week, RUSEV WITH A PIG.", "keywords": "prowrestling, sports, rusev, total divas, total divas recap, wwe total divas", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@UPROXX", "creator": "@UPROXX", "widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2018Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week", "text": {"title": "The Most Outrageous \u2018Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week"}, "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rusev-never-wave.jpg?w=640", "alt": "Rusev never wave"}}, "qc": {"post": "total-divas-season-7-episode-5-recap", "author": "Bill Hanstock", "section": "prowrestling", "primary_tag": "total-divas"}, "google-site-verification": "370ZQZwYhpp3OFLpudIZ11ONRN8X1ZhGglPMAFJ6GKw", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The Most Outrageous \u2019Total Divas\u2019 Moments Of The Week", "url": "https://uproxx.com/prowrestling/total-divas-season-7-episode-5-recap/", "description": "This week, RUSEV WITH A PIG.", "site_name": "UPROXX", "image": {"identifier": "https://uproxx.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/rusev-never-wave.jpg?w=650", "width": 650, "height": 400, "alt": "Rusev never wave"}, "locale": {"identifier": "en_US", "alternate": "en_GB"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-07T22:36:42+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-03-19T11:14:28+00:00", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UPROXX"}, "fb": {"admins": "680207693,2208604", "app_id": 117400151618132, "pages": 116548701336}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512686202.0, "source": "https://uproxx.com", "summary": ""}
