Just when you think you have her all figured out, the Disney Channel alum does a total 180 and switches things up on her fans. So to celebrate our brand-new artist evolution column, we figured taking a look back at all her music would be the perfect way to kick things off.\n\nFrom releasing the ultimate pop jam \"One and the Same\" to accompany one of her first Disney Channel Original Movies in 2009 with Demi Lovato to doing the ultimate Revival for her 2015 album and working with A$AP Rocky, there\u2019s no type of music Selena isn\u2019t afraid to explore. Most recently she dabbled with the likes of EDM as she released her newest single \u201cIt Ain\u2019t Me\u201d with DJ Kygo, who also worked with her collaborator Charlie Puth. Now as she teased new music from the studio over the weekend on Instagram, we can\u2019t help but wonder what she\u2019ll surprise us with next.\n\nThe star certainly has her way of keeping people guessing. As you wait for her to wow you with her next hit, get lost in our roundup of all her tracks. (We\u2019ll even take you all the way to her humble beginnings on Barney and Friends. Yes, the one and only purple dinosaur.) Selena has more than proved that she always has something completely different in store for her followers, which may be the very reason why they\u2019re so devoted to her. Click through and let the nostalgia hit you hard.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58caba29993e01419ae57c98/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-501007472.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cab97e993e01419ae57c95/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/01.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633f1aa2038a40336b350a05/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cab9e634fff6436cff0969/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-177963998.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cabaaf34fff6436cff0971/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-120618588.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58caba1834fff6436cff096d/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-03-16%2520at%252011.57.16%2520AM.png", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cabb2d34fff6436cff097b/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-111706945.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63403a02741d4e9d391116dc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cab9f034fff6436cff096b/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-164429927.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cabab334fff6436cff0973/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-91158922.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63237745c9f3a82503992bf6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cabc1c993e01419ae57c9c/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-587593904.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63360d6c55284445707e12b5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632c651c34ed4e1e15fc9ea3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cac0011e5be536041d893e/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/_fb%20(1).jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/56abec15343eb1d76f90a5dc/master/w_320%2Cc_limit/end-slide-final.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/image/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cac06334fff6436cff0987/16:9/w_320%2Cc_limit/_dip%2520(1).jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6321e445a0f6f5da88ae8667/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cac0011e5be536041d893e/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/_fb%20(1).jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Isis Briones"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/selena-gomez-artist-music-evolution", "title": "Selena Gomez's Artist Evolution, From Disney Channel Dream to 'Revival' Ruler", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "From Disney Channel to her latest EDM hit with DJ Kygo, check out Selena Gomez's full artist evolution here!", "id": "58caafdf1e5be536041d8927", "keywords": "selena gomez, music,kygo,disney,disney channel,artist evolution", "news_keywords": "selena gomez, music,kygo,disney,disney channel,artist evolution", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "gallery", "parsely-post-id": "58caafdf1e5be536041d8927", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"From Disney Channel to her latest EDM hit with DJ Kygo, check out Selena Gomez's full artist evolution here!\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cabfd134fff6436cff0983/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/_tout%20(1).jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cabfd134fff6436cff0983/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/_tout%20(1).jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "We're taking you all the way back.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cac0011e5be536041d893e/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/_fb%20(1).jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "The Artist Evolution of Selena Gomez: From Disney Channel Dream to 'Revival' Ruler", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/gallery/selena-gomez-artist-music-evolution"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-03-16T16:43:30.871Z", "modified_time": "2017-03-16T16:43:30.871Z", "author": "Isis Briones"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "We're taking you all the way back.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/58cac0011e5be536041d893e/16:9/w_2580,c_limit/_fb%20(1).jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "The Artist Evolution of Selena Gomez: From Disney Channel Dream to 'Revival' Ruler"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489682610.871, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
