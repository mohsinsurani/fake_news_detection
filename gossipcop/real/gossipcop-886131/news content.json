White tee. High-waisted jeans. Red lipstick. Tracee proves why this classic look will never go out of style, with the trendy addition of white nails and pumps to put trendy punctuation on the whole thing.\n\n04 of 143 ROSARIO DAWSON Ray Tamarra/GC Images A beach-ready floral maxi is instantly more polished with a pair of striking statement earrings like these Atelier Swarovsi x Peter Pilotto danglers, plus a pristine dove-gray pump (hers are Tamara Mellon).\n\n06 of 143 KATE BOSWORTH Sharky/Splash News Online And here's how you do jeans and a white top the influencer way: By teaming your oversized button-up with an aggressively trendy pair of mom jeans (hers are Citizens of Humanity), and adding a suede By Far pump and teeny Rochas crossbody too small to fit a phone. (Don't forget the coral lip and round shades for the finishing touches.)\n\n07 of 143 KATHERINE HEIGL Edward Opi / Splash News Online You've been hearing \"pair a tough moto with a sweet floral\" for years now - and if this flirty pairing on Katherine (in a Rebecca Minkoff jacket) doesn't convince you to try it, we don't know what will. It would be cute with sneakers and a crossbody, too!\n\n08 of 143 CHARLOTTE LE BON Felipe Ramales / Splash News Online The Kardashians brought back the Champion sweatshirt, but Charlotte gave it that French girl sophistication. With tight jeans, mirrored Krewe shades and lace-up Christian Louboutin combat boots, plus a floor-grazing Self-Portrait duster over all of it, the burgundy hoodie suddenly looks like the chicest staple in your closet. (Plus: We love that she's toting a practical Madewell mini-backpack with it all!)\n\n09 of 143 ANNE HATHAWAY James Devaney/GC Images The star mixes two cheery spring motifs - cherry-red checks on her Mansur Gavriel bag and bright florals on her belted, thrifted day dress - for a pitch-perfect April outfit punctuated with \"yay, it's warm out\" crimson Christian Louboutin heels.\n\n10 of 143 OLIVIA CULPO Pressphotodirect/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images A $2,300 Atelier Swarovski necklace adds a festive finishing touch to an otherwise low-key tee and button-front scalloped skirt, though you could make an equal impact with a fun under-$50 find from BaubleBar.\n\n11 of 143 PRIYANKA CHOPRA James Devaney/GC Images A ladylike tweed blazer (worn with a Wolford bodysuit) is the perfect contrast to shredded boyfriend denim. A wine lip and cream Aquazzura heels are flattering finishing touches.\n\n12 of 143 LUCY HALE FameFlynet The easiest way to try tricky trends is in a very simple color palette - just check out how effortlessly Lucy Hale mixes and matches heeled Mercedes Castillo mules, frayed-hem BlankNYC jeans, a croc crossbody (which, like her sweater, is Elizabeth and James) and cat-eye Sunday Somewhere sunglasses. all in shades of black, white and gray.\n\n13 of 143 LENA DUNHAM Splash News Online She's on set, but that doesn't mean we can't covet her character's wardrobe; we love how the burgundy velvet of her Mary Janes plays off the accents in the print of her dress, and the bucket bag adds to the sweetly retro vibe.\n\n14 of 143 GABRIELLE UNION TheStewartofNY/Splash News Online Can camo be chic? Gabrielle seeks to answer that question with a resounding \"yes\" by pairing her Unravel Project joggers with a cropped turtleneck, Stephanie Rad bomber, structured Les Petits Joueurs bag and stacked-heel sandals.\n\n15 of 143 JESSICA BIEL Splash News Online A fitted pair of Parker Smith skinnies serves as a sexy base for the more prim elements of Jessica's outfit, including her lace turtleneck, ivory blazer and Roger Vivier buckled espadrilles.\n\n16 of 143 FREIDA PINTO AKM-GSI A fire-engine red suit (like her Topshop one, which you can buy for under $200!) is going to command a ton of attention without a whole lot of effort. Since all eyes will be on you, making sure yours fits perfectly and is well-ironed is key - and then you can add easy accessories, like some fun sunglasses or a patent loafer to make it all look a lot more effortless than it was.\n\n17 of 143 JULIANNE HOUGH MEGA Your boyfriend might not automatically peg your high-waisted jeans as his favorite thing in your wardrobe, but with glowy skin and an off-the-shoulder top, we bet you can convince him to change his mind. (Bonus: They make your butt look outstanding.)\n\n18 of 143 RUTH WILSON Toughen up a floaty, flirty, retro-inspired polka-dot dress with a studded moto jacket (hers are both Altuzarra) and pin-thin stilettos.\n\n19 of 143 JESSICA ALBA Jackson Lee / Splash News Online Her favorite Vince sneakers are the perfect foundation for her many long layers, including a teal Sandro coat worn under a Narciso Rodriguez coat, all over some boyfriend jeans.\n\n20 of 143 EMMA ROBERTS JLM / Splash News Online Lace-up peasant-style boots are going to be in everywhere this year (blame the '90s revival). They look extra on-trend when contrasted with a super-girlie paisley dress and a boxy rose-pink Madewell jacket. (And yes, those are the millenial-fave Elizabeth and James sunglasses you spy.)\n\n21 of 143 KERI RUSSELL PG / Splash News Online Got an amazing pair of shoes you want to show off? They look especially killer with a pair of vintage jeans and a tuxedo blazer, as Keri demonstrates.\n\n22 of 143 KATE MARA FameFlynet Athleisure can be a little tricky to pull off without looking like you're really just going straight to the drugstore to buy some Tylenol PM. Kate manages by adding chic, quirky accessories (including her Steven Alan shades) and flashing a little deliberate skin.\n\n23 of 143 JESSICA ALBA Image Press Agency/Splash News Online Her Honest Company line is sold at Target, so it makes sense that she's a pro at shopping their shelves - her cute outfit is made up of a bee-print button-up from Victoria's Beckham's soon-to-launch line and a $24.99 bag from the retailer's Who What Wear collaboration, plus some killer striped platforms from Loeffler Randall.\n\n24 of 143 OLIVIA MUNN PG/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images If it's still a little chilly to wear your mini out on the town (hers is Naked Wardrobe) but you've just gotta take it out of your closet, pair it with a coat in a similar shade and some amazing over-the-knee boots, like her Stuart Weitzman pair, for a look that's sophisticated, sexy and still pretty warm.\n\n26 of 143 GABRIELLE UNION Aaron Davidson/Getty A pretty, girlie dress (hers is from her collaboration with New York & Company) gets a boost from some quirky accessories, like her tri-tone strappy heels and her patch-adorned tophandle bag.\n\n27 of 143 LILY COLLINS FameFlynet A slouchy day-off ensemble (relaxed Parker Smith flares, a front-tied tee, a long cardi) gets a bit of a style boots from her wine lip and metallic mules - which are only $79 at Nine West! That brand-new Chanel bag certainly doesn't hurt, either.\n\n28 of 143 SASHA LANE Donato Sardella/Getty Because an A-line silhouette is the easiest shape dress for any body type to pull off, it's a great base for fun details, like the embroidery on her Coach & Rodarte dress and her pearl-accented Nicholas Kirkwood heels.\n\n29 of 143 DIANE KRUGER Andrew Toth/Getty If you're feeling gutsy enough to pull off a full velvet suit (like her Frame style), it would be difficult to do it more chicly than she does with her sleek turtleneck and pointed booties.\n\n30 of 143 REESE WITHERSPOON AKM-GSI Your black leather jacket is already on permanent rotation in your wardrobe. Why not welcome spring with a shell-pink one, which goes with all the same pieces you already own, but looks super-fresh when paired with a pop of fuchsia or a floral (Draper James, of course) bag.\n\n31 of 143 KIERNAN SHIPKA RW/MediaPunch/IPX High-waisted flares aren't going anywhere, but Kiernan shows an updated take that's more haute than hippie, wearing her polished black trousers with a fuzzy striped sweater (both Bella Freud) and bomber. Pink-rimmed Garrett Leight x Clare V. sunglasses keep it youthful.\n\n32 of 143 HILARY DUFF SMXRF/Star Max/GC Images A cozy, textured mock turtleneck, worn-in brown booties and a logo duffel give Hilary's Parker Smith skinnies a low-key '60s chic feel.\n\n33 of 143 SELENA GOMEZ AKM-GSI As if you couldn't get any more excited about florals for spring, seeing the way Selena wore her Coach floral varsity jacket with super-cropped J Brand jeans (fun fact: she chopped 'em herself!) may do it.\n\n34 of 143 CLAIRE DANES Michael Rozman/Warner Bros. The lively print of Claire's Victoria Beckham sheath gives a sedate silhouette a fun twist \u2014 as does the coordinating oxblood hue of her Jimmy Choo heels and lipstick.\n\n35 of 143 SHAY MITCHELL Pacific Coast News If her black mules are giving you flashbacks to those Steve Madden shoes everyone had, well, that's intentional, and on-trend. Pair yours with torn \"mom jeans\" and a cool jacket (hers is BlankNYC, and under $200!) to make sure your whole outfit doesn't trigger Y2K flashbacks in your friends.\n\n36 of 143 ALEXA CHUNG Splash News Cop some of Alexa's London style by mixing a preppy cableknit with a retro ponyhair animal print jacket and finishing the whole thing off with the perfect Chelsea boot.\n\n37 of 143 LEA MICHELE Michael Rozman/Warner Bros. A long-sleeve midi dress with a punchy floral is the perfect outfit for when you're ready for spring but the weather isn't quite there with you yet. Lea's Saloni dress (same style, different print here) would look adorable with a trench and pumps if you need to warm it up further.\n\n38 of 143 JAMIE CHUNG Michael Kovac/Getty A denim jumpsuit is the perfect canvas for your favorite accessories - Jamie sets her off with a red lip, red-striped belt and red suede Elizabeth and James crossbody.\n\n39 of 143 MANDY MOORE Splash News Online Get in on this spring's \"mom jean\" trend with a very wearable slim-legged, high-waist style (like her Citizens of Humanity pair). Add a slightly cropped top, cool sneakers and a chic, sleek bag and you'll end up with a look that's totally trendy, rather than trend victim.\n\n40 of 143 PRINCESS KATE Chris Jackson/Getty Kate's whole look is Chanel, but you could get a similar vibe with an A-line dress and some vintage or vintage-inspired accessories for a polished but surprising way to wow at your next meeting.\n\n41 of 143 ELIZABETH OLSEN Christopher Peterson/Splash News Online If you're brave enough to wear a white coat in unpredictable spring weather (as Elizabeth is in Sportmax) you could embrace its graphic feel by wearing it with a black turtleneck, black boots and a white satchel.\n\n42 of 143 ALI LARTER Rachel Murray/Getty Got a gorgeous dress that you want to dress down a bit? Do as Ali did with her plunging Jenni Kayne number by topping it with a boyfriend-style shirt (also Jenni Kayne) tied in front. Thick-strap sandals and a choker play up the cool (rather than fancy) factor.\n\n43 of 143 JENNIFER HUDSON Splash News Online We love Jennifer's purple lip as the perfect punctuation to all the trends she's combined (a celeb-loved varsity jacket, denim mini and high suede boots).\n\n44 of 143 VICTORIA JUSTICE Paul Archuleta/FilmMagic A super-feminine scalloped jacket is playful against a super-shredded pair of jeans, and the red heels (like everything else she's wearing, by Ted Baker) just make the whole thing fun.\n\n45 of 143 HILARY DUFF Bought a silky duster after seeing Kylie Jenner in one, and now you don't know how to wear it? It's a breeze when teamed with a simple blouse, black jeans (hers are Mother Denim) and a pump in the same color family. Delicate accessories (like her Bychari necklace, featuring her son's name) are the perfect finishing touches.\n\n46 of 143 REESE WITHERSPOON Bauergriffin.com/MEGA Give your flirty sundress a little edge before spring fully arrives by adding some chunky booties, a studded crossbody and a cool hat.\n\n47 of 143 MANDY MOORE Gilbert Carrasquillo/GC Images Leopard and red are two of those color combinations that go together as well as, well, Mandy Moore and \"Candy.\" But when they're worn as accents (as in her bag and Jenni Kayne mules) to a neutral outfit, the effect is casually cool rather than drop-dead sexy.\n\n48 of 143 KATHARINE MCPHEE MEGA The graphic lines of her stacked heels echo the stripes of her midi skirt, and a pale pink bag adds an element of surprise to an otherwise black-and-white outfit.\n\n49 of 143 EMMA WATSON Sharky/Polite Paparazzi/Splash Add a tough edge to a micromini with classic Doc Marten-style boots and an oversized moto. (And top it all off with classic shades like her Krewe pair.)\n\n50 of 143 KELLY RIPA Noam Galai/WireImage Flare sleeves will be everywhere this spring, and Kelly's way to sport them (in clean stripes, with tailored pants and a pop-of-color heel) is particularly sophisticated.\n\n51 of 143 KARLIE KLOSS FameFlynet A dash of red suede adds a ladylike touch to her head-to-toe menswear vibe.\n\n52 of 143 JESSICA BIEL Splash News Online Give your go-to winter outfit (blazer, flats, tote - hers is Etienne Aigner) a fresh feel for spring by swapping out your blacks and navys for camels, tans and metallics.\n\n53 of 143 HILARY DUFF FameFlynet Cropped jeans look extra flirty with a suede bootie and a silky top.\n\n54 of 143 OLIVIA CULPO Kell Taub/BFA/REX/Shutterstock A glittery Zuhair Murad blazer and high-shine Kenneth Cole boots punch up the most basic jeans-and-tee ensemble.\n\n55 of 143 EMMA WATSON Michael Rozman/Warner Bros. If the phrase \"party shirt\" didn't exist before now, we're inventing it, because it prefectly describes the girlie salmon bow-tied top Emma wears with cigarette pants (also Oscar de la Renta).\n\n56 of 143 SOFIA VERGARA FameFlynet The new classic look is a distressed jean paired with a chic tweed jacket (hers is St. John) with bonus points for elegant accessories.\n\n57 of 143 BELLA HADID Beretta/Sims/REX/Shutterstock Whether you're going to fully embrace Parisian style (as Bella did in her Charlotte Simone beret) or not, the bones of this outfit - a white tee, black skirt, white sneakers and a black-and-white coat (hers is Manning Cartell) - are tr\u00e8s chic.\n\n58 of 143 KARLIE KLOSS Edward Berthelot/Getty Karlie's whole ensemble, from the feminine full skirt to the razor-sharp stilettos, has a fun retro feel. But she keeps it feeling of-the-moment with a graphic tee and funky sunglasses.\n\n59 of 143 MIRANDA KERR AKM-GSI Missing your denim jacket but feel like it's a summer-only item? Miranda shows how chic (and cold-weather appropriate) it can look when paired with leather skinnies, a cropped sweater and a low heel.\n\n60 of 143 NAOMI WATTS BG004/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images In our next life, we'd love to be rocking the newest bag from Chanel before it hits stores with slides and a cute blazer. But in this one, we can still pull together this perfect-for-work outfit (wear her $60 Vans slides to commute, then swap in heels) with stuff from our closet (like her Etnia Barcelona shades), no celebrity connections required.\n\n61 of 143 SARAH PAULSON Phillip Faraone/Patrick McMullan via Getty The silhouettes (the jacket, the A-line skirt, the Tamara Mellon pumps) are all understated - it's the details (the leopard print, the sheer panels, the multiple straps) that makes this outfit both sexy and memorable.\n\n62 of 143 JORDANA BREWSTER ZUMA Jeans with a shredded hem (like her Madewell pair) are surprisingly versatile, as long as you can flash a little skin. We like the way she teamed hers with stacked sandals and a leather jacket, but an ankle bootie would work well too.\n\n63 of 143 JULIANNE HOUGH Play up the sporty vibe of a striped dress by picking a flat with an athletic silhouette, tying a button-up around your waist and going hands-free with a bag like her FashionABLE crossbody.\n\n64 of 143 JENNA DEWAN-TATUM BG005/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images Bodysuits aren't just for Kardashian-esque, super-sexy outfits. Jenna gives her Danskin leotard a weekend-ready vibe with a long, cozy duster and distressed jeans, and keeps things polished with impeccable accessories (including squeaky-clean white sneakers and a Senreve bag).\n\n65 of 143 AUBREY PLAZA Aubrey wore her Elizabeth and James dress (available here in white) with heels on TV, but we actually like the fresh feeling of the chic Tory Burch Oxfords and Lavish Alice coat she added to step out of the studio.\n\n67 of 143 OLIVIA PALERMO Timur Emek/GC Images Leather pants like Olivia's Paige pair don't automatically have to be super-nighttime. With an oversized blazer, trendy scarf and classic Jimmy Choo booties, they're as versatile and comfortable as jeans.\n\n68 of 143 EMMY ROSSUM Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock The intricate lacework on the sleeves and hem - which reminds us of paper snowflakes! - makes a white dress even more winter-appropriate. And suede accessories are excellent seasonal accents.\n\n69 of 143 OLIVIA CULPO A high-neck dress packs plenty of wow factor when it comes in a clingy knit and bombshell shade, like this lipstick-red midi. And yes, red can be hard to accessorize - but we think Olivia nailed it in her two tone beige-and-gold heels and matching gold clutch.\n\n70 of 143 KATE UPTON The Sports Illustrated Swim cover girl makes covering up look just as sexy as a bikini, thanks to her blend of textures (a furry Thakoon coat, ruffled top, second-skin Stephanie Rad leather pants and glossy Tamara Mellon boots.)\n\n71 of 143 ISSA RAE Earl Gibson III/Getty The Insecure star plays up the beachy vibes of her embroidered halter with a pearlescent aqua Edie Parker clutch, opal earrings by Dvani (with rings by Le Vian and John Hardy) and an off-center half bun.\n\n72 of 143 KATE BOSWORTH Dave Benett/Getty Got a dress that's super twee, like Kate does (hers is Woody Woodpecker x House of Holland)? Ground it with minimal makeup and chunky boots.\n\n73 of 143 CHARLIZE THERON Frank Sullivan/Splash News Want to give major \"incognito movie star\" vibes no matter where you're going? Take a cue from Charlize, who wears a monochromatic outfit (including L'Agence leather leggings, a silk top and Saint Laurent bag) with luxe extras, from her cat-eye shades to Anita Ko earrings to her perfectly on-point pumps.\n\n74 of 143 SELENA GOMEZ Pierre Suu/GC Images On the other side of the \"movie star\" spectrum is Selena, who is unmissable in her floral print party dress, Coach varsity jacket, ankle-strap stilettos and ruby-tinted Garrett Leight x Clare V. frames.\n\n75 of 143 CAMILLA BELLE AKM-GSI Great boots and a bag make even the easiest outfit - a slouchy turtleneck and a bun - feel deliberate.\n\n76 of 143 KARLIE KLOSS INSTARimages A full leather skirt is feminine but tough, and classic add-ons like a striped tee and single-sole pumps are the perfect pieces to play up that vibe.\n\n77 of 143 JENNY SLATE Sam Deitch/BFA/REX/Shutterstock Dying for a pair of statement booties but not sure what to wear them with? You can't go wrong with a classic ringer tee and skinny jeans (everything she's wearing is Madewell).\n\n78 of 143 CATE BLANCHETT Or if you're feeling a little bolder, pair your booties with a bunch of standout pieces - like Cate does with her lucite-heel pair, adding a head-turning handbag, cropped jacket and oversize Tod's shades.\n\n79 of 143 AMY ADAMS FameFlynet Your perfect weekend errands-running outfit is here, and it's extra cute thanks to the pretty print top and just-right cuffed jeans.\n\n80 of 143 CHANEL IMAN Owen Kolasinski/BFA/REX/Shutterstock With strappy Stella Luna heels, Chanel's silky wrap top and high-waisted cropped pants (actually a jumpsuit that, like her coat, is Elisabetta Franchi) are ready to party. Add pumps, though, and suddenly this is a fun Friday work outfit.\n\n81 of 143 ALESSANDRA AMBROSIO AKM-GSI An outfit that is both cozy and sexy is a hard one to get right. But Alessandra nails it by paring this Rails sweaterdress with thigh-high Stuart Weitzman boots and a chic Les Petits Jouers bag.\n\n82 of 143 MIRANDA KERR When you're taking the pair of jeans you designed out for a test drive, you want to get your outfit exactly right - and Miranda does just that, pairing her Miranda + Mother high-waist pair with a sheer striped top, logo belt and casually draped tuxedo jacket.\n\n83 of 143 CHARLIZE THERON FameFlynet Perfect-fit black jeans (hers are J Brand) are by far the most versatile thing in your wardrobe - they can be dressed up or down, and add a little glamour to more menswear-inspired items like an oversize blazer or chunky boots.\n\n84 of 143 KATE MARA MEGA You may want to book a trip to somewhere warm just so you can wear this playful, picnic-inspired look. A girlie eyelet HVN dress takes on a tomboy edge with anoversized denim jacket and lace-up white sneakers.\n\n85 of 143 LOUISE ROE Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock Though this jumpsuit would look equally cute dressed down with sneakers and studs, we love the way she glammed it up with a Jimmy Choo clutch and heels and long, on-trend statement earrings.\n\n86 of 143 GIGI HADID Robert Kamau/GC Images She designed that shearling coat with Tommy Hilfger, so she has a vested interest in making sure it looks good. And she achieves her goal by pairing it with some second-skin Frame moto leggings and a fuzzy clutch.\n\n87 of 143 PRIYANKA CHOPRA FameFlynet Florals on a white background look so right for February when they're in a slightly sparse print, like Priyanka's Marni dress, and paired with coordinating Christian Louboutin heels, a Ralph Lauren Collection coat and Garrett Leight sunglasses.\n\n88 of 143 KATE HUDSON FameFlynet Kate continues to singlehandedly work to make you want a pair of flare jeans like her J Brand pair - this time showing how sexy they can be with a plunging top, tuxedo blazer and a hint of leopard platform peeking out at the hem.\n\n89 of 143 JESSICA BIEL FameFlynet We bet you didn't know how much you need a striped coat until now - but after seeing the polished vibe it gives Jessica's loose separates (those Louise et Cie loafers and Oliver Peoples sunglasses help too), we don't know how we ever lived without one either.\n\n90 of 143 LEA MICHELE FameFlynet Bronze heels are the perfect unexpected accompaniment to a slightly boho print dress (hers is Etro).\n\n91 of 143 KERRY WASHINGTON Sonia Recchia/Getty Thought all-black would be boring? Kerry proves the key to a killer monochromatic look is mixing shapes and textures (and making sure her face is flawless, since it's the focal point of the look).\n\n92 of 143 JULIANNE HOUGH INSTAR Two style blogger staples - a half bun and an oversize cardigan - give a casual vibe to Julianne's otherwise sexy skintight J Brand jeans and over-the-knee boots. (And yes, that's a Fitbit she's wearing around her neck.)\n\n93 of 143 EMMA ROBERTS AKM-GSI You've got all the basic components of this outfit - the cropped peacoat, the striped tee, the skinny jeans (hers are Citizens of Humanity), the classic black bag (hers is Senreve). Isn't it time to invest in the outfit-making red booties too?\n\n94 of 143 NINA DOBREV Splash News Online The actress offsets the super-flirty hemline of her geometric-print Armani mini with a moto jacket draped over her shoulders and demure, chunky-heeled L.K. Bennett pumps.\n\n95 of 143 FREIDA PINTO Photographer Group / Splash News Online Showing how well black jeans transition from work to weekend, the star tops hers with an ivory blouse, textured blazer and a red lip for a look that works as well on as off the clock.\n\n96 of 143 KATE HUDSON Pacific Coast News Show off (or fake!) an hourglass shape by tucking a breezy knit into some high-waist flares. Kate plays up the retro vibe of her look with platform heels, round sunglasses and a Jimmy Choo messenger bag, but you could give it a totally different vibe with a braid, backpack and pointy heels.\n\n97 of 143 SARAH PAULSON Ray Tamarra/GC Images Need to make your trusty LBD pop? Do as Sarah does in her Co A-line dress: add high-shine metallic earrings (hers are Veronika Borchers x Pearl Collective) and a chic print pump (like her Kurt Geiger London pair).\n\n98 of 143 OLIVIA PALERMO Neil Warner / Splash News Online When are leggings appropriate for air travel? When they're leather leggings (like Olivia's J Brand pair). She wears hers with a slouchy Iris von Arnim turtleneck (cozy!) and sporty white jacket (brave, but we bet she's flying private!).\n\n99 of 143 JESSICA BIEL FameFlynet Got $25? Then you can snag Jessica's perfect gray sweater from Forever 21 and wear it with, well, anything - though we love how she styled it with preppy classics including an Etienne Aigner tote and glossy black Louise et Cie loafers.\n\n100 of 143 TERESA PALMER Navigating Sundance's \"cozy but chic\" dress code can be tricky. Teresa pulls it off effortlessly by layering a button-up between two supersoft knit pieces, then adding opaque Josie Natori tights and flat Tod's booties.\n\n101 of 143 LUCY HALE Bauer-Griffin/GC Images The Pretty Little Liars star makes jeans and a tee way more than just jeans and a tee thanks to her chic accessories, including a blush bomber, black boots and trendy Smoke x Mirrors sunglasses.\n\n102 of 143 GABRIELLE UNION Jackson Lee/Splash News Online Gabrielle is here to convince you that sandals are appropriate 365 days a year, especially if they are as cute as her \"Liloka\" Schutz style, which she pairs with cropped white trousers, a navy Vince turtleneck, matching coat and Haze sunglasses.\n\n103 of 143 KOURTNEY KARDASHIAN Splash News Online The more rips the better appears to be the KarJenner denim philosophy, as Kourtney proves true in her overly distressed jeans teamed with an AS by DF velvet blazer (sans shirt underneath), coordinating velvet booties and a Louis Vuitton backpack, for a '90s fashion fantasy come to life.\n\n104 of 143 CHRISSY TEIGEN Starzfly/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images While some travel in their yoga pants and running sneakers, Chrissy travels in her striped draped ATM Collection sweater (on sale now!), black skinnies, her chicest ankle boots, a Chanel bag and cool-girl fedora.\n\n105 of 143 ABIGAIL SPENCER AKM-GSI Running errands looks effortlessly more chic when you're wearing a pair of leather pants, white Adidas sneakers, a striped La Ligne NYC shirt and the perfect bomber courtesy The Arrivals.

Super dark-wash, slightly flared denim (hers are Mother), a black turtleneck and a strappy pare of pumps fits that bill.\n\n116 of 143 EMMA STONE Kevin Winter/Getty If you're still in a climate that will tolerate bare legs, you might as well make the most of it by picking sunny, citrus-y brights that play off each other (like her Giambattista Valli mini and tomato-red Tyler Ellis x Petra Flannery clutch).\n\n117 of 143 KATE BECKINSALE SMXRF/Star Max/GC Images Leather pants (Kate's are J Brand) don't always to be edgy! When paired with a silky jacket and scarf-neck blouse, they're downright ladylike.\n\n118 of 143 GWYNETH PALTROW Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock And regular leggings don't have to be relegated to the \"not pants\" pile - Gwyneth's $17.99 pair from H&M look totally chic when tucked into luxe knee-high boots and worn under a coat with rich, tactile cuffs.\n\n119 of 143 SOFIA VERGARA MEGA Jeans, a tee and a comfy cardigan (hers is Karen Kane) look great with pretty much any accessories under the sun - we like the mix of textures in her tan quilted bag and suede booties.\n\n120 of 143 EMMY ROSSUM Bauer-Griffin A striped shirt is a timeless basic, but a striped turtleneck is the basic you need right now.\n\n121 of 143 ALESSANDRA AMBROSIO KCS Presse / Splash News Online A black turtleneck can be worn a million different ways, but we love the French girl-chic variation rocked by Alessandra here - the sheer maxi, chain-studded moto and geometric earrings make for one instant classic outfit.\n\n122 of 143 EMMA ROBERTS AKM-GSI This is how we always think we look when we walk out of the house all bundled up. The star is cute and cozy from her head (clad in a Max Mara beanie) to her shoulders (in an Inhabit scarf, J Brand crop top, Express jacket and Elisabeth Weinstock purse) to her knees and toes (wearing Dear Frances boots).\n\n123 of 143 VICTORIA JUSTICE Daniel Zuchnik/GC Images A hot pink soft wool trench like her Ted Baker style makes any outfit pop - but we like that she gave hers some \"Grease\" vibes with leather pants, sassy Sam Edelman heels and cat-eye Jonathan Adler shades.\n\n124 of 143 MANDY MOORE FameFlynet A striped tee and cigarette pants is the perfect base for tons of outfits. From there, you can add quirky accessories, like Mandy's backless red loafers, cheery tiered jacket and Perverse sunglasses.\n\n125 of 143 MINDY KALING Alessio Botticelli/FilmMagic Mindy may be filming Ocean's Eight, but she is also giving you your work outfit inspiration for the week. We love the way the cherry red of her blouse and belt coordinates with her coat, and the black pumps are all business but would work equally well for after-work drinks.\n\n126 of 143 KATE BOSWORTH A super-girlie Swiss dotted sheer dress (hers is just $58 from the Kohl's k/lab collection!) gets a little kick from some bold accessories, including her patent booties, chunky belt and Salvatore Ferragamo bucket bag.\n\n127 of 143 NAOMIE HARRIS Felipe Ramales / Splash News Online A way to winterize your favorite summer pieces that isn't simply \"add black tights?\" Try jewel-tone embellished flats and a luxe coat like her Burberry cashmere trench.\n\n128 of 143 MICHELLE OBAMA Olivier Douliery/ABACA/AP You don't always have to default to green or sequins for your holiday party attire! Rich, deep cobalt and pretty brocade prints look just as festive (and silver shoes add a party feel to any outfit). Plus, when all else fails: put a bow on it.\n\n129 of 143 ALESSANDRA AMBROSIO One easy way to spice up your favorite jeans-and-sweater airport ensemble: watch our handy GIFs to teach you how to tie a scarf in a new, fun way.\n\n130 of 143 JESSICA ALBA Photographer Group / Splash News Online A long-sleeved print mini is adorable with flats in warmer months, and can be just as flirty in cooler months -- the added coverage of the tights means you can get a little fiercer with the footwear without looking too over-the-top.\n\n131 of 143 MELISSA MCCARTHY Bryan Kasm/HSN A jewel tone top with an embellished collar (hers is from her own line, Melissa McCarthy Seven7), plus black pants and classic black heels, is the perfect work holiday party outfit that will still be cute long into 2017.\n\n132 of 143 EMMA STONE Todd Williamson/Getty Does a print suit sound daunting? Just check out how easy it looks on Emma (hers is Burberry) with a black tank, ankle tie Stella Luna heels and super-minimal jewelry.\n\n133 of 143 PIPPA MIDDLETON Splash News Online Contrast the patrician vibe of a brushed-wool dove gray coat with classic hardware with some slightly edgy buckled boots.\n\n134 of 143 KATE BECKINSALE FameFlynet If you can solve the problem of how to walk without shrugging your scarf off, a large-check number worn as a poncho looks extra-classy over an all-black outfit, cat-eye sunglasses and heels.\n\n135 of 143 LILY COLLINS starzfly/Bauer-Griffin/GC Images Got a lot of holiday travel planned? Eliminate one source of stress with this plane-perfect outfit (from her Parker Smith skinnies to her easy-to-slip-off-at-security booties).\n\n136 of 143 EMMY ROSSUM Billy Farrell/BFA/REX/Shutterstock Brown stretch suede pants are a little advanced, but the good news is, this outfit (including the aforementioned pants, blazer, sweater, boots and clutch, with Lace by Jenny Wu earrings) would look equally adorable with your favorite dark skinny jeans.\n\n137 of 143 REESE WITHERSPOON AKM-GSI This is the Platonic ideal of a Thanksgiving outfit: a classic Fair Isle sweater (hers is Draper James, of course), some jeans with a little give and a festive accessory like a red shoe or bag. It can vibe dressy or casual - so it's perfect for the first Thanksgiving at the potential future in-laws'. (Bonus points for a cute coordinate phone case, like her Minnie & Emma one!)\n\n138 of 143 MICHELLE MONAGHAN AKM-GSI A soft, semi-structured sweater coat like Michelle's Madewell topper will double as a blanket when that turkey-induced couch coma kicks in (and the rest of the outfit, including her Madewell jeans, is comfy but still cool).\n\n139 of 143 OLIVIA CULPO Michael Simon/startraks What's both fashion forward and mashed potatoes-friendly? An oversize sweater and over-the-knee boots (hers are Rampage).\n\n140 of 143 HILARY DUFF Bauer-Griffin A cozy crewneck looks modern and unexpected when tucked into a maxi skirt (note the stretch) and paired with statement earrings like her The2Bandits pair. She wore hers with Ancient Greek sandals, but in colder climates, this would be cute with suede booties as well.\n\n141 of 143 EMMA STONE Michael Rozman / Warner Bros. If your Thanksgiving dinner is a little dressier, go for a jumpsuit - it's basically fancy pajamas, but no one will know. (Emma wore her Michael Kors Collection top and Michael Michael Kors pants with Jennifer Meyer jewelry and Jimmy Choo heels.)\n\n142 of 143 EMMA ROBERTS AKM-GSI Don't want to talk about the election, your dating life or why you're taking seconds? The dinosaur on your sweatshirt will be an awesome conversation piece! (Emma let hers take center stage by pairing it with Citizens of Humanity jeans, sneakers and Garrett Leight x Clare V sunglasses.)", "images":
