The film will also feature Chiwetel Ejiofor as Scar, James Earl Jones as Mufasa, and Alfre Woodard as Sarabi. Actors like John Oliver, Billy Eichner, Seth Rogen, and Eric Andr\u00e9 round out the cast.\n\nDisney\u2019s trend of turning its animated classics into live-action remakes has been a steady part of the studio\u2019s output for years now, with everything from Alice in Wonderland to Beauty and the Beast getting the treatment. But Jon Favreau\u2019s 2016 adaption of The Jungle Book stood out by combining live-action elements along with near-photorealistic computer-generated animals and environments. The result was a technological marvel that felt like it could stand on its own, apart from the nostalgia-fueled interest many of the other remakes have tended to thrive on.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5kpsd9wmUqjoKTf9HrvOIqPMcc=/0x0:3000x2106/1200x628/filters:focal(1305x734:1306x735)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg", "https://www.theverge.com/icons/native-ad-placeholder.png", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2F2bBhonDKKcnDQCBQaLw-ONkrEL8%3D%2F0x0%3A4898x3265%2F100x100%2Ffilters%3Afocal(2449x1633%3A2450x1634)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F22263408%2Fgamestop_stock_hero.jpg&w=2400&q=75", "https://www.theverge.com/_next/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fthumbor%2Fr7FJbei-PPg9atDxFrYkWh1HZD8%3D%2F0x0%3A3000x2106%2F2000x1333%2Ffilters%3Afocal(1305x734%3A1306x735)%2Fcdn.vox-cdn.com%2Fuploads%2Fchorus_asset%2Ffile%2F9589069%2F621183062.jpg&w=2400&q=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5kpsd9wmUqjoKTf9HrvOIqPMcc=/0x0:3000x2106/1200x628/filters:focal(1305x734:1306x735)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryan Bishop"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16596124/disney-the-lion-king-beyonce-cast-announcement", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 will star in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@verge"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "og": {"site_name": "The Verge", "title": "Beyonc\u00e9 will star in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King", "description": "Jon Favreau\u2019s cast just gets more and more impressive", "url": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16596124/disney-the-lion-king-beyonce-cast-announcement", "type": "article", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5kpsd9wmUqjoKTf9HrvOIqPMcc=/0x0:3000x2106/1200x628/filters:focal(1305x734:1306x735)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Verge", "google-site-verification": "IucFf_TKtbFFH8_YeFyEteQIwYPdANM1R46_U9DpAr4", "robots": "index,follow,max-image-preview:large", "description": "Jon Favreau\u2019s cast just gets more and more impressive", "article": {"published_time": "2017-11-02T00:21:21.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-11-02T00:21:21.000Z"}, "author": "Bryan Bishop", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Beyonc\u00e9 will star in Disney\u2019s live-action remake of The Lion King", "parsely-link": "https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/1/16596124/disney-the-lion-king-beyonce-cast-announcement", "parsely-image-url": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/e5kpsd9wmUqjoKTf9HrvOIqPMcc=/0x0:3000x2106/1200x628/filters:focal(1305x734:1306x735)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/9589069/621183062.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-11-02T00:21:21.000Z", "parsely-section": "front-page", "parsely-tags": "verge,front-page,culture,entertainment,film", "parsely-author": "Bryan Bishop", "next-head-count": 31}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509494400.0, "source": "https://www.theverge.com", "summary": ""}
