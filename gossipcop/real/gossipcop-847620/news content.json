And it wasn\u2019t just couples who were do-si-do-ing around the ballroom; Monday\u2019s broadcast also featured the first team dances of Season 27, which added a few extra points to each contestant\u2019s score.\n\nFirst, let\u2019s review the highlights of Country Night:\n\nBEST OF THE NIGHT\n\nDeMarcus Ware and pro Lindsay Arnold (Viennese Waltz) \u2014 I was a little stunned that DeMarcus didn\u2019t earn a perfect score after this Viennese waltz, especially given the judges\u2019 praise. For the last three weeks or so, I\u2019ve found his and Lindsay\u2019s performances to be a bit forgettable, which is why Monday\u2019s dance was doubly pleasant to watch. It was so graceful and tender, and DeMarcus seemed more connected to Lindsay and the choreography than he has since the first week of competition. Judges\u2019 Score: 27/30\n\nBEST OF THE NIGHT (RUNNER-UP)\n\nEvanna Lynch and pro Keo Motsepe (Rumba) \u2014 Season 27 has delivered very unpredictable eliminations thus far; Tinashe is gone, but Grocery Store Joe has never even been in jeopardy. (Insert the emoji of the shrugging lady here.) But I\u2019m so glad that voters have given Evanna a chance, allowing her to stick around long enough to really hone her skills and start dancing for herself instead of other people. The Harry Potter actress showcased incredible confidence and sensuality with this rumba, and she seems to have an awareness of her body and the space around her that even some of the strongest contestants lack. Judges\u2019 Score: 30/30\n\nMOST EXHAUSTING (IN A GOOD WAY!)\n\nAlexis Ren and pro Alan Bersten (Samba) \u2014 My goodness, this samba went on forever, didn\u2019t it? Not only was this routine an excellent commercial for Lauren Alaina\u2019s single, \u201cLadies In the \u201990s,\u201d but it also served as a reminder that Alexis could very well win this whole show \u2014 and she would wholly deserve it. Her movements were so crisp, and, somehow, her energy never flagged. (To be fair, her first kiss with Alan was just broadcast to millions of people, so I suspect there was a little more adrenaline pumping for the Instagram model this week.) Judges\u2019 Score: 29/30\n\nMOST OVERLOOKED ERROR\n\nJuan Pablo Di Pace and pro Cheryl Burke (Charleston) \u2014 Let\u2019s not get this twisted: Juan Pablo and Cheryl were really, really strong on Monday, and they\u2019ve been one of the season\u2019s most consistently excellent couples. But. The final eight-count of their Charleston featured a trick that looked so clumsy, I thought Cheryl was about to fall or get forever entangled in Juan Pablo\u2019s limbs. As Juan Pablo put his leg over Cheryl\u2019s body and twisted around her, it seemed the pair got momentarily stuck \u2014 and even if the trick didn\u2019t have disastrous results, it was still an awkward finish to an otherwise electric routine, and I was surprised that none of the judges acknowledged the flub. Judges\u2019 Score: 30/30\n\nThe team dances, meanwhile, shook out like this:\n\n* Team \u201cHay Now\u201d (Bobby, Milo, Evanna and John): 29/30\n\n* Team \u201cJoe-Down\u201d(Joe, Juan Pablo, DeMarcus and Alexis): 26/30\n\nAnd now, the results:\n\nCOUPLES IN JEOPARDY\n\nJohn Schneider and pro Emma Slater\n\nDeMarcus Ware and pro Lindsay Arnold\n\nEvanna Lynch and pro Keo Motsepe\n\nELIMINATED\n\nJohn Schneider and pro Emma Slater\n\nDeMarcus Ware and pro Lindsay Arnold", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190830/aol-logo.svg",
