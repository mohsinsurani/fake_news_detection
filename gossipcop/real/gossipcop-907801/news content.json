But of course now is a time for listening and that\u2019s what we\u2019re all trying to do.\u201d\n\nBrie has been a fixture at award shows in recent months, thanks to her critically-acclaimed performance in GLOW as well as a small part in the oft-nominated The Disaster Artist, where she stars alongside her husband, Dave Franco, and his brother. As such, it was likely only a matter of time before she was asked to comment publicly on the allegations against James Franco, who did also attend the SAG Awards last night (after previously skipping the Critics\u2019 Choice Movie Awards earlier this month).\n\nAt the 2018 #SAGAwards, Alison Brie addressed the allegations of sexual misconduct made against her brother-in-law, James Franco: \"It remains vital that anyone that feels victimized should and does have the right to speak out and come forward.\" pic.twitter.com/dG5uJJVko7 \u2014 E!

Franco recently took to late-night television to respond to some of those allegations, telling NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers that the allegations against him are \u201cnot accurate\u201d while adding that he does not plan to \u201cactively refute\u201d the claims.", "images": ["https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1242585998-e1665028070836.jpg?w=256&q=75", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243767517-e1665076497696.jpg?w=256&q=75", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-908514106.jpg?resize=1200,600", "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1243581035-e1665068106964.jpg?w=256&q=75"], "top_img": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-908514106.jpg?resize=1200,600", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://fortune.com/2018/01/22/alison-brie-james-franco-sag-awards/", "title": "Alison Brie Addresses James Franco Allegations at SAG Awards", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffc40d", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "At the SAG Awards, 'GLOW' actress Alison Brie responded to the sexual misconduct allegations against her brother-in-law, James Franco.", "keywords": "sag awards 2018, screen actors guild awards, alison brie, james franco, james franco allegations, alison brie james franco, sag awards, dave franco", "og": {"url": "https://fortune.com/2018/01/22/alison-brie-james-franco-sag-awards/", "type": "article", "title": "Alison Brie Responds to the Allegations Against James Franco at the SAG Awards", "description": "Franco recently took to late-night television to respond himself.", "site_name": "Fortune", "image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-908514106.jpg?resize=1200,600", "width": 1024, "height": 683}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alison Brie Responds to the Allegations Against James Franco at the SAG Awards", "description": "Franco recently took to late-night television to respond himself.", "image": "https://content.fortune.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-908514106.jpg?resize=1200,600", "url": "https://fortune.com/2018/01/22/alison-brie-james-franco-sag-awards/"}, "next-head-count": 32}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1516579200.0, "source": "http://fortune.com", "summary": ""}
