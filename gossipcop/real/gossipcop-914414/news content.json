She\u2019s finding pregnancy sex pretty confronting and awkward \u2013 and she\u2019s keen to talk about it. Quel surprise!\n\n\u201cFor me it\u2019s been interesting\u201d\n\nKhloe\u2019s pregnant with her first baby, with partner Tristan Thompson, and it\u2019s fair to say that she\u2019s already pretty closely acquainted with the pregnancy journey, thanks to her family. Sister Kourtney has three kids, Kim also has three (carrying two of them herself) and her sister Kylie has a newborn. Tristan\u2019s already navigated pregnancy, albeit in a separated way, too. He\u2019s dad to one-year-old Prince with former partner Jordan Craig.\n\nKhloe said she\u2019d heard things about sexuality during pregnancy, and is now having her own evolving experience.\n\n\u201cI have always heard that women are extra horny when they\u2019re pregnant,\u201d Khloe posted on her blog, \u201cbut for me it\u2019s been interesting.\u201d\n\n\u201cUncomfortable and limiting\u201d\n\nKhloe says she\u2019s feeling considerably less nimble in the sack, but is attempting to adapt to her new dimensions.\n\n\u201cIn the beginning, sex was the same. As I got into my third trimester and started to get bigger it became harder to have sex and a little more uncomfortable and limiting.\u201d\n\nThe pair are apparently pushing on, and the mum-to-be notes that \u201camazing\u201d Tristan \u2018would never make me feel different in any way.'\u201d\n\nWhile her body is making her feel self-conscious and a little cumbersome, Khloe\u2019s hanging in there and giving it her best shot. Because \u2026 IN LOVE. She notes that she\u2019s probably not the only one feeling weirded out and admits she\u2019s not used to being quite so passive.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure it\u2019s uncomfortable for a man to have sex with a pregnant woman too. Personally, I get uncomfortable and insecure. Also, you can\u2019t move the same, so you kind of feel useless, LOL. But you just have to improvise and do the best you can,\u201d she advised.\n\n\u201cI was just in shock\u201d\n\nKhloe recently revealed that she\u2019d always wanted to have a baby, but assumed she would not be able to easily conceive due to some potential issues with her ovaries.\n\n\u201cWhen I got pregnant, I was just so surprised. \u2018Cause you keep getting told \u2014 you know when you hear all these things about yourself, you just start believing them. And, I was just in shock. I think, as much as everybody else was,\u201d Khloe recalls.\n\nThe couple confirmed the pregnancy in December of 2018, on Instagram. Then last month, Khloe hinted at her due date with a photo celebrating \u201cofficially 6 months\u201d. This suggests she\u2019s due in mid-late April \u2013 and we can not wait to find out the baby\u2019s name!", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1576967442553771&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/babyology.png", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/pregnant-cleaning.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/indian-baby-holding-mothers-head-thumbnail.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/pregnant-woman-on-bed-thumbnail.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pregnant-woman-tummy-1-255x213.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Untitled-design-55.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khloe-Kardashian-Tristian-1.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/menu-icon.png", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/pregnant-woman-looking-at-ultrasound-1-255x213.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/dadtobeth.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/woman-dog_thumbnail.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/birth-newborn-chest-hospital-thumbnail.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/ashley-graham-thumb.jpg", "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/search-icon.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khloe-Kardashian-Tristian-1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pip Lincolne"], "canonical_link": "https://babyology.com.au/pregnancy/khloe-kardashian-talks-frankly-about-pregnancy-sex/", "title": "\u201cI get uncomfortable and insecure\u201d Khloe Kardashian\u2019s pregnancy sex struggle", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Khloe says she's feeling considerably less nimble in the sack, but is adapting on the go.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\"I get uncomfortable and insecure\" Khloe Kardashian's pregnancy sex struggle", "description": "Khloe says she's feeling considerably less nimble in the sack, but is adapting on the go.", "url": "https://babyology.com.au/pregnancy/khloe-kardashian-talks-frankly-about-pregnancy-sex/", "site_name": "Babyology", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/Khloe-Kardashian-Tristian-1.jpg", "width": 800, "height": 417, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/babyology", "published_time": "2018-02-19T02:51:25+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-03-07T00:30:11+00:00"}, "author": "Pip Lincolne", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@babyology", "site": "@babyology", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Pip Lincolne", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.babyology.com.au/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/favicon.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519008685.0, "source": "https://babyology.com.au", "summary": ""}
