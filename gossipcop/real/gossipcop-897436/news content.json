She told Extra that she had just been robbed.\n\n\"Other than we got robbed last night,\" Clarkson said when Extra reporter Renee Bargh commented on how happy she looked. \"We got here and our whole house was like bashed in, it was crazy.\"\n\nShe's taking it in stride, though, noting that nothing irreplaceable was taken. \"Materialistic things we didn't care about, the guy was in our kid's room ... so it was a little weird, other than that everyone is safe and good.\"\n\nClarkson is also making waves this week for being in James Corden's hit Carpool Karaoke series of videos. The episode with Clarkson in it, posted Wednesday, already has more than 3.5 million views.", "images":
