Home to the Great Sphinx, King Khufu\u2019s tomb and the Great Pyramid, the site was a must for the two tourists.\n\nWATCH THIS: Kenya Moore Shares Why She Kept Her New Husband\u2019s Identity Secret, Says She Wants Kids \u2018Right Away\u2019\n\n\u201cThank you for the most amazing birthday gift of my life!\u201d she wrote.\n\nBefore sharing her whereabouts, Moore teased her adventure with this photo of a hotel living room with the caption, \u201cWhere in the world am I?\u201d The space was decorated with yellow and red balloons and a cake for the guest of honor.\n\nMoore and Daly met in 2016 and began dating after a few months. She kept his identity secret at first on RHOA, telling PEOPLE he \u201cdidn\u2019t sign up for this world,\u201d but has since opened up about their life together.\n\n\u201cNo more excuses, or negativity. I now have the chance to live not only for myself, but for my own family,\u201d she said in November. \u201cThe stakes are the greatest they\u2019ve ever been in my life. Today is better than yesterday, and tomorrow will be better than today.\u201d", "images":
