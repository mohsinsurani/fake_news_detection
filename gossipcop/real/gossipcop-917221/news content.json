We liked it so much and we\u2019re so passionate about this show because we\u2019re gonna be exploring the contributions and social impact that people of color have been having in our nation\u2019s history,\u201d she dished. \u201cFor some reason, these events and these personalities never made it into our history books \u2026 It is important for us to reflect on all kinds of role models and trailblazers that we\u2019ve had past and present. Because one thing that\u2019s for certain, especially given this box office record breaking hit with Black Panther, is that we need heroes. We need role models that reflect who we are in order for us to cultivate inspiration.\u201d\n\nThe Avatar starlet, who draws inspiration from the likes of Rosie Perez, Sigourney Weaver, Reese Witherspoon and Gina Rodriquez, hopes to influence positive change in the industry by showcasing diversity. \u201cI\u2019ve been impacted my whole life by trailblazers. Whether they were current at that time or still relevant today, or current today, not only are they using their talents to benefit their personal growth, but they\u2019re giving back,\u201d she gushed. \u201cThey\u2019re giving back to their community. Whatever those communities may be.\u201d\n\nAdded the Star Trek actress, \u201cEither by sharing their insight, by sharing their knowledge, by shedding light on organizations and movements and people that we should all be knowing about and talking about, because they\u2019re bringing change to their local communities. I\u2019m impacted every day by these voices.\u201d\n\nWith reporting by Travis Cronin", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/zoe-saldana-is-launching-bese-media-brand-to-showcase-diversity/", "title": "Zoe Saldana Is Launching BESE Media Brand to Showcase Diversity", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Women Empowerment", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Zoe Saldana is gearing up to launch her new media platform, BESE, to help spread awareness about diversity in the industry \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Zoe Saldana Is Launching a Media Brand to Showcase Diversity in Hollywood", "description": "Zoe Saldana is gearing up to launch her new media platform, BESE, to help spread awareness about diversity in the industry \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/zoe-saldana-is-launching-bese-media-brand-to-showcase-diversity/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2019-04-18T19:51:27+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-02-28T23:35:37+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-04-18T19:51:27+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Zoe Saldana Is Launching a Media Brand to Showcase Diversity in Hollywood", "description": "Zoe Saldana is gearing up to launch her new media platform, BESE, to help spread awareness about diversity in the industry \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/zoe-saldana.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1800px%2C946px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519860937.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
