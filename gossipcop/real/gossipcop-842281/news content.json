Whether you\u2019ve been turned off by religion in the past, have a question about one of the world\u2019s religions or are simply looking for content we no longer have, we hope you\u2019ll stay and see what Patheos has to offer.\n\nAt Patheos, we believe faith is a force for good in the world, but we also know it\u2019s hard to find accurate information about religion online. We exist to help provide information, stories and conversation that leads to understanding, empathy and acceptance of all faiths.\n\nYou don\u2019t have to be a believer. But our hope is Patheos can serve as a platform to encounter others with different views while encouraging a civil discussion about matters of faith. Such encounters, we believe, can breed tolerance, compassion and growth.\n\nHere\u2019s some views we recommend exploring:\n\nWhy I Stay: A fascinating look at stories of faithfulness in the face of judgement, hurt, and betrayal. There are lots of podcasts and articles about why so many people are leaving religion, but this one explores why anyone stays.\n\nPatheos Answers: Here is where we tackle FAQs about religious beliefs, customs and traditions, whether it be Buddhism, Christianity, Islam, or another religion.\n\nProgressive Christian: In this channel we explore the changing church, transforming theology, spiritual practices and formation, faith and politics, social justice and so much more.\n\nNew Visions: Here is where you\u2019ll find spiritual practitioners that are exploring interspirituality, transpersonal psychology and other alternative approaches to the spiritual journey.", "images": ["https://media.patheos.com/~/media/patheos-images/blog%20logos/filmchat.jpg", "https://media.patheos.com/~/media/patheos-images/blog%20logos/keith%20giles.jpg", "https://www.patheos.com/Areas/Patheos/assets/apple-touch-icon.png", "https://www.patheos.com/~/media/images/components/navigation/patheos/patheos-logo-header.png", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1510929182549648&ev=PageView&eid=63800827562717&ud[fbp]=&ud[fbc]=&noscript=1", "https://media.patheos.com/~/media/patheos-images/blog%20logos/connecting%20with%20christ.jpg", "https://media.patheos.com/~/media/patheos-images/blog%20logos/chorus%20in%20the%20chaos.jpg", "https://media.patheos.com/~/media/patheos-images/blog%20logos/roger%20olson.jpg", "https://media.patheos.com/~/media/patheos-images/blog%20logos/through%20catholic%20lenses.jpg", "https://media.patheos.com/~/media/patheos-images/blog%20logos/hindu%2020.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.patheos.com/Areas/Patheos/assets/apple-touch-icon.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.patheos.com/nonreligious-questions", "title": "Nonreligious Questions", "meta_data": {"referrer": "origin", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "og": {"title": "Nonreligious Questions", "description": "Whether you\u2019ve been turned off by religion in the past or have a question about one of the world\u2019s religions, check out what Patheos has to offer.", "url": "https://www.patheos.com/nonreligious-questions"}, "description": "Whether you\u2019ve been turned off by religion in the past or have a question about one of the world\u2019s religions, check out what Patheos has to offer.", "robots": "INDEX, FOLLOW, noydir, noodp", "msapplication-TileColor": "#00aba9", "msapplication-TileImage": "/Areas/Patheos/assets/mstile-150x150.png?v=00rbb46rd6", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Patheos", "creator": "@Patheos", "title": "Nonreligious Questions", "description": "Whether you\u2019ve been turned off by religion in the past or have a question about one of the world\u2019s religions, check out what Patheos has to offer."}, "fb": {"pages": 1108139422538318}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.patheos.com", "summary": ""}
