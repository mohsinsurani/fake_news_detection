The parents-to-be channeled Game of Thrones for a Halloween party Monday night with Kardashian dressing up as the Mother of Dragons Daenerys Targaryen and Thompson going as Khal Drogo, which seems to be a subtle confirmation to the pregnancy of their first child.\n\nThe duo revealed quick peeks at their looks Monday night on Instagram story, but revealed the full custom-made medieval outfits designed by Bryan Hearns on Tuesday.\n\nKhloe Kardasian/Instagram\n\nIn a photo the star shared of the couple kissing in their costumes, Kardashian called her boyfriend of over a year the \u201cmoon of my life,\u201d after she captioned a shirtless photo of the NBA star with \u201cThat\u2019s daddy,\u201d Monday night on social media.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: See Every Single Costume the KarJenners Wore This Year!\n\nLooking for more style content?

But perhaps the 33-year-old star is ready to start showing more skin and taking some maternity dressing advice from her older sister Kourtney, who recently told us, \u201cDon\u2019t feel like you have to hide your bump and just dress for your body. Just embrace it!\u201d\n\nKhloe Kardasian/Instagram\n\nLast month, multiple sources confirmed to PEOPLE that Kardashian is expecting her first child, a baby boy, with Thompson.\n\n\u201cYes, Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan are expecting and they are absolutely thrilled,\u201d one source told PEOPLE of the couple.\n\n\u201cThis is something Khlo\u00e9 has wanted for years and years and yet it\u2019s more than that: She didn\u2019t want it unless she was in the right relationship for it,\u201d the source added. \u201cThis is such a wonderful moment for her: not only is she going to be a mother, she is going to be raising a child with a man she truly loves. Everyone is over the moon for them both.\u201d\n\nWhat do you think of Khlo\u00e9 and Tristan\u2019s costume?
