{"url": "https://people.com/tv/luann-de-lesseps-talks-dorinda-medley-feud/", "text": "Luann de Lesseps is still feeling the pain of her fight with her Real Housewives of New York City costar Dorinda Medley.\n\nOn Monday night, the Countess was back on stage for another round of her hit #CountessAndFriends cabaret show \u2014 this time, from New York City\u2019s famed Feinstein\u2019s/54 Below.\n\nDuring the Q&A portion, a fan asked if de Lesseps would ever considering making up with Medley.\n\nThe two longtime friends, both 53, had an epic fallout on RHONY\u2018s tenth season \u2014 which began when a newly-sober de Lesseps questioned Medley\u2019s drinking while the two were vacationing with their cast mates in Cartagena, Colombia. From there, Medley blew up, mocking de Lesseps for her headline-making arrest and trip to rehab.\n\nFurther insults came at the RHONY season 10 reunion, when Medley asserted that de Lesseps only sought treatment to avoid jail time and that she had become \u201cconfused between fame and infamy\u201d after her cabaret took off.\n\nThough it\u2019s been months, de Lesseps remains upset with Medley\u2019s words. \u201cWhat she said hurts still,\u201d the mother of two explained. \u201cI\u2019m just trying to process it and get over it right now. I\u2019m not ready to take the Band-Aid off. I\u2019m still scarred from it!\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019m in a good place,\u201d the reality star and cabaret singer added, before referencing Medley\u2019s \u201cJovani\u201d chants from the finale. \u201cI don\u2019t need heckling.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: RHONY\u2019s Luann de Lesseps Slams Dorinda Medley\u2019s Claim She Went to Rehab to \u2018Stay out of Jail\u2019\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean that de Lesseps and Medley will stay estranged forever.\n\n\u201cI do [want to make up with her]. I love Dorinda,\u201d de Lesseps said. \u201cWe\u2019ve known each other for a long time. I\u2019m sure we\u2019ll come to a good decision.\u201d\n\nJohn Lamparski/Getty\n\nDe Lesseps was less kind when she appeared on Sept. 5\u2019s Watch What Happens Live with Andy Cohen.\n\nShe began by fiercely denying the claim that she was court-ordered to go to rehab.\n\n\u201cI went on my own recognizance, first of all, so Dorinda doesn\u2019t know anything about me,\u201d de Lesseps said. \u201cI went because I felt that I needed to go and take care of myself and I take it very seriously, my sobriety.\u201d\n\nNext, she defended her attitude regarding the success of her cabaret.\n\n\u201cYeah, I\u2019m not taking advice, right now, from Dorinda,\u201d de Lesseps said. \u201cThank you for those two cents. But I will say, my cabaret, to me, is everything. I\u2019ve found my calling in my life and if that makes them uncomfortable, that is too bad for them. That\u2019s all I can say. When I do my shows, I\u2019m on stage and I\u2019m doing my thing, so I don\u2019t let [the boozy environment] really affect me. I understand their concern and I appreciate it, but I\u2019m good because I\u2019m on stage doing what I love.\u201d\n\nBorgata Hotel Casino & Spa\n\nPaul Wontorek\n\nThat same positivity was pouring out of the Countess on Monday night. \u201cI\u2019m doing what I love,\u201d de Lesseps told the crowd. \u201cI found my calling.\u201d\n\nShe was supported in the crowd by two other Housewives: her RHONY costar Sonja Morgan and Real Housewives of New Jersey star Teresa Giudice.\n\nMorgan, 54, joined de Lesseps on stage for a performance of her song, \u201cMoney Can\u2019t Buy You Class.\u201d Meanwhile, Giudice, 46, asked de Lesseps about the difficulties of going through a divorce on television.\n\n\u201cYou know, I knew it was time to go,\u201d de Lesseps said. \u201cI was solid in my decision. When I\u2019m done, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nGiudice agreed. \u201cMe too,\u201d she said, to the cheers of the crowd. \u201cWhen I\u2019m done, I\u2019m done.\u201d\n\nAdditional #CountessAndFriends shows will be announced on de Lesseps\u2019 official website shortly.", "images":
