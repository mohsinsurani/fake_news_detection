When I finished it was a good showbiz moment and everyone was happy but there was blood trickling down my face and I had to be re-stitched. But, it was so worth it!\"\n\nThe Logan star also nearly got his co-star Zac Efron killed when they went cycling in London.\n\nEfron, 30, shared that: \"I cycled with him in London but I'm not one to ride a bike early in the morning in traffic so it turned out to be quite dangerous.\n\n\"I followed Hugh around a few cars and suddenly there was a double-decker bus right in front of me. I slammed on the brakes, went under the front tyre and narrowly missed death.\n\n\"Hugh was on the other side of the road and stuck up his thumb and just said, 'You good? Let's go.'\"\n\nThe Graham Norton Show airs on BBC One on December 31 at 10.20pm.", "images": ["https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/loading.gif", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/ewn-logo.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/dd8dxnjrs2slzr3i4eej", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/ewn-logo-sticky.png", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/bzs2euuly2bxvvv7gjki", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_436,w_700/gdfjky5pit6nbna3qnno", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/lqsb3bur7aanpojmuovc", "https://collector.effectivemeasure.net/noscript", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/ael2dmv9unm5ic852drl", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/v1538138159/rjmmxcnwfcznechkzz9p.png", "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/gdfjky5pit6nbna3qnno", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/wqkje8icy4nzwyf6klhq", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/android.jpg", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_141,q_70,w_225/anvgdve5spryhhigjndy", "https://ewn.co.za/site/design/img/apple.jpg", "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_175,q_70,w_280/zcgi54xee01kwhrtz0bv"], "top_img": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/gdfjky5pit6nbna3qnno", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bang Showbiz"], "canonical_link": "https://ewn.co.za/2017/12/29/hugh-jackman-burst-stitch-open-singing-in-the-greatest-showman", "title": "Hugh Jackman burst stitch open singing in 'The Greatest Showman'", "meta_data": {"shorturl": "https://ewn.co.za/uadpv", "description": "Jackman had to have his stitches from skin cancer redone after singing a line in the movie.", "keywords": "Hugh Jackman, The Greatest Showman, Lifestyle", "news_keywords": "Hugh Jackman, The Greatest Showman, Lifestyle", "author": "BANG Showbiz", "ContentItemType": "Article", "articleid": 286436, "disqusidentifier": 0, "og": {"type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/gdfjky5pit6nbna3qnno", "secure_url": "https://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/gdfjky5pit6nbna3qnno", "width": 700, "height": 437}, "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2017/12/29/hugh-jackman-burst-stitch-open-singing-in-the-greatest-showman", "title": "Hugh Jackman burst stitch open singing in 'The Greatest Showman'", "description": "Jackman had to have his stitches from skin cancer redone after singing a line in the movie."}, "twitter": {"image": "http://cdn.primedia.co.za/primedia-broadcasting/image/upload/c_fill,h_437,w_700/gdfjky5pit6nbna3qnno", "card": "summary", "creator": "@ewnreporter", "url": "https://ewn.co.za/2017/12/29/hugh-jackman-burst-stitch-open-singing-in-the-greatest-showman", "site": "@ewnreporter", "title": "Hugh Jackman burst stitch open singing in 'The Greatest Showman'", "app": {"name": {"iphone": "Eyewitness News", "ipad": "Eyewitness News", "googleplay": "Eyewitness News"}, "id": {"iphone": 636459947, "ipad": 636459947, "googleplay": "com.eyewitnessnews"}}}, "fb": {"app_id": 259652954116494, "pages": 168892509821961}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=636459947", "google-play-app": "app-id=com.eyewitnessnews", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "p": {"domain_verify": "3acf0ffe30e8e741add34eeb0aa173dd"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1514505600.0, "source": "https://ewn.co.za", "summary": ""}
