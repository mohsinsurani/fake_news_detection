And guys, IT'S HAPPENING. Witherspoon confirmed the news on her Instagram this morning with a pool shot of herself in Elle Woods' signature bikini. \"It\u2019s true... #LegallyBlonde3,\" she wrote simply.\n\nAny Legally Blonde fan knows that when Witherspoon revisited her character's wardrobe in 2016, during the movie's 15th anniversary, she revealed the sparkly pink bikini still fits. Look how good Elle Woods look:\n\nPlot details aren't known yet, but Kirsten \u201cKiwi\u201d Smith and Karen McCullah, the original screenwriters, were reported to be in talks to write the script. Selma Blair, Luke Wilson, Jennifer Coolidge, waiting to hear you'll be back!", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67f50b99-742e-4e5d-8197-6e717b23ab3b.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hp2-ff-021-1656430894.jpg?crop=0.454xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.elle.com/_assets/design-tokens/elle/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/blonde-01-41-16-09-1-1664575541.jpg?crop=0.755xw:1.00xh;0.123xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2022-07-25-at-11-17-40-am-1658762275.png?crop=0.418xw:1.00xh;0.236xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tmc-107-unit-04108r-1665178520.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.151xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emma-d-arcy-1665164132.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.245xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/fc847fa5-f55a-482c-8732-63048541a5b3/thumb_1920x1080_00002_1664987006_12835.jpg?crop=0.5625xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/elm100122cethomas-001-1-1663357851.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ciw-unit-12862-r-jpg-1664898600.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tml-105-js-01374rt-1664382829.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0833xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leagally-blonde-2-shutterstock-editorial-5884828o-huge-1528390605.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/luckiest-girl-alive-jessica-knoll-1665088185.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/harvey-sadler-emma-d-arcy-leo-hart-1664752895.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2019-elle-songassociation-ep93-lewiscapaldi-jp-cm-kk-v3-ap-v2-1575927996.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/dragons-hotd-1-1663005412.png?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.259xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leagally-blonde-2-shutterstock-editorial-5884828o-huge-1528390605.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/leagally-blonde-2-shutterstock-editorial-5884828o-huge-1528390605.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a21186107/reese-witherspoon-confirms-legally-blonde-3-happening-instagram/", "title": "Reese Witherspoon Confirms 'Legally Blonde 3' Is On and She's In", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Reese Witherspoon Confirms 'Legally Blonde 3' Is On - Reese to Reprise Role as Elle Woods", "description": "\u200bEarlier this week, Deadline reported that Reese Witherspoon was in talks\u200b to reprise her role as Elle Woods in \u200bLegally Blonde 3\u200b, 17 years after the original film was done.
