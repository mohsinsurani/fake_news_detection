Right after \"everyone going to Italy without me this summer\" and \"low-rise jeans making a comeback.\"\n\nBut imagine all the cringe and awkwardness that comes with running into an ex, and then multiply it by a factor of approximately 100,000, because that's what celebs are dealing with. Like, pretty sure Pete Davidson is straight-up unable to attend public events without having to make small talk with someone he's dated, and at this point the Met Gala should probably rebrand itself as \"Fancy Place Where You Pose on the Red Carpet Several Feet Away from the Person Who Just Dumped You.\"\n\nBut even more yikes than celebs running into their exes literally all over town? The fact that said run-ins typically go down in public, in front of paps, meaning there are almost always pictures and videos. On that note (lol), have fun experiencing the secondhand awkwardness of celebs who've publicly run into their exes over the years\u2014from Brad Pitt and Jen Aniston's surprise meet up at the Screen Actors Guild Awards, to Shawn Mendes and Hailey Baldwin bumping into each other in a hotel lobby before the Met Gala, to my personal fave: Joe Jonas and Demi Lovato unexpectedly having to spend 4 full hours together. You know, because they got trapped in an elevator.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/bella-and-weeknd-1501773031.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2022-07-11-at-11-26-33-am-1657553216.png?crop=1.00xw:0.929xh;0,0.0429xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/ed-and-ellie-1501773753.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/screen-shot-2022-07-11-at-11-26-33-am-1657553216.png?crop=1.00xw:0.929xh;0,0.0429xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mehera", "Mehera Bonner Is A Celebrity", "Entertainment News Writer Who Enjoys Bravo", "Antiques Roadshow With Equal Enthusiasm", "She Was Previously Entertainment Editor At Marie Claire", "Has Covered Pop Culture For Over A Decade.", "Carine Lavache"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/g11305499/celebrity-ex-run-ins/", "title": "26 Celebrity Ex Couples", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "These Awkward Celebrity Exes Run-Ins Will Make You Squirm", "description": "I am so uncomfortable.
