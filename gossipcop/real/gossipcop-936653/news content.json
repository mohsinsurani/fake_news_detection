Knowing that they really share the same values as I do about food provenance, sustainability, seasonality and most importantly flavour, makes this the most exciting event to be a part of.\"\n\nMini cupcakes at Ms Ptak's bakery start at \u00a31.50, and her wedding cakes are priced on request.\n\nOn her website, Ms Ptak states: \"For weddings, we recommend either our vanilla, chocolate, carrot, lemon or coconut cream cake finished with super deluxe satiny Swiss meringue buttercream icing covering the top and sides of a tiered cake.\n\n\"The cake can then be decorated with a crown of icing pearls on top and along the base and fresh flowers. We work with a local florist to match the flowers to your event.\"\n\nImage: Prince Harry and Meghan Markle taste traditional Welsh cakes during a visit to Cardiff Castle\n\n:: Pubs to stay open late for Prince Harry and Meghan Markle's wedding weekend\n\nThe baker also runs a podcast project where she interviews women she admires, and past episode guests include Alice Levine and Thomasina Miers.\n\nPrince William and Catherine's cake for the 2011 wedding was made by Fiona Cairns, and was a more traditional fruit cake, with the couple understood to have kept one of the eight tiers for the christening of their first child.\n\nMs Cairns told Hello magazine that Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, had a lot of input into the cake, with the lace design from her wedding dress added, as well as her choice of flowers and leaves.\n\nImage: Fiona Cairns with Prince William and Kate's wedding cake in 2011\n\nPrince Harry and Ms Markle have not released a guest list or details of her wedding dress designer, but have said they will be inviting 2,640 members of the public to Windsor Castle for the Royal wedding.\n\nThe guest list will include 1,200 young people and others who have served their communities and shown strong leadership.\n\nMel B also hinted that all five members of the Spice Girls have been invited.", "images":
