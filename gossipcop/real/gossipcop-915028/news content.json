He will remain chief creative officer through January 2019, when his contract expires, and then will stay on as a board member, Bloomberg reports.\n\nIn a regulatory filing, Guess announced that Marciano had entered into settlements with five people arising out of claims of inappropriate conduct, for a total of $500,000. The settlements, according to the filing, were to avoid litigation costs, and did not represent an admission of \u201cliability or fault.\u201d\n\nThe investigators, who according to the filing interviewed 40 people and reviewed some 1.5 million pages of documents, ultimately couldn\u2019t corroborate many of the allegations. \u201dIn some cases, no conclusion could be reached because the individuals either declined to be interviewed or provided insufficient information to the investigators,\u201d the filing states. \u201cAnd, in other cases, the investigation found that credible accounts were given by both sides.\u201d\n\nWhat the investigators did conclude was that Marciano \u201cexercised poor judgment in his communications with models and photographers,\u201d and that he had put himself in situations that could\u2014and did\u2014result in \u201cplausible allegations of improper conduct.\u201d\n\nUpton first went public with her allegations in January, joining the #MeToo movement on social media and later giving a detailed account to Time magazine. \u201cAfter the first day of shooting the Guess Lingerie campaign [on July 25, 2010], Paul Marciano said he wanted to meet with me,\u201d she said. \u201cAs soon as I walked in with photographer Yu Tsai, Paul came straight up to me, forcibly grabbed my breasts and started feeling them\u2014playing with them actually. After I pushed him away, he said, \u2018I\u2019m making sure they\u2019re real.'\u201d\n\nShe said that after she repeatedly rebuffed him, he became hostile toward her, calling her \u201cdisgusting\u201d and a \u201cpig\u201d on set and spreading rumors that she was drunk during shoots. Marciano denied Upton\u2019s claims, telling Time that he had never touched her inappropriately, and that he would never \u201crefer to a Guess model in such a derogatory manner.\u201d He added that he supports the #MeToo movement, and wouldn\u2019t allow others to defame him. Tsai, the photographer, corroborated Upton\u2019s claims to Time.\n\nWhen Guess opened its probe into Marciano, he ceased his day-to-day responsibilities at the company, and his pay was suspended. Now that the investigation is over, he will receive his salary again until January 30, according to the filing.\n\nMeanwhile, Guess says that Marciano has begun transitioning his duties to Victor Herrero, who previously took over Marciano\u2019s role as Guess CEO in 2015, while brother Maurice Marciano has been appointed by the board to serve as the company\u2019s new executive chairman.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/dd6f1bcc7215f57a557d5da4d2fdabd2.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/40e800aa06ce975cda2a40a4e83356ea.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_410,h_231/4b03e26565373382d3a94151b6d5bd9e.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/c8101ab2777f771787eef377fb2da8bf.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/324de71349cdceb01cc06a07c2f467cc.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/9b0d11393087415f2bff0248ce5a3659.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/d872fec30d243d22d46695c46c50dd3b.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/78fc08ea59564c0a01e9778d921413a4.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/e5c5c5219115e7b82b3b1693d5996fdb.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/bc16a5dcf68379bf869ffbfb9415a57e.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_1200,h_630,c_fill/4b03e26565373382d3a94151b6d5bd9e.JPG", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_220,h_220/0bf183cd60d66bddc13b48d84e6f353f.JPG"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_1200,h_630,c_fill/4b03e26565373382d3a94151b6d5bd9e.JPG", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Bain"], "canonical_link": "https://qz.com/1304407/guess-cofounder-paul-marciano-has-resigned-after-sexual-misconduct-claims/", "title": "Guess cofounder Paul Marciano is stepping down after sexual misconduct claims", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=5", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "title": "Guess cofounder Paul Marciano is stepping down after sexual misconduct claims", "description": "Guess started an investigation after model Kate Upton shared her #MeToo story about Marciano in February.", "image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_1200,h_630,c_fill/4b03e26565373382d3a94151b6d5bd9e.JPG", "type": "article", "url": "https://qz.com/1304407/guess-cofounder-paul-marciano-has-resigned-after-sexual-misconduct-claims/", "site_name": "Quartz"}, "application-name": "Quartz", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Quartz", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black", "msapplication-window": "width=1024;height=768", "msapplication-tooltip": "Global business journalism about how the world is changing", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ffffff", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_144,h_144,c_fill/96cd2e6c897ad9a113b0ecb7b215540c.jpg", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_70,h_70,c_fill/96cd2e6c897ad9a113b0ecb7b215540c.jpg", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_150,h_150,c_fill/96cd2e6c897ad9a113b0ecb7b215540c.jpg", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_310,h_150,c_fill/96cd2e6c897ad9a113b0ecb7b215540c.jpg", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_310,h_310,c_fill/96cd2e6c897ad9a113b0ecb7b215540c.jpg", "google-site-verification": "Gw2dGJnVMI3pq0GKnZhuLcbWkaRm8IbZxjm2hHxn9YY", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Guess started an investigation after model Kate Upton shared her #MeToo story about Marciano in February.", "twitter": {"image": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/q_75,w_1200,h_630,c_fill/4b03e26565373382d3a94151b6d5bd9e.JPG", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marcbain_", "site": "@qz", "url": "https://qz.com/1304407/guess-cofounder-paul-marciano-has-resigned-after-sexual-misconduct-claims/"}, "theme-color": "#f9f9f9", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/quartznews", "published_time": "2018-06-13T15:18:25.000Z"}, "author": "Marc Bain"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://qz.com", "summary": ""}
