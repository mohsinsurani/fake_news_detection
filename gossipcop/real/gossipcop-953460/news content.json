After Natalie, 28, was cruelly outed by her castmate, Kaleigh Morris, last year on social media, she set the record straight on Tuesday night\u2019s episode of The Challenge: Final Reckoning. \u201cI am pansexual and I\u2019m okay with that now,\u201d she said, also revealing she was currently in a relationship with a woman. She then took to Twitter to continue the conversation, writing, \u201cI came out with my story to share my truth with those who are battling the same thing I did. Do not throw hate at anyone for their actions. I wanted to use my platform to educate people who are not informed. Let\u2019s spread love and education not hate.\u201d\n\nNatalie joins many out and proud celebrities in her fight for education and love, including Miley Cyrus, who came out as pansexual in October 2015. \u201cI\u2019m very open about it \u2014 I\u2019m pansexual. But I\u2019m not in a relationship. I\u2019m 22, I\u2019m going on dates, but I change my style every two weeks, let alone who I\u2019m with,\u201d she told Elle UK in a candid interview. She reiterated her feelings in 2017 to Billboard, saying, \u201cWho I\u2019m with has nothing to do with sex \u2014 I\u2019m super open, pansexual, that\u2019s just me.\u201d Another celeb who has been very honest about his sexuality is Nico Tortorella.\n\nThe Younger actor identifies as pansexual and is currently married to his longtime partner, who identifies as a queer woman. \u201cI believe in the spectrum, the full universe of gender and sexuality, and probably I fall more into the pansexual fluid terms which fall into the umbrella of bisexual in LGBTQ-plus,\u201d he told The Advocate. \u201cI think when I was first having this conversation, I didn\u2019t like the term bisexual because I think it was a little dated for this generation; people weren\u2019t using it. It kind of puts people into this box. [But] I respect the term bisexual. I use it because I respect it.\u201d\n\nWe love that way of thinking!
