The actress told PEOPLE while promoting her upcoming Lifetime film \u201cCocaine Godmother\u201d that \u201cthere was no other way\u201d for Douglas to handle the situation.\n\n\u201cThere was no other way than to be preemptive in a story that had to be watched. He did a statement. I think it\u2019s very clear the way that he stands,\u201d Zeta-Jones said. \u201cI cannot elaborate on something that\u2019s so very personal to him.\u201d\n\nZeta-Jones made it clear she supports both her husband\u2019s denial and the #MeToo anti-harassment movement at large: \u201cMy reaction was that as two people who have been in this business \u2014 him longer than me \u2014 was that we support \u2018Me Too\u2019 and the movement more than anybody, anybody \u2014 me as a woman, him as a man.\u201d\n\nIn an interview with Deadline published January 10, Douglas noted that a sexual harassment claim was going to be made against him in the future. The actor said he received a message from his attorney that The Hollywood Reporter was interested in a story involving one of the actor\u2019s former employees who alleges he sexually harassed her approximately 32 years ago. The woman alleges Douglas \u201cspoke raunchily\u201d to her and to his friends when she was around. She also claims Douglas masturbated in front of her.\n\nRelated 'Wednesday' Trailer: Catherine Zeta-Jones Slinks Into Netflix's 'Addams Family' Series\n\n'Franklin' First Look: Michael Douglas Takes on Benjamin Franklin in AppleTV+ Series Related The 200 Best Horror Movies of All Time\n\n35 Disturbing Foreign Films to Watch, from Gaspar No\u00e9 to Takashi Miike\n\n\u201cI had the choice of waiting for a story to come out, one that will clearly get picked up by other newspapers and magazines, and then I have to sit there and try to defend myself.
