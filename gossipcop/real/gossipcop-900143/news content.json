Rita Ora and John Legend also sang during the ceremony.\n\nThis year, 43 awards were to be attributed across the categories of movies, TV, music, and pop culture. Members of the public voted ahead of time for their favourite films, TV shows, musicians, and influencers.\n\nThree special awards were given. Melissa McCarthy was named People Icon of 2018, Victoria Beckham earned the Fashion Icon title, and lawyer and social justice activist Bryan Stevenson was awarded the People's Champion gong.\n\nIn addition to providing the opening performance for the evening, Minaj collected two major awards during the ceremony. She was named Female Artist of 2018 and won the Album of 2018 award for Queen. Minaj thus had the chance to give two humorous acceptance speeches. In the first, she gave a shout-out to actor Michael B Jordan, saying he would be removing her dress later in the evening. Minaj's second acceptance speech saw her dedicate her award to \"Kim Kardashian's a** in that dress\".\n\nAvengers: Infinity War, which was released in April this year by Marvel, was one of the night's big winners. The superhero film was named movie of the year and won the Action Movie of 2018 award. It also earned Scarlett Johansson the title of Female Movie Star of 2018 for her role as Black Widow.\n\nBlack Panther, another Marvel Studios production, led to two awards. Chadwick Boseman was picked as Male Movie Star of 2018 for his role as T'Challa, while Danai Gurira, who plays Okoye, won the Action Movie Star of 2018 gong.\n\nFollow updates as they happened\n\nPlease allow a moment for the liveblog to load.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/11/14/screen-shot-2018-11-09-at-3.09.00-pm.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/11/14/screen-shot-2018-11-09-at-3.09.00-pm.png?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/11/14/screen-shot-2018-11-09-at-3.09.00-pm.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cl\u00e9mence Michallon", "New York", "James Crump"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/peoples-choice-awards-live-winners-time-channel-watch-vote-2018-niki-minaj-taylor-swift-a8627016.html", "title": "People's Choice Awards 2018: Nicki Minaj, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War triumph", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "Forty-three gongs were attributed ahead of\u00a0Sunday night based\u00a0on the public's votes", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/music/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-11-12T04:48:44.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "People's Choice Awards 2018: Nicki Minaj, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War triumph", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/news/peoples-choice-awards-live-winners-time-channel-watch-vote-2018-niki-minaj-taylor-swift-a8627016.html", "type": "article", "description": "Forty-three gongs were attributed ahead of\u00a0Sunday night based\u00a0on the public's votes", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/11/14/screen-shot-2018-11-09-at-3.09.00-pm.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/11/14/screen-shot-2018-11-09-at-3.09.00-pm.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-11-12T04:48:44.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-11-12T04:48:44.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "Music", "author_name": "Cl\u00e9mence Michallon", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 608, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 0, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 13, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2018-11-12T04:48:44.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "People's Choice Awards 2018: Nicki Minaj, Black Panther and Avengers: Infinity War triumph", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Forty-three gongs were attributed ahead of\u00a0Sunday night based\u00a0on the public's votes", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/11/11/14/screen-shot-2018-11-09-at-3.09.00-pm.png?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Taylor Swift,Nicki Minaj,Rita Ora,John Legend,People's Choice Awards,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541998124.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
