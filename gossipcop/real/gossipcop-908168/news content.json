No. It\u2019s \u201cShy\u201d.\u2019\n\nAnd Aunty Khloe also revealed how to pronounce the baby\u2019s nickname, which, let\u2019s face it, is probably what we\u2019re going to go by.\n\nShe tweeted: \u2018Hey Chi (shy).\u2019\n\nWhatever you think of the name we know young Chi will rock, just like her older siblings North, and Saint do.\n\nOkay, so now we want a baby pic please and thanks.\n\nGot a showbiz story?
