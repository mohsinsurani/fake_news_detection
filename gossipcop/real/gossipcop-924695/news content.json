Hamlin explained in the caption that the first photo is recent, while the other is from last year when she was suffering from anorexia. Hamlin looked visibly thinner in the second photo.\n\n\u201cLast year at this time there was no doubt that I was not okay,\u201d Hamlin wrote in the captiom. \u201cNot only physically but also mentally. I feel like sometimes people forget that just because your job involves being in front of the camera, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have bad days. We\u2019re human. All of us.\u201d\n\nHamlin said she hopes that others will benefit from reading about her struggles.\n\n\u201cI went through this journey not for attention, not for people to pitty [sic] me, but to help,\u201d she said. \u201cI am on this earth to help people, and I know that.\u201d\n\nInstagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public.\n\nHamlin also told fans that she suffers from \u201chealth complications\u201d as a result of her years long battle with anorexia. She said that she was recently diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s disease, an autoimmune disorder that attacks the thyroid gland.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of health complications after starving myself for so long so it\u2019s going to be a journey that I go through for a large part of my life \u2026 not to say that recently being diagnosed with Hashimoto\u2019s has also been an extreme challenge for me to balance when still getting over this part of my life, but I am getting there. One day at a time. I want to help.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180402143940-amelia-gray-hamlin.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170126173139-chloe-melas.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180402143940-amelia-gray-hamlin.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180402143940-amelia-gray-hamlin.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chloe Melas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/02/entertainment/lisa-rinna-anorexia-amelia-gray-hamlin/index.html", "title": "Lisa Rinna's daughter reveals battle with anorexia", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Lisa Rinna's daughter Amelia Gray Hamlin reveals battle with anorexia | CNN", "description": "Amelia Gray Hamlin, the daughter of actors Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin, took to Instagram on Sunday to reveal that she struggled with anorexia.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180402143940-amelia-gray-hamlin.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/04/02/entertainment/lisa-rinna-anorexia-amelia-gray-hamlin/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lisa Rinna's daughter Amelia Gray Hamlin reveals battle with anorexia | CNN", "description": "Amelia Gray Hamlin, the daughter of actors Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin, took to Instagram on Sunday to reveal that she struggled with anorexia.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180402143940-amelia-gray-hamlin.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1688,w_2999,c_fill/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Amelia Gray Hamlin, the daughter of actors Lisa Rinna and Harry Hamlin, took to Instagram on Sunday to reveal that she struggled with anorexia.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-02T19:04:10Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-02T19:04:10Z", "tag": "celebrities, diseases and disorders, eating disorders, health and medical, lisa rinna, mental health, mental illnesses", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "celebrities, diseases and disorders, eating disorders, health and medical, lisa rinna, mental health, mental illnesses", "author": "Chloe Melas", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522623600.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
