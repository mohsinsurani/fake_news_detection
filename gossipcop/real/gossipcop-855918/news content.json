Staged just six months after allegations surrounding Harvey Weinstein shocked the world, the headlines from this year\u2019s showcase are about the power of women and their pursuit of equality.\n\nThis in mind, the one-way conversation I might normally have in this column about who wore which gown by which designer seems as limiting as it is discourteous. But if you\u2019ll excuse my insolence I\u2019d like to do so, because in watching Cannes from afar, it\u2019s clear that something extraordinary is happening. The ball gown is no longer a prerequisite. At least it has been knocked down a peg or two, with more and more attendees choosing to shun tradition in favour of clothes that confirm and reflect a modern new age for the festival.\n\nTake a glance at the relaxed trouser suits and the statement sweaters, worn (gasp!) with a pair of flat pumps instead of towering stilettos, and it\u2019s clear to see: there is change afoot on the French Riviera.\n\nIt is from those choosing to buck the tried and tested trends of Cannes that a best-dressed list which is unlike any other in the festival\u2019s history emerges. Among the leading figures are L\u00e9a Seydoux \u2014 an actress who represents a vibrant new generation of female film-makers \u2014 who favoured cocktail style sweaters and thigh-skimming Louis Vuitton shirt dresses instead of conforming to classic Cannes tradition.\n\nLea Seydoux at the Cold War premiere / AFP/Getty Images\n\nShe is joined by Kristen Stewart, who packed an array of Chanel trouser suits to accompany her on her trip to the French Coast, and by Carey Mulligan, who marched to her own tune in a scarlet tuxedo.\n\nCarey Mulligan poses for portrait photographs for the film 'Wildlife' / Joel C Ryan/Invision/AP\n\nSaturday night\u2019s protest serves as the most glorious example of Cannes\u2019 prevalent new image, with women from across the length and breadth of the film industry choosing to take to the red carpet in everything from shift dresses and trouser suits to their favourite pair of jeans. The result was a spectacle which unearthed these women at their most powerful and a key change for the festival which counts gowns and honking great diamonds as crucial to its DNA as the Palme D\u2019Or.\n\nOf course Cannes is Cannes and accordingly there were gowns aplenty on the Le Croisette this year, with puffy and princessy giving way to moody shades and strong silhouettes.\n\nKristen Stewart in a Chanel suit and Cate Blanchett in an Armani gown / Getty Images\n\nWhen jury president Cate Blanchett made her impassioned speech on Saturday she did so in a streamlined creation by Giorgio Armani. It was a fitting complement for a woman who would have looked statuesque had she decided on a bin bag to wear to the occasion.\n\nJulianne Moore wearing a Givenchy gown / AFP/Getty Images\n\nStepping out in show stopping Givenchy, Julianne Moore made a similar impact. Cut with pin-sharp precision and laden with feathers, here was a dress that made no apologies for Moore\u2019s pre-eminence. It was empowering \u2014 and completely fabulous.\n\nIn 2018, a year in which battles for flexible working and equal pay are as pertinent as they have ever been, the descent of princess dressing on Cannes\u2019s red carpet makes for refreshing viewing. After all, while a couture gown laden with 20kg of diamonds might be one woman\u2019s fairy tale, for many \u2014 for most \u2014 it\u2019s not a practical choice.\n\nCannes Film Festival 2018 - the
