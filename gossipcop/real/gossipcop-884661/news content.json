I want to say thank you for the outpouring of love from my friends and fans we have received over the last couple days. You guys have no idea how much you have helped get us through this tough time.\u201d\n\nOn Tuesday afternoon, officials said that at least 59 people had been killed and more than 500 were injured.\n\nOn Sunday night, gunman Stephen Paddock opened fire from his 32nd-floor hotel room at the Mandalay Bay casino on the crowd of more than 22,000 at the Route 91 Harvest Festival, an outdoor country music festival that was at the end of its third day and Aldean was performing the closing set.\n\nThe country star released an emotional plea on Monday evening asking fans and followers to \u201ccome together and stop the hate.\u201d\n\n\u201cSomething has changed in this country and in this world lately that is scary to see. This world is becoming the kind of place I am afraid to raise my children in,\u201d said Aldean, who is expecting a baby boy with wife Brittany.\n\nWATCH: 50 Killed, 200 Wounded at Jason Aldean\u2019s Las Vegas Concert \u2013 Deadliest Mass Shooting in U.S. History\n\nHow to Help and Learn About Loved Ones\n\nFriends and family are asked to report missing people believed to be connected to the shooting using the hotline 1-800-536-9488.\n\nAnyone with photo or video evidence of the shooting is asked to call 1-800-CALL-FBI.\n\nThe city of Las Vegas has established a Family Reunification Center to help connect relatives with the more than 500 people who were injured.\n\nIn addition, city officials urged those locally who wish to donate blood to visit one of two donation centers operated by United Blood Services, either at 6930 W.
