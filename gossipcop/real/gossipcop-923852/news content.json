The cheek.\n\nThe couple haven't named the airport that allowed him to travel with nothing more than a cover shot... which is probs for the best. Social media users couldn't handle this news, with people wondering just how on earth this was allowed.\n\nI CANT BREATHE IMAGINE BEING ABLE TO JUST HOLD UP A MAGAZINE TO AIRPORT SECURITY TO IDENTIFY URSELF \u2014 henny c (@newamericanas) March 28, 2018\n\nIs that actually allowed? \u2014 Glor parx (@floriaandfading) March 28, 2018\n\nThey let me use a Costco card and my work badge once when i forgot mine \u2014 Lauren (@laurenlolli518) March 28, 2018\n\nPicture: GIPHY\n\nYou Should Download Our Brand New App For All The Latest Music News!\n\nWatch Dua Lipa get in trouble for leaping into a
