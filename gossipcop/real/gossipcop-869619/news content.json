We know he's technically not a Kardashian or Jenner ex, but he is Kardashian adjacent, and having him in the mix makes this guest list substantially more intriguing and weird. Hands down.\n\n...as was Robert Shapiro because WHY NOT!?!?\n\nOh, to be a fly on that wall because...", "images": ["http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-071017-rob-ti.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhop-candiace-dillard-chris.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-tyga-embed.jpg?itok=SkBcNR9i", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-robert-shapiro.jpg?itok=1IxsUDf8", "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-072717-chyna-tyga-lamar-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-kyle-cooke-tom-schwartz-divorce.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/09/daily-dish-rhoslc-season-3-announcement_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-chyna-lamar-embed.jpg?itok=kQaMphWo", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhobh-kyle-richards-jamie-lee-curtis-halloween-ends-reunion.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhobh-garcelle-beauvais-movie.jpeg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/10/daily-dish-rhonj-dolores-catania-nana.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/themes/custom/lifestyle/images/heartlock-white.png", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/08/daily-dish-real-girlfriends-in-paris-trailer.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-lamar-embed.jpg?itok=ZCKJVAuJ", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/06/daily-dish-rhoa-after-show.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2022/07/daily-dish-rhobh-after-show.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/faux_player__mobile/public/media_mpx/thumbnails/bravo-video.nbcuni.com/image/NBCU_Bravo/48/847/170727_3559065_Blac_Chyna___Rob_Kardashian_s_Relationship_T.jpg?itok=fnnpXIA_", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-071417-blac-chyna-promote.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/2021/05/bravocon-2021-announcement_0.jpg", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-black-chyna-embed.jpg?itok=MUBVv1ZE", "http://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/styles/blog-post-embedded--mobile/public/dish-072717-bella-thorne-embed.jpg?itok=-fVKj-TC"], "top_img": "https://www.bravotv.com/sites/bravo/files/field_blog_image/2017/07/dish-072717-chyna-tyga-lamar-promote.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bravotv.com/the-daily-dish/kardashian-exes-tyga-blac-chyna-and-lamar-odom-party-together-photos", "title": "Kardashian Exes Tyga, Blac Chyna, Lamar Odom Party Together", "meta_data": {"branch": {"deeplink": {"showJourneys": "true"}}, "parsely-post-id": 1125240, "parsely-section": "The Daily Dish Blog Post", "parsely-metadata": "{\"type\":\"node\",\"bundle\":\"blog\",\"display_title\":\"Tyga, Blac Chyna, and Lamar Odom All Walk Into a Party\",\"kicker\":{\"teaser_meta_horizontal\":\"The Daily Dish\"},\"field_microsite\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"microsite_nid\":\"1075801\",\"site_section\":\"The Daily Dish\",\"thumbnails\":{\"3_2_small\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_small\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/07\\/dish-072717-chyna-tyga-lamar-promote.jpg?itok=vRkCAp5F\",\"3_2_medium\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_medium\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/07\\/dish-072717-chyna-tyga-lamar-promote.jpg?itok=_9No9ljB\",\"3_2_large\":\"https:\\/\\/www.bravotv.com\\/sites\\/bravo\\/files\\/styles\\/3_2_thumbnail_large\\/public\\/field_blog_image\\/2017\\/07\\/dish-072717-chyna-tyga-lamar-promote.jpg?itok=b0yI-577\"}}", "description": "This is the kind of thing you can't make up.
