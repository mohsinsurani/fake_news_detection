But Katie not-so-subtly left the room as Davis \u2013 who traditionally announces his big name guests at the event \u2013 was about to give a shout out to them both.\n\nKATIE HOLMES LOOKS SMITTEN WITH JAMIE FOXX IN RARE PUBLIC APPEARANCE\n\nBut when she returned, Davis called her out, saying, \u201cThis lady left the room right when I was going to introduce her, she was sitting at that table right with Jamie Foxx and everyone else.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf you\u2019re going to sit together what better night than tonight,\u201d Davis added to laughs from the audience, which included Jay Z, Beyonc\u00e9, Pink, John Legend and Chrissy Tiegen, Cardi B, Sting, DJ Khaled and a host of top music execs.\n\nA camera showed Foxx, 50, still sitting at the next table, cracking up into laughter while Holmes gave an embarrassed smile.\n\nBut later in the night, Foxx finally moved into the seat next to Holmes, where he was seen whispering in her ear. Then when Logic and Khaled performed, they got up onto their feet and danced with other partygoers.\n\nThe pair was first linked in 2013, but have kept their relationship low-key. They have been spotted visiting each other in LA, in Paris together last spring, and there were photographed strolling on a Malibu beach in September.\n\nThis article originally appeared in the New York Post.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/kevinSpacey.jpeg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/et-handout-katie-holmes-jamie-fox-getty.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/meek-mill-kanye.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/348/196/GettyImages-1427614638.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/et-handout-katie-holmes-jamie-fox-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/436b45c1-kushner-kloss-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-411.svg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/Getty_QueenElizabeth_PrinceAndrew.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/348/196/Kanye_West_Kim_Kardashian.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/et-handout-katie-holmes-jamie-fox-getty.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/01/28/katie-holmes-and-jamie-foxx-finally-let-their-love-shine/", "title": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx look like a couple at pre-Grammys gala", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Music mogul\u00a0Clive Davis\u00a0poked fun at\u00a0Katie Holmes and\u00a0Jamie Foxx\u2018s coy attempts to hide their relationship at his starry Pre-Grammy Awards Gala.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx look like a couple at pre-Grammys gala", "dcterms.abstract": "Music mogul\u00a0Clive Davis\u00a0poked fun at\u00a0Katie Holmes and\u00a0Jamie Foxx\u2018s coy attempts to hide their relationship at his starry Pre-Grammy Awards Gala.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Music mogul\u00a0Clive Davis\u00a0poked fun at\u00a0Katie Holmes and\u00a0Jamie Foxx\u2018s coy attempts to hide their relationship at his starry Pre-Grammy Awards Gala.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:400cd754-b4d6-5340-97d1-1d762cbb2bcf", "dc.source": "New York Post", "dc.date": "2018-01-28", "dcterms.created": "2018-01-28T19:07:35-05:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-01-28T19:12:46-05:00", "og": {"title": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx look like a couple at pre-Grammys gala", "description": "Music mogul\u00a0Clive Davis\u00a0poked fun at\u00a0Katie Holmes and\u00a0Jamie Foxx\u2018s coy attempts to hide their relationship at his starry Pre-Grammy Awards Gala.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/et-handout-katie-holmes-jamie-fox-getty.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-look-like-a-couple-at-pre-grammys-gala", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Katie Holmes, Jamie Foxx look like a couple at pre-Grammys gala", "description": "Music mogul\u00a0Clive Davis\u00a0poked fun at\u00a0Katie Holmes and\u00a0Jamie Foxx\u2018s coy attempts to hide their relationship at his starry Pre-Grammy Awards Gala.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/et-handout-katie-holmes-jamie-fox-getty.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/katie-holmes-jamie-foxx-look-like-a-couple-at-pre-grammys-gala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/EVENTS/Grammys,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "grammys,entertainment", "classification-tags": "grammys,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
