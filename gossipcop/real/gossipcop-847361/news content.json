Ripa had brought on more than a handful of women and men to temporarily co-host the show with her, and there were a few rumored names to be frontrunners for the permanent position.\n\nSEE ALSO: Ryan Seacrest named as 'Live' co-host, Twitter asks: 'Does he EVER sleep?'\n\nJerry O'Connell was one of those rumored to be heavily considered for the role, and he took to Twitter on Monday to congratulate Seacrest on the news.\n\nSee photos of the people who were in contention for the spot:\n\n\n\n\"Congrats to my old friends @RyanSeacrest and @KellyRipa and even Gelman! Ha,\" he tweeted. \"Love you all @LiveKelly\"\n\nRipa's best friends, Andy Cohen and Anderson Cooper, who had also served as temporary co-hosts, took to Twitter to also congratulate the former \"American Idol\" host on his new position.\n\n\"Mazel @RyanSeacrest,\" Andy Cohen wrote, while Cooper said, \"Congratulations @RyanSeacrest, you get to join the best person i know, @KellyRipa every day! Can't wait to watch!\"\n\nAnother one of Ripa's former temporary co-hosts could become her future ratings rival, too. Earlier this week, sources revealed that Megyn Kelly's upcoming NBC morning show will air at 9 a.m., the same time slot as Ripa's long-running \"Live!\"\n\nRELATED: See photos of Ryan Seacrest through
