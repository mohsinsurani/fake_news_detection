It was reminiscent of a very similar display of affection between Princess Diana and Prince Charles back in 1987, when the late princess presented her former husband a prize at the Guards Polo Club in Windsor in Berkshire. Clearly, the prince is following in his mother's footsteps in more ways than one.\n\nGALLERY: All the photos from Harry and Meghan's day at the polo\n\nAfter Prince Harry\u2019s team won the polo match, his biggest fan Meghan \u2013 who had been cheering from the sidelines \u2013 was on hand to present her husband and his teammate, the charity\u2019s ambassador Nacho Figueras, with the Sentebale Polo 2018 trophy. After she handed the trophy to Nacho and gave him a kiss on each cheek, the former actress sidled up to Harry to congratulate him with a royal smooch, a follow up to their first public kiss on their wedding day on May 19.\n\nVIDEO: A kiss for her Prince! The Duchess of Sussex hands over the winning trophy to the Duke\u2019s @Sentebale team! pic.twitter.com/CdHcFeX3NT \u2014 Emily Nash (@emynash) July 26, 2018\n\nThe photo is bound to go down in history. It\u2019s one of the Royal Family\u2019s unofficial royal traditions, though it is certainly not expected for a royal couple to share a kiss! Almost every year Diana and Charles were spotted together at a polo match, they were seen locking lips \u2013 some private kisses behind the scenes, others in the middle of the field while Harry\u2019s dad was accepting a trophy. Because royal public displays of affection are generally frowned upon, it makes these instances that much more special for fans to witness.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex have made waves as one of the more unconventional royal couples, often being spotted clasping hands, holding each other\u2019s backs or looking longingly into each other\u2019s eyes. While their shows of affection have slowed a bit since they said \u201cI do,\u201d the world is certainly not starved for witnessing these tender moments \u2013 most recently, they were seen holding hands while on their first overseas royal tour in Ireland.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180726200606im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1728383620790976&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180726200606im_/https://www.himgs.com/imagenes/hello-canada/common/comscoreRogersMediaPublishingLifestyle.png?44", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180726200606im_/https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2018/07/26/000/610/462/featured_5_3.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180726200606im_/https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=HS7uq1SZw320l9", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180726200606im_/https://www.himgs.com/css/hello/img/logo.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180726200606im_/https://ca.hellomagazine.com/images/stories/0/2018/07/26/000/610/462/featured_5_3.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hello"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180726200606/https://ca.hellomagazine.com/royalty/02018072646440/meghan-markle-prince-harry-kiss-polo", "title": "Meghan Markle kisses Prince Harry at polo like Princess Diana", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "title": "Meghan Markle kisses Prince Harry at polo like Princess Diana", "description": "Meghan Markle and Prince Harry shared a sweet moment after his team won the Sentebale polo match \u2013 a kiss reminiscent of Princess Diana and Prince Charles back in 1987", "keywords": "British royals, Royal Kisses, Royal couples, Meghan markle, Prince Harry, Prince Charles, Princess Diana, Royalty, Home", "dc.title": "Meghan Markle kisses Prince Harry at polo like Princess Diana", "origen": "ca.hellomagazine.com", "author": "HELLO!
