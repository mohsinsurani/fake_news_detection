Ross Gilmore / Redferns/Getty Images\n\nNewton-John previously postponed some shows earlier in May for what she described at the time as \u201ca long running issue with sciatica\u201d that was causing her back pain.\n\nThe \u201cGrease\u201d star was first diagnosed with breast cancer in 1992, on the same weekend her father died of cancer. She lost her sister, Rona Newton-John, to brain cancer in 2013.\n\nLast fall Newton-John released an album with Amy Sky and Beth Nielsen Chapman, \u201cLiv On,\u201d that was inspired by their experiences with loss and illness, including the death of Newton-John's sister.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s to help people through grief and through healing, whatever time it takes you,\u201d she told Hoda Kotb and Kathie Lee Gifford in October.\n\nTuesday\u2019s statement noted that Newton-John will reschedule her postponed concert dates in the coming weeks.\n\nRELATED", "images":
