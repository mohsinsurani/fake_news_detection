In fact, it's hard to imagine times when we are more than an ear-length away from hearing another song.\n\nBut why does music mean so much to us? A powerful form of communication that transcends all barriers \u2014 music is our common language, but why?\n\nA composer and educator with a lifelong fascination for music, Adam Ockelford has traced our connection with music back to infants and caregivers. Infants are unable to follow words, but they are developmentally primed to trace patterns in sound, such as through the songs a caretaker sings to them. Therefore, understanding music is intuitive for humans, even at a very young age, and it encourages healthy development.\n\nIn addition, there may be another evolutionary purpose for music. Music provides a sense of sameness between humans \u2014 if you can copy the sounds someone else makes, you must be an ally. This synergy plays a role in human survival because it evokes empathy and understanding, a lesson we still learn from music in today's culture.\n\n\"Music is central to the notion of what it is to be human, and spans cultures, continents and centuries,\" writes Ockelford. \"My music, your music, our music can bind us together as families, as tribes and as societies in a way that nothing else can.\"\n\nNeed a playlist?
