But in the film, she is doing her best to carry on.\n\n\"It is 30 years since she shot to global stardom in The Wizard of Oz, but if her voice has weakened, its dramatic intensity has only grown,\" a release from the filmmakers states.\n\nThe movie will recount Garland's performances, with Zellweger singing some of her best-known numbers \u2014 including Somewhere Over the Rainbow from her greatest film success in 1939's The Wizard of Oz.\n\nJudy will also delve into Garland\u2019s behind-the-scenes battles with her management, her relationships with charmed musicians and fans as well as family drama playing out behind-the-scenes of the London performances.\n\n\"Judy is fragile,\" the film release states. \"After working for 45 of her 47 years, she is exhausted; haunted by memories of a childhood lost to Hollywood; gripped by a desire to be back home with her kids. Will she have the strength to go on?\"\n\nThe cast includes Jessie Buckley, Finn Wittrock and Harry Potter's Michael Gambon. British stage director Rupert Goold is directing.\n\nNo release date has been given.\n\nZellweger has shown she can sing and dance, earning critical raves and an Oscar nomination as Roxie Hart in the 2002 film adaptation of Chicago.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5754332789001_5754332129001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3492b4581f759f13a1512e274d4f9533073aed3d/c=129-225-2131-1356/local/-/media/2018/03/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636570858284284660-XXX-ZX47181-D-ZIEGFELD-FOLLIES-D-11114165.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/3492b4581f759f13a1512e274d4f9533073aed3d/c=129-225-2131-1356/local/-/media/2018/03/19/USATODAY/USATODAY/636570858284284660-XXX-ZX47181-D-ZIEGFELD-FOLLIES-D-11114165.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryan Alexander"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/03/19/first-look-renee-zellweger-judy-garland-judy-send-you-over-rainbow/440316002/", "title": "The first look of Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in 'Judy' will send you over the rainbow", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2018/03/19/first-look-renee-zellweger-judy-garland-judy-send-you-over-rainbow/440316002/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "The first look of Renee Zellweger as Judy Garland in 'Judy' will send you over the rainbow", "description": "Production has begun for the Judy Garland biopic 'Judy,' starring Renee Zellweger.
