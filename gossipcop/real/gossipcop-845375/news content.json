She says Brown \u201cseduced a naive and a curious 18-year-old foreign exchange student \u2026 with alcohol, fame, and casual sex.\u201d\n\nGilles claims she had \u201cconsensual group sex\u201d at Brown and Belafonte\u2019s home just days after meeting the couple. She says that over time, she and Brown \u201cdeveloped a friendship and sexual relationship with one another that was separate and apart from Brown\u2019s relationship with her husband.\u201d\n\nAccording to her lawsuit, Gilles says she eventually accepted Brown\u2019s offer to work for the couple as their nanny. She says her \u201csexual and employment relationship with Brown continued for approximately seven years.\u201d\n\nJames Devaney/GC Images\n\nGilles claims \u201cBelafonte was not present during most of the sexual encounters\u201d between herself and Brown and the only times she had sex with Belafonte was when Brown invited him to join. When that happened, Gilles claims, Brown would then \u201cserve as the \u2018camera man\u2019 and record the sexual encounter\u201d and/or take part.\n\nFurthermore, Gilles claims she \u201cpersonally witnessed both Brown and Belafonte bring different women into their home and engage in group sex on multiple occasions\u201d while Gilles watched their children.\n\nAs for Brown\u2019s claims that Gilles was pregnant with Belafonte\u2019s baby and subsequently had an abortion, Gilles does confirm she had an abortion, but says the pregnancy was the result of a one-night stand, something she confided to Brown about. Gilles says Brown was nothing but supportive and helped arrange the abortion and care for her afterward.\n\nGilles is suing for libel, invasion of privacy, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. She is seeking unspecified damages.", "images":
