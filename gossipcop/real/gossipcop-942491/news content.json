Those come in addition to the viewers who watch HBO on an ancient platform known as TV.\n\nWe figured this was as good a time as any to update comparisons among the existing streaming options. So here they are, with pretty pictures and variably pretty statistics:\n\nHBO Now\n\nLike Plepler said, the SVOD option for HBO currently has \u201cabout\u201d 800,000 paying subscribers after eight months of existence. That\u2019s a lower figure than Wall Street analysts wanted to see, but the service has yet to land on Xbox and PlayStation platforms. The two video game consoles account for about 20 percent of sister app HBO Go\u2019s viewing.\n\nOf course, HBO and Cinemax still do the vast majority of their business on cable \u2014 which people in the industry call \u201clinear\u201d viewing, a term that also applies to broadcast TV. A person with knowledge of the numbers told TheWrap that combined totals between the two channels are \u201capproaching 50 million domestic\u201d subscribers. Add in 81 million more paid users internationally, and one can understand why parent company Time Warner appreciates the traditional model.\n\nRead more details on the current state of HBO Now here.\n\nAlso Read: HBO Now Has 'About 800,000' Paying Subscribers, CEO Confirms\n\nHulu\n\nRight around the previous television upfronts season, Hulu revealed that it had about 9 million paying subscribers. However, a lot has happened since April 2015, and we don\u2019t just mean a long 10 months passing.\n\nSince that number, Hulu has not only added a ton of content, it\u2019s changed subscription options. The 9 million count came about at a time when the service only offered an $8-per-month plan, with which subscribers still had to watch commercials. In September, Hulu rolled out a $12 monthly subscription option that removes the ads.\n\nThe company plans to publicly update its subscriber total sometime this year, but all Hulu told TheWrap today was, \u201cOur subscriber base has continued to grow since then.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s important to note here that Hulu is only meaningfully active in the United States, unlike \u2026\n\nAlso Read: Time Warner's Q4 HBO Growth Can't Offset Company's Box Office Sales Drop\n\nNetflix\n\nThe big boy of them all, Netflix boasts a massive 70.1 million paid subscriptions worldwide. In the U.S., the company\u2019s 43.4 million paid subscribers is pushing five-times Hulu\u2019s count.\n\nNetflix still does not release viewership information, though it claims \u201cOrange Is the New Black\u201d would be the top show across pay-TV if it did. San Francisco-based Symphony Advanced Media has claimed it can accurately measure Netflix\u2019s viewing, and that the numbers aren\u2019t nearly as impressive as Ted Sarandos and Reed Hastings would like us all to believe. Those two guys say the claim \u2014 and Symphony A.M.\u2019s data \u2014 is hogwash.\n\nAlso Read: 'Fuller House' Trailer Brings the 'Full House' Gang Back Together (Video)\n\nAmazon Prime\n\nAmazon keeps a lid on its figures too, though it has thrown around the phrase \u201ctens of millions\u201d in the past. That said, many \u2014 or probably most \u2014 of Amazon\u2019s Prime subscribers don\u2019t even watch the TV shows and movies. They just want free two-day shipping on paper towels.\n\nAlso Read: Amazon Stock Sinks Like a Stone After Missing Q4 Expectations\n\nCBS All Access\n\nLast March, CBS Chairman Les Moonves sort of gave guidance about how many subscribers CBS All Access has. While he would not talk statistics, when asked if his streaming option had more subscribers than the roughly 100,000 reported for Dish\u2019s Sling service at the time, Moonves affirmed that it definitely did. He went no further than that, and several analysts took the tone of his quick confirmation to mean that All Access was well above Sling\u2019s 100,000 benchmark.\n\nAlso Read: Ratings: 'NCIS' Blows Away Competition on Tuesday\n\nSling TV\n\nWhich brings us to Sling, which had a company reported 169,000 subscribers by the end of March. That was the last time Dish shared its figures. However, through a little third-party reverse engineering-style mathematics, StreamingMediaBlog.com reported in December that Sling was up to about 400,000 subscribers \u2014 but definitely below 500,000.\n\nAlso Read: 'Star Trek' Reboot Gets Bryan Fuller as Showrunner\n\nThe Mysteries\n\nShowtime, YouTube Red and Playstation Vue have not shared subscriber numbers.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Game-of-Thrones-Headey-Cersei.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/streaming.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/The-Mindy-Project.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Jeffery-Tambor-Transparent.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/House-of-Cards.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/Faris.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/08/Tony-Maglio-96x96.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thewrap-film-slate.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/sling-tv.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo_Small.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo-Stacked.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Image-2022-04-26-at-3.00.43-PM-300x81.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/streaming.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tony Maglio"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/hbo-vs-hulu-vs-netflix-heres-whos-winning-in-streaming-subscribers-by-a-lot/", "title": "HBO vs. Hulu vs. Netflix: Here\u2019s Who\u2019s Winning in Streaming Subscribers \u2013 By a Lot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f9f9f9", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-title": "HBO vs. Hulu vs. Netflix: Here\u2019s Who\u2019s Winning in Streaming Subscribers \u2013 By a Lot", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/hbo-vs-hulu-vs-netflix-heres-whos-winning-in-streaming-subscribers-by-a-lot/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2016-02-10T13:20:54-08:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Tony Maglio", "parsely-tags": "amazon, amazon_prime, cbs-all-access, hbo, hbo-now, hulu, netflix, playstation-vue, reed_hastings, richard_plepler, sling, ted_sarandos, youtube-red", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/streaming-160x105.jpg"}, "description": "Hint: The leader has more than 70 million paid users", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "HBO vs. Hulu vs. Netflix: Here's Who's Winning in Streaming Subscribers -
