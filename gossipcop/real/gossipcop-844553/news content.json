I\u2019ve only just recently come out as bisexual to my friends and family,\u201d she said in a photo posted to Twitter. \u201cIt\u2019s something I am still processing and trying to understand and I don\u2019t like talking about it too much.\u201d\n\nThe tweet was seemingly prompted by previous tweets from upset Riverdale fans about the use of queerbaiting in the teen drama in which the actress also stars. LGBT viewers were hopeful that the two female leads, Betty and Veronica, would be an item thanks to a kiss shared early on in the series. But when nothing came to be, some criticized the show's use of girl-on-girl action for views.\n\n@shannonpurser @colesprouse beronica fans are frustrated because they were blatantly, undeniably queerbaited into watching the show \u2014 jamie not spears (@jmiemarie) April 18, 2017\n\nOne twitter user, by the name of \u201cjamie not spears,\u201d tweeted \u201cberonica fans are frustrated because they were blatantly, undeniably queerbaited into watching the show.\u201d\n\nPurser retweeted the user\u2019s thread, responding, \u201cAnd I get that, representation is so powerful and important. But we didn't write the show? We have literally no say in what happens.\u201d\n\nAnd I get that, representation is so powerful and important. But we didn't write the show?

That being said, I have never ever wanted to alienate anyone and my tweet was thoughtless. I wasn't referring to all the beronica shippers, just the ones who had been particularly cruel to me personally.\"\n\nAlthough this was the first explicit statement about her sexual orientation, the star hasn\u2019t been shy about the topic of sexuality in the past.\n\nEarlier this month, she took to Twitter to talk about the anxiety she experienced over her sexuality.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/867041ca26a06133a2f6ceb7a02f8dee3d669165/c=0-116-1992-1614/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?width=320&height=240"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sara M Moniuszko"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/04/19/stranger-things-star-shannon-purser-comes-out-bi-addresses-queerbaiting/100660870/", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 star Shannon Purser comes out as bi, addresses queerbaiting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/entertainthis/2017/04/19/stranger-things-star-shannon-purser-comes-out-bi-addresses-queerbaiting/100660870/life/entertainthis", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "\u2018Stranger Things\u2019 star Shannon Purser comes out as bi, addresses queerbaiting", "description": "Shannon Purser, known for her role as Barb, has come out as bisexual on Twitter.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ca39855c2e593960e339f0491264cc7572e68312/c=0-93-1992-1219/local/-/media/2017/04/12/USATODAY/USATODAY/636275832103803431-663602100.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "news_keywords": "LGBT community,Television,Stranger Things,Bisexuals,LGBT issues", "description": "Shannon Purser, known for her role as Barb, has come out as bisexual on Twitter.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492556400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
