The rapper recently shared a photo of herself onto her Instagram account showing off her baby bump and a new \u2018do. Cardi B announced her pregnancy earlier this year on Saturday Night Live, where she performed as the show's guest performer and revealed her bump for the first time in a stunning white dress.\n\nRumors regarding the rappers pregnancy with Migos\u2019 Offset swirled for months until Cardi herself wanted to be \u201cfree\u201d and finally put an end to all that baby talk. With the cat out of the bag and a bun in the oven, Cardi is sharing her journey through pregnancy with her fans online, including in her most recent post.\n\nShe did take a brief Instagram hiatus earlier this year in May, after an altercation with Azealia Banks, but it is clear that she is back and ready to flaunt her stuff on the social media platform.\n\nThe \"Be Careful\" rapper captioned her photo: \u201cBig Momma\u201d, as she posed looking absolutely beautiful in a white body fitting dress, with ornate jewelry, long pink nails, and her new rainbow hair. Yes, you heard that right, rainbow hair. Cardi wore her hair in a half-up-half-down top-knot style to show off her rainbow colors. The blue, pink and yellow colors radiate in the pic, being the center of attention in the gorgeous shot.\n\nThe rapper is proving that although she may be pregnant, it is by no means putting a stop her creative fashion choices. Cardi has been a huge supporter of Fashionova, an online retailer that sells clothes for less, and it appears that she has smashed it yet again in this Instagram pic. If anyone can make rainbow hair work, it\u2019s definitely Cardi B.\n\nThe rapper is not only expecting any day now, she is currently promoting her recent album Invasion of Privacy, which was released on April 6th, 2018. With a baby on the way, an album to promote and a strong Instagram game, Cardi is proving that she can truly do it all.\n\nNEXT: BROCCOLI FEST MARKS CARDI B'S LAST PERFORMANCE BEFORE BABY", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cardi-B-Bump-Hair.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-colored-light.53763959.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/re-logo-full-colored-light.4b543c53.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-colored-light.8d65e7f9.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-colored-light.051eb8af.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cardi-B-Bump-Hair.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michael Ibrahim"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126/https://www.babygaga.com/cardi-b-instagram-baby-bump-rainbow-hair/", "title": "Cardi B Is Back On Instagram Sharing Her Baby Bump And Rainbow Hair", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Cardi B posted two photos on Instagram recently showing off her huge baby bump and debuting her new rainbow-dyed hair.", "og": {"title": "Cardi B Is Back On Instagram Sharing Her Baby Bump And Rainbow Hair", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cardi-B-Bump-Hair.jpg", "width": 1710, "height": 900}, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126/https://www.babygaga.com/cardi-b-instagram-baby-bump-rainbow-hair/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Cardi B posted two photos on Instagram recently showing off her huge baby bump and debuting her new rainbow-dyed hair.", "site_name": "BabyGaga"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-17T15:45:05Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-17T15:45:05Z", "section": "Parenting News", "author": "Michael Ibrahim", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/babygaga"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@babygaga", "title": "Cardi B Is Back On Instagram Sharing Her Baby Bump And Rainbow Hair", "description": "Cardi B posted two photos on Instagram recently showing off her huge baby bump and debuting her new rainbow-dyed hair.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220819185126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Cardi-B-Bump-Hair.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 270407583294564}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529250305.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
