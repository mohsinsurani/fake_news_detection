I know what you're thinking, this link may seem tenuous given that the whole of Hollywood goes BUT Swift's new song 'Dress' - where she sings: 'Flashback to when you met me/ Your buzz cut/ And my hair bleached' -has provided some fans with the theory that the 2016 event could be significant.\n\nGetty Images\n\nA-ha! At the gala, Joe's hair is certainly shorter and Taylor rocks a bleached blonde bob...\n\n\n\nHowever, this Met Gala is also seemingly full of Taylor-related events as a video of her and (soon to be boyfriend) Tom Hiddleston having a dance-off to Beyonce's Crazy in Love does the rounds on the internet.\n\nJust a month later, she announces she has broken up with boyfriend of a year Calvin Harris and weeks later she's pictured kissing Tom Hiddleston. 'Hiddleswift', as they become to be known, break up in September, 2016.\n\n12 October 2016: Taylor and a whole load of squad members (Is the squad still a thing?) including Lorde, Cara Delevingne, Dakota Johnson and Martha Hunt attend a secret Kings of Leon concert in New York City. It's widely reported that Joe was also there and this is the place where the couple meet.\n\nTaylor and Dakota Johnson in NYC on October 12, 2016 Getty Images\n\n12 November 2016: Taylor is papped going to watch a film with her mother and two of the Haim sisters Este and Alana in Los Angeles. And what film is this? Only Joe Alwyn's film Billy Lynn's Long Halftime Walk.\n\nCoincidence orrrrr?\n\n16 May 2017: Unfortunately, we can't fill you in on what specifically happened over the six months between November 2016 and May 2017 because the couple were so darn good at hiding their relationship.\n\nIn May, the story of their relationship finally breaks. The Sun reports that the pair have been dating in secret for months (seems about right) and that Taylor is \"besotted\" with him.\n\nThey add that she's been spending lots of time in London with him, using wigs, scarves and hats as a disguise.\n\n\"Taylor and Joe are the real deal, this is a very serious relationship,\" a source tells the newspaper. \"...Taylor has flown in via private jets and her security has made it a military-like mission to prevent her from being seen.\"\n\n1 June 2017: As well as Taylor's Mission Impossible-style visits to the UK, Joe also flies to see Taylor in New York, reports E! News.\n\n\"Taylor and Joe have really tried to be on lockdown and have spent most of their time together in private locations where they could get to know each other without the pressure of a public relationship and people making judgement calls,\" a source tells the outlet.\n\n2 June 2017: E! News covers the story a day later, reporting that Joe has finally met... the squad.\n\nTaylor Swift and said \u2019squad\u2019 at the 2015 VMAs Getty Images\n\nApparently, Selena Gomez and Gigi Hadid, as well as other \"close friends\", had the pleasure of meeting and getting to know their pals' new beau.\n\n5 June 2017: Taylor and Joe are pictured together for the first time in a paparazzi shot. The two are seen enjoying coffee on a balcony in Nashville, Tennessee and Taylor is smiling. Cute! It's reported that Joe is there to meet the parents. Dun dun dunnnn.\n\nAs well as this, reports that Taylor is house-hunting in London - the city where none other than bloomin' Joe lives - also do the rounds.\n\n26 July 2017: Taylor and Joe are photographed again, however, this time they're really trying not to be. Pictures in the Mail Online show the couple wearing hoodies and keeping their eyes to the ground as they leave the singer's New York City apartment.\n\n5 September 2017: Taylor is back with new music and everyone is freaking out trying to guess who and what all the songs are about. After all, she's had a fairly eventful couple of years since her last album.\n\nOne song '...Ready for It?' has fans divided over whether it's about Joe or her former love interest Harry Styles. But then... according to Buzzfeed, Taylor reportedly likes a Tumblr post breaking down the lyrics, with all signs pointing to them being about Joe.\n\n21 September 2017: The secret transatlantic visits show no slowing down and they've reportedly been made easier by Taylor's famous mates.\n\nAccording to The Sun, Cara Delevingne hosted the couple at her house in west London so that they could continue to keep the whole thing on the DL while visiting Joe's family and friends.\n\nTaylor and Cara in NYC in September 2016 Getty Images\n\n\"She's trying to keep a low profile with Joe and staying with Cara has let her do that,\" a source told the tabloid. \"... They can even walk Cara's dog round the local park without anyone batting an eyelid.\"\n\n20 October 2017:\n\nAnother song from Taylor's forthcoming album Reputation drops and it's called 'Gorgeous'. According to fans, Taylor told them the song was about Joe during one of her secret listening sessions.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nTaylor told fans at the secret sessions that #Gorgeous is about her boyfriend Joe pic.twitter.com/4mxHSz9neL \u2014 Taylor Swift News \ud83d\udd70\ufe0f (@TSwiftNZ) October 20, 2017\n\nLyrics include: \"You should take it as a compliment / That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk / You should think about he consequence / Of your magnetic field being a little too strong /And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us.\"\n\nFirstly, Joe is British and Taylor is American which could explain the whole making fun of the way you talk thing. Secondly, her two previous boyfriends have been in their 30s and therefore older than Joe.\n\n26 October 2017:\n\nTaylor's BFF Ed Sheeran pipes up, telling a radio station he thinks Joe is a \"good dude\".\n\nTaylor and Ed at the 2016 Grammy awards Getty Images\n\nGiving the seal of approval, the 'Shape of You' singer tells Capital London's Breakfast Show: \"He's really nice. Really, really friendly, really good dude\".\n\n3 November 2017: The fourth song from Reputation drops and this time it's 'Call It What You Want' which fans think seems to include a mix of references about both the Kimye feud and Joe.\n\nHere are the lyrics which might be about Joe:\n\n\"My baby's fly like a jet stream/ High above the whole scene\" - potentially referencing that Joe is not as famous as some of Swift's previous love interests.\n\n10 November 2017: Taylor's 15-track album is released in full, proving plenty more lyrics for us to try and dissect. Among the many fan theories pointing to lines about Joe, a couple are:\n\n'Don't Blame Me': \"I've been breaking hearts a long time, and toying with them older guys just to play things for me to use / Don't blame me, your love made me crazy / My drug is my baby / I'll be using for the rest of my life\"\n\nThe fact that Taylor seems to talk about the future in the last line indicates she's singing about a current relationship, i.e. her and Joe.\n\n'Delicate': \"My reputation's never been worse, so you must like me for me / Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you / Oh damn, never seen that colour blue.\"\n\nIt's fair to say Taylor's public reputation took a bash during the time she met Joe, which she could be hinting at when she describes how the mysterious subject of the song was into her regardless.\n\nHe also has very blue eyes, we might add.\n\n\n\n6 April 2018: Taylor is reportedly keen to buy a \u00a330m house in north London's Crouch End, so she can \"set down roots\" near where Joe and his family live.\n\nA source told The Sun: \u201cTaylor loves the UK and how she can live a relatively normal life without being disturbed,\" the source said. \u201cSetting down roots is something she\u2019s thought long and hard about. She\u2019s set aside \u00a330million ($42million) to find the house of her dreams, which she hopes to one day settle down in with Joe if their relationship continues to grow.\"\n\n29 September 2018: Taylor and Joe are spotted hand-in-hand heading towards the singer's New York City apartment together.\n\nJackson Lee Getty Images\n\n22 November 2018: Would you believe it?

Well, until Izuka Hoyle, who plays courtier Mary Seton, shared an Instagram Story of the pair chatting in the cinema's lobby, along with the caption, \"Romeo take me somewhere we can be alone\".\n\nInstagram Stories\n\nWhile fans are desperate for their first official red carpet moment for Joe and Taylor, a source told The Sun the singer didn't want to distract from her boyfriend's achievements.\n\n\"Taylor didn't want to draw attention to herself because it was really Joe's night\", the insider commented. \"But she did want to support him and knew he would appreciate her being there, so she took steps to try and prevent anyone knowing she was there.\n\n\"It worked in the dark of the cinema but by the time they made it to the party afterwards her cover was blown.\"\n\n6 January 2019: A new year and yet Taylor and Joe still appear to be going strong. The two attended the Golden Globes, separately, of course and then hit up several after-parties following the show.\n\nAll eyes on Taylor at the 2019 InStyle and Warner Bros party Donato Sardella Getty Images\n\nTaylor was spotted at the InStyle/Warner Bros party - where she posed on the red carpet - and then at Fox's and Netflix's soirees, as was Joe. At the Netflix afterparty, \"Taylor Swift, was the star of the party, sitting in a VIP area next to [Netflix CCO Ted] Sarandos. At one point, Sarandos approached Swift and her boyfriend Joe Alwyn to ask for a photo with the star. Swift obliged, but was quickly met with more and more photo requests from other attendees at the party. Security called for backup to her section to give her some privacy, but Swift and Alwyn left the event shortly after,\" per The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nJoe at the FOX, FX And Hulu 2019 Golden Globe Awards After Party Phillip Faraone Getty Images\n\nA reporter for Entertainment Tonight also told his Twitter followers how he'd witnessed \"Joe Alwyn give Taylor Swift a kiss at the Fox afterparty\". Cute!\n\n17 January 2019: Given that Joe is in every film under the sun at the start of 2019 (well, it feels like it, he has parts in The Favourite and Mary Queen of Scots) he conducts some interviews to promote these movies.\n\n\n\nIn one with , he objects to being labelled \"strangely private\" over his and Taylor's refusal to discuss their relationship. He tells the magazine he doesn't think he's had to \"fight for his privacy\" more than anyone else in the public eye and it seems like he's just of the opinion he doesn't have to share one of the more personal sides of his life with the rest of the world.\n\n\"I don't think anyone you meet on the streets would just spill their guts out to you, therefore why should I?\" he says. \"And then that is defined as being 'strangely private'. Fine. But I don't think it is. I think it's normal.\"\n\n10 February 2019: Taylor skipped the Grammys so she could support Joe at the BAFTAs, where his film, The Favourite, won like a million awards.

They were able to get to know each other in peace.\"\n\nGetty Images\n\nWhile there are rumours going around that Joe is planning a proposal, Taylor is apparently just happy to be with him whatever happens. \"Taylor really got lucky to meet Joe, and she is the first one to say it,\u201d a source said. \u201cJoe really is one of a kind.\u201d\n\nThe insider added that \"They have a very special relationship.

All\u2019s well that ends well to end up with you.\"\n\nSomething borrowed? Something blue? End up with you? Certainly sounds like a hint towards marriage, doesn't it?

MS.SWIFT ARE YOU GONNA BE TAYLOR ALWYN?\" one fan wrote, while another added, \"I think Taylor Swift just told us she's engaged. That's it.

Speaking about the surprise collaboration in her new documentary, folklore: the long pond studio sessions on Disney+, Taylor said:\n\n\"There's been a lot of discussion about William Bowery and his identity. He's not a real person... William Bowery is Joe, as we know. And Joe, Joe plays piano beautifully, and he's always just playing and making things up and kind of creating things.\"\n\nShe later revealed, \"I just heard Joe singing the entire, fully formed chorus of 'Betty' from another room. And I just was like, 'Hello,'\" Taylor said. \"It was a step that we would never have taken because why would we have ever written a song together? This was the first time we had a conversation where I came in and I was like, 'Hey, this could be really weird and we could hate this, so could we just, because we're in quarantine and there's nothing else going on, could we just try to see what it's like if we write this song together?'\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nAs for his involvement with the song 'Exile'? \"Joe had written that entire piano part and he was singing the Bon Iver part... He was just singing it. And so, I was entranced and I asked if we could keep writing that one. It was pretty obvious that it should be a duet, 'cause he's got such a low voice and it sounded really good sung down there in that register.\"\n\nWe are SO ready for a Joe/Taylor duet album.\n\nNovember 2020: Taylor speaks about Joe during an interview with Paul McCartney for Rolling Stone.\n\nDiscussing Folklore song 'Peace', Taylor explained, \"'Peace' is actually more rooted in my personal life. I know you [McCartney] have done a really excellent job of this in your personal life: carving out a human life within a public life, and how scary that can be when you do fall in love and you meet someone, especially if you\u2019ve met someone who has a very grounded, normal way of living.\n\n\"I, oftentimes, in my anxieties, can control how I am as a person and how normal I act and rationalise things, but I cannot control if there are 20 photographers outside in the bushes and what they do and if they follow our car and if they interrupt our lives. I can\u2019t control if there\u2019s going to be a fake weird headline about us in the news tomorrow.\"\n\nRobert Kamau Getty Images\n\nAsked by McCartney, \"Does your partner sympathise with that and understand?\" Taylor responded, \"Oh, absolutely. ... But I think that in knowing him and being in the relationship I am in now, I have definitely made decisions that have made my life feel more like a real life and less like just a storyline to be commented on in tabloids.\n\n\"Whether that\u2019s deciding where to live, who to hang out with, when to not take a picture \u2014 the idea of privacy feels so strange to try to explain, but it\u2019s really just trying to find bits of normalcy. That\u2019s what that song 'Peace' is talking about. Like, would it be enough if I could never fully achieve the normalcy that we both crave?\"\n\nJanuary 2021: After 11 months of not being seen out together (and being locked down because of you know what), Swift and Alwyn are photographed in London, out on a walk with his mum.

Never take them for granted.\"\n\n13th September 2021: Taylor took a trip to Belfast to support Joe as he wrapped filming for the BBC's adaptation of Sally Rooney novel Conversations with Friends.\n\nBelfast cocktail bar The Tipsy Bird shared the news by posting an adorable picture of Taylor alongside staff on Instagram.

So that if you're not posting all the time about what you're doing, how you're spending a day or how you made a breakfast, does that make you a recluse?\n\n\"I'd also like to feel slightly less guarded sometimes in interviews or in whatever kind of interactions, but it's just a knee-jerk response to the culture we live in. If you give it to them, it just opens the door.\"\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram.
