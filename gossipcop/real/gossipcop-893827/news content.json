News exclusive trailer as she gets up and walks off the reunion stage. As she enters her dressing room, the OG Housewife firmly says, \u201cI\u2019m off this damn show!\u201d\n\nDuring the explosive reunion, Gunvlason, 55, tells castmate and former friend Tamra Judge, \u201cThat doesn\u2019t look good on you, Tamra,\u201d who proceeds to fire back, \u201cNothing looks good on you.\u201d\n\nIn addition to Gunvalson and Judge\u2019s bickering, the two-part reunion will address the feuds between other cast members, including Lydia McLaughlin and Meghan King Edmonds.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t understand my faith, so of course it\u2019s not going to make sense to you,\u201d 36-year-old McLaughlin, who is a devout Christian, explains.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m just trying to say \u2026\u201d says Edmonds, 33, as McLaughlin cuts her off and firmly questions, \u201cWhat? What are you trying to say?\u201d\n\nThe reunion will also address Kelly Dodd being newly single since announcing her divorce, Peggy Sulahian\u2019s \u201cpain\u201d and feeling \u201cmisunderstood\u201d by her castmates, and Shannon Beador\u2019s separation from her husband, David.\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s gong on with your home?

You can do what you can to keep your family together, but you have to have willing parties. You need two people to make a marriage work, and that just wasn\u2019t happening in our relationship.\u201d\n\nThe first episode of a two-part season 12 Real Housewives of Orange County reunion airs
