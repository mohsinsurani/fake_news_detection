Ahead of the season (and possibly series) finale, Fox released a new promo for the rest of the season that offers a few clues as to what to expect. Here, THR breaks it all down.\n\nIn Wednesday\u2019s penultimate hour, FBI agents Fox Mulder (David Duchovny) and Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson) investigate a youth-obsessed cult. But arguably the most important parts of the episode \u2014 certainly the most emphasized by the trailer \u2014 are the conversations the duo have about their own relationship. \u201cI believed we could live together, and I fled,\u201d Scully says. \u201cI believed I could protect our son, and I failed.\u201d Adds Mulder: \u201cI don\u2019t know if any God is listening, but I am standing right here.\u201d\n\nThe notoriously complicated couple (who broke up before the season 10 revival, but slept together earlier this season) even finally address their status head-on, when Scully questions Mulder\u2019s assumption that they\u2019re together. (Baby steps.)\n\nUnfortunately for them, that may be the least of their problems. In the season finale, \u201cMy Struggle IV,\u201d series-long baddie Cigarette Smoking Man (William B. Davis) tells Assistant Director Walter Skinner (Mitch Pileggi) that he\u2019s about to deliver on his promise to unleash a global contagion. The season 10 finale also had the agents trying to stop a global contagion from wiping out the majority of the population; the season 11 premiere revealed that was Scully\u2019s shared premonition with her MIA son, William, about what was to come.\n\nSpeaking of Skinner, the trailer implies he may finally share the secret he\u2019s been sitting on all year. \u201cThere\u2019s something you need to know,\u201d Skinner tells Scully. \u201cSomething you may not want to hear.\u201d Viewers know that Skinner was told in the season 11 premiere that CSM (not Mulder) was actually William\u2019s (Miles Robbins) biological father \u2026 but will he finally tell Scully? (And if he does, will she tell Mulder?)\n\nEither way, William finally will have to face his parents in the finale. After encountering them midseason in \u201cGhouli\u201d (but using his powers to disguise himself), Mulder seeks out his son to try to get his help; he isn\u2019t able to sway William. \u201cHe won\u2019t listen to reason,\u201d Mulder laments to Scully. \u201cHe\u2019ll listen to me,\u201d she insists. But the couple aren\u2019t the only ones interested in him: CSM makes it clear he wants to find William ASAP, and the mysterious Erika Price (Barbara Hershey) and Mr. Y (AC Peterson) also appear to have an eye on him. With William on the run (and CSM\u2019s history of hurting/killing the people he claims to care about), will the young man be able to escape the finale unscathed?\n\nA montage of quick scenes also included in the trailer indicates CSM will come face to face with his other son, Mulder (with last season\u2019s finale essentially erased, the two haven\u2019t seen each other since CSM was blown up and presumed dead in 2002\u2019s then-series finale); Skinner gets cornered by a car in an alley; and Mulder and Scully get forcibly separated. (It\u2019s notable that this finale does appear to have more of Mulder/Scully together than the season 10 finale, which saw them share just the final scene.)\n\nComplicating everything is the real-life fact that the show\u2019s fate is still very much up in the air. Anderson has said she\u2019s done with the series after this season; it\u2019s hard to imagine the Scully storyline gets completely tied up with one hour of the mythology story left. With the X-Files world on the verge of dissolving into mayhem, will there be any time for real closure?\n\nWhat do you want to see from the two remaining episodes?
