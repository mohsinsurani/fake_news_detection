It wasn\u2019t worth living. I was wasting people\u2019s time and space.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cGMA\u201d star opens up in her new book, \u201cNatural Disaster: I Cover Them. I Am One,\u201d about her battle with depression.\n\nIn the introduction to the book, she writes that she checked herself into a mental health hospital just 10 days before starting her high-profile job at ABC.\n\n\"I cover natural disasters, and I've struggled with being one in my personal life,\" she wrote.\n\nShe recalled to People, \u201cI lost myself and my will to live.\u201d\n\nShe said when feeling depressed she \u201cfelt helpless\u201d and \u201chopeless.\u201d\n\nZee had previously revealed she battled anorexia and was narcoleptic in college.
