Inside the Met, the two were photographed mid-conversation as Moschino designer Jeremy Scott (who was Cardi B's date) watched on like a proud dad.\n\nYou can practically hear Cardi saying, \"okurrrrrt?\" through this photo:\n\nGetty Images\n\nLater in the night, Nicki and Cardi even posed together for a group selfie.\n\nOf course, the internet completely lost it upon seeing the duo chatting at the Met Gala. Within minutes, Twitter was hard at work crafting the greatest comparisons of the rappers' conversation.\n\nOne user pointed out that the meet-up was basically a recreation of the 1435 painting, \"Visitation\", by Jacques Daret. And well, he's not entirely wrong...\n\nAnother compared the moment to an iconic scene from the Disney movie, The Emperor's New Groove:\n\nAnd then, there was a long list of people who simply could not maintain their chill at the sight of the rappers together:\n\nNow all we need is a Nicki x Cardi collab track, please and thank you.
