Though edited from the U.S. version, the scene is included in the European version of the film. The controversial pic also includes sex scenes with all four main characters, including Michelle Williams and Anne Hathaway . For their roles, Ledger, Gyllenhaal and Williams each scored Oscar noms in 2006.\n\nTen years after Jake Gyllenhaal starred in the landmark Brokeback Mountain \u2014 and almost eight years after the death of co-star Heath Ledger \u2014 the actor said he had no qualms about taking the role when it came his way.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s one of the most beautiful scripts I\u2019ve ever read, and it was Ang Lee, and at the time Heath [Ledger] was a friend of mine \u2014 before we even shot the movie \u2014 and always sort of alluring to me,\u201d Gyllenhaal recalled.\n\n\u201cHeath was always somebody who I admired,\u201d he continued. \u201cHe was way beyond his years as a human, in a way. I wasn\u2019t quite sure where he came from. I mean, I know he\u2019s from Perth, but I wasn\u2019t really quite sure where he came from, and I think that\u2019s the feeling most people got when they were around him and why he was so extraordinary. And when that opportunity came, I was a young actor. I was like, \u2018Yeah, I\u2019m in.\u2019 I know a lot has been made of the choice to do it, but it just didn\u2019t seem like something that was scary to me. You know, it was binding, because sometimes a lot of that character is very specifically the more overtly gay character of the two. The one who\u2019s struggling with it less. And I didn\u2019t really realize that. And that was an interesting journey for me, giving in to that idea. Being the one who tries to push the relationship.\u201d\n\nGyllenhaal noted that one of the things that separated him and Ledger was that the former had little experience with animals, which he felt he needed to have for the role. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t a connection that I had that was just in me,\u201d he said. \u201cHeath, you know, would walk up to a horse and could like silence the horse. Just literally he\u2019d be like, \u2018Shh. Shh.\u2019 And then he\u2019d get on the horse. I\u2019d be like, \u2018I\u2019m going to get on you.\u2019 They\u2019d be like, \u2018F\u2014 off!\u2019 I didn\u2019t really have that style.\u2019 \u201c\n\nThe actor took part in THR\u2019s ongoing interview series The Hollywood Masters, which took place Nov. 18 at Loyola Marymount University\u2019s School of Film & TV.\n\nAsked if there will come a time when stars can openly be gay, he said: \u201cI wish I had that answer. I think it is changing. And it\u2019s pretty amazing how it\u2019s changing. And one of the things that I\u2019m so proud of [about] that movie, was to see, within the past basically 10 years, how much has changed. When the Supreme Court [issued a ruling] just a little while ago, I felt like we had been part, a little part and parcel of that movement. I was proud, you know? To me that\u2019s really a pretty incredible moment. We had to wait a little while for it. But when will it be OK for an actor to be gay? I mean, it\u2019s OK now.\u201d\n\nA full transcript follows.\n\nGALLOWAY: You went to Columbia University \u2014 you dropped out halfway through, but you went to study Eastern Religions and Philosophy. Why and what did that teach you?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: To be honest, I was at a loss, I think, in a lot of ways. I was trying to figure out where my intellect, if I really have one, where it fit. And so I was searching. I really didn\u2019t know who I was or what I really wanted to be, and in that search, like I think you do as an actor, you end up trying to define whatever that is, and I sort of said, \u201cOh well, searching spiritually in a way is interesting, and Eastern religion seems to be about a search.\u201d And Robert Thurman was at Columbia, who\u2019s one of the Western world\u2019s most renowned thinkers in Eastern religion \u2014\n\nGALLOWAY: \u2014 especially since his daughter started acting \u2014\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes. Uma Thurman is his daughter. And there was a class called Intro to Tibetan Buddhism, and I just went in, and there were like 250 people waiting to get into this class. My sister actually was at Columbia at the time, and she was going to graduate, and she joined me there. It was the only class we took together, which was pretty cool. And they said, \u201cOK, all freshmen leave,\u201d and my sister was \u2014 whoop \u2014 \u201cStay.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOK.\u201d And she was like, \u201cNow all sophomores leave,\u201d and I was like, \u201cI should go.\u201d And she was like, \u201cStay.\u201d And then so on and so forth until the I was the only freshman there. And she said, \u201cNow walk up to the TA and say, you know you\u2019re a freshman, but you really want to take this class.\u201d And so I did, and they were like, \u201cOh, yeah, sure, stay.\u201d\n\nGALLOWAY: So she\u2019s pretty savvy.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: All the other sheep just left, yeah. [LAUGHTER]. And that\u2019s really my sister in a nutshell. And then I ended up staying and falling in love with the ideas. And it was a place where I felt creative, because at Columbia there\u2019s no performing arts department, so I was searching for it everywhere I could, and I took some photography classes and I ended up becoming fascinated with Eastern Religion, and ultimately it seemed to encompass the more abstract mind that I have.\n\nGALLOWAY: So what fascinates you about it? Is it one particular religion, or one particular idea?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: No. That\u2019s probably my problem. I think it\u2019s more, at least at the time, a sense of abstraction. My mind doesn\u2019t really work in a way where there\u2019s a definitive sense of something. I go one way and then it opens up into a million different ideas, and somehow, when you look at the art, Buddhist art, or particularly Tibetan art, you know, it\u2019s a similar thing. All of a sudden there are a million lotus leaves and you\u2019re following one to the next and to another, and I related to that, and it felt simple and easy to me. And it made me feel smart \u2014 [LAUGHTER] \u2014 which other subjects didn\u2019t make me feel.\n\nGALLOWAY: Which subjects did not make you feel smart?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Every other one. [LAUGHTER] Because I could draw ideas. I remember writing a paper for a seminar class. I remember writing a paper about \u2014 and this is going to sound really sort of pretentious, but that\u2019s where my mind was at the time \u2014 how acting and the performing artist can really be like a Bodhisattva, how they can communicate ultimately an idea in a way that can move and shift things. And that was wonderful. I didn\u2019t know many classes where I could try and relate the thing that I really loved and wanted to do into an intellectual idea, and that happened to be one of them.\n\nGALLOWAY: Has that helped with your acting?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: No. On a spiritual level, on a place where you want to be a better human being and listen more, I try. I joke, but it has. I mean, I don\u2019t consider myself a card-carrying Buddhist, you know. But I do believe deeply in the ideas, and I think anytime you have interest in anything, it somehow humbles you. So yes, I think it has.\n\nGALLOWAY: Your family was very creative. Your father\u2019s a director, your mother\u2019s a well-known screenwriter. Obviously Maggie, your sister, is an actress. How did they shape you?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh, man. This is an hour right? [LAUGHTER] If I\u2019m really honest, I think in positive and negative ways. You know, being the youngest, I constantly have that insecurity of being the youngest, which ultimately is probably my drive. in a lot of ways. In terms of as an artist, the way we could communicate as a family very clearly was through movies and through acting, and when things became complicated with all of our own personalities, that\u2019s where we are most clear. I think that\u2019s also where we are most brutal with each other as well.\n\nGALLOWAY: In what way?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: This is interesting, but I think we love each other so much and expect so much from each other, and I think we expect a type of honesty in the work that we all do. And I was brought up, and my sister too, with two people who were always saying, \u201cWhat you do is really nowhere near as important as the things that are going on in the world, and if your work needs to reflect that, or you want it to, then you need to strive for a certain type of excellence.\u201d Because things that are going in the world, particularly now, are no match to what art can do, you know? But you need to strive to try and communicate and try and change things in a similar way. And then people can think that\u2019s pretentious or whatever, but it\u2019s your life\u2019s work, and you\u2019ve decided that. That\u2019s what they made us believe. So we have a pretty high standard, which is at times great and at times not.\n\nGALLOWAY: Which work of yours have they liked the best and which have they liked the least?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS] My mom\u2019s a big fan of Bubble Boy. No. My sister and I, and my brother-in-law too, who\u2019s an actor \u2014\n\nGALLOWAY: Peter Sarsgaard.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: \u2014 Peter Sarsgaard, he\u2019s an extraordinary actor, and I would say that Peter has really brought into my life and my sister\u2019s life a sense of presence as an actor that I never really understood or knew about until I met him. They\u2019ve been together for a very long time, and he introduced me to the idea of the presentation. You know, as Uta Hagen would say, there\u2019s the representational actor and the presentational actor. He immediately was a present, and he has always been a very presentational actor. It\u2019s always about getting into who he is and bringing that always, not hiding behind a mask. You know, my sister came up to me recently after she saw this movie, Southpaw, the movie I did, and she thought there was this exploration of that type of presentation, and a bit of representation as well, if I could be totally honest, where she was deeply moved. And I think also what\u2019s interesting is that she knows how much the choices that I make reflect what\u2019s going on in my life. Admittedly, probably, as my sister, and as someone who loves me \u2014 like, she can\u2019t wait to see become a father\u2026 There are a lot of different things that are spinning and connecting when your family sees what you do.\n\nGALLOWAY: What did you mean when you said: the choices that you make reflect what\u2019s going on in your life?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I could think of it two ways. When you have the opportunity to choose projects, inevitably you start being moved towards the things that you\u2019re moved by, right? And that changes over time, as we change, right? I also think within the scene, a specific scene \u2014 if I were to play a part that I played 10 years ago now, my interpretation of that scene would be totally different. I would be making different choices. It\u2019s actually [happening] right now in the movie I\u2019m making: I\u2019m doing one section of the movie where I\u2019m playing 22 years old, which has been a very interesting thing for me. Because I can\u2019t somehow subtract all of the experiences that I\u2019ve had in my life. And it\u2019s fascinating to see, because somewhere I\u2019m very reflective in that. You know, I\u2019ve been playing basically actually close to 40 years old, so I\u2019m somewhere lost in age in this movie. But it\u2019s been fascinating to see that I can\u2019t subtract that time.\n\nGALLOWAY: How do you recreate yourself at 22?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Some of it\u2019s physical. You do what you can to make your body and your face and the impression. You have help from the cinematographer and how they light you and all that, and then I try and find and access the parts of myself that still blindly believe and have faith in a lot of things. I don\u2019t mean to be cynical, but I\u2019ve also discovered that I still have a lot of those. And they may not be where I expected them to be. Maybe I\u2019ve been in relationships, and this is a movie about relationships, like romance relationships \u2014 so maybe I\u2019ve been in some that have sort of made me lose my faith. But deep down inside, I still have blind faith, you know?\n\nGALLOWAY: You\u2019re only 34, don\u2019t lose it yet! [LAUGHTER]\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I was listening to this Adele song, where she\u2019s like, \u201cWhen we were young\u2026\u201d I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re 27. Are you kidding me?\n\nGALLOWAY: But you feel so old when you\u2019re young. And weirdly you feel younger when you get older.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah. I think that there\u2019s definitely this sort of innocence, and I see that particularly with my parents, that\u2019s totally accessible, always. It\u2019s just how much you really want to access it.\n\nGALLOWAY: And great artists have to have some of that, right?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking me, but I think so. I think so.\n\nGALLOWAY: You said something really interesting once: you said, \u201cI\u2019m a very political person, and I make political choices in my movies.\u201d What did you mean by that?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I have always had a deep belief that every movie, every artistic expression, is political. Don\u2019t be fooled. Even ones that we wouldn\u2019t consider overtly political are political. When we spend time doing anything, whether it\u2019s distraction or whether it\u2019s something that we have to face, it is always political. That\u2019s my belief. Not to say that you should be constantly trying to change the world, but I think it\u2019s important to know that whatever we do has an implication and has an effect, and because of that it is political.\n\nGALLOWAY: Have you made a political mistake \u2014 I mean, artistically have you made a political mistake, or a decision that you regret from that point of view?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Every day, all the time. You mean specifically in a project? Or just behaviorally?\n\nGALLOWAY: Either one that you\u2019d like to talk about is fine by me.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nGALLOWAY: Just be warned, there\u2019s a social media universe out there.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh, I have, believe me. We were joking before, and we were taking a picture and he was like, \u201cI realize I don\u2019t know where these pictures go.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhen you take a picture, that\u2019s how you should feel always.\u201d Mistake. I don\u2019t really know if I believe in that word. I guess the answer to that question specifically is, no. I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve made a mistake. I think I have behaved in ways that I am proud of; I think I\u2019ve behaved in ways I\u2019m not. I think that I have done work where I feel like I\u2019ve challenged myself, and then what\u2019s even more confusing is I\u2019ve done work where I think I\u2019ve challenged myself and no one\u2019s responded to it, and no one\u2019s interested in it. And then I\u2019ve done work at times where I feel like, huh? Nothing\u2019s happening and everyone goes [GASP] \u201cOh my God,\u201d you know? So in that way, as an actor in particular, you\u2019re powerless. And so in that way as an actor in particular you can\u2019t make mistakes.\n\nGALLOWAY: Is this why you started producing recently?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: To make mistakes?\n\n[LAUGH]\n\nGALLOWAY: No, not to feel powerless. You produced Nightcrawler.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes. I also have an ache to be a part of the whole. I love storytelling, you know, beyond anything. I love a great story beyond a great performance. Storytelling is about what we all do together and how we collaborate together. A performance can be a collaboration in ways, but oftentimes it\u2019s one individual thing. I get off on the interaction with people, and I love the chess of a movie and particularly \u2014 not only in preproduction or in production or postproduction\u2014 the behavioral chess. That is, learning and being humbled by and also teaching certain people certain things. I love that. As a producer, you have an opportunity to see the whole and bring people together.\n\nGALLOWAY: Would you direct, too?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\nGALLOWAY: And going back to this idea that you love story \u2014 is there one story, one film \u2014\n\nGYLLENHAAL: That was a mistake?\n\nGALLOWAY: No, I dropped that one. I\u2019m letting you off easy, you know. That really resonates with you? One, growing up, that made you say, \u201cThis is what I want to do?\u201d I often come back to this thing \u2014 do you know that Japanese film Afterlife?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Beautiful movie, yeah.\n\nGALLOWAY: You\u2019re set in sort of a way station between this world and the next.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Like purgatory.\n\nGALLOWAY: And you\u2019re allowed to take one memory with you. You know?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I know I can\u2019t beat Amy Adams answer to this question. That\u2019s guaranteed.\n\nGALLOWAY: [LAUGHS] Did she talk about this with you? That\u2019s so funny. You\u2019re both very charming guests, so\u2026\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Well, I will safely say she\u2019s probably one of, if not the best actor that I\u2019ve worked with. She\u2019s extraordinary, and when I talk about working with people who are more talented than you, she\u2019s definitely the first person, right now, particularly, that comes to mind.\n\nGALLOWAY: So is there one film that you would take?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Pretty much almost any film by Audiard, I would say.\n\nGALLOWAY: Oh, Jacques Audiard. A Prophet?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: A Prophet, definitely yes, absolutely. As a whole, as a film.\n\nGALLOWAY: Say no more, what a great choice.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: A Separation is another film that I think is extraordinary, and one of those things that feels like it\u2019s from another planet, much like Terrence Malick\u2019s movies did: at a certain point, you feel like he\u2019s an alien from another planet telling us and looking at us and showing us how we are. I also really, really love Jerry McGuire.\n\nGALLOWAY: Yes. It\u2019s really good.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: West Side Story. I remember as a kid, those things that stick with you, Goonies. That has a profound resonance with me, that movie.\n\nGALLOWAY: Jake, you\u2019re tumbling from my\u2026\n\nGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS]\n\nGALLOWAY: We start with Jacques Audiard and we end up with Goonies.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Good. Good. Good. I like being up on stage with someone and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get. I appreciate that. And I\u2019m slowly feeling like\u2026\n\nGALLOWAY: Was there a moment when you decided \u201cI\u2019m going to be an actor?\u201d You were in City Slickers at the age of 10. When was the moment where you said, \u201cOK, I\u2019m an actor\u201d?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I really don\u2019t know if I feel that way now. I think it\u2019s fleeting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something where I say, \u201cThis is something that\u2026\u201d Because as an actor, no matter what, you\u2019re at the whim of so many other people all the time. Last night, when I was working with Amy, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m an actor!\u201d you know? But that came really from watching her and feeling kind of \u2014 you\u2019ve got to hash tag this \u2014but feeling blessed that I was with her. You know what I mean? You have the feeling that, \u201cI earned this exchange.\u201d I did this Little Shop of Horrors encores performance at City Center this past June, and I was working with Ellen Greene, who originated Audrey, and I was on stage with her as she dies in the scene. She\u2019s 64. You know, I\u2019m 34, and I was a kid when I watched her do it in the movie for the first time. And it was this strange mix of sexuality and oddity and amazing, this voice that was confusing to me. As a kid you\u2019re like, woof, that\u2019s brutal and moving and so many things mixed up into one, which is why that performance is probably one of the most classic performances ever, her performance in Little Shop. And I\u2019m sitting there holding her in my arms, playing Seymour, and thinking, \u201cI have done all the work I\u2019ve done to earn this moment,\u201d you know? And I think, when you say, \u201cWhen did you feel like an actor?\u201d it\u2019s those moments when I feel like, \u201cI\u2019m an actor, wow.\u201d That\u2019s an extraordinary moment for me. So it\u2019s not like I walk around going, \u201cI\u2019m an actor.\u201d I walk around thinking job to job, trying to not have regrets. Again, I would again bring up Amy, but there was this moment last night, it was like 3 a.m. and we were exhausted. She had done two super-brutal scenes, very hard emotional scenes, and she was just spent. And sometimes, when you\u2019re in that space, you\u2019re trying to find anything you can \u2014 like coffee or running down the street \u2014 to get motivation. And she just said, \u201cThat was too perfect. Can we just do it again, just one more?\u201d And there was something about her not wanting to have regret, wanting to know when she walked home back to her trailer \u2014 she went home at 5 a.m. \u2014 that, \u201cAll right, I left as much as I could on the table.\u201d\n\nGALLOWAY: Hugh Jackman said almost precisely the same thing about you with Prisoners.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Really?\n\nGALLOWAY: Yes. I want to talk about your first big film. You did October Sky, and then you got the break that at the time wasn\u2019t a big hit, but in retrospect is an extraordinary film, Donnie Darko. So let\u2019s watch our first clip. I hope I chose the right scene.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS] The red curtain.\n\nGALLOWAY: This is your life, Jake.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh no, [LAUGHS].\n\n[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\n\nGALLOWAY: It\u2019s such a wonderful film. I don\u2019t think I realized that when I first saw it, and then I watched again last week. It\u2019s spooky and haunting.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: [pointing to an audience member] This dude in the hood is, yeah.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nGALLOWAY: So, Jason Schwartzman was meant to play this part.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes.\n\nGALLOWAY: Dropped out, you came in.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\nGALLOWAY: How did you get in? How did you prepare for that role?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Well at the time Jason and I \u2014 he\u2019s a friend of mine. I remember him preparing for a long time, and then at the very last minute it all fell apart. And he had just done Rushmore and he\u2019s incredible in that. And I felt this, this pressure, you know. I went in to meet with [director] Richard Kelly and he was desperately looking for an actor, because he wanted to go. He had been really satisfied with what he had and then it all fell apart. And he was like, \u201cI just want to put it back together, I don\u2019t want to lose it.\u201d You know. \u201cYou seem cool.\u201d So there was that, there this actor who I just always thought was great and I didn\u2019t know. And I felt that way the whole time I was doing it. I thought, \u201cMan, Jason would be so good in this.\u201d And he would have been. That\u2019s the other thing about playing roles: You I\u2019m fascinated to know what other actors have done with the roles that I play.\n\nGALLOWAY: Did you talk to him about what he would have done with it?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: No. We did not talk about that, no. I remember it all happening very fast.\n\nGALLOWAY: Were you nervous about doing it or did you not know enough at that point to be nervous?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I\u2019m always nervous about it. You know, somehow, without even knowing it, I try and recreate the idea of what it feels like to go in front of an audience every night when I\u2019m making a film. And that similar type of pressure and excitement before a scene, or preparing for a movie, so\u2026\n\nGALLOWAY: That\u2019s interesting, because I would have though your goal would have been to relax, not to build the pressure up on yourself.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: There are standards. I like to be prepared, I guess I should say \u2014 that type of pressure of, \u201cAll right, now you go with abandon,\u201d you know. Now when you\u2019re in it, you let go of all the things \u2014 that\u2019s what happens when you\u2019re onstage. You have formal rehearsal, a lot of things you don\u2019t have in movies \u2014 which is, you have to formally rehearse. You have to know your back story, discuss it, and almost everybody onstage has to know each other\u2019s [story], so that when it comes time to actually do it, you can throw it all away. That\u2019s the way I like to \u2014 and I didn\u2019t realize until very recently \u2014 that\u2019s the way I like to prepare for movies.\n\nGALLOWAY: Have you worked with an acting coach? I don\u2019t think you ever took any formal acting lessons, did you?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: When I was younger, I did. I went to this place called Actors Space in the Valley. I was pretty young, and we were doing acting and improvisation. But no, no I didn\u2019t go to RADA, I didn\u2019t do that. But I do now work with an acting coach, primarily for the initial intellectual connection to the material. And then sometimes you need an anchor, whatever it might be. You need a space to connect. So often you get into a way of doing things. You have your typical way of preparing and you\u2019re like, \u201cOK, I\u2019m ready.\u201d And then you\u2019re a bit lost, because you don\u2019t have something to connect to whatever it is. And that\u2019s what she provides for me. And oftentimes, too, just knocking me around a little bit. There\u2019s no real plan with us and I don\u2019t really ever have that. It\u2019s just knocking you out. As an actor, too, I feel like I\u2019m somebody who, when somebody gives me a mark, I don\u2019t want to hit it. I don\u2019t like that. But then, without even knowing it, I just hit it. And then it traps me You know, that\u2019s the nature of an actor in a lot of ways. I was working with Michael Shannon on this movie I\u2019m doing now, and I was like, \u201cOh man I\u2019m having trouble with this scene.\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cWell, then just open it up.\u201d I was like, \u201cBut, the mark?\u201d And I was like, what\u2019s wrong with me? And he was like, \u201cDude, what\u2019s wrong with you?\u201d [LAUGHTER] There\u2019s the nature of an actor that, someone says \u201cGo over there and do this,\u201d and you go like, \u201cOK. Yes I can do that so well.\u201d\n\nGALLOWAY: Because you want to please?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: There\u2019s part of that. And I think, for me, there\u2019s also that I understand the opposite side of the camera. I have a profound respect for that. I have worked with people who, when you hit that mark, are doing 50 percent of your work for you. So, you know, it\u2019s a balance. When you walk into a mark and you\u2019re lit a certain way or something\u2019s happening so often you don\u2019t know what\u2019s behind you\u2026 And that\u2019s what\u2019s so strange about being a movie actor.\n\nGALLOWAY: Did you expect Donnie Darko to be like this when you were shooting it? Or did you think it was going to be a different kind of film?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I thought \u2014 I mean, I was 19, I thought it was going to be the best movie ever made. [LAUGHTER] And everyone was going to see it and it was just going to be incredible. And then nobody saw it and it didn\u2019t get bought at Sundance. And it was a really great experience. Humbling. And then it\u2019s since found its way.\n\nGALLOWAY: Do you understand what\u2019s going on in the film?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes.\n\nGALLOWAY: If you go to the web, as you know, there are websites devoted to Donnie Darko and the Tangent Universe.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: There are websites?\n\nGALLOWAY: Oh, absolutely \u2014\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh, wow, oh.\n\nGALLOWAY: \u2014 regularly updated, that explain the Tangent Universe, that explain the concept of time travel.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS] I don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s a real waste of time.\n\nGALLOWAY: You said, \u201cI don\u2019t understand it.\u201d So I wondered if that had changed.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I do. I mean, we started the conversation starting about abstraction, and about why I connect to material and for what reason. Often times it\u2019s really hard for me to articulate why I connect to something. But I know exactly what that movie\u2019s about. I can\u2019t define it; it doesn\u2019t tie up in a perfect bow. But it\u2019s about adolescence. It\u2019s about what it feels like \u2014 this isn\u2019t meant as a criticism, but like things I didn\u2019t relate to, which were high school movies. Where I\u2019d watch it and I\u2019d be like, \u201cWell, am I like the kid that nobody likes? Or am I like the person who everybody [likes]?\u201d I couldn\u2019t [tell]. I was like quantifying, putting me in a box. \u201cThis is my personality at that age\u201d and \u201cI\u2019m this kind of person\u201d just felt like bullshit to me. And to me Donnie Darko was about adolescence. And about how, as soon as you start to grow up and you sort of move out into the world, you realize everything is so trippy. That anything can be anything. And that\u2019s equal amounts exciting as it is frightening. And that you can make a connection, but the connection can be with a rabbit, and a man in a suit. And that you can see things and people can think you\u2019re crazy, but you\u2019re actually not. I think that\u2019s what that movie is to me. And there are all these ideas that Richard threw in there \u2014 Stephen Hawking\u2019s ideas and things like that.\n\nGALLOWAY: You\u2019ve made some very bold choices and I wonder, when you came to do Brokeback Mountain, if you were frightened of that? Let\u2019s watch. It\u2019s very hard to get a short clip.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I know. I\u2019m trying to figure out what clip you picked. I\u2019m like, \u201cHere we go. All right!\u201d [LAUGHTER]\n\nGALLOWAY: You can guess? This is towards the end of the movie.\n\n[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\n\nGALLOWAY: Does that bring back memories?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah. It definitely does. I was like, \u201cIt definitely does.\u201d [LAUGHTER] Yeah it does. It\u2019s funny, I was thinking about it: I haven\u2019t seen that in a while, but so many jokes have been made about \u201cI can\u2019t quit you.\u201d It\u2019s like, \u201cMy God!\u201d And it\u2019s not even on my face. The shot is on my back.\n\nGALLOWAY: Right, it was very strong seeing that. But it\u2019s one of the great movie lines and everybody who has been in an intense relationship has got to that point.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Isn\u2019t that amazing?\n\nGALLOWAY: I love the fact that it\u2019s not on your face.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Not on your face. The power of the story.\n\nGALLOWAY: It\u2019s amazing how the world has changed because, at that time, a lot of actors didn\u2019t want to play a gay role.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Mm-hmm.\n\nGALLOWAY: Did you feel that pressure?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Now everybody does.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Did I feel the pressure? No. I think maybe naively, but also just I had been brought up a different way. I had been brought up in an elementary school where, my first few grades, I remember being specifically told that my teachers were gay. I was just that age and that was just how it was, and my parents were very\u2026 You know, that\u2019s how I was raised. Like super-progressive. And so it\u2019s just something I took for granted, weirdly. At the time. I think, now, younger generations do take that for granted in a lot of ways. I don\u2019t think that takes away from the struggle of identity and what that is. But the struggle for identity is everybody\u2019s struggle. No matter what it is.\n\nGALLOWAY: Do you struggle for identity?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I\u2019m an actor.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I mean it. Totally relatable. You know what I mean. But at the time, I just went, \u201cIt\u2019s Ang Lee.\u201d It\u2019s one of the most beautiful scripts I\u2019ve ever read and it was Ang Lee, and at the time Heath [Ledger] was a friend of mine \u2014 before we even shot the movie \u2014 and always sort of alluring to me. Heath was always somebody who I admired. He was way beyond his years as a human, in a way. I wasn\u2019t quite sure where he came from. I mean, I know he\u2019s from Perth, but I wasn\u2019t really quite sure where he came from and I think that\u2019s the feeling most people got when they were around him and why he was so extraordinary. And when that opportunity came I was a young actor. I was like, \u201cYeah, I\u2019m in.\u201d I know a lot has been made of the choice to do it, but it just didn\u2019t seem like something that was scary to me. You know, it was binding, because sometimes a lot of that character is very specifically the more overtly gay character of the two. The one who\u2019s struggling with it less. And I didn\u2019t really realize that. And that was an interesting journey for me, giving into that idea. Being the one who tries to push the relationship. And I think in a very simple way people would say, \u201cOh the sort of more female character.\u201d I don\u2019t even know what the hell that means, but I\u2019ve been told that many times \u2014 you know, the one who wants the relationship or something. That was an interesting thing for me.\n\nGALLOWAY: How did you prepare for that?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Heath and I spent a lot of time, a lot of things were just about\u2026 The biggest thing, and this is going to sound odd, but the biggest thing that I did was: I had not spent a ton of time around animals as a kid. It wasn\u2019t a connection that I had that was just in me. Heath, you know, would walk up to a horse and could like silence the horse. [LAUGHTER] Do you know what I mean? Just literally he\u2019d be like, \u201cShh shh.\u201d And he\u2019d be like [MAKES HORSE SOUND]. [LAUGHTER] And then he\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get on you now.\u201d [MAKES HORSE SOUND]. And then he\u2019d get on the horse. I\u2019d be like, \u201cI\u2019m going to get on you.\u201d They\u2019d be like \u201cPfft, f\u2014k off!\u201d [LAUGHTER] I didn\u2019t really have that style, so one of the things I did was: I got a dog. I know it sounds funny, but I got a dog and that dog died six months ago.\n\nGALLOWAY: Oh.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\nGALLOWAY: What kind of dog?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: He was a German shepherd. His name is Atticus and he taught me. So, that was the first thing. And the other thing was, really, I talked to a lot of people. A lot. Particularly just hearing stories. Ang gave us a lot of books about cowboys who had been gay or stories about it and all that stuff. And I just talked to a lot of my friends \u2014who [was] their first, particularly same-sex, first situation. That was fascinating to me \u2014trying to learn what that was in a certain period of time. Certain age. The secrecy involved in it. All those things.\n\nGALLOWAY: What surprised you most about what you found out?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Just the secrecy of it. How much it had to be. And then [that] became a part of their idea of sexuality. That was fascinating to me. That we all develop relationships with each other based on our first relationships, and then how we experience them. But inevitably they are echoes of earlier on. In my belief. And so when something is not accepted, somehow that becomes part of how we become attracted to it. Does that make sense?\n\nGALLOWAY: Yes, absolutely.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: So I was fascinated with that. That what ties these two characters together is not just a love, but a loneliness. I think primarily it was deep loneliness. And what I always say about that movie, which I think maybe over time is more understood, is that this is about two people desperately looking for love. To be loved. And who were probably capable of it. And they just found it with someone of the same sex, you know. And that does not dismiss the fact that it is about, really, primarily, the first kind of very profound gay love story. Hopefully it can create an equality of an idea: that is, it\u2019s possible that you can find love anywhere. That intimacy exists in so many places that convention and society won\u2019t always allow us to see. And we won\u2019t allow ourselves to see, because of what criticism \u2014 and danger, really \u2014 it might provoke.\n\nGALLOWAY: It\u2019s still hard for a movie star to be gay. I mean, if you\u2019re going to be a character actor, it\u2019s one thing. When will that change?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: You\u2019re asking me? [LAUGHTER] When will that change? Look, I mean to ask, I think, when a lot of things will change? I wish I had that answer. I mean, I think it is changing, first of all. And it\u2019s pretty amazing how it\u2019s changing. And one of the things that I\u2019m so proud of, in terms of being in that movie, was to see how, within the past basically 10 years, how much has changed. You know. When the Supreme Court passed just a little while ago, I felt like we had been part, a little part and parcel of that movement. You know. My parents taught me as a kid: do your work. Do it well. Try as hard as you can, whatever it is. It will one day, for the long [run], it will make some sort of change somewhere. You know, that happened there. It was so deeply moving to me that day [when the Supreme Court gave a ruling in favor of gay marriage] when my mother \u2014 I remember I was at Little Shop of Horrors. We were in rehearsal. I was freaking out, because we had like six days of rehearsal and four performances. It was a staged reading, and it was like, I didn\u2019t know what I was doing. And we were in rehearsal and my mom sent me the decision. And she just said, \u201cSometimes love does win out,\u201d I remember. And I was just super proud. I mean I was proud, you know? To me that\u2019s really a pretty incredible moment. We had to wait a little while for it. But when will it be OK for an actor to be gay? I mean, it\u2019s OK now.\n\nGALLOWAY: Michelle Williams said Ang Lee was very tough on the boys. In what way?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Well, I think it\u2019s a cultural thing, in a way. We are all from different cultures, you know. Heath\u2019s Australian, really. I\u2019m from here. Ang\u2019s from China. But I think Ang gets very close in preproduction and rehearsals. And then he allows his actors \u2014 I don\u2019t think scared of actors, but I think he\u2019s scared of getting in on the scenes he\u2019s watching. The space he\u2019s watching. So he just totally disconnects from you while you\u2019re shooting. And I think it\u2019s amazing what happens because he gets very close and then he lets you off these reins, you know, and you\u2019re like [MAKES NOISE]. And I think he was aware of what the stakes were. And he had high expectations for us, you know. And we had a lot of burden to carry with that relationship and those two characters. A lot. I mean there was a lot there and he had to get it right. And he\u2019s tough, you know? I mean, he just is and that\u2019s what makes him the extraordinary director he is. And I have grown, and I do love that from my directors. When they push you.\n\nGALLOWAY: I know you very much like working with Sam Mendes on Jarhead. Did he direct you on stage? Did he do the Kenneth Lonergan play?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: No. He didn\u2019t.\n\nGALLOWAY: OK. Why do you like working with him so much? What makes a director that you as an actor respond to?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Well he just allowed me to make what we would call mistakes and had no judgment of them. He also empowered me. You know, he\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re my actor. I chose you. Whatever you do is right.\u201d Right? \u201cI made the decision, I\u2019m complicit in choosing you. And I went through everything I could to choose you, so I feel good and whatever you\u2019re going to do I\u2019m going to give you this space.\u201d And so it was very empowering. It was like he just completely gave me this confidence. And at the same time was very aware of my instrument and how to sort of push and pull it. I like the conscious manipulation that a great director can have. When you\u2019re both complicit in the manipulation of an emotion. Meaning, Sam sometimes would come up to me and he would start talking to me and we\u2019d be talking about a scene and then he would just walk away from me. And it would piss me off. And then he\u2019d roll the camera in this very\u2026 and it would boil up in me in this way and I just realized he kind of tied something up and then he snapped it off and he just shot it. And being aware that he was starting to mess with me ended up really feeling, I don\u2019t know if this sounds really dark, but like it really felt great, you know. We were in a relationship where we were aware of what was happening. And he\u2019s just so smart, too. There\u2019s always an intellectual side to the films he\u2019s doing and to the characters, and there\u2019s such a deep knowledge when you\u2019ve worked with the actors that he\u2019s worked with, on stage in particular, but also in film.\n\nGALLOWAY: Do you think intellect helps or hurts an actor?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I think, in the initial process of discovering a character and the analytical process \u2014 and this is what I did take from Buddhism \u2014initially I think there has to be an analytical, intellectual approach. And that has to be abandoned by the time you\u2019re playing the game. You run your plays, you know your plays, you study your plays, you study the other team, you do as much as you can, you go to practice, you get in shape, you do what you need to do, and then by the time you get to the game, you know your plays, but they have to feel like they\u2019re in your bones. That has to be an unconscious thing, it cannot be conscious. That is everything to me.\n\nGALLOWAY: And can you maintain that, take after take?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: No.\n\nGALLOWAY: OK, so now I want to talk about your work with a director who demands take after take, and how you do that. So we\u2019re going to look at a clip from \u2014\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Zodiac. [LAUGHS]\n\nGALLOWAY: Zodiac, yes. You\u2019re on the trail of a serial killing and this may be the guy right here.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: What\u2019s it about?\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\n[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\n\nGALLOWAY: I love the way you\u2019re looking at that thing, and realizing, \u201cOh my god, this guy might be the killer,\u201d and it\u2019s perfectly calibrated. You know, it would be so easy to do too much, or not enough, and it\u2019s this realization that we can feel, and then you go into the basement and we\u2019re all screaming, \u201cGet out of the basement, get out of that basement!\u201d Jane Fonda was here, and she said the toughest emotion for her to act was fear. What\u2019s the toughest for you?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: The easiest is anger, not just for me but in general. I think volume is also very easy. That\u2019s always a default to go to. Hardest emotion? They\u2019re all pretty damn hard; I don\u2019t know really if there\u2019s one specifically, but I do think, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening or what I\u2019m feeling when I\u2019m actually listening. I remember Chris Cooper saying to me \u2014 I was doing October Sky with him \u2014 and he said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re just yelling at me.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re just yelling. You need to listen.\u201d We were in a fight, and you know, oh you\u2019d get so excited as an actor, you\u2019re like, \u201cWe have a fight, oh, I get to get mad.\u201d And he just said, \u201cYou need to listen.\u201d And I started listening \u2014 and then all of a sudden where I was listening was where, I don\u2019t know, anger became something else. But I don\u2019t know about what the hardest one is. I think I\u2019m generally \u2014 fear, fear is very still, so in terms of that kind of fear \u2014 there\u2019s so many different kinds of fear, but fear is something, particularly in movies, that\u2019s interesting, because it\u2019s created by the film maker, that was created by Fincher, that\u2019s why he\u2019s brilliant. So, to me it\u2019s more important, in terms of the director, because whatever story\u2019s being told has to be water-tight, and then whatever movement you make, like I said, you have to do less, or you know, or the opposite of.\n\nGALLOWAY: He\u2019s a very meticulous director, and does take after take after take. Do you like that? And how do you work with a director like that?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I don\u2019t think I had any idea at the time how to work with someone as masterful as he is. And I don\u2019t think at the time I really understood what was happening. I think I was in a space where I was like: there are all these things. I remember when we were filming, when Brokeback Mountain was coming out, and there were all these awards and stuff, and every night they were asking us to go to somewhere else, and I was shooting all these takes with David, and I was just confused, as a person, and as an actor feeling a little too big for my britches and that this thing was happening and then also not having enough skill yet, and technique to know exactly where I was, and know about the character. So, when I look at that now, all I think about is what a master I was working with, and all of the things I could have watched and learned \u2014 and I didn\u2019t. And how, now, in my career, how I would love to have a ton of takes.\n\nGALLOWAY: That\u2019s so interesting.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: It\u2019s to be cherished, and I think that\u2019s a big thing you learn, too. I think I work as hard as I do now, because of a lot of lessons I\u2019ve learned early on. And the amount of preparation I saw from someone like Fincher, and how aware he is of everybody else\u2019s job on the set, and how much respect he has for every aspect of the film, and every aspect of the frame \u2014 that\u2019s the type of actor I am now; it\u2019s not the type of actor I was then. But without understanding his process, and then coming to learn it later on, I would never be the actor I am now.\n\nGALLOWAY: You said you had an epiphany when you were 30 years old, but you did great work before then too.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: You\u2019ve always been sweet about that. Thank you. [LAUGHTER]\n\nGALLOWAY: It\u2019s not just, \u201cOh wow, you\u2019ve done Nightcrawler and Southpaw and End of Watch, which I love. You did extraordinary work before that. What was the epiphany? Was it triggered by Prince of Persia, which wasn\u2019t a success? What led to it and how did you change?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I don\u2019t want to be lofty when I say this, but I don\u2019t know what a success is any more. I know how we define it, but that was a moment where I went, \u201cWait, who am I?\u201d You could feel the business, in particular, kind of go \u201cHe\u2019s all right, let\u2019s go over here.\u201d I started to go, \u201cWait, I know why I love to do this.\u201d I think I got off track in why I love to do it. And I like the privacy of it, I like the intimacy of it, I like that when you create you really do create with a very small group of people, and in that space, before it goes out to all these people, that\u2019s what I love. And so I went, \u201cI\u2019m going to give everything to that. The result of that doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d and ultimately, it\u2019s something I have no control over. Though, it looks like that when it\u2019s your face. So I went, \u201cI\u2019m going to give everything in preparation to that process, and the world before it.\u201d I started to realize I love study, I love the study of human behavior, I love how you\u2019re sitting and the reason you tied your shoes the way you did, I love your \u2014\n\nGALLOWAY: You know the reason why I tied my shoes the way I did? [LAUGHTER]\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Probably because you\u2019re not great at tying your shoes. [LAUGHTER]\n\nGALLOWAY: No, I feel in a nine-foot deep hole in Cuba.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: No way.\n\nGALLOWAY: Really banged up my foot, so if I do it too tight it hurts, but there is a reason, and I\u2019m impressed that you observed that.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: But that, to me, that\u2019s everything, to me that\u2019s so fun, I mean, that\u2019s where I went like, I mean, wherever you find your fun, you know.\n\nGALLOWAY: It wasn\u2019t much fun.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah. [LAUGHS]\n\nGALLOWAY: Being yanked out, you know.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Well, you\u2019re not a professional shoe-tier, nor should you be because that\u2019s sort of shameful, but I would say that \u2014\n\nGALLOWAY: I\u2019m wearing a brand new suit here.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Your suit\u2019s a lot better. [LAUGHS] But you\u2019ve got to find your fun, like I found, when I talk about being onstage, I just get excited, it makes me excited. I feel like my life is worthwhile. I wake up in the morning and I\u2019m like yeah, you know, and I think about walking from my apartment to the subway, , getting on the subway and going up to the theater, walking and saying hi to everybody on my way there, walking into the theater. I may be tired, but I just \u2014\n\nGALLOWAY: When you had that epiphany, was it while you were making a film, and what was the first film that you made after that?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: End of Watch was really the movie that I made where it was quiet, everything was quiet.\n\nGALLOWAY: Which is such a wonderful film. And then you formed this collaboration with Denis Villeneuve.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes, that was quiet too, until everybody fell in love with Denis. Now it\u2019s really loud.\n\nGALLOWAY: Let\u2019s take a look at Prisoners, which is really excellent. This is a very brutal scene, I should warn you. Here we go.\n\n[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\n\nGALLOWAY: A really good scene. You play the cop, a detective with a tic, with a slight nervous tic, which again is beautifully calibrated. How did you create that character, and what led to the tic?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I read the script, and I had this idea. He was a sort of blank canvas, that character, on the page. There were many choices that could be made with him, and I just got this idea while I was reading it _ that it would be fascinating in a who-done-it story to have the cop be the big question mark. Who, essentially, I knew in the end was the good, really, fundamentally good guy. But if I could f\u2014k with the audience enough to think that, in their conventional idea, he maybe could be the bad guy, through most it. Then it\u2019d be super fun. Because it meant, it gave me a world of choice throughout every scene. So all of a sudden those somewhat bland scenes of interrogation and things you see in so many movies became \u2014 you know, you opened yourself up to a world of myriad choices, and so something came to me physically, it came from that weird place of instinct where I went, \u201cOh, what if he\u2019s holding back, obviously, his feelings?\u201d He\u2019s a young guy, but he\u2019s seen a lot, and he\u2019s never been able to fully expression himself, so much verbally and maybe that inability to express comes through a sense of sort of frustration, and maybe that frustration\u2019s communicated in a tic of some kind, and I felt that in my eyes, somewhere, and I got together with Denis, who I have a very open, creative relationship with, and I just started playing around with it, and clearly it freaked him out when I first did it. I was like, [blinks this eyes]. He was like, \u201cUh, you know\u2026\u201d And I know in his mind, he\u2019s like, \u201cHow am I gonna f\u2014ing edit that? Do we edit on the blink, before the blink, after the blink, and I\u2019m like exactly. [LAUGHS] So, I had that initial idea, and then I just started, then everything sort of spun out from there. I was fascinated. I love Serpico, you know, and I was thinking about police officers, and I had a lot of police officer friends from my work on End of Watch, very close detective friends. I didn\u2019t play a detective, but they were all detectives, and they were amazing men that I met on that movie. And so I started stealing from them. Like, I love trying to figure out, like who pulled the wool over my eyes, it\u2019s just my thing, I\u2019m like hmm? You know. \u2018Cause I think as an actor you have that nature, you\u2019re kind of like, what\u2019s really going on? And so that instinct led me also to just the primary research of interrogations, and before that scene in particular, I watched a videotaped interrogation where the suspect actually shot himself, for real. And so, I walked into that scene with the reality of these things actually happening. Because when I read it on the page first, I went like, \u201cUh, this feels like a kind of writerly thing,\u201d you know. It felt like that, it didn\u2019t feel super real to me. And when I searched far enough, I found that, that happens quite often.\n\nGALLOWAY: Wow.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: You know, there were these amazing, really, really hard things to watch of suspects in the room, sitting there, not having been searched. There was one guy that happened to have been searched properly by the police \u2014 there\u2019s so many different ways a suspect gets the detectives. When they finally get to the detectives, there\u2019s a sense of like, they\u2019ve been searched, they\u2019ve been put in a cell for long, they\u2019re finally there in the room to be interrogated, there are a lot of assumptions made by every step along the way, and obviously sometimes mistakes were made. And in this case that I saw, he still had a gun on him. So he was handcuffed, and here\u2019s there, who knows what it is, and the officer walks in, he\u2019s on his phone, asking him, doing what you do normal, very normal. And he says, \u201cYou want a glass of water?\u201d The guy says yes, officers walks back outside, and when he walks outside to get a cup of water, the guy pulls a gun out of nowhere \u2014 he still had his gun on him that they hadn\u2019t found \u2014 and he just shot himself, and that made that real. You know, I think I\u2019m not in this work to not look at life as it is. I\u2019m not in it to say, \u201cI want to wear a mask and escape,\u201d you know. I want to know what\u2019s happening in the world, and I want to have it touch me in a way that I can do something, my little part like that, and have it somehow translate. And so that\u2019s what I did there, you know, that\u2019s a specific work, but in terms of creating a character, I will also give massive credit to Donald Mowat, who\u2019s the makeup artist on that movie, who I met on that movie. And, he gave me the idea that there is no continuity, that there is no real continuity ultimately, particularly on the face or in a character. We can walk out of this room differently than we walked in it, through a door, whatever our exchange is, my face can look different, it actually can, given what happens, and doesn\u2019t mean you get punched, you have a black eye. Emotionally there are things happening that affect us. And he was the first person to really show me that through that through makeup, something that a lot of people consider to be a very vain sort of department at this day and age now, in a lot of ways \u2014 he really opened my eyes. It was beautiful. I walked in \u2014 in that movie I get shot in the head at one point \u2014 and I walked in that day \u2014 this is also where I think the universe deliveries pretty interesting things where, if you listen enough, you know, it will reveal itself somehow \u2014 I had a headache. I was just like, \u201cAhh man, my head is killing me today.\u201d And Donald\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d [LAUGHS] And I was like, \u201cOhh.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWhere?\u201d I said, \u201cHere, behind my eyes on my right side, it\u2019s just killing me.\u201d And he was like, \u201cGreat. Well then the bullet should go there.\u201d The target draws forth the arrow.\n\nGALLOWAY: It\u2019s so great that you learned something fundamental about acting from your makeup person.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh my God. Working with Jim Sheridan for instance, we did this movie Brothers. Jim will ask anybody \u2014 we\u2019ll get a delivery on set, and like the poor delivery guy will be like, \u201cHere\u2019s your pizza,\u201d and he\u2019ll be like, \u201cCome over here. Come here. I want to ask you a question. Do you think this is real?\u201d And he\u2019s like, \u201cIs that Natalie Portman?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. What do you think? Do you think she\u2019s good in it? Should we do another take?\u201d And they\u2019re like, \u201cI, uh, you want your pizza?\u201d There\u2019s no shame in everybody\u2019s ideas. There\u2019s no shame in somebody not knowing. There\u2019s no shame in somebody who doesn\u2019t necessarily do that job knowing a little bit more in that instance than you might know about your own job, you know, and I think that is where movies are such a collaborative art form.\n\nGALLOWAY: You said you\u2019re not drawn to playing characters with masks, but you almost played Spiderman, and you almost played Batman. Would you want to today?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: There are a lot of other almosts. I was almost in Dude, Where\u2019s my Car?\n\nGALLOWAY: That\u2019s a classic.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: There were a lot of people who almost played Bubble Boy, you know.\n\nGALLOWAY: Would you want to do a superhero movie?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: It\u2019s so funny, because they\u2019re so prevalent. I don\u2019t have a \u201cI want to play this or that,\u201d I just don\u2019t have that. I\u2019ve never been like that. People say to me, well \u201cWhat\u2019s the character you really want to play?\u201d And I go, I don\u2019t know, I\u2026 there are people who I think would be fascinating, but you know, if there\u2019s a super hero that is you know, gives me, or I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s the character, it\u2019s really the director, someone who gives me that space to create something interesting with it, you know, those are the characters I love. It\u2019s like, so it\u2019s not, you know, at times when I think you\u2019re talking about those movies, there\u2019s a time where you know, you\u2019re a young actor and you\u2019re just like, oh man, like I can play this like super hero that\u2019s so cool, you know, and it is cool, but I think for right now, I just want to work with people I really like, and who, who think I\u2019m good.\n\nGALLOWAY: Yes, that helps.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: No, it does, I mean it\u2019s everything.\n\nGALLOWAY: Absolutely. Other people\u2019s belief changes you. We all have insecurity, and uncertainty, and to have that glow cast over you by somebody that you respect, makes a gigantic difference.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: It\u2019s everything.\n\nGALLOWAY: It is.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: It is everything because it teaches you how to build it in yourself so that slowly you can be anywhere and be cool. And by cool, I don\u2019t mean cool. I mean vulnerable and a mess. [LAUGHS] Like we are.\n\nGALLOWAY: Right. I want to talk about a role you did want to play enough that you produced the film. It\u2019s really one of your great roles: Nightcrawler.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Super vulnerable.\n\nGALLOWAY: And super interesting, by the way. Super strange.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah. Yeah. I love him so much.\n\n[CLIP]\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh man, Dan Gilroy.\n\nGALLOWAY: Yes. And by the way, Rene Russo\u2019s so good in that.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh Rene is amazing. Yeah.\n\nGALLOWAY: And I loved listening to the audience reactions to each line. You know? When I met you we did this roundtable for The Hollywood Reporter, and Jake showed up looking awful. Wow, I thought, he was this kind of a handsome guy, you know? But I guess you\u2019d lost 30 pounds to do Nightcrawler.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yep.\n\nGALLOWAY: What drew you to this part? And how did you lose 30 pounds?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Um\u2026\n\nGALLOWAY: What did you not eat?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I just ran, you know. I ran a lot. I had this idea that he was a coyote, that Southern California was some place I grew up here, so you know, coyote\u2019s are everywhere and they had this thing and this way of walking and moving and looking and that they\u2019re hungry all the time. And there\u2019s this sort of, they kind of look like they\u2019re you know, not unassuming at all, but they look like weak in a way because they\u2019re so thing but they\u2019re just sort of strangely evil and scavengers and will tear apart any animal, you know? In that scene in particular like one of the choices that I believed was like he never used utensils, you know. He was always eating like a coyote, you know? I just ran, I ran, you know. And I didn\u2019t eat that much. It\u2019s really that simple. I mean it sucked.\n\n[LAUGHTER]\n\nGALLOWAY: Did you model the part on anybody?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes. There are aspects of a lot of people. Primarily, Dan Gilroy who wrote and directed the movie, was a big influence just like in terms of physicality in a lot of ways, because Dan has this sort of upright, very amazing posture about him. But really, I modeled it after an animal. I always find you go back to an animal; it will always show you the sort of primal aspects of behavior. You always know how to respond if you choose that. And I don\u2019t mean that like all of the sudden I decide to bark in the middle of a scene or something, [LAUGH] but I think that there\u2019s an inherent aspect, a very simple, very clear, very primary color to an animal without inhibition. So you can watch it like fire, like a child, an animal.\n\nGALLOWAY: What\u2019s so interesting is that the words and the surface seem disconnected from the awfulness. And it\u2019s like he could be talking about the weather.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yep.\n\nGALLOWAY: How do you pull that off? Do you make notes on your script? Do you play it different ways?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes. Well first of all I memorize the entire \u2014 this is the first time in a movie \u2014 I memorized the entire movie, like I would a play. So that we shot the movie in 22 days, which is a very short shooting schedule. We shot it all at night, well 22 nights really. And I just knew that there were these huge long monologues and I knew that I wanted to be able to get them out in one take. But I knew the variation wasn\u2019t going to be in the take it was going to be, I mean like within the take it was going to be take to take. Because we were trying to sort of calibrate this guy. So in terms of the disconnection, I think that came from really following the writing. You know? I did not veer from a period, a comma, even an unconscious mistake that Dan made. Sometimes he put commas in the weirdest places, and I\u2019d be like why did you put that there? He\u2019d say \u201cOh it must have been a mistake,\u201d I went \u201cno, no, no.\u201d OK. You know? I\u2019d ask him why he wrote it, and he\u2019d be like, and this is when you know someone\u2019s written something brilliant. They go, \u201cI don\u2019t know.\u201d Because it comes from, whenever I feel like someone goes \u201cwell I wrote it because this, and this connects to that, and dah dah dah.\u201d OK, cool. When they go like \u201coh, I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know where that came from.\u201d You know? That\u2019s when you\u2019re like-. And often times, I\u2019d ask Dan and I\u2019d be like, \u201cWhat. Can you tell me why he\u2019s like-.\u201d \u201cOh, I don\u2019t know.\u201d You know? And I\u2019d be like, \u201cOK, all right. Well I\u2019m just going to say it.\u201d \u201cYeah, yeah just say it.\u201d You know? And when I would just sort of say it, again like I keep saying it\u2019s like as an actor in particular, 50% of your work can be done for you when you\u2019re working with people who not only believe in you, but also who are exceptional. And it\u2019s your job to be able to try and find those people. And it\u2019s not just the writer or the director, it\u2019s everybody. You know? And there, you know you are the object that carries all departments. You are not, and I think I find this frustrating, when actors believe they\u2019re special. That the department, you know, oh I didn\u2019t-. A microphone on me, like you know? You carry the costume department, the sound department, the lighting department has to light you. You know? It\u2019s not like a privilege. You know what I mean? They have to figure out your face and all that. You know? They have to figure out the character and the story. And the director has to move and shape the whole thing. And so on and so forth.\n\nGALLOWAY: Who was the DP on all this? Was it Robert Elswit?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Robert Elswit.\n\nGALLOWAY: Who is your godfather?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yes.\n\nGALLOWAY: What did he teach you?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Nothing. [LAUGHTER] No. Look I have a profound respect for cinematographers. That is my secret sauce, you know. Like they are everything to me. And to me I just, I\u2019m a geek when it comes to them. And when it comes to Robert and when it comes to someone like Roger Deakins who shot Prisoners and he shot Jarhead too. When it comes to people like that, you know, if they tell me to hit a mark, I\u2019m going to hit a mark. Because they\u2019ve also already thought about my job, that\u2019s the other interesting thing. When somebody\u2019s really good, they\u2019re not just thinking about their job. They\u2019re saying like I\u2019m helping you too. I\u2019m not just dismissing what you do. You know? And you know, working with Robert, Robert is a storyteller. He\u2019s not a cinematographer, he\u2019s a storyteller. And to me, that\u2019s the graduation I hope to get to in my profession. That I\u2019m not just an actor, I\u2019m a storyteller. And I think that takes a long time in, when you have one job on a movie set. Makeup artists, actor, whatever. To graduate from just that to storyteller. And when he taught me was that you have to be aware of the story no matter what you\u2019re doing. That you are in service of that story. Not just how pretty that looks, or you know, what your character\u2019s doing. Or you know, only looking at, I mean we\u2019re all going to do it, like if I am an actor, I\u2019m going to be watching an actor\u2019s work. Like it\u2019s inevitable. I mean I\u2019m watching and they\u2019re like the silhouette of eating and going like, am I buying that, do I buy that? Am I buying that? You know? Is that believable? Is that any good? You know? I\u2019m watching all that in performance, but ultimately it\u2019s looking beyond what you do to service the story.\n\nGALLOWAY: Will you continue producing?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I hope so. I would love to. That\u2019s what I would love to do. I love artists, I love, I hope you guys will hire me some day. [LAUGH] I like really do feel that way I think. I love watching other people work, you know? And putting people together in a way that they can really feel like they\u2019re having fun. Like I said. It\u2019s never like, I don\u2019t think, easy\u2019s a good word, or hard\u2019s a good word when you talk about making movies. Because it\u2019s neither of those things, but enjoying it even when it hurts.\n\nGALLOWAY: I want to take a look at a film you probably did get hurt on: Southpaw.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\n[CLIP]\n\nGALLOWAY: So you spent six months preparing for this part.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\nGALLOWAY: To get in shape physically. But I wondered if the hardest part might have actually been that scene, [where his wife dies in the movie] which is so intense.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\n\nGALLOWAY: How do you prepare for that?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I think you build up the love between these two people. You know? I think Antoine Fuqua who directed the movie allowed for this space where Rachel\u2019s [Rachel McAdams] character and my character could really exist as a family in this space. And I think both of us really fell in love with that space, you know? We fell in love with our daughter, we were all together all the time. We were really like a unit, you know, and we shot all that stuff and there was a lot of improvisation and just a lot of getting to know each other as people, and Antoine was in there too. And you know, and I think also you just build that up. And I think just the thought of those things being taken away is enough, you know? It\u2019s just like particularly, I think, again like these things happen. You know? And I think also just the respecting of that space, and you know one of the things too is I believe and Michael Pe\u00f1a when I worked with, on End of Watch he said to me something that was I think one of the wisest things anyone\u2019s ever really said to me about acting, which is that you know your instinct is like a wild animal. You know? And you know a tiger in the jungle, you know, if you try and find it, it\u2019s not going to, you\u2019re not going to find it, you know they have like the cameras trying to like shoot it at different times of night and stuff. And as soon as a flash goes off, it\u2019s gone. You know? It\u2019s that sensitive, that thing. So the space within which to have that animal that has like come out, needs to be quiet. It needs to be respected. You need to create that space for that thing. And because it can go like that, it\u2019s gone. You\u2019re like dry, you know? As an actor, you\u2019re just in a space and then all of a sudden things set you off and, and it\u2019s not like, you know, I think you can find it in a lot of different ways, you know. Things are blessings that are coming at you in, hashtag [LAUGHTER], that are coming at you at times, always. So you can dismiss them like \u201cI need my space, you know, and I just like ah, what\u2019s that sound, you know, uh.\u201d You know, or like things come at you and they\u2019re always talking like, to you. But in the case of that I think the nature of the situation creates everything for you, you know? And I think also I find tactile things, you know. Just the feeling of blood itself is enough for me. You know? If you, even if it\u2019s not real blood. You know? I mean that\u2019s enough, like sometimes there are very simple things that are enough. You know? Sometimes you can be in a scene and you can start literally moving your body in the way that you would emotionally, and it will access that feeling. You don\u2019t have to go back and think about how this person yelled at you when you were a baby, and blah, blah, blah. You just have to hunch over and all of a sudden. When you hold, particularly for me in that scene, when you hold a woman in your arms who\u2019s saying \u201cwhat\u2019s going on?\u201d That\u2019s enough for me. You know? And I can\u2019t give her an answer. That\u2019s enough for me.\n\nGALLOWAY: Are you ever afraid that that emotion will dry up? And that you won\u2019t be able to access it? You know, I have a friend who\u2019s an actress and she said to me she couldn\u2019t access the emotion the way she did when she was younger.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I\u2019m not afraid of that, because I think there\u2019s sort of a bit of a surrender to that you know? I mean inevitably, this is what Peter Sarsgaard, my brother-in-law really taught me. Which is like wherever you are, like you come into a scene, you\u2019re like OK, well all right. This scene is where I\u2019m supposed to be. This is the scene where obviously I lose my wife, right? Like that\u2019s enough and, so I need to be in this space, whatever it is. Well, it makes me think of Dustin Hoffman. I worked with Dustin Hoffman when I was a kid. And Dustin before the funeral scene was like put on hip-hop, like crazy bad like pop hip-hop before in the makeup trailer. And I was like \u201cwhat are, what is?\u201d like and he was just like \u201cyeah.\u201d And I was like not only is he not a very good dancer, but he [LAUGHS] thank god he chose the right profession, but like he was like you have to like a slingshot, go as far away from the feeling that you\u2019re about to go into. Like go have fun, enjoy yourself.\n\nGALLOWAY: That is so fascinating. I would have thought the opposite.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Right? Right, yeah. Well it\u2019s about technique, you know? Like of course you\u2019re going to run dry I think if you stay in the same place and you are inspired in the same place and it\u2019s accessible from the same place always. It\u2019s never going to be accessible from the same place, like you know, I mean feelings are, they\u2019re ephemeral and that\u2019s what they are. You know? And he\u2019s the first guy, like you see Meryl Street. I remember watching Meryl Streep in, The River Wild. There\u2019s this scene where she\u2019s has a gun pointed at her, her family\u2019s in this-. I mean by the way, it\u2019s absurd in a lot of ways. Like she\u2019s on a raft, and it\u2019s like, there\u2019s water\u2019s like, you know. And she starts, someone pulls a gun on her I think, I\u2019m not really fully aware of the scene and she just, she starts, you see her terrified. And then all of a sudden she starts to burst out laughing. She starts laughing. Like she can\u2019t stop laughing. Because she\u2019s terrified and she\u2019s emotional and there are no rules to what you\u2019re supposed to feel. That to me is like A number one, that\u2019s the thing I have to remind myself all the time. You walk into a scene there are no rules ever about what you\u2019re supposed to feel. And so to me that was like, that\u2019s like, that one scene I always think like \u201cwhoa.\u201d What a brilliant, you know, she just moving like wherever the gun\u2019s funny so it\u2019s f\u2014ing funny. You know? It\u2019s like what are you going to do?\n\nGALLOWAY: Great, great answer. Let\u2019s get our student questions \u2014 fairly briefly please, because we\u2019re running late.\n\nQUESTION: Out of everything you\u2019ve done, is there a certain line or dialogue that has really stuck with you and why?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh wow. Wow. Yeah. Oh jeez. Well there are lines that just stick with me, like I mean I still can remember it\u2019s like every line that I say from Nightcrawler, I mean it\u2019s just always there.\n\nGALLOWAY: Every line?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: I would say almost every line, yeah. You know, I mean I have like funny like done interviews and someone\u2019s like \u201creally? And can you do the monologue?\u201d I\u2019m like, \u201cyeah I can do any monologue from that movie even now, because I memorized them like.\u201d But in terms of emotionally, you know what\u2019s funny about lines is that like I said like with, like the line in Brokeback Mountain like I had no idea the resonance that line\u2019s-. And it doesn\u2019t even have that resonance with me now, because it didn\u2019t have that resonance when I said it. The lines that were more important to me were like the like, you know, \u201cyou count the damn many times like, I can\u2019t survive on a couple of high altitude fucks every once, twice a year.\u201d You know? Those are the lines I could be, I could emote. You know? And then the one on my back\u2019s the one everyone\u2019s like \u201coh that line\u2019s amazing.\u201d You know?\n\nGALLOWAY: Somewhere Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains are saying the same thing.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Well, that would be nice company, yeah.\n\nQUESTION: Congratulations on your first-look deal with Bold Films. I want to know so far what has surprised you the most about producing?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Just how hard it is. It\u2019s so hard. It\u2019s a process in which you literally always take two steps forward and then it feels like three steps back. You know what I mean? And it\u2019s like, and then like you got to cheat your way towards like one more step without anybody seeing, you know? It\u2019s like there\u2019s, it\u2019s just I think when I say hard I think it\u2019s, you know you\u2019re dealing with so many personalities, you know, as an actor you know, you come in with your personality. You know? And you\u2019re like the last one in usually in a lot of ways. As a producer, it starts when I talk about privacy and silence. It starts before anybody believes in it. And I think that\u2019s, you have to have a real sense of self, and in order to push things through. And so often, what\u2019s interesting, is how many people dismiss an idea that eventually everybody [gloms] onto. So to me it\u2019s, that\u2019s what I mean by hard.\n\nGALLOWAY: Do you have a favorite project you\u2019re trying to get off the ground?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Yeah, but I\u2019m superstitious a little bit. So I\u2019m like\u2026\n\nGALLOWAY: You\u2019re allowed not to answer questions.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: And by the way, a lot of really good, probably better filmmakers than me in here, so if I say it, they\u2019re like \u201cOh that\u2019s a great idea.\u201d [LAUGHTER]\n\nQUESTION: Something I really admire about you and your career is just like the variety of work you\u2019ve done. Like everything is different. Like there\u2019s the indies that fly under the radar, and the Oscar nominated dramas, and a rom-com. And they\u2019re all so different and so good, and I guess what I would like to know is like do you think there\u2019s an element, like, in all of the projects you\u2019ve chosen thus far that is present in every single one of them, and that kind of unites all of these projects that are, to the outsider, would look so different?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Oh yeah. They\u2019re not all that good, but\u2026 Yeah, I just like, I can\u2019t not have something attached to like what actually happens in real life. Like I can\u2019t do a romantic comedy without there being something where like, in the case of Annie Hathaway\u2019s character, her character ends up having Parkinson\u2019s, you know? To me, I feel like that\u2019s love, you know? Like to me. So every movie has to have that kind of sense of that. You know I don\u2019t, not fantasy as much. I don\u2019t do as well with that. Yeah. And also I think yeah, like, often times I read scripts and they\u2019re based on a knowledge, people\u2019s knowledge of movies as opposed to people\u2019s knowledge of themselves. You know? And when I feel that, when someone\u2019s saying like this is something for me, it\u2019s not just I love movies, and this is what a movie would do. It\u2019s like the characters move the way that specific individual sees them move. And to me that\u2019s what I\u2019m always looking for.\n\nQUESTION: I would like to say you\u2019re very funny. I wasn\u2019t expecting that.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: Thank you. My mom would agree with you.\n\nGALLOWAY: I don\u2019t think you could do Nightcrawler without having an underlying humor. Even though it\u2019s so dark, there\u2019s also a humor in that performance.\n\nGYLLENHAAL: It\u2019s funny, people are like, \u201cWhy are comedians so dark?\u201d Like they\u2019re so dark. And they\u2019re like, \u201cJake why don\u2019t you make a happy film, like a comedy?\u201d They\u2019re the darkest people I know, comedians.\n\nGALLOWAY: Sorry go ahead.\n\nQUESTION: But my question is, when you\u2019re reading a script, what intrigues you the most. Is it the story or the character that you want to play?\n\nGYLLENHAAL: It depends really I think, recently I\u2019ve decided as an actor the only, the power I have really is in the performance. It\u2019s the only real place I get to sort of communicate. Everything else is in the hands of everyone else, so I\u2019ve recently more started picking things based on character and how much I can learn in terms of into the real, in the real world about that. Like I\u2019ve become obsessed with learning other languages in movies, because I was like, since I was like, but I learned how to box so why don\u2019t I just learn another language for a movie? Do you know? And. Because I think like I sort of look at it that way, so I\u2019m doing a movie, I\u2019m doing this movie with Antoine Fuqua that we\u2019re developing and the first half of the movie will be in Spanish. You know? And so to me, that idea. Those things, and it\u2019s a character thing. Going into the character for me more and more. But it\u2019s both, I mean you wish to have both, you know? I mean, but often times now I will sacrifice sometimes certain things in a story for the character. And that works sometimes and doesn\u2019t others.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Brokeback_Mountain.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Brokeback_Mountain.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Brokeback_Mountain.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephen Galloway"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ten-years-brokeback-jake-gyllenhaal-843951/", "title": "10 Years After \u2018Brokeback,\u2019 Jake Gyllenhaal Remembers Heath Ledger: \u201cWay Beyond His Years as a Human\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I wasn\u2019t really quite sure where he came from, and I think that\u2019s the feeling most people got when they were around him and why he was so extraordinary,\" Gyllenhaal recalls.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Stephen Galloway", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 843951, "title": "10 Years After 'Brokeback,' Jake Gyllenhaal Remembers Heath Ledger: \"Way Beyond His Years as a Human\"", "published_at": "2015-11-25 12:37:52", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Brokeback_Mountain.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "topics": "Movies", "body": "Ten years after Jake Gyllenhaal starred in the landmark Brokeback Mountain\u00a0\u2014 and almost eight years after the death of co-star Heath Ledger \u2014 the actor said he had no qualms about taking the role when it came his way.\r\n\"It\u2019s one of the most beautiful scripts I\u2019ve ever read, and it was Ang Lee, and at the time Heath [Ledger] was a friend of mine \u2014 before we even shot the movie \u2014 and always sort of alluring to me,\"\u00a0Gyllenhaal recalled.\r\n\"Heath was always somebody who I admired,\" he continued. \"He was way beyond his years as a human, in a way. I wasn\u2019t quite sure where he came from. I mean, I know he\u2019s from Perth, but I wasn\u2019t really quite sure where he came from, and I think that\u2019s the feeling most people got when they were around him and why he was so extraordinary. And when that opportunity came, I was a young actor. I was like, 'Yeah, I\u2019m in.' I know a lot has been made of the choice to do it, but it just didn't seem like something that was scary to me. You know, it was binding, because sometimes a lot of that character is very specifically the more overtly gay character of the two. The one who's struggling with it less. And I didn\u2019t really realize that. And that was an interesting journey for me, giving in to that idea. Being the one who tries to push the relationship.\"\r\n\r\nGyllenhaal noted that one of the things that separated him and Ledger was that the former had little experience with animals, which he felt he needed to have for the role. \"It wasn't a connection that I had that was just in me,\" he said. \"Heath, you know, would walk up to a horse and could like silence the horse. Just literally he\u2019d be like, 'Shh. Shh.' And then he\u2019d get on the horse. I\u2019d be like, 'I\u2019m going to get on you.' They\u2019d be like, 'F\u2014 off!\u2019 I didn\u2019t really have that style.' \"\r\nThe actor took part in THR\u2019s ongoing interview series The Hollywood Masters, which took place Nov. 18 at Loyola Marymount University\u2019s School of Film & TV.\r\nAsked if there will come a time when stars can openly be gay, he said: \"I wish I had that answer. I think it is changing. And it's pretty amazing how it's changing. And one of the things that I'm so proud of [about] that movie, was to see, within the past basically 10 years, how much has changed. When the Supreme Court [issued a ruling] just a little while ago, I felt like we had been part, a little part and parcel of that movement. I was proud, you know? To me that's really a pretty incredible moment. We had to wait a little while for it. But when will it be OK for an actor to be gay? I mean, it's OK now.\"\r\nA full transcript follows.\r\nGALLOWAY: You went to Columbia University \u2014 you dropped out halfway through, but you went to study Eastern Religions and Philosophy. Why and what did that teach you?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 To be honest, I was at a loss, I think, in a lot of ways.\u00a0 I was trying to figure out where my intellect, if I really have one, where it fit. And so I was searching. I really didn\u2019t know who I was or what I really wanted to be, and in that search, like I think you do as an actor, you end up trying to define whatever that is, and I sort of said, \u201cOh well, searching spiritually in a way is interesting, and Eastern religion seems to be about a search.\u201d And Robert Thurman was at Columbia, who\u2019s one of the Western world\u2019s most renowned thinkers in Eastern religion \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 \u2014 especially since his daughter started acting \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yes. Uma Thurman is his daughter. And there was a class called Intro to Tibetan Buddhism, and I just went in, and there were like 250 people waiting to get into this class. My sister actually was at Columbia at the time, and she was going to graduate, and she joined me there. It was the only class we took together, which was pretty cool.\u00a0 And they said, \u201cOK, all freshmen leave,\u201d and my sister was \u2014 whoop \u2014 \u201cStay.\u201d And I was like, \u201cOK.\u201d And she was like, \u201cNow all sophomores leave,\u201d and I was like, \u201cI should go.\u201d And she was like, \u201cStay.\u201d And then so on and so forth until the I was the only freshman there. And she said, \u201cNow walk up to the TA and say, you know you\u2019re a freshman, but you really want to take this class.\u201d And so I did, and they were like, \u201cOh, yeah, sure, stay.\u201d\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 So she\u2019s pretty savvy.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 All the other sheep just left, yeah. [LAUGHTER].\u00a0 And that\u2019s really my sister in a nutshell. And then I ended up staying and falling in love with the ideas. And it was a place where I felt creative, because at Columbia there\u2019s no performing arts department, so I was searching for it everywhere I could, and I took some photography classes and I ended up becoming fascinated with Eastern Religion, and ultimately it seemed to encompass the more abstract mind that I have.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: So what fascinates you about it? Is it one particular religion, or one particular idea?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: No. That\u2019s probably my problem.\u00a0 I think it\u2019s more, at least at the time, a sense of abstraction.\u00a0 My mind doesn\u2019t really work in a way where there\u2019s a definitive sense of something.\u00a0 I go one way and then it opens up into a million different ideas, and somehow, when you look at the art, Buddhist art, or particularly Tibetan art, you know, it\u2019s a similar thing.\u00a0 All of a sudden there are a million lotus leaves and you\u2019re following one to the next and to another, and I related to that, and it felt simple and easy to me.\u00a0 And it made me feel smart \u2014\u00a0 [LAUGHTER]\u00a0 \u2014 which other subjects didn\u2019t make me feel.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Which subjects did not make you feel smart?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Every other one.\u00a0 [LAUGHTER] Because I could draw ideas.\u00a0 I remember writing a paper for a seminar class.\u00a0 I remember writing a paper about \u2014 and this is going to sound really sort of pretentious, but that\u2019s where my mind was at the time \u2014 how acting and the performing artist can really be like a Bodhisattva, how they can communicate ultimately an idea in a way that can move and shift things.\u00a0 And that was wonderful.\u00a0 I didn\u2019t know many classes where I could try and relate the thing that I really loved and wanted to do into an intellectual idea, and that happened to be one of them.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Has that helped with your acting?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: No. On a spiritual level, on a place where you want to be a better human being and listen more, I try. I joke, but it has.\u00a0 I mean, I don\u2019t consider myself a card-carrying Buddhist, you know.\u00a0 But I do believe deeply in the ideas, and I think anytime you have interest in anything, it somehow humbles you. So yes, I think it has.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Your family was very creative. Your father\u2019s a director, your mother\u2019s a well-known screenwriter. Obviously Maggie, your sister, is an actress. How did they shape you?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Oh, man. This is an hour right? [LAUGHTER] If I\u2019m really honest, I think in positive and negative ways. You know, being the youngest, I constantly have that insecurity of being the youngest, which ultimately is probably my drive. in a lot of ways.\u00a0 In terms of as an artist, the way we could communicate as a family very clearly was through movies and through acting, and when things became complicated with all of our own personalities, that\u2019s where we are most clear.\u00a0 I think that\u2019s also where we are most brutal with each other as well. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: In what way?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: This is interesting, but I think we love each other so much and expect so much from each other, and I think we expect a type of honesty in the work that we all do.\u00a0 And I was brought up, and my sister too, with two people who were always saying, \u201cWhat you do is really nowhere near as important as the things that are going on in the world, and if your work needs to reflect that, or you want it to, then you need to strive for a certain type of excellence.\u201d Because things that are going in the world, particularly now, are no match to what art can do, you know?\u00a0 But you need to strive to try and communicate and try and change things in a similar way.\u00a0 And then people can think that\u2019s pretentious or whatever, but it\u2019s your life\u2019s work, and you\u2019ve decided that. That\u2019s what they made us believe. So we have a pretty high standard, which is at times great and at times not.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Which work of yours have they liked the best and which have they liked the least?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS] My mom\u2019s a big fan of Bubble Boy. No. My sister and I, and my brother-in-law too, who\u2019s an actor \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Peter Sarsgaard. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: \u2014 Peter Sarsgaard, he\u2019s an extraordinary actor, and I would say that Peter has really brought into my life and my sister\u2019s life a sense of presence as an actor that I never really understood or knew about until I met him. They\u2019ve been together for a very long time, and he introduced me to the idea of the presentation. You know, as Uta Hagen would say, there\u2019s the representational actor and the presentational actor. He immediately was a present, and he has always been a very presentational actor. It\u2019s always about getting into who he is and bringing that always, not hiding behind a mask.\u00a0 You know, my sister came up to me recently after she saw this movie, Southpaw, the movie I did, and she thought there was this exploration of that type of presentation, and a bit of representation as well, if I could be totally honest, where she was deeply moved.\u00a0 And I think also what\u2019s interesting is that she knows how much the choices that I make reflect what\u2019s going on in my life. Admittedly, probably, as my sister, and as someone who loves me \u2014 like, she can\u2019t wait to see become a father\u2026 There are a lot of different things that are spinning and connecting when your family sees what you do.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: What did you mean when you said: the choices that you make reflect what\u2019s going on in your life?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I could think of it two ways. When you have the opportunity to choose projects, inevitably you start being moved towards the things that you\u2019re moved by, right? And that changes over time, as we change, right? I also think within the scene, a specific scene \u2014 if I were to play a part that I played 10 years ago now, my interpretation of that scene would be totally different. I would be making different choices. It\u2019s actually [happening] right now in the movie I\u2019m making: I\u2019m doing one section of the movie where I\u2019m playing 22 years old, which has been a very interesting thing for me. Because I can\u2019t somehow subtract all of the experiences that I\u2019ve had in my life. And it\u2019s fascinating to see, because somewhere I\u2019m very reflective in that.\u00a0 You know, I\u2019ve been playing basically actually close to 40 years old, so I\u2019m somewhere lost in age in this movie. But it\u2019s been fascinating to see that I can\u2019t subtract that time.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: How do you recreate yourself at 22?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Some of it\u2019s physical. You do what you can to make your body and your face and the impression. You have help from the cinematographer and how they light you and all that, and then I try and find and access the parts of myself that still blindly believe and have faith in a lot of things. I don\u2019t mean to be cynical, but I\u2019ve also discovered that I still have a lot of those. And they may not be where I expected them to be. Maybe I\u2019ve been in relationships, and this is a movie about relationships, like romance relationships \u2014 so maybe I\u2019ve been in some that have sort of made me lose my faith.\u00a0 But deep down inside, I still have blind faith, you know?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You\u2019re only 34, don\u2019t lose it yet!\u00a0\u00a0 [LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I was listening to this Adele song, where she\u2019s like, \u201cWhen we were young...\u201d\u00a0 I was like, \u201cYou\u2019re 27. Are you kidding me?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 But you feel so old when you\u2019re young. And weirdly you feel younger when you get older.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Yeah. I think that there\u2019s definitely this sort of innocence, and I see that particularly with my parents, that\u2019s totally accessible, always. It\u2019s just how much you really want to access it.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: And great artists have to have some of that, right?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I don\u2019t know what you\u2019re asking me, but I think so. I think so.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You said something really interesting once: you said, \u201cI\u2019m a very political person, and I make political choices in my movies.\u201d What did you mean by that?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I have always had a deep belief that every movie, every artistic expression, is political. Don\u2019t be fooled. Even ones that we wouldn\u2019t consider overtly political are political. When we spend time doing anything, whether it\u2019s distraction or whether it\u2019s something that we have to face, it is always political. That\u2019s my belief. Not to say that you should be constantly trying to change the world, but I think it\u2019s important to know that whatever we do has an implication and has an effect, and because of that it is political.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Have you made a political mistake \u2014 I mean, artistically have you made a political mistake, or a decision that you regret from that point of view?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Every day, all the time. You mean specifically in a project? Or just behaviorally?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Either one that you\u2019d like to talk about is fine by me.\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Just be warned, there\u2019s a social media universe out there.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Oh, I have, believe me. We were joking before, and we were taking a picture and he was like, \u201cI realize I don\u2019t know where these pictures go.\u201d And I said, \u201cWhen you take a picture, that\u2019s how you should feel always.\u201d Mistake.\u00a0 I don\u2019t really know if I believe in that word. I guess the answer to that question specifically is, no.\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I\u2019ve made a mistake.\u00a0 I think I have behaved in ways that I am proud of; I think I\u2019ve behaved in ways I\u2019m not. I think that I have done work where I feel like I\u2019ve challenged myself, and then what\u2019s even more confusing is I\u2019ve done work where I think I\u2019ve challenged myself and no one\u2019s responded to it, and no one\u2019s interested in it.\u00a0 And then I\u2019ve done work at times where I feel like, huh? Nothing\u2019s happening and everyone goes [GASP] \u201cOh my God,\u201d you know?\u00a0 So in that way, as an actor in particular, you\u2019re powerless.\u00a0 And so in that way as an actor in particular you can\u2019t make mistakes.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Is this why you started producing recently?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: To make mistakes? \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGH]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 No, not to feel powerless. You produced Nightcrawler. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 I also have an ache to be a part of the whole.\u00a0 I love storytelling, you know, beyond anything. I love a great story beyond a great performance.\u00a0 Storytelling is about what we all do together and how we collaborate together. A performance can be a collaboration in ways, but oftentimes it\u2019s one individual thing. I get off on the interaction with people, and I love the chess of a movie and particularly \u2014 not only in preproduction or in production or postproduction\u2014 the behavioral chess.\u00a0 That is, learning and being humbled by and also teaching certain people certain things.\u00a0 I love that. As a producer, you have an opportunity to see the whole and bring people together.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Would you direct, too?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yeah. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 And going back to this idea that you love story \u2014 is there one story, one film \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: That was a mistake?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: No, I dropped that one. I\u2019m letting you off easy, you know. That really resonates with you? One, growing up, that made you say, \u201cThis is what I want to do?\u201d I often come back to this thing \u2014 do you know that Japanese film Afterlife? \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Beautiful movie, yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You\u2019re set in sort of a way station between this world and the next.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Like purgatory. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 And you\u2019re allowed to take one memory with you.\u00a0 You know?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I know I can\u2019t beat Amy Adams answer to this question.\u00a0 That\u2019s guaranteed.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: [LAUGHS] Did she talk about this with you?\u00a0 That\u2019s so funny. You\u2019re both very charming guests, so\u2026\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Well, I will safely say she\u2019s probably one of, if not the best actor that I\u2019ve worked with. She\u2019s extraordinary, and when I talk about working with people who are more talented than you, she\u2019s definitely the first person, right now, particularly, that comes to mind.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 So is there one film that you would take? \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Pretty much almost any film by Audiard, I would say. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Oh, Jacques Audiard. A Prophet?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 A Prophet, definitely yes, absolutely. As a whole, as a film. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Say no more, what a great choice.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: A Separation is another film that I think is extraordinary, and one of those things that feels like it\u2019s from another planet, much like Terrence Malick\u2019s movies did: at a certain point, you feel like he\u2019s an alien from another planet telling us and looking at us and showing us how we are. I also really, really love Jerry McGuire. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Yes.\u00a0 It\u2019s really good.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: West Side Story. I remember as a kid, those things that stick with you, Goonies. That has a profound resonance with me, that movie. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Jake, you\u2019re tumbling from my\u2026\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: We start with Jacques Audiard and we end up with Goonies.\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Good.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 Good.\u00a0 I like being up on stage with someone and they don\u2019t know what they\u2019re going to get.\u00a0 I appreciate that.\u00a0 And I\u2019m slowly feeling like\u2026\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Was there a moment when you decided \u201cI\u2019m going to be an actor?\u201d You were in City Slickers at the age of 10.\u00a0 When was the moment where you said, \u201cOK, I\u2019m an actor\u201d?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I really don\u2019t know if I feel that way now. I think it\u2019s fleeting. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s something where I say, \u201cThis is something that\u2026\u201d Because as an actor, no matter what, you\u2019re at the whim of so many other people all the time. Last night, when I was working with Amy, I was like, \u201cI\u2019m an actor!\u201d you know? But that came really from watching her and feeling kind of \u2014 you\u2019ve got to hash tag this \u2014but feeling blessed that I was with her. You know what I mean? You have the feeling that, \u201cI earned this exchange.\u201d I did this Little Shop of Horrors encores performance at City Center this past June, and I was working with Ellen Greene, who originated Audrey, and I was on stage with her as she dies in the scene. She\u2019s 64. You know, I\u2019m 34, and I was a kid when I watched her do it in the movie for the first time. And it was this strange mix of sexuality and oddity and amazing, this voice that was confusing to me. As a kid you\u2019re like, woof, that\u2019s brutal and moving and so many things mixed up into one, which is why that performance is probably one of the most classic performances ever, her performance in Little Shop. And I\u2019m sitting there holding her in my arms, playing Seymour, and thinking, \u201cI have done all the work I\u2019ve done to earn this moment,\u201d you know?\u00a0 And I think, when you say, \u201cWhen did you feel like an actor?\u201d it\u2019s those moments when I feel like, \u201cI\u2019m an actor, wow.\u201d That\u2019s an extraordinary moment for me. So it\u2019s not like I walk around going, \u201cI\u2019m an actor.\u201d I walk around thinking job to job, trying to not have regrets. Again, I would again bring up Amy, but there was this moment last night, it was like 3 a.m. and we were exhausted. She had done two super-brutal scenes, very hard emotional scenes, and she was just spent. And sometimes, when you\u2019re in that space, you\u2019re trying to find anything you can \u2014 like coffee or running down the street \u2014 to get motivation.\u00a0 And she just said, \u201cThat was too perfect. Can we just do it again, just one more?\u201d And there was something about her not wanting to have regret, wanting to know when she walked home back to her trailer \u2014 she went home at 5 a.m. \u2014 that, \u201cAll right, I left as much as I could on the table.\u201d\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Hugh Jackman said almost precisely the same thing about you with Prisoners.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Really?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Yes. I want to talk about your first big film. You did October Sky, and then you got the break that at the time wasn\u2019t a big hit, but in retrospect is an extraordinary film, Donnie Darko.\u00a0 So let\u2019s watch our first clip. I hope I chose the right scene.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS]\u00a0 The red curtain.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 This is your life, Jake. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Oh no, [LAUGHS]. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\t[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: It's such a wonderful film. I don't think I realized that when I first saw it, and then I watched again last week. It's spooky and haunting.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: [pointing to an audience member] This dude in the hood is, yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: So, Jason Schwartzman was meant to play this part.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yes.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Dropped out, you came in.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: How did you get in?\u00a0 How did you prepare for that role?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Well at the time Jason and I \u2014 he's a friend of mine. I remember him preparing for a long time, and then at the very last minute it all fell apart.\u00a0 And he had just done Rushmore and he's incredible in that. And I felt this, this pressure, you know.\u00a0 I went in to meet with [director] Richard Kelly and he was desperately looking for an actor, because he wanted to go. He had been really satisfied with what he had and then it all fell apart. And he was like, \u201cI just want to put it back together, I don't want to lose it.\u201d You know. \u201cYou seem cool.\u201d So there was that, there this actor who I just always thought was great and I didn't know.\u00a0 And I felt that way the whole time I was doing it.\u00a0 I thought, \u201cMan, Jason would be so good in this.\u201d And he would have been. That's the other thing about playing roles: You I'm fascinated to know what other actors have done with the roles that I play. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Did you talk to him about what he would have done with it?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 No.\u00a0 We did not talk about that, no. I remember it all happening very fast.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Were you nervous about doing it or did you not know enough at that point to be nervous?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I'm always nervous about it. You know, somehow, without even knowing it, I try and recreate the idea of what it feels like to go in front of an audience every night when I'm making a film. And that similar type of pressure and excitement before a scene, or preparing for a movie, so...\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: That's interesting, because I would have though your goal would have been to relax, not to build the pressure up on yourself.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: There are standards. I like to be prepared, I guess I should say \u2014 that type of pressure of, \u201cAll right, now you go with abandon,\u201d you know. Now when you're in it, you let go of all the things \u2014 that\u2019s what happens when you're onstage. You have formal rehearsal, a lot of things you don't have in movies \u2014 which is, you have to formally rehearse. You have to know your back story, discuss it, and almost everybody onstage has to know each other's [story], so that when it comes time to actually do it, you can throw it all away. That's the way I like to \u2014 and I didn't realize until very recently \u2014 that's the way I like to prepare for movies.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Have you worked with an acting coach? I don't think you ever took any formal acting lessons, did you?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: When I was younger, I did. I went to this place called Actors Space in the Valley. I was pretty young, and we were doing acting and improvisation. But no, no I didn't go to RADA, I didn't do that. But I do now work with an acting coach, primarily for the initial intellectual connection to the material. And then sometimes you need an anchor, whatever it might be. You need a space to connect. So often you get into a way of doing things. You have your typical way of preparing and you're like, \u201cOK, I'm ready.\u201d\u00a0 And then you're a bit lost, because you don't have something to connect to whatever it is. And that's what she provides for me. And oftentimes, too, just knocking me around a little bit. There's no real plan with us and I don't really ever have that. It's just knocking you out. As an actor, too, I feel like I'm somebody who, when somebody gives me a mark, I don't want to hit it. I don't like that. But then, without even knowing it, I just hit it. And then it traps me\u00a0 You know, that's the nature of an actor in a lot of ways. I was working with Michael Shannon on this movie I'm doing now, and I was like, \"Oh man I'm having trouble with this scene.\"\u00a0 And he's like, \"Well, then just open it up.\" I was like, \"But, the mark?\" And I was like, what's wrong with me? And he was like, \"Dude, what's wrong with you?\" [LAUGHTER] There's the nature of an actor that, someone says \u201cGo over there and do this,\u201d and you go like, \"OK. Yes I can do that so well.\"\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Because you want to please?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: There's part of that. And I think, for me, there's also that I understand the opposite side of the camera. I have a profound respect for that. I have worked with people who, when you hit that mark, are doing 50 percent of your work for you. So, you know, it's a balance. When you walk into a mark and you're lit a certain way or something's happening so often you don't know what's behind you...\u00a0 And that's what's so strange about being a movie actor.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Did you expect Donnie Darko to be like this when you were shooting it?\u00a0 Or did you think it was going to be a different kind of film?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I thought \u2014 I mean, I was 19, I thought it was going to be the best movie ever made. [LAUGHTER] And everyone was going to see it and it was just going to be incredible. And then nobody saw it and it didn't get bought at Sundance. And it was a really great experience. Humbling. And then it's since found its way.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Do you understand what's going on in the film?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Yes.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: If you go to the web, as you know, there are websites devoted to Donnie Darko and the Tangent Universe.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 There are websites?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Oh, absolutely \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Oh, wow, oh.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: \u2014 regularly updated, that explain the Tangent Universe, that explain the concept of time travel.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: [LAUGHS] I don\u2019t understand. That\u2019s a real waste of time.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You said, \u201cI don't understand it.\u201d So I wondered if that had changed.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I do. I mean, we started the conversation starting about abstraction, and about why I connect to material and for what reason. Often times it's really hard for me to articulate why I connect to something. But I know exactly what that movie's about. I can't define it; it doesn't tie up in a perfect bow. But it's about adolescence. It's about what it feels like \u2014 this isn't meant as a criticism, but like things I didn't relate to, which were high school movies. Where I'd watch it and I'd be like, \u201cWell, am I like the kid that nobody likes? Or am I like the person who everybody [likes]?\u201d I couldn't [tell]. I was like quantifying, putting me in a box. \u201cThis is my personality at that age\u201d and \u201cI'm this kind of person\u201d just felt like bullshit to me. And to me Donnie Darko was about adolescence.\u00a0 And about how, as soon as you start to grow up and you sort of move out into the world, you realize everything is so trippy. That anything can be anything.\u00a0 And that's equal amounts exciting as it is frightening. And that you can make a connection, but the connection can be with a rabbit, and a man in a suit. And that you can see things and people can think you're crazy, but you're actually not. I think that's what that movie is to me. And there are all these ideas that Richard threw in there \u2014 Stephen Hawking's ideas and things like that. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You've made some very bold choices and I wonder, when you came to do Brokeback Mountain, if you were frightened of that? Let's watch. It's very hard to get a short clip.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I know. I'm trying to figure out what clip you picked.\u00a0 I'm like, \u201cHere we go.\u00a0 All right!\u201d [LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You can guess?\u00a0 This is towards the end of the movie.\r\n\t\r\n\t[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Does that bring back memories?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Yeah. It definitely does. I was like, \u201cIt definitely does.\u201d [LAUGHTER] Yeah it does.\u00a0 It's funny, I was thinking about it: I haven't seen that in a while, but so many jokes have been made about \"I can't quit you.\" It's like, \u201cMy God!\u201d And it's not even on my face. The shot is on my back.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Right, it was very strong seeing that. But it's one of the great movie lines and everybody who has been in an intense relationship has got to that point.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Isn't that amazing?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: I love the fact that it's not on your face.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Not on your face. The power of the story.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: It's amazing how the world has changed because, at that time, a lot of actors didn't want to play a gay role.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Mm-hmm.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Did you feel that pressure?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Now everybody does.\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Did I feel the pressure? No. I think maybe naively, but also just I had been brought up a different way. I had been brought up in an elementary school where, my first few grades, I remember being specifically told that my teachers were gay.\u00a0 I was just that age and that was just how it was, and my parents were very... You know, that's how I was raised. Like super-progressive. And so it's just something I took for granted, weirdly. At the time. I think, now, younger generations do take that for granted in a lot of ways. I don't think that takes away from the struggle of identity and what that is.\u00a0 But the struggle for identity is everybody's struggle. No matter what it is.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Do you struggle for identity?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I'm an actor.\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I mean it. Totally relatable. You know what I mean.\u00a0 But at the time, I just went, \u201cIt's Ang Lee.\u201d It's one of the most beautiful scripts I've ever read and it was Ang Lee, and at the time Heath [Ledger] was a friend of mine \u2014 before we even shot the movie \u2014 and always sort of alluring to me. Heath was always somebody who I admired.\u00a0 He was way beyond his years as a human, in a way. I wasn't quite sure where he came from. I mean, I know he's from Perth, but I wasn't really quite sure where he came from and I think that's the feeling most people got when they were around him and why he was so extraordinary. And when that opportunity came I was a young actor. I was like, \u201cYeah, I'm in.\u201d\u00a0 I know a lot has been made of the choice to do it, but it just didn't seem like something that was scary to me. You know, it was binding, because sometimes a lot of that character is very specifically the more overtly gay character of the two.\u00a0 The one who's struggling with it less. And I didn't really realize that.\u00a0 And that was an interesting journey for me, giving into that idea. Being the one who tries to push the relationship.\u00a0 And I think in a very simple way people would say, \u201cOh the sort of more female character.\u201d I don't even know what the hell that means, but I've been told that many times \u2014 you know, the one who wants the relationship or something. That was an interesting thing for me.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: How did you prepare for that?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Heath and I spent a lot of time, a lot of things were just about...\u00a0 The biggest thing, and this is going to sound odd, but the biggest thing that I did was: I had not spent a ton of time around animals as a kid.\u00a0 It wasn't a connection that I had that was just in me.\u00a0 Heath, you know, would walk up to a horse and could like silence the horse. [LAUGHTER] Do you know what I mean? Just literally he'd be like, \"Shh shh.\"\u00a0 And he'd be like [MAKES HORSE SOUND]. [LAUGHTER] And then he'd be like, \"I'm going to get on you now.\" [MAKES HORSE SOUND].\u00a0 And then he'd get on the horse.\u00a0 I'd be like, \"I'm going to get on you.\"\u00a0 They'd be like \u201cPfft, f\u2014k off!\u201d [LAUGHTER] I didn't really have that style, so one of the things I did was: I got a dog. I know it sounds funny, but I got a dog and that dog died six months ago.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Oh.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: What kind of dog?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: He was a German shepherd. His name is Atticus and he taught me. So, that was the first thing. And the other thing was, really, I talked to a lot of people. A lot. Particularly just hearing stories. Ang gave us a lot of books about cowboys who had been gay or stories about it and all that stuff. And I just talked to a lot of my friends \u2014who [was] their first, particularly same-sex, first situation. That was fascinating to me \u2014trying to learn what that was in a certain period of time. Certain age. The secrecy involved in it. All those things. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: What surprised you most about what you found out?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Just the secrecy of it. How much it had to be. And then [that] became a part of their idea of sexuality. That was fascinating to me. That we all develop relationships with each other based on our first relationships, and then how we experience them. But inevitably they are echoes of earlier on. In my belief. And so when something is not accepted, somehow that becomes part of how we become attracted to it. Does that make sense?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Yes, absolutely.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: So I was fascinated with that. That what ties these two characters together is not just a love, but a loneliness. I think primarily it was deep loneliness. And what I always say about that movie, which I think maybe over time is more understood, is that this is about two people desperately looking for love. To be loved. And who were probably capable of it. And they just found it with someone of the same sex, you know.\u00a0 And that does not dismiss the fact that it is about, really, primarily, the first kind of very profound gay love story. Hopefully it can create an equality of an idea: that is, it's possible that you can find love anywhere. That intimacy exists in so many places that convention and society won't always allow us to see. And we won't allow ourselves to see, because of what criticism \u2014 and danger, really \u2014 it might provoke.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: It's still hard for a movie star to be gay. I mean, if you're going to be a character actor, it's one thing. When will that change?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 You're asking me? [LAUGHTER] When will that change? Look, I mean to ask, I think, when a lot of things will change? I wish I had that answer. I mean, I think it is changing, first of all.\u00a0 And it's pretty amazing how it's changing.\u00a0 And one of the things that I'm so proud of, in terms of being in that movie, was to see how, within the past basically 10 years, how much has changed. You know. When the Supreme Court passed just a little while ago, I felt like we had been part, a little part and parcel of that movement.\u00a0 You know. My parents taught me as a kid: do your work. Do it well. Try as hard as you can, whatever it is. It will one day, for the long [run], it will make some sort of change somewhere. You know, that happened there.\u00a0 It was so deeply moving to me that day [when the Supreme Court gave a ruling in favor of gay marriage] when my mother \u2014 I remember I was at Little Shop of Horrors.\u00a0 We were in rehearsal. I was freaking out, because we had like six days of rehearsal and four performances. It was a staged reading, and it was like, I didn't know what I was doing.\u00a0 And we were in rehearsal and my mom sent me the decision. And she just said, \u201cSometimes love does win out,\u201d I remember.\u00a0 And I was just super proud.\u00a0 I mean I was proud, you know? To me that's really a pretty incredible moment.\u00a0 We had to wait a little while for it.\u00a0 But when will it be OK for an actor to be gay? I mean, it's OK now.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Michelle Williams said Ang Lee was very tough on the boys. In what way?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Well, I think it's a cultural thing, in a way. We are all from different cultures, you know.\u00a0 Heath's Australian, really. I'm from here. Ang's from China. But I think Ang gets very close in preproduction and rehearsals.\u00a0 And then he allows his actors \u2014 I don't think scared of actors, but I think he's scared of getting in on the scenes he's watching. The space he's watching. So he just totally disconnects from you while you're shooting.\u00a0 And I think it's amazing what happens because he gets very close and then he lets you off these reins, you know, and you're like [MAKES NOISE].\u00a0 And I think he was aware of what the stakes were.\u00a0 And he had high expectations for us, you know.\u00a0 And we had a lot of burden to carry with that relationship and those two characters.\u00a0 A lot.\u00a0 I mean there was a lot there and he had to get it right.\u00a0 And he's tough, you know?\u00a0 I mean, he just is and that's what makes him the extraordinary director he is.\u00a0 And I have grown, and I do love that from my directors.\u00a0 When they push you.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 I know you very much like working with Sam Mendes on Jarhead. Did he direct you on stage? Did he do the Kenneth Lonergan play?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 No. He didn't.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 OK. Why do you like working with him so much?\u00a0 What makes a director that you as an actor respond to?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Well he just allowed me to make what we would call mistakes and had no judgment of them.\u00a0 He also empowered me.\u00a0 You know, he's like, \"You're my actor.\u00a0 I chose you. Whatever you do is right.\" Right? \"I made the decision, I'm complicit in choosing you. And I went through everything I could to choose you, so I feel good and whatever you're going to do I'm going to give you this space.\"\u00a0 And so it was very empowering.\u00a0 It was like he just completely gave me this confidence.\u00a0 And at the same time was very aware of my instrument and how to sort of push and pull it.\u00a0 I like the conscious manipulation that a great director can have.\u00a0 When you're both complicit in the manipulation of an emotion.\u00a0 Meaning, Sam sometimes would come up to me and he would start talking to me and we'd be talking about a scene and then he would just walk away from me. And it would piss me off.\u00a0 And then he'd roll the camera in this very... and it would boil up in me in this way and I just realized he kind of tied something up and then he snapped it off and he just shot it. And being aware that he was starting to mess with me ended up really feeling, I don't know if this sounds really dark, but like it really felt great, you know.\u00a0 We were in a relationship where we were aware of what was happening.\u00a0 And he's just so smart, too.\u00a0 There's always an intellectual side to the films he's doing and to the characters, and there's such a deep knowledge when you've worked with the actors that he's worked with, on stage in particular, but also in film.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Do you think intellect helps or hurts an actor?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I think, in the initial process of discovering a character and the analytical process \u2014 and this is what I did take from Buddhism \u2014initially I think there has to be an analytical, intellectual approach.\u00a0 And that has to be abandoned by the time you\u2019re playing the game.\u00a0 You run your plays, you know your plays, you study your plays, you study the other team, you do as much as you can, you go to practice, you get in shape, you do what you need to do, and then by the time you get to the game, you know your plays, but they have to feel like they\u2019re in your bones.\u00a0 That has to be an unconscious thing, it cannot be conscious.\u00a0 That is everything to me.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: And can you maintain that, take after take?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 No.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: OK, so now I want to talk about your work with a director who demands take after take, and how you do that. So we\u2019re going to look at a clip from \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Zodiac. [LAUGHS]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Zodiac, yes. You\u2019re on the trail of a serial killing and this may be the guy right here.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 What\u2019s it about?\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\t[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: I love the way you\u2019re looking at that thing, and realizing, \u201cOh my god, this guy might be the killer,\u201d and it\u2019s perfectly calibrated.\u00a0 You know, it would be so easy to do too much, or not enough, and it\u2019s this realization that we can feel, and then you go into the basement and we\u2019re all screaming, \u201cGet out of the basement, get out of that basement!\u201d Jane Fonda was here, and she said the toughest emotion for her to act was fear. What\u2019s the toughest for you?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: The easiest is anger, not just for me but in general.\u00a0 I think volume is also very easy. That\u2019s always a default to go to. Hardest emotion? They\u2019re all pretty damn hard; I don\u2019t know really if there\u2019s one specifically, but I do think, I don\u2019t know what\u2019s happening or what I\u2019m feeling when I\u2019m actually listening. I remember Chris Cooper saying to me \u2014 I was doing October Sky with him \u2014 and he said, \u201cYou know, you\u2019re just yelling at me.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cYou\u2019re just yelling. You need to listen.\u201d We were in a fight, and you know, oh you\u2019d get so excited as an actor, you\u2019re like, \u201cWe have a fight, oh, I get to get mad.\u201d And he just said, \u201cYou need to listen.\u201d And I started listening \u2014 and then all of a sudden where I was listening was where, I don\u2019t know, anger became something else.\u00a0 But I don\u2019t know about what the hardest one is. I think I\u2019m generally \u2014 fear, fear is very still, so in terms of that kind of fear \u2014 there\u2019s so many different kinds of fear, but fear is something, particularly in movies, that\u2019s interesting, because it\u2019s created by the film maker, that was created by Fincher, that\u2019s why he\u2019s brilliant. So, to me it\u2019s more important, in terms of the director, because whatever story\u2019s being told has to be water-tight, and then whatever movement you make, like I said, you have to do less, or you know, or the opposite of.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 He\u2019s a very meticulous director, and does take after take after take.\u00a0 Do you like that? And how do you work with a director like that?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I don\u2019t think I had any idea at the time how to work with someone as masterful as he is. And I don\u2019t think at the time I really understood what was happening.\u00a0 I think I was in a space where I was like: there are all these things. I remember when we were filming, when Brokeback Mountain was coming out, and there were all these awards and stuff, and every night they were asking us to go to somewhere else, and I was shooting all these takes with David, and I was just confused, as a person, and as an actor feeling a little too big for my britches and that this thing was happening and then also not having enough skill yet, and technique to know exactly where I was, and know about the character.\u00a0 So, when I look at that now, all I think about is what a master I was working with, and all of the things I could have watched and learned \u2014 and I didn\u2019t.\u00a0 And how, now, in my career, how I would love to have a ton of takes.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: That\u2019s so interesting.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: It\u2019s to be cherished, and I think that\u2019s a big thing you learn, too. I think I work as hard as I do now, because of a lot of lessons I\u2019ve learned early on. And the amount of preparation I saw from someone like Fincher, and how aware he is of everybody else\u2019s job on the set, and how much respect he has for every aspect of the film, and every aspect of the frame \u2014 that\u2019s the type of actor I am now; it\u2019s not the type of actor I was then. But without understanding his process, and then coming to learn it later on, I would never be the actor I am now.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You said you had an epiphany when you were 30 years old, but you did great work before then too.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: You\u2019ve always been sweet about that. Thank you. [LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: It\u2019s not just, \u201cOh wow, you\u2019ve done Nightcrawler and Southpaw and End of Watch, which I love. You did extraordinary work before that. What was the epiphany? Was it triggered by Prince of Persia, which wasn\u2019t a success? What led to it and how did you change?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I don\u2019t want to be lofty when I say this, but I don\u2019t know what a success is any more. I know how we define it, but that was a moment where I went, \u201cWait, who am I?\u201d You could feel the business, in particular, kind of go \u201cHe\u2019s all right, let\u2019s go over here.\u201d I started to go, \u201cWait, I know why I love to do this.\u201d I think I got off track in why I love to do it.\u00a0 And I like the privacy of it, I like the intimacy of it, I like that when you create you really do create with a very small group of people, and in that space, before it goes out to all these people, that\u2019s what I love.\u00a0 And so I went, \u201cI\u2019m going to give everything to that. The result of that doesn\u2019t really matter,\u201d and ultimately, it\u2019s something I have no control over.\u00a0 Though, it looks like that when it\u2019s your face. So I went, \u201cI\u2019m going to give everything in preparation to that process, and the world before it.\u201d I started to realize I love study, I love the study of human behavior, I love how you\u2019re sitting and the reason you tied your shoes the way you did, I love your \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 You know the reason why I tied my shoes the way I did? [LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Probably because you\u2019re not great at tying your shoes. [LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 No, I feel in a nine-foot deep hole in Cuba.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 No way.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Really banged up my foot, so if I do it too tight it hurts, but there is a reason, and I\u2019m impressed that you observed that.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 But that, to me, that\u2019s everything, to me that\u2019s so fun, I mean, that\u2019s where I went like, I mean, wherever you find your fun, you know.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 It wasn\u2019t much fun.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yeah. [LAUGHS]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Being yanked out, you know.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Well, you\u2019re not a professional shoe-tier, nor should you be because that\u2019s sort of shameful, but I would say that \u2014 \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: I\u2019m wearing a brand new suit here.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Your suit\u2019s a lot better. [LAUGHS] But you\u2019ve got to find your fun, like I found, when I talk about being onstage, I just get excited, it makes me excited.\u00a0 I feel like my life is worthwhile.\u00a0 I wake up in the morning and I\u2019m like yeah, you know, and I think about walking from my apartment to the subway, , getting on the subway and going up to the theater, walking and saying hi to everybody on my way there, walking into the theater.\u00a0 I may be tired, but I just \u2014\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 When you had that epiphany, was it while you were making a film, and what was the first film that you made after that?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 End of Watch was really the movie that I made where it was quiet, everything was quiet.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Which is such a wonderful film.\u00a0 And then you formed this collaboration with Denis Villeneuve.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Yes, that was quiet too, until everybody fell in love with Denis. Now it\u2019s really loud.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Let\u2019s take a look at Prisoners, which is really excellent. This is a very brutal scene, I should warn you.\u00a0 Here we go.\r\n\t\r\n\t[CLIP] [APPLAUSE]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: A really good scene. You play the cop, a detective with a tic, with a slight nervous tic, which again is beautifully calibrated. How did you create that character, and what led to the tic?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I read the script, and I had this idea. He was a sort of blank canvas, that character, on the page. There were many choices that could be made with him, and I just got this idea while I was reading it _ that it would be fascinating in a who-done-it story to have the cop be the big question mark.\u00a0 Who, essentially, I knew in the end was the good, really, fundamentally good guy. But if I could f\u2014k with the audience enough to think that, in their conventional idea, he maybe could be the bad guy, through most it. Then it\u2019d be super fun.\u00a0 Because it meant, it gave me a world of choice throughout every scene.\u00a0 So all of a sudden those somewhat bland scenes of interrogation and things you see in so many movies became \u2014 you know, you opened yourself up to a world of myriad choices, and so something came to me physically, it came from that weird place of instinct where I went, \u201cOh, what if he\u2019s holding back, obviously, his feelings?\u201d He\u2019s a young guy, but he\u2019s seen a lot, and he\u2019s never been able to fully expression himself, so much verbally and maybe that inability to express comes through a sense of sort of frustration, and maybe that frustration\u2019s communicated in a tic of some kind, and I felt that in my eyes, somewhere, and I got together with Denis, who I have a very open, creative relationship with, and I just started playing around with it, and clearly it freaked him out when I first did it.\u00a0 I was like, [blinks this eyes]. He was like, \u201cUh, you know\u2026\u201d And I know in his mind, he\u2019s like, \u201cHow am I gonna f\u2014ing edit that? Do we edit on the blink, before the blink, after the blink, and I\u2019m like exactly. [LAUGHS]\u00a0 So, I had that initial idea, and then I just started, then everything sort of spun out from there.\u00a0 I was fascinated. I love Serpico, you know, and I was thinking about police officers, and I had a lot of police officer friends from my work on End of Watch, very close detective friends. I didn\u2019t play a detective, but they were all detectives, and they were amazing men that I met on that movie.\u00a0 And so I started stealing from them.\u00a0 Like, I love trying to figure out, like who pulled the wool over my eyes, it\u2019s just my thing, I\u2019m like hmm?\u00a0 You know.\u00a0 \u2018Cause I think as an actor you have that nature, you\u2019re kind of like, what\u2019s really going on?\u00a0 And so that instinct led me also to just the primary research of interrogations, and before that scene in particular, I watched a videotaped interrogation where the suspect actually shot himself, for real.\u00a0 And so, I walked into that scene with the reality of these things actually happening.\u00a0 Because when I read it on the page first, I went like, \u201cUh, this feels like a kind of writerly thing,\u201d you know.\u00a0 It felt like that, it didn\u2019t feel super real to me.\u00a0 And when I searched far enough, I found that, that happens quite often.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: Wow.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: You know, there were these amazing, really, really hard things to watch of suspects in the room, sitting there, not having been searched. There was one guy that happened to have been searched properly by the police \u2014 there\u2019s so many different ways a suspect gets the detectives.\u00a0 When they finally get to the detectives, there\u2019s a sense of like, they\u2019ve been searched, they\u2019ve been put in a cell for long, they\u2019re finally there in the room to be interrogated, there are a lot of assumptions made by every step along the way, and obviously sometimes mistakes were made.\u00a0 And in this case that I saw, he still had a gun on him.\u00a0 So he was handcuffed, and here\u2019s there, who knows what it is, and the officer walks in, he\u2019s on his phone, asking him, doing what you do normal, very normal.\u00a0 And he says, \u201cYou want a glass of water?\u201d The guy says yes, officers walks back outside, and when he walks outside to get a cup of water, the guy pulls a gun out of nowhere \u2014 he still had his gun on him that they hadn\u2019t found \u2014 and he just shot himself, and that made that real.\u00a0 You know, I think I\u2019m not in this work to not look at life as it is.\u00a0 I\u2019m not in it to say, \u201cI want to wear a mask and escape,\u201d you know.\u00a0 I want to know what\u2019s happening in the world, and I want to have it touch me in a way that I can do something, my little part like that, and have it somehow translate.\u00a0 And so that\u2019s what I did there, you know, that\u2019s a specific work, but in terms of creating a character, I will also give massive credit to Donald Mowat, who\u2019s the makeup artist on that movie, who I met on that movie.\u00a0 And, he gave me the idea that there is no continuity, that there is no real continuity ultimately, particularly on the face or in a character. We can walk out of this room differently than we walked in it, through a door, whatever our exchange is, my face can look different, it actually can, given what happens, and doesn\u2019t mean you get punched, you have a black eye. Emotionally there are things happening that affect us.\u00a0 And he was the first person to really show me that through that through makeup, something that a lot of people consider to be a very vain sort of department at this day and age now, in a lot of ways \u2014 he really opened my eyes.\u00a0 It was beautiful. I walked in \u2014 in that movie I get shot in the head at one point \u2014 and I walked in that day \u2014 this is also where I think the universe deliveries pretty interesting things where, if you listen enough, you know, it will reveal itself somehow \u2014 I had a headache. I was just like, \u201cAhh man, my head is killing me today.\u201d And Donald\u2019s like, \u201cThat\u2019s great.\u201d [LAUGHS] And I was like, \u201cOhh.\u201d He\u2019s like, \u201cWhere?\u201d I said, \u201cHere, behind my eyes on my right side, it\u2019s just killing me.\u201d And he was like, \u201cGreat. Well then the bullet should go there.\u201d The target draws forth the arrow.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 It\u2019s so great that you learned something fundamental about acting from your makeup person.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Oh my God. Working with Jim Sheridan for instance, we did this movie Brothers. Jim will ask anybody \u2014 we\u2019ll get a delivery on set, and like the poor delivery guy will be like, \u201cHere\u2019s your pizza,\u201d and he\u2019ll be like, \u201cCome over here. Come here. I want to ask you a question. Do you think this is real?\u201d\u00a0 And he\u2019s like, \u201cIs that Natalie Portman?\u201d and he\u2019s like, \u201cYeah. What do you think? Do you think she\u2019s good in it? Should we do another take?\u201d\u00a0 And they\u2019re like, \u201cI, uh, you want your pizza?\u201d There\u2019s no shame in everybody\u2019s ideas.\u00a0 There\u2019s no shame in somebody not knowing. There\u2019s no shame in somebody who doesn\u2019t necessarily do that job knowing a little bit more in that instance than you might know about your own job, you know, and I think that is where movies are such a collaborative art form.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: You said you\u2019re not drawn to playing characters with masks, but you almost played Spiderman, and you almost played Batman. Would you want to today?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 There are a lot of other almosts.\u00a0 I was almost in Dude, Where\u2019s my Car?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 That\u2019s a classic.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 There were a lot of people who almost played Bubble Boy, you know.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Would you want to do a superhero movie?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 It\u2019s so funny, because they\u2019re so prevalent. I don\u2019t have a \u201cI want to play this or that,\u201d I just don\u2019t have that. I\u2019ve never been like that. People say to me, well \u201cWhat\u2019s the character you really want to play?\u201d And I go, I don\u2019t know, I... there are people who I think would be fascinating, but you know, if there\u2019s a super hero that is you know, gives me, or I don\u2019t even know if it\u2019s the character, it\u2019s really the director, someone who gives me that space to create something interesting with it, you know, those are the characters I love.\u00a0 It\u2019s like, so it\u2019s not, you know, at times when I think you\u2019re talking about those movies, there\u2019s a time where you know, you\u2019re a young actor and you\u2019re just like, oh man, like I can play this like super hero that\u2019s so cool, you know, and it is cool, but I think for right now, I just want to work with people I really like, and who, who think I\u2019m good.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Yes, that helps.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 No, it does, I mean it\u2019s everything.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Absolutely. Other people\u2019s belief changes you. We all have insecurity, and uncertainty, and to have that glow cast over you by somebody that you respect, makes a gigantic difference.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: It\u2019s everything.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: It is.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 It is everything because it teaches you how to build it in yourself so that slowly you can be anywhere and be cool. And by cool, I don\u2019t mean cool. I mean vulnerable and a mess.\u00a0 [LAUGHS] Like we are.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Right.\u00a0 I want to talk about a role you did want to play enough that you produced the film. It's really one of your great roles: Nightcrawler. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Super vulnerable.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 And super interesting, by the way. Super strange.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 I love him so much.\r\n\t\r\n\t[CLIP]\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Oh man, Dan Gilroy.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Yes. And by the way, Rene Russo's so good in that.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Oh Rene is amazing.\u00a0 Yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 And I loved listening to the audience reactions to each line.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 When I met you we did this roundtable for The Hollywood Reporter, and Jake showed up looking awful.\u00a0 Wow, I thought, he was this kind of a handsome guy, you know? But I guess you'd lost 30 pounds to do Nightcrawler.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yep.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 What drew you to this part?\u00a0 And how did you lose 30 pounds?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Um\u2026\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 What did you not eat?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: I just ran, you know. I ran a lot.\u00a0 I had this idea that he was a coyote, that Southern California was some place I grew up here, so you know, coyote's are everywhere and they had this thing and this way of walking and moving and looking and that they're hungry all the time.\u00a0 And there's this sort of, they kind of look like they're you know, not unassuming at all, but they look like weak in a way because they're so thing but they're just sort of strangely evil and scavengers and will tear apart any animal, you know?\u00a0 In that scene in particular like one of the choices that I believed was like he never used utensils, you know.\u00a0 He was always eating like a coyote, you know?\u00a0 I just ran, I ran, you know.\u00a0 And I didn't eat that much.\u00a0 It's really that simple.\u00a0 I mean it sucked.\r\n\t\r\n\t[LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Did you model the part on anybody?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 There are aspects of a lot of people.\u00a0 Primarily, Dan Gilroy who wrote and directed the movie, was a big influence just like in terms of physicality in a lot of ways, because Dan has this sort of upright, very amazing posture about him.\u00a0 But really, I modeled it after an animal. I always find you go back to an animal; it will always show you the sort of primal aspects of behavior.\u00a0 You always know how to respond if you choose that.\u00a0 And I don't mean that like all of the sudden I decide to bark in the middle of a scene or something, [LAUGH] but I think that there's an inherent aspect, a very simple, very clear, very primary color to an animal without inhibition.\u00a0 So you can watch it like fire, like a child, an animal.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 What's so interesting is that the words and the surface seem disconnected from the awfulness.\u00a0 And it's like he could be talking about the weather.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL: Yep.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: How do you pull that off? Do you make notes on your script?\u00a0 Do you play it different ways?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yes.\u00a0 Well first of all I memorize the entire \u2014 this is the first time in a movie \u2014 I memorized the entire movie, like I would a play.\u00a0 So that we shot the movie in 22 days, which is a very short shooting schedule.\u00a0 We shot it all at night, well 22 nights really. And I just knew that there were these huge long monologues and I knew that I wanted to be able to get them out in one take.\u00a0 But I knew the variation wasn't going to be in the take it was going to be, I mean like within the take it was going to be take to take.\u00a0 Because we were trying to sort of calibrate this guy.\u00a0 So in terms of the disconnection, I think that came from really following the writing.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 I did not veer from a period, a comma, even an unconscious mistake that Dan made.\u00a0 Sometimes he put commas in the weirdest places, and I'd be like why did you put that there?\u00a0 He'd say \"Oh it must have been a mistake,\" I went \"no, no, no.\" OK.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 I'd ask him why he wrote it, and he'd be like, and this is when you know someone's written something brilliant.\u00a0 They go, \u201cI don't know.\u201d\u00a0 Because it comes from, whenever I feel like someone goes \"well I wrote it because this, and this connects to that, and dah dah dah.\" OK, cool.\u00a0 When they go like \"oh, I don't know.\u00a0 I don't know where that came from.\" You know?\u00a0 That's when you're like-.\u00a0 And often times, I'd ask Dan and I'd be like, \"What.\u00a0 Can you tell me why he's like-.\" \"Oh, I don't know.\" You know?\u00a0 And I'd be like, \"OK, all right.\u00a0 Well I'm just going to say it.\" \"Yeah, yeah just say it.\" You know?\u00a0 And when I would just sort of say it, again like I keep saying it's like as an actor in particular, 50% of your work can be done for you when you're working with people who not only believe in you, but also who are exceptional.\u00a0 And it's your job to be able to try and find those people.\u00a0 And it's not just the writer or the director, it's everybody.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And there, you know you are the object that carries all departments.\u00a0 You are not, and I think I find this frustrating, when actors believe they're special.\u00a0 That the department, you know, oh I didn't-.\u00a0 A microphone on me, like you know?\u00a0 You carry the costume department, the sound department, the lighting department has to light you.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 It's not like a privilege.\u00a0 You know what I mean?\u00a0 They have to figure out your face and all that.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 They have to figure out the character and the story.\u00a0 And the director has to move and shape the whole thing.\u00a0 And so on and so forth.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Who was the DP on all this?\u00a0 Was it Robert Elswit?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Robert Elswit.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Who is your godfather?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yes.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 What did he teach you?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Nothing. [LAUGHTER] No. Look I have a profound respect for cinematographers.\u00a0 That is my secret sauce, you know.\u00a0 Like they are everything to me.\u00a0 And to me I just, I'm a geek when it comes to them.\u00a0 And when it comes to Robert and when it comes to someone like Roger Deakins who shot Prisoners and he shot Jarhead too.\u00a0 When it comes to people like that, you know, if they tell me to hit a mark, I'm going to hit a mark.\u00a0 Because they've also already thought about my job, that's the other interesting thing.\u00a0 When somebody's really good, they're not just thinking about their job.\u00a0 They're saying like I'm helping you too.\u00a0 I'm not just dismissing what you do.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And you know, working with Robert, Robert is a storyteller.\u00a0 He's not a cinematographer, he's a storyteller.\u00a0 And to me, that's the graduation I hope to get to in my profession.\u00a0 That I'm not just an actor, I'm a storyteller.\u00a0 And I think that takes a long time in, when you have one job on a movie set.\u00a0 Makeup artists, actor, whatever.\u00a0 To graduate from just that to storyteller.\u00a0 And when he taught me was that you have to be aware of the story no matter what you're doing.\u00a0 That you are in service of that story.\u00a0 Not just how pretty that looks, or you know, what your character's doing.\u00a0 Or you know, only looking at, I mean we're all going to do it, like if I am an actor, I'm going to be watching an actor's work.\u00a0 Like it's inevitable.\u00a0 I mean I'm watching and they're like the silhouette of eating and going like, am I buying that, do I buy that?\u00a0 Am I buying that?\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 Is that believable?\u00a0 Is that any good?\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 I'm watching all that in performance, but ultimately it's looking beyond what you do to service the story.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Will you continue producing?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I hope so.\u00a0 I would love to.\u00a0 That's what I would love to do.\u00a0 I love artists, I love, I hope you guys will hire me some day. [LAUGH] I like really do feel that way I think.\u00a0\u00a0 I love watching other people work, you know?\u00a0 And putting people together in a way that they can really feel like they're having fun.\u00a0 Like I said.\u00a0 It's never like, I don't think, easy's a good word, or hard's a good word when you talk about making movies.\u00a0 Because it's neither of those things, but enjoying it even when it hurts. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 I want to take a look at a film you probably did get hurt on: Southpaw. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\t[CLIP]\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 So you spent six months preparing for this part.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 To get in shape physically.\u00a0 But I wondered if the hardest part might have actually been that scene, [where his wife dies in the movie] which is so intense.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 How do you prepare for that?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I think you build up the love between these two people.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 I think Antoine Fuqua who directed the movie allowed for this space where Rachel's [Rachel McAdams] character and my character could really exist as a family in this space.\u00a0 And I think both of us really fell in love with that space, you know?\u00a0 We fell in love with our daughter, we were all together all the time.\u00a0 We were really like a unit, you know, and we shot all that stuff and there was a lot of improvisation and just a lot of getting to know each other as people, and Antoine was in there too.\u00a0 And you know, and I think also you just build that up.\u00a0 And I think just the thought of those things being taken away is enough, you know?\u00a0 It's just like particularly, I think, again like these things happen.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And I think also just the respecting of that space, and you know one of the things too is I believe and Michael Pe\u00f1a when I worked with, on End of Watch he said to me something that was I think one of the wisest things anyone's ever really said to me about acting, which is that you know your instinct is like a wild animal.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And you know a tiger in the jungle, you know, if you try and find it, it's not going to, you're not going to find it, you know they have like the cameras trying to like shoot it at different times of night and stuff.\u00a0 And as soon as a flash goes off, it's gone.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 It's that sensitive, that thing.\u00a0 So the space within which to have that animal that has like come out, needs to be quiet.\u00a0 It needs to be respected.\u00a0 You need to create that space for that thing.\u00a0 And because it can go like that, it\u2019s gone.\u00a0 You're like dry, you know?\u00a0 As an actor, you're just in a space and then all of a sudden things set you off and, and it's not like, you know, I think you can find it in a lot of different ways, you know.\u00a0 Things are blessings that are coming at you in, hashtag [LAUGHTER], that are coming at you at times, always.\u00a0 So you can dismiss them like \"I need my space, you know, and I just like ah, what's that sound, you know, uh.\" You know, or like things come at you and they're always talking like, to you.\u00a0 But in the case of that I think the nature of the situation creates everything for you, you know?\u00a0 And I think also I find tactile things, you know.\u00a0 Just the feeling of blood itself is enough for me.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 If you, even if it's not real blood.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 I mean that's enough, like sometimes there are very simple things that are enough.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 Sometimes you can be in a scene and you can start literally moving your body in the way that you would emotionally, and it will access that feeling.\u00a0 You don't have to go back and think about how this person yelled at you when you were a baby, and blah, blah, blah.\u00a0 You just have to hunch over and all of a sudden.\u00a0 When you hold, particularly for me in that scene, when you hold a woman in your arms who's saying \"what's going on?\" That's enough for me.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And I can't give her an answer.\u00a0 That's enough for me.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Are you ever afraid that that emotion will dry up?\u00a0 And that you won't be able to access it?\u00a0 You know, I have a friend who's an actress and she said to me she couldn't access the emotion the way she did when she was younger.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I'm not afraid of that, because I think there's sort of a bit of a surrender to that you know?\u00a0 I mean inevitably, this is what Peter Sarsgaard, my brother-in-law really taught me.\u00a0 Which is like wherever you are, like you come into a scene, you're like OK, well all right.\u00a0 This scene is where I'm supposed to be.\u00a0 This is the scene where obviously I lose my wife, right?\u00a0 Like that's enough and, so I need to be in this space, whatever it is.\u00a0 Well, it makes me think of Dustin Hoffman.\u00a0 I worked with Dustin Hoffman when I was a kid.\u00a0 And Dustin before the funeral scene was like put on hip-hop, like crazy bad like pop hip-hop before in the makeup trailer.\u00a0 And I was like \"what are, what is?\" like and he was just like \"yeah.\" And I was like not only is he not a very good dancer, but he [LAUGHS] thank god he chose the right profession, but like he was like you have to like a slingshot, go as far away from the feeling that you're about to go into.\u00a0 Like go have fun, enjoy yourself. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 That is so fascinating. I would have thought the opposite.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Right?\u00a0 Right, yeah.\u00a0 Well it's about technique, you know?\u00a0 Like of course you're going to run dry I think if you stay in the same place and you are inspired in the same place and it's accessible from the same place always.\u00a0 It's never going to be accessible from the same place, like you know, I mean feelings are, they're ephemeral and that's what they are.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And he's the first guy, like you see Meryl Street.\u00a0 I remember watching Meryl Streep in, The River Wild. There's this scene where she's has a gun pointed at her, her family's in this-.\u00a0 I mean by the way, it\u2019s absurd in a lot of ways.\u00a0 Like she's on a raft, and it's like, there\u2019s water's like, you know. And she starts, someone pulls a gun on her I think, I'm not really fully aware of the scene and she just, she starts, you see her terrified.\u00a0 And then all of a sudden she starts to burst out laughing.\u00a0 She starts laughing.\u00a0 Like she can't stop laughing.\u00a0 Because she's terrified and she's emotional and there are no rules to what you're supposed to feel.\u00a0 That to me is like A number one, that's the thing I have to remind myself all the time.\u00a0 You walk into a scene there are no rules ever about what you're supposed to feel.\u00a0 And so to me that was like, that's like, that one scene I always think like \"whoa.\" What a brilliant, you know, she just moving like wherever the gun's funny so it's f\u2014ing funny.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 It's like what are you going to do?\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Great, great answer.\u00a0 Let's get our student questions \u2014 fairly briefly please, because we're running late. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tQUESTION: Out of everything you've done, is there a certain line or dialogue that has really stuck with you and why?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Oh wow.\u00a0 Wow.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 Oh jeez.\u00a0 Well there are lines that just stick with me, like I mean I still can remember it's like every line that I say from Nightcrawler, I mean it's just always there. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Every line?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 I would say almost every line, yeah.\u00a0 You know, I mean I have like funny like done interviews and someone's like \"really?\u00a0 And can you do the monologue?\" I'm like, \"yeah I can do any monologue from that movie even now, because I memorized them like.\" But in terms of emotionally, you know what's funny about lines is that like I said like with, like the line in Brokeback Mountain like I had no idea the resonance that line's-.\u00a0 And it doesn't even have that resonance with me now, because it didn't have that resonance when I said it.\u00a0 The lines that were more important to me were like the like, you know, \"you count the damn many times like, I can't survive on a couple of high altitude fucks every once, twice a year.\" You know?\u00a0 Those are the lines I could be, I could emote.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And then the one on my back's the one everyone's like \"oh that line's amazing.\" You know? \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Somewhere Humphrey Bogart and Claude Rains are saying the same thing.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Well, that would be nice company, yeah.\r\n\t\r\n\tQUESTION: Congratulations on your first-look deal with Bold Films. I want to know so far what has surprised you the most about producing?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Just how hard it is.\u00a0 It's so hard.\u00a0 It's a process in which you literally always take two steps forward and then it feels like three steps back.\u00a0 You know what I mean?\u00a0 And it's like, and then like you got to cheat your way towards like one more step without anybody seeing, you know?\u00a0 It's like there's, it's just I think when I say hard I think it's, you know you're dealing with so many personalities, you know, as an actor you know, you come in with your personality.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And you're like the last one in usually in a lot of ways.\u00a0 As a producer, it starts when I talk about privacy and silence.\u00a0 It starts before anybody believes in it.\u00a0 And I think that's, you have to have a real sense of self, and in order to push things through.\u00a0 And so often, what's interesting, is how many people dismiss an idea that eventually everybody [gloms] onto.\u00a0 So to me it's, that's what I mean by hard.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Do you have a favorite project you're trying to get off the ground?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Yeah, but I'm superstitious a little bit.\u00a0 So I'm like\u2026\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 You're allowed not to answer questions.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 And by the way, a lot of really good, probably better filmmakers than me in here, so if I say it, they're like \"Oh that's a great idea.\" [LAUGHTER]\r\n\t\r\n\tQUESTION:\u00a0 Something I really admire about you and your career is just like the variety of work you've done.\u00a0 Like everything is different.\u00a0 Like there's the indies that fly under the radar, and the Oscar nominated dramas, and a rom-com.\u00a0 And they're all so different and so good, and I guess what I would like to know is like do you think there's an element, like, in all of the projects you've chosen thus far that is present in every single one of them, and that kind of unites all of these projects that are, to the outsider, would look so different?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Oh yeah.\u00a0 They're not all that good, but... Yeah, I just like, I can't not have something attached to like what actually happens in real life.\u00a0 Like I can't do a romantic comedy without there being something where like, in the case of Annie Hathaway's character, her character ends up having Parkinson's, you know?\u00a0 To me, I feel like that's love, you know?\u00a0 Like to me.\u00a0 So every movie has to have that kind of sense of that.\u00a0 You know I don't, not fantasy as much.\u00a0 I don't do as well with that.\u00a0 Yeah.\u00a0 And also I think yeah, like, often times I read scripts and they're based on a knowledge, people's knowledge of movies as opposed to people's knowledge of themselves.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And when I feel that, when someone's saying like this is something for me, it's not just I love movies, and this is what a movie would do.\u00a0 It's like the characters move the way that specific individual sees them move.\u00a0 And to me that's what I'm always looking for. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tQUESTION: I would like to say you're very funny. I wasn't expecting that.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 Thank you.\u00a0 My mom would agree with you.\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY: I don't think you could do Nightcrawler without having an underlying humor. Even though it's so dark, there's also a humor in that performance.\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 It's funny, people are like, \u201cWhy are comedians so dark?\u201d Like they're so dark.\u00a0 And they're like, \u201cJake why don't you make a happy film, like a comedy?\u201d They're the darkest people I know, comedians. \u00a0\r\n\t\r\n\tGALLOWAY:\u00a0 Sorry go ahead.\r\n\t\r\n\tQUESTION:\u00a0 But my question is, when you're reading a script, what intrigues you the most.\u00a0 Is it the story or the character that you want to play?\r\n\t\r\n\tGYLLENHAAL:\u00a0 It depends really I think, recently I've decided as an actor the only, the power I have really is in the performance.\u00a0 It's the only real place I get to sort of communicate.\u00a0 Everything else is in the hands of everyone else, so I've recently more started picking things based on character and how much I can learn in terms of into the real, in the real world about that.\u00a0 Like I've become obsessed with learning other languages in movies, because I was like, since I was like, but I learned how to box so why don't I just learn another language for a movie?\u00a0 Do you know?\u00a0 And.\u00a0 Because I think like I sort of look at it that way, so I'm doing a movie, I'm doing this movie with Antoine Fuqua that we're developing and the first half of the movie will be in Spanish.\u00a0 You know?\u00a0 And so to me, that idea.\u00a0 Those things, and it's a character thing.\u00a0 Going into the character for me more and more.\u00a0 But it's both, I mean you wish to have both, you know?\u00a0 I mean, but often times now I will sacrifice sometimes certain things in a story for the character.\u00a0 And that works sometimes and doesn't others.", "fb": {"pages": 14425952749}, "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "10 Years After \u2018Brokeback,\u2019 Jake Gyllenhaal Remembers Heath Ledger: \u201cWay Beyond His Years as a Human\u201d", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/ten-years-brokeback-jake-gyllenhaal-843951/", "description": "\u201cI wasn\u2019t really quite sure where he came from, and I think that\u2019s the feeling most people got when they were around him and why he was so extraordinary,\u201d Gyllenhaal recalls.", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Brokeback_Mountain.jpg?w=1024", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2015-11-25T12:37:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2015-11-27T13:39:54+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "10 Years After \u2018Brokeback,\u2019 Jake Gyllenhaal Remembers Heath Ledger: \u201cWay Beyond His Years as a Human\u201d", "description": "\u201cI wasn\u2019t really quite sure where he came from, and I think that\u2019s the feeling most people got when they were around him and why he was so extraordinary,\u201d Gyllenhaal recalls.", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/Brokeback_Mountain.jpg?w=3000"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/anGypG5-T-8"], "publish_date": 1448455072.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
