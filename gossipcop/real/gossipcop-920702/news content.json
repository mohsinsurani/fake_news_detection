In it, Ritchie references her \u201creally giant\u201d chest.\n\n\u201cThey were double-Ds by the time I was in the eighth grade,\u201d Ritchie says in the clip, where she talks about growing confident in her own skin.\n\n\u201cI think I feel most sexy in the morning: rolls, stretch marks, cellulite,\u201d she said. \u201cWhichever gender you choose to have sex with, you should be proud and find yourself sexually.\u201d\n\nSEE ALSO: This new clothing app is the Poshmark for plus-size women\n\nRihanna also offered peeks of her lingerie styles in earlier campaign posts, such as previewing a pink lace bodysuit.\n\nThe inclusive new line will feature bra sizes ranging from 32A to a 44DD, while underwear sizes come in extra-small to a 3X. With the average woman being a size 16 to 18, there\u2019s certainly demand: The plus-size women\u2019s clothing industry is valued at $17 billion, according to NDP Group. More recently, fashion brands like Reformation, Target and Reese Witherspoon\u2019s Draper and James clothing line broke into the market by introducing their own plus-size designs.\n\nSEE ALSO: This celeb favorite clothing line finally has a plus-size line\n\nThe \u201cWork\u201d singer-turned-businesswoman has recently pivoted to lingerie on the heels of her highly successful Fenty makeup launch in September, which features a range of foundation in 40 shades, making it seamless for women of all races to find a color that matches their skin tone. The brand received praise from the likes of Shonda Rhimes, Viola Davis and hijabi model Halima Aden.\n\n\u201cThe thing about Fenty, which I own, is that I can get a base makeup that is exactly my skin tone,\u201d Davis told Refinery29 of Rihanna\u2019s foundation.\n\nThe sales reflect her customers' support. Fenty Beauty fans spend an average of $471 per year in the makeup category, compared to KKW shoppers -- Kim Kardashian\u2019s new beauty line -- who spend $278; Kylie Cosmetics shoppers who spend $181; and shoppers of Kat Von D who spend $371, according to research from Slice Intelligence as reported by WWD.\n\nFans have already been showing an outpouring of support on social media, singing RiRi\u2019s praises for incorporating plus-sizes into the line. So it\u2019s safe to say Rihanna could be hitting a high note by folding messages of body positivity into her new fashion brand.", "images": ["https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/google-play.png", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images//Multimedia/2018/10/30/Photos/ZH/MW-GW556_3e56ed_20181030175019_ZH.jpg", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/mw-bio.png", "https://images.mktw.net/im-634507?width=183", "https://images.mktw.net/im-622144?width=167&height=94", "https://images.mktw.net/im-471261?width=183", "https://images.mktw.net/im-262198?width=183", "https://images.mktw.net/im-607321?width=183", "https://sts3.wsj.net/bucket-a/maggie/static/images/app-store.svg", "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW556_3e56ed_ZG_20181030175019.jpg", "https://images.mktw.net/im-262198?width=300&height=168"], "top_img": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW556_3e56ed_ZG_20181030175019.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jeanette Settembre"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rihannas-new-lingerie-line-is-working-the-plus-size-market-2018-04-30-1188394", "title": "Rihanna\u2019s new lingerie line is working the plus-size market", "meta_data": {"og": {"title": "Rihanna\u2019s new lingerie line is  working the plus-size market", "site_name": "MarketWatch", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rihannas-new-lingerie-line-is-working-the-plus-size-market-2018-04-30-1188394", "description": "Savage x Fenty, Rihanna\u2019s new lingerie line, will feature sizes extra-small to 3X on the heels of her successful Fenty Beauty", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW556_3e56ed_ZG_20181030175019.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "page.site": "marketwatch", "twitter": {"site": {"identifier": "@marketwatch", "id": 624413}, "domain": "marketwatch.com", "creator": "@J_Settembre", "description": "Savage x Fenty, Rihanna\u2019s new lingerie line, will feature sizes extra-small to 3X on the heels of her successful Fenty Beauty", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.wsj.net/public/resources/images/MW-GW556_3e56ed_ZG_20181030175019.jpg", "width": 1320, "height": 742}, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article.content_group": "marketwatch", "language": "EN-US", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/marketwatch", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"app_id": 283204329838}, "theme-color": "#2e2e2f", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "page.site.product": "MW", "robots": "noarchive,noodp", "googlebot-news": "index", "entitlementToken": "cecc4267a0194af89ca343805a3e57af", "muxUrl": "https://api.wsj.net", "article.doctype": 88, "cXenseParse": {"wsj-doctype": 88, "wsj-product": "Moneyish Blogs", "wsj-column": "Moneyish"}, "article.id": "84c9ac23-1a17-4f2a-8e0d-479465d4ccf4", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=336693422,app-argument=mwatch://article?id=84c9ac23-1a17-4f2a-8e0d-479465d4ccf4", "article.section": "Personal Finance", "article.column": "Moneyish", "author": "Jeanette Settembre", "description": "Savage x Fenty, Rihanna\u2019s new lingerie line, will feature sizes extra-small to 3X on the heels of her successful Fenty Beauty", "article.template": "full", "keywords": "article_normal", "news_keywords": "article_normal", "parsely-link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/story/rihannas-new-lingerie-line-is-working-the-plus-size-market-2018-04-30-1188394", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "Rihanna\u2019s new lingerie line is  working the plus-size market", "parsely-section": "Personal Finance", "parsely-post-id": "84c9ac23-1a17-4f2a-8e0d-479465d4ccf4", "parsely-tags": "PageType: Article, Template: full, ArticleId: 84c9ac23-1a17-4f2a-8e0d-479465d4ccf4, Column: Moneyish, DocType: 88, Subsection: Personal Finance, Access: Meter", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-04-30T11:39:00-04:00", "parsely-author": "Jeanette Settembre", "dj.asn": "i-0e5b", "user.type": "nonsubscriber", "user.exp": "default", "cx_pv_id": "l906q37mn3x58k7c", "cx_shield": "{\"campaign\":226,\"placement\":\"none\",\"tag\":\"default\",\"type\":\"free\",\"paywallType\":\"free\",\"bucket\":2}"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525042800.0, "source": "https://www.marketwatch.com", "summary": ""}
