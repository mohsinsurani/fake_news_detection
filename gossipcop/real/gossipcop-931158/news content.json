This unique short season of the show includes a cast of famous athletes from different disciplines.\n\n\n\nThe season has a few winter Olympians such as Tonya Harding, Jamie Anderson, Mirai Nagasu, Chris Mazdzer and of course, Rippon. There are also some team sports players like Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and former MLB outfielder Johnny Damon.\n\n\n\nIn this first week, the couples dance to the foxtrot, salsa, cha-cha-cha, or the waltz. The couples were evaluated both by the judges and from a live voting audience at home. For the first time in the show, two couples were eliminated on the opening episode. (Spoilers ahead!)\n\n\n\nLuckily, Rippon wasn\u2019t one of the two couples. In fact, he was one of the top couples of the week. It\u2019s been a dream for the Olympian to be on the show, so I\u2019m sure it feels great that he performed well.\n\n\n\nBefore we get into the dance, we have to talk about his introduction video. The first 10 seconds of the clip where Adam meets his partner, Jenna Johnson, is just them screaming and hugging. \"It was destiny,\" he says.\n\n\n\n\u201cAdam and I, when we first met, I was amazed because I felt like we had known each other for years,\u201d Jenna explained in the clip. \u201cImmediately, there was just a connection and a chemistry.\u201d\n\n\n\nI need to get a drink of water before we discuss how amazing his freaking performance was. If I hadn\u2019t seen him plastered all over Twitter for like a month, I wouldn\u2019t have been able to tell which one was the celebrity and which one was the professional dancer. First off all, they danced to \u201cSissy That Walk.\u201d I don\u2019t know if that was Jenna\u2019s choice or a production decision, but either way, genius move.\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817im_/https://intomore.com/styles/intomore/unicorn.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817im_/https://media.promogogo.com/intomore/2018-05-01/d00c827392114513b0b37c6fc669edec.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=25529403&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817im_/https://intomore.com/styles/intomore/burger-close.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817im_/https://intomore.com/styles/intomore/into-logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817im_/https://media.promogogo.com/intomore/2018-05-01/d00c827392114513b0b37c6fc669edec.gif", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817/https://intomore.com/culture/Adam-Rippon-Slays-Sissy-That-Walk-On-Dancing-With-the-Stars/7c432f80acf34ffa", "title": "Adam Rippon Slays 'Sissy That Walk' On \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019", "meta_data": {"fb": {"app_id": 749967531714191}, "og": {"title": "Adam Rippon Slays 'Sissy That Walk' On \u2018Dancing With the Stars\u2019", "description": "The cha-cha-cha has never been so fierce.", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817im_/https://media.promogogo.com/intomore/2018-05-01/d00c827392114513b0b37c6fc669edec.gif", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "site_name": "INTO", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180522200817/https://intomore.com/culture/Adam-Rippon-Slays-Sissy-That-Walk-On-Dancing-With-the-Stars/7c432f80acf34ffa"}, "description": "The cha-cha-cha has never been so fierce.", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, target-densitydpi=medium-dpi, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
