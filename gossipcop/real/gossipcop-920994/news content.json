Turns out, she wasn\u2019t exactly clearheaded while deciding to get inked on her inner lip back in July 2016.\n\nBefore carefully exposing the hidden tattoo (Jenner took pains not smudge her statement lipstick), the model told DeGeneres, \u201cI was drunk! I was not thinking clearly.\u201d\n\nThe host also inquired about the 22-year-old\u2019s choice of phrase: the word \u201cmeow.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was literally the first thing that came to my mind,\u201d she explained. \u201cI don\u2019t know, just my drunk thoughts.\u201d\n\nDespite DeGeneres\u2019 hesitation, Jenner noted that the location of her tattoo minimalized the pain. The body art done on her fingers where there\u2019s bone, however, hurt a bit, Jenner said.\n\nThe talk show star examined the tattoos on Jenner\u2019s fingers, a heart and a dot, done in white ink to be inconspicuous.\n\n\u201cI just wanted to know what it felt like,\u201d Jenner explained when asked why she would elect to have barely visible artwork done. \u201cAll my friends have them. I was like, \u2018I just want to know what it feels like.\u2019 \u201d\n\nJonBoy Tattoo/Instagram\n\nUnlike many who get tattoos with special significance, the model previously wrote on her website that her inner lip ink was just for fun \u2014 despite older sister Kim Kardashian West\u2019s advice to never \u201cput a bumper sticker on a Bentley.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kendall Jenner Opens Up About Her Golden Globes Acne: \u2018Never Let That S\u2014 Stop You!\u2019\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no real meaning behind it, I just wanted to be able to say that I have a tattoo \u2018on my face,\u2019 \u201d she said. \u201cI have two others also: a broken heart on one hand and a full heart on the other.\u201d\n\nJenner continued, \u201cI definitely want more and even though I used to say I\u2019d only get one if it meant something to me, now I have even more possibilities!\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/0v0AMf30BE67f7Q99JFtW09Fqtk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Ireland-Baldwin-kendall-jenner-12e65de3cbba4d829311716c6901b73e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3r3bd7MdNi_ZtskLvC1t1wphTYA=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x279:751x281)/kal-penn-tattoo-13e1924bd5d549f4ae4750a9e846f77a.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/9CzrGmX38MxkPadH9_6JPSVdZTQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(657x0:659x2)/kendall-jenner-wp-2000-60242948825440908380a576ae284d0c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/L8SS1c1M-irWIau5vPway1LZ9Ng=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(734x1328:736x1330)/olivia-wilde-1-2776ff1b0cda4fcaa7fb5d1700f3a178.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ewSQxrPZx9EHtIr4YX9e3I6VwCY=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(299x0:301x2)/hailey-baldwin-600x450-4a9dfdeb41234ec7aebb1307b563fac3.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/ISPHXWL56y1zPzkzVWqx6TSINnM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(789x0:791x2)/bella-hadid-tattoo-2000-1-a981ffee91d34b15abd6e987226542af.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/0Jj_D9Oa5ZLBFju8jtcC8wKYiWk=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/davidson-kardashian-1-51a2cf03ed044e249592cfd0ed01db8b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NC77xOWa11PdnzAym3DUFlrsv0E=/650x0/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(597x0:599x2)/kendall-jenner8-48a28efb49ca43f1af5613faecc9d93f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/8cJmVZc7Ok6w5_4Wwxc14qmMsU4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_generic-1885945d8bd544778fbbf4be88a63f00.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/kqG9h7HsDRcEeAKS4o6xpPKOl_g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/Kris-and-KhloeCC81-Kardashian-a50b771527f447fab0b09799a88c04ec.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/znHsVDG_y1LUuRkQpbKy6u8J-Pg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/kris-jenner-news-e3e99ec2c1344661ab2d5bdf14bcd97d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/41w9zguDkO-Pic2HobSzDz1EGKM=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Stephanie-13-258c05f276a7429a88ccccf5dd0c2103.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/7A1h-RwakfoglxlZKSqq5tGM5Rw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(597x0:599x2)/kendall-jenner8-1-efa8725c30024d8d8e4c5924b038736c.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/PfPdNi2fqa4znfD32w3erb7238g=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(511x0:513x2)/kendall-jenner-1024-1-5b9d1f650e4b4f2c838b3f950238590f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NkYhq7SBNLYaW3zixPg6Vp7dDUw=/1196x1500/filters:fill(auto,1)/kendall-jenner8-48a28efb49ca43f1af5613faecc9d93f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/NJJExmL_24v4IBgwzBIyJRh5Jh8=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/shanna-moakler-2-d08ca720e1f544dbb753657b7e358719.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/k4w65KPu3lwIXKC8cdNHAgbd6Ek=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(919x332:921x334)/selena-gomez-a563c3f8434c445d9f4d4336e5b77159.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/95Tp4UB8OaDoxa63xisqKCaV4oM=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/kim-k-pete-davidson-1499e187b4a94247b27ee0a5d7550fd6.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/NkYhq7SBNLYaW3zixPg6Vp7dDUw=/1196x1500/filters:fill(auto,1)/kendall-jenner8-48a28efb49ca43f1af5613faecc9d93f.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Petit", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/style/kendall-jenner-drunk-getting-meow-lip-tattoo/", "title": "Kendall Jenner Was Drunk When She Got Lip Tattoo", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I was drunk!
