Charms in the shape of wishbones and four-leaf clovers that dangle from a slender chain are best sellers, as are a variety of items adorned with a large heart.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fcba12e980d5a45d26ab02dde2a1a1e329a4eaeef278c26c7671adf706730e77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fcba12e980d5a45d26ab02dde2a1a1e329a4eaeef278c26c7671adf706730e77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Felder"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "type": "article", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019 (Published 2017)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fcba12e980d5a45d26ab02dde2a1a1e329a4eaeef278c26c7671adf706730e77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "The designer Jennifer Meyer posing in some of her own jewelry creations at her Los Angeles home."}, "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "title": "Jennifer Meyer\u2019s Goal? \u2018Jewelry You Wear All the Time\u2019 (Published 2017)", "description": "Since 2005 the Los Angeles resident has been designing gold pieces that are simple and small \u2014 and that sell.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg?year=2017&h=901&w=1600&s=b42da1325cf6a0afbfb9adf5a21ea6fc31f20cb0fe32e91c35c69a65a5c5b19e&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "The designer Jennifer Meyer posing in some of her own jewelry creations at her Los Angeles home."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/62c45c9a-e343-5a64-bc92-c95f95045fa6"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-12T08:47:40.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-12T08:47:40.000Z", "section": "Fashion", "tag": "Los Angeles (Calif)", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005368453, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/62c45c9a-e343-5a64-bc92-c95f95045fa6", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/80619c053bfe44da8de2abde5e1960a9", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/09/12/fashion/12meyer-inyt1/12meyer-inyt1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=fcba12e980d5a45d26ab02dde2a1a1e329a4eaeef278c26c7671adf706730e77&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Rachel Felder", "news_keywords": "Jewelry,Jennifer Meyer,Los Angeles", "pdate": 20170912, "CG": "fashion", "CN": "jewelry", "CT": "spotlight", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/62c45c9a-e343-5a64-bc92-c95f95045fa6", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/09/12/fashion/jewelry-jennifer-meyer-los-angeles.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505170800.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
