The star-studded ceremony took place at Ashford Castle in Co. Mayo, Ireland, according to E News.\n\nMultiple outlets report that the Irish athlete, 27, and the publicist exchanged vows before several noteworthy guests, including Ed Sheeran, 50 Shades of Grey star Jamie Dornan, Coldplay\u2019s Chris Martin, and singer Stevie Wonder. Both Sheeran and Wonder are said to have performed throughout the evening.\n\nMcIlroy proposed to the American beauty in December 2015 after less than a year of dating. In an interview with Irish Sunday Independent, the golf champ explained that the two hit it off as friends before becoming a couple.\n\n\u201cWe met when she was working for the PGA of America and renting a condo in Palm Beach,\u201d he told the newspaper. \u201cI found it refreshing being with someone who was living a normal life rather than, \u2018Oh! My jet is 30 minutes late!\u2019 I could speak to her about anything; we ended up spending a bit of time together and realized that there was something more there.\u201d\n\nMcIlory added: \u201cI love that she knows everything about me, and there was no judgment there. There was no judgment from Day one, which is huge, because that\u2019s very hard to find for someone in my position.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-611438790-1500x1200.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1038262530-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cropped-the-knot-news-logo@2x.png", "https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cec381d2-93e9-4201-9271-30f51f4fec94~rs_200.h", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-498263150-1024x710.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Questions-About-How-Coronavirus-Could-Affect-Your-Wedding_-Read-This-LEAD-shutterstock-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_1554396644-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/authors/kspears-2.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89960078_664744544273850_2656838980867194880_o-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2127-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-611438790-1024x754.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-611438790-1024x754.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kelly Is An Online News Writer For The Knot.
