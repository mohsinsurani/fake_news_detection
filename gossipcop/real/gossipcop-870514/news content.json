So Rob Lowe and his sons join the legions of ghost hunters that populate cable with \u201cThe Lowe Files,\u201d a goofy bit of Scooby-Doo-like hijinks for the A&E network.\n\nOpening to the strains of the song \u201cDon\u2019t Fear the Reaper,\u201d this rather odd series introduces Lowe \u2013 who, no fool, promptly rattles off a list of his credits \u2013 and his college-age kids John Owen and Matthew. Narrated earnestly by Lowe (who\u2019s also among the producers), the concept is for the trio to explore the paranormal and other \u201cunsolved mysteries\u201d together, beginning with an episode that features the Hardy Boys-esque title \u201cHaunted Boys\u2019 Reformatory.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat makes us different from any other idiot who\u2019s taking cameras into haunted mansions and castles and whatever?\u201d John Owen asks, as they banter in the car.\n\nWell, for starters, dad is asked to pose for pictures when they stop for coffee and donuts, and the family has its own \u201cpersonal shaman,\u201d billed as a \u201cspiritual intermediary,\u201d who they bring with them to investigate the unruly spirits.\n\nThe Lowe Files: Official First Look | Series Premiere August 2nd | A&E\n\nThe main problem with having actors participate in these sort of exercises is there\u2019s always a nagging sense that they\u2019re hamming it up, despite on-air disclaimers that stress the program is \u201c100% authentic\u201d and that \u201cNothing has been staged for television.\u201d The elder Lowe also somehow manages to look dashing and handsome even seen through eerie night-vision photography while wearing a silly beanie.\n\nThe sheer glut of unscripted programs devoted to the paranormal has made it challenging to bring anything new to the equation, which is where the actor\u2019s name recognition and the family dynamics come into play. The sitcom-like qualities, however, disappear faster than you can say gh-gh-ghost once items start moving around and lights flashing in that aforementioned dormitory.\n\nWell-known performers who dabble in reality TV usually do so either because the phone has stopped ringing quite as regularly or to provide a lift to their progeny, a la (in one early and often-imitated example) Ozzy Osbourne.\n\nLowe is spinning \u201cThe Lowe Files\u201d as an opportunity for a great big shared adventure. Still, after his sitcom \u201cThe Grinder\u201d went south, it\u2019s probably not the worst way to help boost his sons\u2019 profiles and keep himself in the spotlight, even if said light comes via the familiar glow of a greenish night-vision lens.\n\n\u201cThe Lowe Files\u201d premieres Aug. 2 at 10 p.m. on A&E.", "images": ["https://i.ytimg.com/vi/eqXZq-rKfew/hqdefault.jpg", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170731113823-lowe-files-photo-ae.jpg?q=x_0,y_67,h_2956,w_5254,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170608134508-brian-lowry.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170731113823-lowe-files-photo-ae.jpg?q=x_0,y_67,h_2956,w_5254,c_crop/h_270,w_480"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170731113823-lowe-files-photo-ae.jpg?q=x_0,y_67,h_2956,w_5254,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Lowry"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/01/entertainment/the-lowe-files-review/index.html", "title": "'The Lowe Files' review: Rob Lowe goes ghost hunting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Rob Lowe turns ghost hunting into family affair on A&E | CNN", "description": "'The Lowe Files' review: Rob Lowe and sons turn ghost hunting into a family affair in A&E reality show", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170731113823-lowe-files-photo-ae.jpg?q=x_0,y_67,h_2956,w_5254,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/01/entertainment/the-lowe-files-review/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Rob Lowe turns ghost hunting into family affair on A&E | CNN", "description": "'The Lowe Files' review: Rob Lowe and sons turn ghost hunting into a family affair in A&E reality show", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170731113823-lowe-files-photo-ae.jpg?q=x_0,y_67,h_2956,w_5254,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "'The Lowe Files' review: Rob Lowe and sons turn ghost hunting into a family affair in A&E reality show", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-01T14:08:43Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-01T14:08:43Z", "tag": "a&e television networks llc, celebrities, companies, rob lowe", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "a&e television networks llc, celebrities, companies, rob lowe", "author": "Brian Lowry", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501542000.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
