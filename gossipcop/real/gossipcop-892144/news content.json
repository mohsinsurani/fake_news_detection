The television star has denied the claim, saying that he does not know the accuser.\n\nCohen \u2014 who posted the claim on Facebook with details of her emotional state over the past month during the flood of sexual misconduct stories in Hollywood (she called the outpouring \u201cboth triggering and emotionally exhausting\u201d) \u2014 alleges that Westwick sexually assaulted her three years ago, in February 2014, during \u201ca dark time in my life.\u201d Her mother was sick with cancer (she died three months after the alleged assault) and she did not have the support system to deal with \u201cthe aftermath of the rape.\u201d\n\nReached by The Hollywood Reporter on Monday night, Cohen detailed the claims she made in her Facebook post. Her sister, Catalina Colgate, and close friend, Blaise Godbe Lipman, separately corroborated that they were told of Cohen\u2019s account three years ago, when the sexual assault was alleged to have taken place.\n\nWestwick responded in a statement on Instagram that read, \u201cI do not know this woman. I have never forced myself in any manner, on any woman. I certainly have never committed rape.\u201d\n\nThe incident allegedly occurred at Westwick\u2019s home in the Hollywood Hills. Cohen said she had been invited to the actor\u2019s home by a producer named Kaine Harling, a man she had briefly dated in 2013. The evening took a turn, she claims, when \u201cEd suggested \u2018we should all fuck.'\u201d Despite wanting to leave, Cohen said she was encouraged to stay for another 20 minutes by Harling \u201cto smooth everything over\u201d while Westwick suggested she nap in a guest bedroom.\n\nAfter falling asleep, Cohen alleges that she woke up to Westwick assaulting her.\n\n\u201cI was woken up abruptly by Ed on top of me, his fingers entering my body. I told him to stop, but he was strong. I fought him off as hard as I could but he grabbed my face in his hands, shaking me, telling me he wanted to fuck me,\u201d Cohen alleges. \u201cI was paralyzed, terrified. I couldn\u2019t speak, I could no longer move. He held me down and raped me.\u201d\n\nShocked and confused, Cohen said she ended up leaving the next morning. \u201cI was so lost and needed someone to pull me out of there,\u201d she told THR, adding that Harling had left earlier in the night.\n\nCohen told her friend Lipman of the encounter and also spoke with Harling, whom she claims blamed her for what happened. She added that Harling told her \u201cI can\u2019t say anything because Ed will have people come after me, destroy me, and that I could forget about an acting career. Saying there\u2019s no way I can go around saying Ed \u2018raped\u2019 me and that I don\u2019t want to be \u2018that girl.'\u201d\n\nCohen continued that she now realizes \u201cthe ways in which these men in power prey on women, and how this tactic is used so frequently in our industry, and surely, in many others.\u201d THR reached out to Harling for comment, but he has yet to respond.\n\nSeeing the flood of stories about everyone from Harvey Weinstein and James Toback to Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner inspired Cohen to share her story of the alleged incident. Cohen, who is from Atlanta, is an actress, writer and producer whose credits include the series Ladies Like Us and the upcoming film Earthwalkers.\n\n\u201cThere is a bigger picture to this \u2014 cleaning out the system and creating radical change,\u201d Cohen told THR. \u201cI think that\u2019s what I\u2019m contributing to. That\u2019s the big motivator for having this go out and putting it out there. \u2026 I believe in the message of restoration. This will only make us stronger.\u201d\n\nTHR has reached out to Westwick for additional comment, as well as to Cohen for a response to Westwick\u2019s assertion.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-624122282-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-624122282-h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-624122282-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Gardner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/ed-westwick-accused-rape-actor-denies-claim-1055474/", "title": "\u2018Gossip Girl\u2019 Star Ed Westwick Accused of Rape, Actor Denies Claim", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Actress Kristina Cohen claims the sexual assault occurred in February 2014.", "news_keywords": "autoplay", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Chris Gardner", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1055474, "title": "'Gossip Girl' Star Ed Westwick Accused of Rape, Actor Denies Claim", "published_at": "2017-11-07 10:50:08", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/gettyimages-624122282-h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "autoplay", "topics": "News", "body": "Actress Kristina Cohen has accused Gossip Girl actor Ed Westwick of rape.
