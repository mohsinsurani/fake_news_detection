VALERIE MACON / AFP /Getty Images\n\nDesigned by the late Filipino fashion legend Pitoy Moreno, who died on Jan. 15, the gown is made from the \"obi\" fabric used as wraps in Japanese kimonos.\n\n\"You think it would tarnish! It\u2019s been hanging in my closet,\" Moreno told Ryan Seacrest during E!'s red carpet coverage Sunday night.\n\nJust learned from Rita Moreno\u2019s daughter that her mom will be wearing the same gown she wore to the #Oscars in 1962 pic.twitter.com/Sf6DdgC7jr \u2014 Rebecca Keegan (@ThatRebecca) March 3, 2018\n\nMoreno, on hand to present an award Sunday night, added a few flourishes to make the dress even more stunning in 2018. Turning the gown strapless, the \"One Day at a Time\" star was able to show off a stunning gold necklace.\n\nMoreno is deserving of a fashion award to go along with the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar and Tony Awards the EGOT winner has on her mantle.\n\nVanity Fair reporter Rebecca Keegan was the first to report the news after hearing about Moreno's plans from the actress's daughter two days earlier.\n\nThe look was the talk of social media:\n\nThat\u2019s our @TheRitaMoreno\n\n\n\nI can\u2019t even fit into the dress I wore home from the hospital after my first kid!! https://t.co/dEGaXmUQnI \u2014 Gloria Calder\u00f3n Kellett (@everythingloria) March 4, 2018\n\n\"That\u2019s our @TheRitaMoreno,\" tweeted one fan. \"I can\u2019t even fit into the dress I wore home from the hospital after my first kid!!\"\n\n\"Bow down!!!!
