I'd be more than happy to fill in for yah. I will wear one of your outfits, the whole thing. I'll get in there, I'll scrub real good \u2014 I know how to wash my hands really, really well.\"\n\nThe one thing Kimmel won't do, though, is cut the umbilical cord. One, \"it's patronizing\" to act like you're \"the mayor and you're cutting the ribbon.\" The second reason, \"I don't want to screw up my kid's bellybutton.\"\n\nJohnson's celebrity dream family is growing fast, not just with Kimmel. The other day on The Ellen DeGeneres Show, the Rock star joked about bringing Frances McDormand into his relationship with Hashian. The Oscar winner had taken the time on the Golden Globes stage to acknowledge Johnson's 16-year-old daughter, Simone Garcia Johnson, who had been serving as Golden Globes ambassador.\n\n\"Frances, we're gonna have to exchange numbers because \u2014 just between you and I, I know no one else is watching \u2014 we're gonna get married,\" he said.\n\nJohnson is now ready to head to Shanghai and London on the press tour for Rampage, but he said the doctor gave him the okay; his newborn will likely stay put until her due date on April 25. Either way, Kimmel better be on call.", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2019%2F04%2F09%2Fnick-romano-image.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2017%2F12%2Fgettyimages-691304392-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fdwayne-johnson-2000.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fdwayne-johnson-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nick Romano", "April", "At Am Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson wants Jimmy Kimmel to deliver his baby: 'I'm gonna need a doula'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "news_keywords": "entertainment, entertainment news, ew, entertainment weekly", "description": "How do you say no to The Rock?", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "Dwayne Johnson wants Jimmy Kimmel to deliver his baby: 'I'm gonna need a doula'", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "description": "How do you say no to The Rock?", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fdwayne-johnson-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fdwayne-johnson-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson wants Jimmy Kimmel to deliver his baby: 'I'm gonna need a doula'", "description": "How do you say no to The Rock?", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F04%2Fdwayne-johnson-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2018/04/04/dwayne-johnson-jimmy-kimmel-deliver-baby/"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/_a382GtsKUc"], "publish_date": 1522796400.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
