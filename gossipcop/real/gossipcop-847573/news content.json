H&M has been such a big supporter of me from day one\u2014and this further proves that they believe beauty comes in different aspects. And the fact that Anna [Wintour] was like, \"Hey, you can be on the cover [of Vogue],\" and then was like, \"Hey, you can come to the Met,\" makes me [scream]. I'm Anna Wintour\u2013approved!\n\nGlamour: How has this experience been different from your past red-carpet events?\n\nAG: It\u2019s really a team effort. I've never had so many people involved in what my hair and makeup and nails are going to look like. And I had to be careful [with the dress], because it\u2019s a costume [event] and I want to stay within the theme, but I don\u2019t want to look gimmicky.\n\nGlamour: Right\u2014as a viewer, it's disappointing when people ignore the theme. How did you and the H&M design team pay homage to Comme des Gar\u00e7ons?\n\nAG: Everybody has a take on what that brand feels and looks like to them\u2014[for me], Rei Kawakubo and Comme des Gar\u00e7ons is red, red, red. H&M took that inspiration\u2014and all the great big shapes that you see in Kawakubo's designs\u2014and made this dress. We needed to show shape, because I have a body type that, when covered by a bunch of [volume], looks like a big [blob] walking down the red carpet. So the exposed bustier is a good detail.\n\nGlamour: How much of the design process were you involved in?\n\nAG: The great thing about custom is that you can get involved in the design. I\u2019ve been a part of it from the beginning, but H&M started the process by drawing. They sent over a couple of sketches of different dresses, and I picked my favorite. We edited that a little bit from there.", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1493578881/glamour_most-memorable-met-gala-dresses.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633ef8eaf0197d1ce66b2735/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/633dcb5fa325f3cb9d2d5dcc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/63220814a78f29f95d915099/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5907443e277bbc1e75c1eee9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ashley-graham-met.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6324b26b547694622aa6aae6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59074536f712667b5bea0437/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ashley-graham-met-selfie-lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5907449072287d18f2d8b040/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ashley-graham-met-back.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5907445db033211b51d9a29d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ashley-graham-met-full.JPG", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6336eea682d2c7a98fa2e8bb/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59074536f712667b5bea0437/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/ashley-graham-met-selfie-lede.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632484d849f9a667e4ae50a1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59074536f712667b5bea0437/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ashley-graham-met-selfie-lede.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lauren Chan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/ashley-graham-2017-met-gala-dress", "title": "Exclusive: Ashley Graham on the Making of Her Met Gala 2017 Dress", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Ashley Graham talked to Glamour about the making of her custom H&M dress for the 2017 Met Gala, celebrating the opening of the  Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costime institute.", "id": "59073d5fffe48646c2c29db1", "keywords": "ashley graham,met gala,h&m,plus size", "news_keywords": "ashley graham,met gala,h&m,plus size", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59073d5fffe48646c2c29db1", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Ashley Graham talked to Glamour about the making of her custom H&M dress for the 2017 Met Gala, celebrating the opening of the  Rei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons exhibit at the Metropolitan Museum of Art's Costime institute.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/590744d972287d18f2d8b042/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/ashley-graham-met-selfie.JPG\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/590744d972287d18f2d8b042/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/ashley-graham-met-selfie.JPG\"}", "og": {"description": "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59074536f712667b5bea0437/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ashley-graham-met-selfie-lede.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Exclusive: How Ashley Graham Got Her Gorgeous Custom Gown for Her First Met Gala", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/ashley-graham-2017-met-gala-dress"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-01T23:30:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-01T23:30:00.000Z", "author": "Lauren Chan"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25\ud83d\udd25", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59074536f712667b5bea0437/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/ashley-graham-met-selfie-lede.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Exclusive: How Ashley Graham Got Her Gorgeous Custom Gown for Her First Met Gala"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493681400.0, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
