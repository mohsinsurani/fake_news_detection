Javi Marroquin and Briana DeJesus made things official during Monday, June 4, episode of Teen Mom 2. Even though they tried to act like one big happy family with their children, their relationship with Kailyn Lowry couldn\u2019t be worse. Also, Chelsea Houska faced Adam Lind in court and can finally sleep soundly again. Find out what you might have missed during this week\u2019s episode of Teen Mom 2.\n\nChelsea Finally Feels Her Daughter is Safe\n\nIt was finally time for Chelsea to face her ex in court to try to hyphenate her daughter\u2019s last name to match her and her husband Cole Deboer\u2019s name. She also wanted to get her visitation agreement changed so that Adam could only see Aubree in a visitation center. She couldn\u2019t be more nervous to faceher ex, who she hadn\u2019t seen in about a year.\n\n\u201cI hate that I doubt myself,\u201d Chelsea said and continued to worry about her intentions. \u201cAm I being ridiculous? Can you be too ridiculous when it comes to your child?\u201d\n\nIn the end, everything went Chelsea\u2019s way, and she cried on the car ride home because she finally felt like Aubree was in a safe situation.\n\n\u201cI just feel like a weight is lifted off my shoulders,\u201d Chelsea said. They celebrated by telling Aubree about the name change by writing it on a cake, and Aubree was over-the-moon.\n\nBriana and Javi are Official\n\nAfter weeks of beating around the bush, Briana finally admitted that she and Javi were \u201cboyfriend and girlfriend.\u201d She went to Delaware to celebrate Lincoln\u2019s birthday with the kids. She even made Javi and their children matching shirts for the party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m looking forward to today,\u201d Javi said, and the two were acting like they were married already even though they just made it official. Javi was stressed about the Kailyn situation, but was mushy about having Briana to help him through it. \u201cIt\u2019s nice having you by my side,\u201d he told her.\n\nEven though last week\u2019s episode made it seem like Kailyn was in a relationship with her friend Dom, she shut rumors down this week by declaring she was too busy dealing with other people to be in a relationship. Although she was mostly referring to her children, the Briana/Javi drama might also have had something to do with it.\n\nWhen Javi decided Briana was going to go to Lincoln\u2019s party that he was supposed to cohost with Kailyn, Kailyn dropped out and had her own party. Briana exchanged some vicious texts with Javi\u2019s ex, and it caught Kailyn off guard.\n\n\u201cShut the f\u2014k up cause now I\u2019m mad. S\u2014k my d\u2014k, you dumb bitch,\u201d Briana texted Kailyn when Kailyn said she didn\u2019t want to meet up with her to talk thing about.\n\nAfter that explosion, Kailyn prohibited the crew from filming any part of the party because Briana was there. \u201cI don\u2019t think that she\u2019s a good person,\u201d Kailyn said. \u201cI don\u2019t want anything to do with him.\u201d\n\nNathan Might Still Be In Love With Jenelle\n\nJenelle Evans embarked on a new business venture and transformed her personal Facebook into a more professional page. However, the change made rumors swirl that she and David Eason were breaking up because her page no longer mentioned they were together. Her ex Nathan Griffith didn\u2019t waste any time to text Jenelle to find out what was going on and tell her he wants the best for her.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t know s\u2014t about Kaiser. You don\u2019t ask about Kaiser. But you ask if I\u2019m broken up with David,\u201d Jenelle told her friend about the text, who proclaimed that Nathan was just trying to weasel his way back into her life. To no one\u2019s surprise, David lost it when he found out about the text. He got into a fight with Nathan over it and called him some extremely derogatory words. When Jenelle was suppose to drop off Kaiser to Nathan after, she sent David\u2019s mother to avoid drama.\n\nHowever, Nathan was so made about the texts, he went after David\u2019s mom. He also seemed a little upset that the two were still together. \u201cThey need to get off the drugs,\u201d Nathan said. \u201cI won\u2019t do this no more.\u201d\n\nLeah Opens Up To Her Daughter\n\nLeah Messer took her daughter Aleeah Grace to a therapist this episode to work out some behavioral issues she was dealing with. Aleeah was acting out, and Leah and her ex Corey Simms thought it had something to do with her twin getting more attention than her. The appointment went well, but Leah had to talk about her daughter\u2019s problems in front of her, which made it awkward.\n\n\u201cIt was hard to talk about why you\u2019re not always the nicest to Ali,\u201d Leah told Aleeah afterward. \u201cEven when you have a bad day, I still love you.\u201d\n\nTeen Mom 2 airs on MTV Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/teenmom3.jpg?crop=293px%2C10px%2C1107px%2C580px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/teenmom3.jpg?crop=293px%2C10px%2C1107px%2C580px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Creutz", "Alex Darus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/teen-mom-2-recap-briana-and-javi-are-dating/", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Recap: Briana and Javi Are Dating!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Briana DeJesus and Javi Marroquin finally admitted they are a couple during the Monday, June 4 episode of \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 \u2014 read Us Weekly's recap", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Recap: Briana and Javi Finally Admit They\u2019re Dating", "description": "Briana DeJesus and Javi Marroquin finally admitted they are a couple during the Monday, June 4 episode of \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 \u2014 read Us Weekly's recap", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/teen-mom-2-recap-briana-and-javi-are-dating/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-05T13:03:52+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/teenmom3.jpg?crop=293px%2C10px%2C1107px%2C580px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/teenmom3.jpg?crop=293px%2C10px%2C1107px%2C580px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-05T03:22:16+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-06-05T13:03:52+00:00"}, "author": "Christina Creutz", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 Recap: Briana and Javi Finally Admit They\u2019re Dating", "description": "Briana DeJesus and Javi Marroquin finally admitted they are a couple during the Monday, June 4 episode of \u2018Teen Mom 2\u2019 \u2014 read Us Weekly's recap", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/teenmom3.jpg?crop=293px%2C10px%2C1107px%2C580px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528168936.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
