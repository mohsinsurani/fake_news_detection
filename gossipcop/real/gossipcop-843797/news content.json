Jimmy Fallon kicked off Saturday Night Live on April 15 with an epic flash mob featuring Harry Styles dancing to the late David Bowie\u2018s \u201cLet\u2019s Dance.\u201d\n\nThe Tonight Show host, 42, returned to host the NBC late-night sketch comedy show for the first time since 2013 to celebrate the first-ever episode that aired live from coast to coast. \u201cTonight is bigger than a show,\u201d he said during his opening monologue. \u201cIt\u2019s a party!\u201d\n\nSNL\u2018s house band then began playing \u201cLet\u2019s Dance\u201d as Fallon walked off the stage and through the halls of the studio, surrounded by dozens of backup dancers. While he sang the 1983 tune, he was joined by the SNL cast members and the evening\u2019s musical guest, Styles, 23.\n\nAnd while the former One Direction singer only appeared for approximately 15 seconds, his charming (and funny!) dance moves and irresistible smile essentially stole the show.\n\nLater on, Styles performed his new single, \u201cSign of the Times,\u201d and debuted a second song, \u201cEver Since New York,\u201d from his upcoming debut self-titled solo album.\n\nSaturday Night Live airs on NBC Saturdays at 11:30 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-jimmy-fallon-8dacc65a-011e-4146-ae67-f00231101fa9.jpg?crop=0px%2C22px%2C1009px%2C530px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-jimmy-fallon-8dacc65a-011e-4146-ae67-f00231101fa9.jpg?crop=0px%2C22px%2C1009px%2C530px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/harry-styles-dances-during-jimmy-fallons-snl-flash-mob-w477045/", "title": "Harry Styles Dances During Jimmy Fallon's 'SNL' Flash Mob", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jimmy Fallon kicked off 'Saturday Night Live' on April 15 with an epic flash mob featuring Harry Styles dancing to David Bowie's 'Let's Dance' \u2014 watch", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Harry Styles Dances to Bowie During Jimmy Fallon's 'SNL' Flash Mob", "description": "Jimmy Fallon kicked off 'Saturday Night Live' on April 15 with an epic flash mob featuring Harry Styles dancing to David Bowie's 'Let's Dance' \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/harry-styles-dances-during-jimmy-fallons-snl-flash-mob-w477045/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:15:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-jimmy-fallon-8dacc65a-011e-4146-ae67-f00231101fa9.jpg?crop=0px%2C22px%2C1009px%2C530px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-jimmy-fallon-8dacc65a-011e-4146-ae67-f00231101fa9.jpg?crop=0px%2C22px%2C1009px%2C530px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-16T13:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:15:19+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Harry Styles Dances to Bowie During Jimmy Fallon's 'SNL' Flash Mob", "description": "Jimmy Fallon kicked off 'Saturday Night Live' on April 15 with an epic flash mob featuring Harry Styles dancing to David Bowie's 'Let's Dance' \u2014 watch", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/harry-styles-jimmy-fallon-8dacc65a-011e-4146-ae67-f00231101fa9.jpg?crop=0px%2C22px%2C1009px%2C530px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492348500.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
