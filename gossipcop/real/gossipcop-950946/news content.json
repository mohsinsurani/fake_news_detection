It shows a blue Mercedes veering into oncoming traffic, apparently to turn into a residential compound near Olbia. The video shows what is reported as Clooney\u2019s scooter crashing into the car while another scooter alongside him manages to veer around it.\n\nClooney is thrown over the front of his bike and up in the air before landing on the asphalt, where the car driver and other witnesses come to help.\n\nThe John Paul II hospital in Olbia confirmed Clooney was treated there and released after a few hours.\n\nLocal media representatives who gathered at the hospital said the Oscar-winning actor-director left in a van through a side exit.\n\nThe newspaper La Nuova Sardegna said the 57-year-old Clooney was heading to a film set when the accident happened at a curve in the road near the entrance to the Costa Corallina residential compound in the province of Olbia.\n\nAn oil stain and police paint remained on the road. Photographs taken by someone passing the scene showed the car\u2019s front right bumper damaged and Clooney\u2019s bike on its side.\n\nClooney reportedly was in Sardinia filming a television miniseries adapted from Joseph Heller\u2019s World War II novel Catch-22.\n\nHe has been staying at a lush, gated rental villa in the high-end Puntaldia neighborhood on Sardinia\u2019s northeastern coast, which overlooks the Tyrrhenian Sea. Staff at the home declined to comment.\n\nClooney is a frequent visitor to Italy. He has a home on Lake Como and was married in Venice in 2014 to British human rights attorney Amal Clooney.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/george_clooney_recovering_after_scooter_crash_in_italy_inset-h_2018_.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/george_clooney_recovering_after_scooter_crash_in_italy_inset-h_2018_.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/george_clooney_recovering_after_scooter_crash_in_italy_inset-h_2018_.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["The Associated Press"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/surveillance-footage-shows-george-clooneys-scooter-crash-1126218/", "title": "Surveillance Footage Shows George Clooney\u2019s Scooter Crash", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Actor George Clooney slammed his motorbike into an oncoming car that turned suddenly into his lane Tuesday and was thrown several meters (yards) in the air on the Italian island of Sardinia, according to video of the crash.", "news_keywords": "George Clooney", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "the Associated Press", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1126218, "title": "Surveillance Footage Shows George Clooney's Scooter Crash", "published_at": "2018-07-10 19:43:05", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/george_clooney_recovering_after_scooter_crash_in_italy_inset-h_2018_.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "George Clooney", "topics": "Movies", "body": "Actor George Clooney slammed his motorbike into an oncoming car that turned suddenly into his lane Tuesday and was thrown several meters (yards) in the air on the Italian island of Sardinia, according to video of the crash.\r\n\"He is recovering at his home and will be fine,\" Clooney spokesman Stan Rosenfield told the Associated Press in an email.\r\nSurveillance video of the crash, apparently taken by a fixed security video, was obtained late Tuesday by the newspaper Corriere della Sera.
