Spotted in attendance for the B-Day festivities was Miley's little sister Noah, her older bro Trace, and her parents Tish and Billy Ray Cyrus, who captured a few pictures from the celebration on Instagram.\n\n\"Thankful for this moment. My thoughts and prayers with so many hearts that need mended. Peace and love to all,\" the 57-year-old crooner wrote with an image of the Cyrus brood, which shows the birthday girl waiting with a beaming smile to enjoy her pastel-colored cake.\n\n\"Happy birthday to my sweet girl,\" Hemsworth writes to his fianc\u00e9e with an image of her beside a colorful balloon display. \"You\u2019re more precious than ever. So thankful to have you in my life.\"\n\nThe \"Malibu\" artist's birthday party and well wishes come at a bittersweet time, as she and her future husband's Malibu home was recently destroyed due to the uncontrollable wildfires that burned through California only a few weeks ago.\n\nIn a social media post, the \"Malibu\" singer showed her gratitude for being \"one of the lucky ones\" to have evacuated the area unscathed. \"My animals and LOVE OF MY LIFE made it out safely and that's all that matters right now. \u2026 the memories shared with family and friends stand strong. I am grateful for all I have left.\"", "images": ["https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/f79fc341-a979-4863-81b0-eea1ddc6e07b?ops=resize(900,506),quality(10)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/assets.brands/60ccb1af1b3a402cbd502616?ops=gravity(%22center%22),contain(180,60)&quality=80"], "top_img": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Paris Close"], "canonical_link": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-11-24-untitled-content/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Celebrates 26th Birthday With Family After Losing Home To Fires", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"locale": "en_us", "title": "Miley Cyrus Celebrates 26th Birthday With Family After Losing Home To Fires | 103.7 The Q", "description": "We're so glad Miley enjoyed her special day!", "url": "https://1037theq.iheart.com/content/2018-11-24-untitled-content/", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "width": 1200, "height": 675}, "type": "article", "site_name": "103.7 The Q"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#fff", "msvalidate.01": "E98E323249F89ACF6294F958692E230B", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "theme-color": "#ee2634", "twitter": {"title": "Miley Cyrus Celebrates 26th Birthday With Family After Losing Home To Fires | 103.7 The Q", "description": "We're so glad Miley enjoyed her special day!", "url": "https://1037theq.iheart.com/content/2018-11-24-untitled-content/", "image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@1037theq", "creator": "@1037theq", "domain": "1037theq.iheart.com", "tile": {"image": {"alt": "We're so glad Miley enjoyed her special day!"}, "template": {"testing": 1}}, "": {"tile": {"image": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)"}}}, "parsely-title": "Miley Cyrus Celebrates 26th Birthday With Family After Losing Home To Fires | 103.7 The Q", "description": "We're so glad Miley enjoyed her special day!", "keywords": "birmingham, alabama, radio, hits, wqen, top 40, streaming", "parsely-tags": "birmingham, alabama, radio, hits, wqen, top 40, streaming", "parsely-link": "https://1037theq.iheart.com/content/2018-11-24-untitled-content/", "thumbnail": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-image-url": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://i.iheart.com/v3/re/new_assets/5bf99208e98a784d2f862efc?ops=gravity(%22north%22),fit(1200,675),quality(65)", "parsely-type": "post", "application-name": "103.7 The Q", "fb": {"app_id": 195502630484729}, "google-site-verification": "p2FWrUKxtwBmQgHV4CjD80oKdZZBjmMNByoWvZMsYso", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://www.iheart.com/content/2018-11-24-untitled-content/", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-11-24T20:46:00Z", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "parsely-author": "Paris Close", "parsely-section": "iHeartRadio Music News"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543017600.0, "source": "https://1037theq.iheart.com", "summary": ""}
