And I haven\u2019t been able to get this person\u2019s name; they won\u2019t give me the name of the person.\u201d\n\nAccording to reports, the Tony winner said the incident happened without warning and that she didn\u2019t even know the person.\n\nThere was no, \u2018Hi, how are you doing?\u2019 And I was asleep before the plane even took off; I\u2019m one of those sleepers. I wanted to punch that man, and I knew that that would take away from the story that I had to tell. I had to hold in everything that I was feeling to be able to tell this story and be heard and taken seriously from the place I was in. It\u2019s been\u2026interesting.\u201d\n\nAnd while the man was removed from the plane, Anika hasn\u2019t been given her perpetrator\u2019s name\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a Freedom of Information act. You\u2019re supposed to be able to get people\u2019s names. I made a report right then with the FBI and they dropped it. They dropped the case,\u201d she said.\n\nListen below.\n\nThe actress has since taken to social media to share a gratitude of thanks after bravely sharing her story.\n\nJust want to thank everyone who has sent me positive thoughts and support. This is not an easy thing, but you all make me feel lifted. ?? https://t.co/UtfJaHwMFJ \u2014 Anika Noni Rose *DoesntNeedToSeeYourPenis* (@AnikaNoniRose) January 18, 2018\n\nTV One Stars Accused Of Sexual Harassment, Misconduct Or Rape 18 photos Launch gallery Stars Accused Of Sexual Harassment, Misconduct Or Rape 1.
