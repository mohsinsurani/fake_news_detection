Bekah Martinez, who competed for Arie Luyendyk Jr.\u2019s heart on season 22 of The Bachelor, revealed Wednesday that she is pregnant and expecting her first child with her boyfriend, Grayston Leonard.\n\nMartinez shared the news in an interview with PureWow. \u201cI was in disbelief and thought, \u2018Is this really happening?'\u201d Martinez told the site. \u201cI immediately called Grayston and then went across the street to the Dollar Tree and bought two more pregnancy tests. They, of course, were both positive.\u201d\n\nAccording to Martinez, who has been dating Leonard for seven months, becoming a mother is \u201clegitimately a dream come true.\u201d The 23-year-old elaborated, \u201cIt\u2019s the one thing that I\u2019ve known with certainty for so long. I\u2019ve gone back and forth on the idea of marriage and relationships, but I\u2019ve always felt sure that I want to be a mom.\u201d\n\nMartinez\u2019s pregnancy announcement comes months after she was named a castmember on season five of Bachelor in Paradise, which just wrapped its season Tuesday night. Host Chris Harrison had announced her participation during the Bachelorette reunion show earlier this summer, but then her casting never materialized.\n\nIt was never explained why she opted not to do the show. Now, Martinez explains that her relationship with Leonard \u2014 and their forthcoming bundle of joy \u2014 got in the way.\n\n\u201cI think pregnancy is better than Bachelor in Paradise,\u201d she says. \u201cAlthough I\u2019m probably equally as sweaty, exhausted, nauseous, stressed out and emotional, at least I don\u2019t have to worry about finding a man. I already have that one covered.\u201d\n\nMartinez made headlines back in February when she appeared on a missing persons list while The Bachelor was still airing. Martinez\u2019s mother reported her missing, telling police in November 2017 that she hadn\u2019t communicated with her daughter after she supposedly left to work on a marijuana farm. Martinez later clarified the situation during an appearance on Jimmy Kimmel Live!.\n\n\u201cI just decided to go to the mountains with my friends for a couple weeks [after filming The Bachelor] and I was there for six or seven days without phone service, which I thought I was going to have phone service and I told my mother that I would,\u201d she explained at the time. \u201cI just had this weird feeling on the sixth or seventh day. \u2018I need to go home now.\u2019 So, I got in my car, drove to where I had service, called my parents and then come to find out [that] only 12 hours before, my mother had called the Humboldt Sheriff\u2019s Department saying that I was missing.\u201d\n\nDuring her chat with PureWow, Martinez joked that she plans to keep her child out of the spotlight to avoid drama: \u201cI don\u2019t really want my child to get reported missing on a weed farm.\u201d\n\nMartinez also made headlines in August when sexual harassment claims surfaced against Bachelor in Paradise star Leo Dottavio, who appeared on Becca Kufrin\u2019s recent season of The Bachelorette.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jordan_jenna_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/jordan_jenna_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/style/bekah-martinez-bachelor-star-pregnant-first-child-1142596/", "title": "\u2018Bachelor\u2019 Star Bekah Martinez Pregnant With Her First Child", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "'Bachelor' star Bekah Martinez is pregnant and expecting her first child with boyfriend Grayston Leonard.
