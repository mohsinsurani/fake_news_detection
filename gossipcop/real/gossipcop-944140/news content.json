He never wasn\u2019t, and he never will not be. People that knew him really well say they see him in me, that it\u2019s almost scary.\u201d\n\nHer older brother, Prince Michael Jackson, agrees.\n\n\u201cBasically, as a person, she is who my dad is. The only thing that\u2019s different would be her age and her gender,\u201d he told the magazine, adding that Paris is like their dad \u201cin all of her strengths, and almost all of her weaknesses as well. She\u2019s very passionate. She is very emotional to the point where she can let emotion cloud her judgment.\u201d", "images":
