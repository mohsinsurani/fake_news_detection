He goes, 'Yeah, I saw a headline. Your wife said your kids walked in on you having sex.' I don't even know that she told that story! I don't know what version she told of it.\"\n\nBut when Kimmel asked it was true, Shepard responded, \"Ish.\"\n\nActors Kristen Bell and Dax Shepard backstage at the People's Choice Awards 2017 at Microsoft Theater on Jan. 18, 2017 in Los Angeles.

That would have been a strange nap.\"\n\nAhem.", "images":
