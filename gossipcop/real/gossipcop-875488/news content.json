{"url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/business/consumer/gwyneth-paltrow-s-goop-accused-making-deceptive-health-claims-n796551", "text": "The watchdog group Truth in Advertising wants Goop, the lifestyle website started by actress Gwyneth Paltrow, to stop making what it calls \u201cunsubstantiated\u201d and \u201cdeceptive\u201d advertising claims for some of the health and wellness products it sells. And it filed a formal complaint last week asking authorities in California to force the company to do that.\n\nTINA said it investigated more than 50 products sold on the site in which \u201cthe company claims, either expressly or implicitly, that its products \u2013 or third-party products that it promotes \u2013 can treat, cure, prevent, alleviate the symptoms of, or reduce the risk of developing a number of ailments, ranging from depression, anxiety and insomnia, to infertility, uterine prolapse and arthritis, just to name a few.\u201d\n\nBonnie Patten, TINA\u2019s executive director, told NBC News she was \u201csurprised at the level of deception\u201d they found.\n\n\u201cOur concern is that Goop is using disease treatment claims to market products that it has no reliable scientific evidence to prove they can do the things they are saying, as is required by law,\u201d Patten said. \u201cThey're making claims that crystals can treat infertility or soap can treat acne, eczema and psoriasis. They have perfumes that they claim have ingredients that heal diseased lungs and improve memory. You name it, they've got something for you.\u201d\n\nTINA contacted Goop about its concerns on August 11 and asked it to remove the offending advertising claims within a week. After 10 days, only a few changes had been made, Patten said, so last week Patten decided it \u201cwas in the best interests of consumers\u201d to file a complaint with the California Food and Drug and Medical Device Task Force.\n\n\"They're making claims about products for which there is absolutely no science to support those claims.\u201d\n\nThere\u2019s no shortage of sites making questionable or bogus health claims. So why did TINA decide to investigate Goop?\n\n\u201cIt's a very high-profile site, and a lot of women have turned to its empowerment message and purchased its products,\u201d Patten told NBC News.\n\nGoop responded to TINA\u2019s accusations with this statement:\n\n\u201cGoop is dedicated to introducing unique products and offerings and encouraging constructive conversation surrounding new ideas. We are receptive to feedback and consistently seek to improve the quality of the products and information referenced on our site. We responded promptly and in good faith to the initial outreach from representatives of TINA and hoped to engage with them to address their concerns. Unfortunately, they provided limited information and made threats under arbitrary deadlines which were not reasonable under the circumstances. Nevertheless, while we believe that TINA\u2019s description of our interactions is misleading and their claims unsubstantiated and unfounded, we will continue to evaluate our products and our content and make those improvements that we believe are reasonable and necessary in the interests of our community of users.\u201d\n\nA Second Opinion\n\nThe Goop website tells visitors: \u201cWe test the waters so that you don\u2019t have to. We will never recommend something that we don\u2019t love, and think worthy of your wallets and your time.\u201d\n\nBut Dr. John Swartzberg, head of the editorial board at the UC Berkeley Wellness Letter, believes people who buy some of the wellness products sold on Goop are \u201cwasting their money\u201d and possibly risking their health.\n\nNBC News asked Swartzberg to look at the products flagged by TINA. He called the site \u201cirresponsible\u201d and said he was \u201castounded\u201d by the various health claims made \u2013 some of which he believed were possibly or probably illegal.\n\n\u201cPeople are really being deceived by what they're advertising on Goop. They're making claims about products for which there is absolutely no science to support those claims,\u201d Swartzberg said. \u201cAt best, people who buy these products will spend an awful lot of money for something that's not going to be any help at all. At worst, they're going to put things in their bodies that potentially could be harmful.\u201d\n\nNot the First Time\n\nGoop recently agreed to voluntarily, but permanently discontinue advertising claims made for \u201cMoon Juice,\u201d \u201cBrain Dust,\u201d and \u201cSex Dust\u201d supplements after a complaint was filed with the National Advertising Division of the Council of Better Business Bureaus.\n\nNAD noted that Moon Juice was featured as a recipe ingredient in the GP Morning Smoothie. \u201cGwyneth drinks one of these every morning, whether or not she\u2019s detoxing,\u201d the site said. \u201cChoose your Moon Juice moon dust depending on what the day ahead holds\u2026 brain dust before a long day at the office, sex dust before a date, etc.\u201d\n\nIn its news release NAD noted that \u201can advertiser has an obligation to insure that the claims it makes for the product are truthful, accurate, and not misleading\u201d \u2014 something that apparently did not happen in this case.\n\nEarlier this year, critics blasted Goop for selling the jade egg, a stone shaped like an egg that\u2019s meant to be inserted in the vagina. The jade egg ($66) is supposed to result in better sex and better health.\n\nIn an article warning women not to do this, the Huffington Post quoted Dr. Maria Isabel Rodriguez, an assistant professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Oregon Health & Science University.\n\n\"I cannot think of a single reason why inserting a large, heavy stone object into the vagina would improve one\u2019s sex life,\u201d she told the Huffington Post. \u201cThe vagina and the rest of our reproductive organs are actually quite smart at regulating themselves and need no interference from douches, jade eggs, or Gwyneth Paltrow.\u201d\n\nDr. Rodriguez warned that using the egg could cause vaginal infection and trauma.\n\nEarlier this year, Goop got called out for the claims made for Body Vibes, wearable stickers ($64 for a 2-pack) that are supposed to \u201cpromote healing\u201d and create \u201ca calming effect\u201d by rebalancing the energy frequency in our bodies.\n\nGoop said the stickers were made with \u201cthe same conductive carbon material NASA uses to line space suits so they can monitor an astronaut\u2019s vitals during wear.\u201d But that wasn\u2019t true.\n\nGizmodo ran a story in late June that said NASA spacesuits \u201cdo not have any conductive carbon material lining.\u201d Mark Shelhamer, former chief scientist at NASA\u2019s human research division, called the marketing claim \u201ca load of BS\u201d and told Gizmodo the whole premise was \u201clike snake oil.\u201d\n\nA few days after that story was published, Goop removed the spacesuit claim, but it still sells the stickers and still touts their energy-balancing properties.\n\nHerb Weisbaum is The ConsumerMan.
