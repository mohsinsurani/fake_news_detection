Oh, and James and Jax Taylor are actually getting along now too, which is equally blowing our minds.\n\nUnfortunately, there's tension in other relationships, such as with Stassi Schroeder and her now-ex-boyfriend Patrick Meagher, who you can catch a glimpse of in the above supertease. Jax's relationship with girlfriend Brittany Cartwright is rocked after a shocking accusation against the SUR bartender. (By the way, Kristen Doute will be more focused on trying to break Jax and Brittany up rather than on her own relationship with Brian Carter.) There even seems to be trouble in paradise for Tom Sandoval and Ariana Madix.\n\n\n\n\n\nBut this season will also be about new beginnings. We'll see Lisa Vanderpump move ahead with opening another restaurant with Tom Sandoval and Tom Schwartz, a plan that she proposed to the pair last season. Scheana Marie will begin a new chapter after deciding to end her marriage with Mike Shay last season, allowing her to start up a romance with former flame Rob Valletta.\n\nThere will also be a lot of fun in store for the Vanderpump Rules crew this season, including costume parties, Pride festivities, and an unforgettable return to Mexico.\n\nGet your first look at Season 6 by watching the full supertease, above. Be sure to tune in for the most jaw-dropping season ofVanderpump Rules yet on Monday, December 4 at 9/8c.\n\nCatch up on last season, below.", "images":
