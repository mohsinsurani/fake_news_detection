Long before Markle and her betrothed told the world about their romance, she told her \"Suits\" pals about it.\n\n\"I got the news early, and I was like, 'You've got to be kidding me,'\" Hoffman said. \"It was like both of us in the trailer, just kind of like, 'Oh! You're dating a prince?!' You know, I was just like, 'Take it slow, be careful \u2014 don't let him hurt you.'\"\n\nThat last bit was deadpan humor, but Torres said they were all serious when it came to keeping tight-lipped about the happy news.\n\n\"We knew she was excited, and there was reason to keep it close to the vest,\" she added.\n\nOf course, that's just the sort of thing anyone would do for a friend \u2014 especially one so close.\n\nRick Hoffman, Patrick J.

We were with each other for longer than we went to college or high school with our friends. We became family in a way \u2014 we're still family. So this is a wonderful family affair.\"\n\nHoffman is grateful to have her in the family, too, since years before Markle's own wedding plans, she helped him out in a pinch at another wedding.\n\n\"I'll give you an idea (of how great she is),\" he said. \"So I was in a relationship that didn't work out, and I had to go to a wedding in Paris. ... I was dateless, and Meghan was like, 'Do you want me to come with you?' I was like, 'Yeah, that would awesome.' We had the producer schedule our schedules off. Meghan and I had the best week.\"\n\nBut their time together on \"Suits\" is now over. Markle and her on-screen other half, actor Patrick J. Adams, left the show at the end of last season.\n\n\"'Suits' continues, and (their characters) Mike and Rachel are really still there \u2014 their spirits are still there,\" Rafferty said.\n\n\"They were really the major artery of the show, and now we have to sort of regenerate another artery,\" Hoffman added. \"We're working on it.\"\n\n20 photos Slideshow Meghan Markle Meghan Markle through the
