Cindy Crawford and husband Rande Gerber are thrilled their pal George Clooney is going to finally be a dad \u2014 but they\u2019re not sure he\u2019ll be on diaper duty.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m very excited,\u201d the supermodel told E! News on Thursday, March 16. The Hollywood star and international human rights lawyer are expecting twins this summer. \u201cI think it\u2019s incredible for George and it really took Amal, I think,\u201d said Crawford, a longtime friend of the actor\u2019s. \u201cShe\u2019s just so amazing and they\u2019re just so happy. It just seemed like a natural step.\u201d\n\nThe 51-year-old revealed she\u2019d suspected as soon as George introduced them to Amal that they\u2019d end up walking down the aisle. \u201cIt was like all of a sudden he might get married and he might have a family.\u2026 We\u2019re very excited for them,\u201d she said.\n\nBut businessman Gerber, who shares tequila company Casamigos with the Ocean\u2019s Eleven star, joked of the actor-director: \u201cI\u2019m not sure he\u2019ll be changing diapers.\u201d\n\nNews that the famous couple were expecting their first children came when their close friend Julie Chen confirmed they were expecting on her show The Talk in early February. Amal wed the former ER star and longtime bachelor in a lavish ceremony in Venice, Italy, in 2014.\n\nThe 36-year-old, who is due in the summer, showed off her baby bump as the couple stepped out for the Cesar Awards in Paris on February 24, when George received an Honorary Cesar Award at the event, often dubbed \u201cFrance\u2019s Oscars.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rande-cindy-crawford-11c7959d-a809-492c-a687-7b65d6acd17f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1843px%2C968px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rande-cindy-crawford-11c7959d-a809-492c-a687-7b65d6acd17f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1843px%2C968px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Caitlin O'Toole"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cindy-crawford-rande-gerber-very-excited-for-clooney-twins-w472663/", "title": "Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber 'Very Excited' for Clooney Twins", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber shared their excitement over pal and business partner George Clooney and wife Amal\u2019s baby news \u2014 see what they said.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber 'Very Excited' for Clooney Twins", "description": "Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber shared their excitement over pal and business partner George Clooney and wife Amal\u2019s baby news \u2014 see what they said.", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/cindy-crawford-rande-gerber-very-excited-for-clooney-twins-w472663/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2017-12-07T03:08:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rande-cindy-crawford-11c7959d-a809-492c-a687-7b65d6acd17f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1843px%2C968px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rande-cindy-crawford-11c7959d-a809-492c-a687-7b65d6acd17f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1843px%2C968px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-03-17T21:40:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-12-07T03:08:19+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cindy Crawford, Rande Gerber 'Very Excited' for Clooney Twins", "description": "Cindy Crawford and Rande Gerber shared their excitement over pal and business partner George Clooney and wife Amal\u2019s baby news \u2014 see what they said.", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/backup/rande-cindy-crawford-11c7959d-a809-492c-a687-7b65d6acd17f.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1843px%2C968px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1489786800.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
