Everyone needs to check it out.\n\nWaddell and Roper did a photoshoot with both of their baby girls over the weekend and the results are adorable. The friends each shared some behind the scenes pictures of them with their little girls, Isabella and Emerson, as well as Waddell\u2019s husband Evan Bass via Instagram Story.\n\n\"So Carly and I are doing a photo shoot with Emerson and Bella today,\u201d shared Roper.\n\nNot long after she posted her first story, Roper once again took to social media to share a video of her friend, as well as showcase the talented photographer Brandon Chesbro who was doing the photoshoot for them.\n\n\u201cThis is like a fairy tale,\" she shared along with a video of Waddell and baby Isabella under a tree.\n\nThe ladies weren\u2019t the only ones using social media to share stories for the event. Bass was more than happy to show off his ladylove and her friend in a video belting out the tune \u2018Kiss the Girl\u2019. The new moms were singing the song from the Disney classic The Little Mermaid to their beautiful babies. In his video, Evans jokingly asked his followers to send him help.\n\nCarly Waddell and Jade Roper not only met each other on Bachelor In Paradise, but they each met their husbands on the show, as well. Roper married Tanner Tolbert in 2016 and baby Emerson was born in August 2017. Waddell married Bass summer of 2017. Their wedding was featured on last summer's Bachelor In Paradise. They welcomed baby Isabella in February.\n\nSome couples that meet on the ABC reality TV show actually do make it work, and not all of the ladies hate each other. Proof of that is in Waddell and Roper\u2019s friendship. Not only are they experiencing first-time motherhood together, they are also sharing their journey on a new podcast called Babes and Babies.\n\nBachelor In Paradise alums Roper and Waddell decided to do a joint photoshoot with their daughters outside Nashville over the weekend. Here is hoping these two mamas decide to share more of their amazing pictures with their followers, because seriously we can\u2019t get enough!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-colored-light.53763959.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/carly-waddell-evan-bass-.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-colored-light.051eb8af.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-colored-light.8d65e7f9.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://www.babygaga.com/public/build/images/re-logo-full-colored-light.4b543c53.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/carly-waddell-evan-bass-.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bg Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126/https://www.babygaga.com/jade-roper-carly-waddell-baby-photoshoot/", "title": "Check Out Jade Roper & Carly Waddell's Baby Photoshoot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "description": "Jade Roper and Carly Waddell did a joint photoshoot just outside of Nashville over the weekend and shared behind-the-scenes action on Instagram.", "og": {"title": "Check Out Jade Roper & Carly Waddell's Baby Photoshoot", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/carly-waddell-evan-bass-.jpg", "width": 1710, "height": 900}, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126/https://www.babygaga.com/jade-roper-carly-waddell-baby-photoshoot/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "Jade Roper and Carly Waddell did a joint photoshoot just outside of Nashville over the weekend and shared behind-the-scenes action on Instagram.", "site_name": "BabyGaga"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-04-02T17:45:27Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-02T17:45:27Z", "section": "Parenting News", "author": "BG Staff", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/babygaga"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@babygaga", "title": "Check Out Jade Roper & Carly Waddell's Baby Photoshoot", "description": "Jade Roper and Carly Waddell did a joint photoshoot just outside of Nashville over the weekend and shared behind-the-scenes action on Instagram.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220822172126im_/https://static0.babygagaimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/carly-waddell-evan-bass-.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 270407583294564}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522691127.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
