Isn't he like 11 years old?\" Jimmy Kimmel asked Chopra on the show.\n\n\"We were both wearing Ralph Lauren and we decided to go together. I didn't ask his age. Eleven? I didn't know that,\" the star responded. \"Yeah, we were on the same table and we already know each other. So he was like, 'Hey, you wanna go together?' And I was like 'Yeah, okay, let's go together.' It ended up working out.\"\n\nPhoto Credit: Getty / Jackson Lee", "images": ["https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/jpeg-20036771.jpeg", "https://media.popculture.com/2018/06/chopra-20036770.jpeg", "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/28/cd03c760-9ade-439d-92fc-2dfef031097a/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-20036769.jpg?width=1200"], "top_img": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/28/cd03c760-9ade-439d-92fc-2dfef031097a/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-20036769.jpg?width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/nick-jonas-swoons-priyanka-chopra-smile-romance-rumors-heat-up/", "title": "Nick Jonas Swoons Over Priyanka Chopra's 'Smile' as Romance Rumors Heat Up", "meta_data": {"description": "Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra may not have officially commented on rumors regarding their [...]", "keywords": "Social Media,Celebrity News,Celebrities,Instagram,Priyanka Chopra,Nick Jonas", "news_keywords": "Social Media,Celebrity News,Celebrities,Instagram,Priyanka Chopra,Nick Jonas", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "PopCulture", "creator": "PopCulture", "title": "Nick Jonas Swoons Over Priyanka Chopra's 'Smile' as Romance Rumors Heat Up", "description": "Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra may not have officially commented on rumors regarding their [...]", "image": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/28/cd03c760-9ade-439d-92fc-2dfef031097a/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-20036769.jpg?width=1200"}, "og": {"title": "Nick Jonas Swoons Over Priyanka Chopra's 'Smile' as Romance Rumors Heat Up", "type": "article", "url": "https://popculture.com/celebrity/news/nick-jonas-swoons-priyanka-chopra-smile-romance-rumors-heat-up/", "image": {"identifier": "https://sportshub.cbsistatic.com/i/2021/03/28/cd03c760-9ade-439d-92fc-2dfef031097a/nick-jonas-priyanka-chopra-20036769.jpg?width=1200", "width": 660, "height": 360}, "site_name": "Celebrity", "description": "Nick Jonas and Priyanka Chopra may not have officially commented on rumors regarding their [...]"}, "fb": {"app_id": 398373180287205, "pages": 1075190092524035}, "google-site-verification": "iPoSsgn-BS2aFT9iphBFS8eF6I23H2Le3DRVOCodjJg", "p": {"domain_verify": "c711bf7a7a8040f2b74003958afd81d4"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=0", "theme-color": "#263240", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528066800.0, "source": "https://popculture.com", "summary": ""}
