Following his July DUI arrest and the enduring a slew of painful headlines which questioned the state of his health, the singer reached out to the show for help.\n\n\u201cI think Aaron is here today for one reason. He\u2019s hoping to feel better about his life, his health,\u201d ER physician Dr. Travis Stork says.\n\nThe singer reveals he been the subject of repeated body-shaming with some people saying he appears to have cancer or AIDS and some question if he\u2019s using hard drugs. Regarding his small stature and weight, he tells us, \u201cWhy am I so thin? Acid reflux, [and a] hiatal hernia.\u201d\n\nWatch: The Doctors discuss Aaron Carters Critical Health\n\nWe sent the singer to see Gastroenterologist Dr. Jorge Rodriguez in hopes of getting to the bottom of his health issues.\n\n\u201cI just get made fun of a lot for how I look\u2026 because I\u2019m gaunt and I\u2019m skinny,\u201d he tells Dr. Rodriguez. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about my overall health because people tell me I look like I have AIDS or I look like I have cancer, or I look like I\u2019m dying.\u201d\n\nWhen asked about drugs use, he says, \u201c\u201cI do not do any cocaine, I do not do any meth, everyone always calls me a crack head and a meth head, whether it\u2019s news outlets, blogs, they are body-shaming me every day. He goes on to reveal, \u201cI\u2019ve never smoked crack in my life, I\u2019ve never smoked meth in my life. I tried cocaine when I was like 16.\u201d Aaron is prescribed a variety of medications by his doctor, including Xanax, Klonopin, oxycodone to treat his fractured jaw, fractured kneecap, and pain associated with his rigorous performance routines.\n\nThe star also shares, \u201cI haven\u2019t always been the safest sexually\u201d and is concerned about the possibility of having an STD along with dealing with anxiety and stress.\n\nWatch: Aaron Carter Wants to Set the Record Straight\n\nDr. Rodriguez orders an upper endoscopy and a complete battery of blood tests including an HIV test, STD panel, and a liver kidney and thyroid check. Aaron is also given a hair follicle drug test. Additionally, Aaron gets chest x-rays from radiologist Dr. Daniel Cousin of Bayview Radiology.\n\nAaron tells The Doctors, \u201cI take my drugs as needed\u2026. Do I feel like I\u2019m in control of [my prescription drugs]? Absolutely, I do. It\u2019s in moderation, it\u2019s as needed. It\u2019s not to get high.\u201d\n\nWhile he says he feels in control of his prescription drug use, the death of his sister Leslie Carter, who died from an overdose of prescription meds in 2012, weighs heavily on him. \u201cOf course it scares me, but it scares me to the point to not make the wrong decision,\u201d he says.\n\nWatch: Aaron Carter Opens up about His Sexuality\n\nDuring Aaron\u2019s appearance, the results of this drugs test are revealed. Dr. Stork says that while his tests for cocaine and meth both come back negative, he does test positive for THC (marijuana) benzodiazepines (Xanax) and opiates (oxycodone). The combination of taking benzodiazepines and opiates, which can lead to an accidental death, is concerning to The Doctors and psychiatrist Dr. Domenick Sportelli, who was also brought in to work with the singer.\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re an anxious person, you\u2019re driving a speeding car that\u2019s out of control, totally out of control. I give you a benzo, it\u2019s like letting you put on the brakes to that car for a little while, but in a couple of hours that car is going to be out of control again,\u201d Dr. Sportelli explains. \u201cYou need to learn how to drive the car. I don\u2019t just want to give you a break. I want to teach you how to drive the car.\u201d\n\nWatch: Web Exclusive: Aaron Carter's Alarming Personal Training Session\n\nAppearing receptive to this approach, Aaron says, \u201cI look forward to being able to drive that car.\" Adding, \u201cI don\u2019t want to be on these [drugs]\u2026 I find myself getting them off the streets just to get them.\u201d\n\nRead More with Aaron Carter: Singer Talks July DUI Arrest\n\nRead More with Aaron Carter: The Singer\u2019s Emotional Family Revelations\n\nRead More with Aaron Carter: Singer Opens Up About Being Attracted to Men and Women\n\nSee Part 2 of The Doctors exclusive sit-down with Aaron Carter on September 14", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://ssl.gstatic.com/images/icons/gplus-32.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=8628780&c3=8628780&c4=http://www.thedoctorstv.com&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://badges.instagram.com/static/images/ig-badge-view-24.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/playbutton.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/uparrow-26660d05b788d6ed726d8ab4c8c50178.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTcvMDkvMTIvMTAwMDcuU3ViLjE0LmpwZyJdXQ/10007.Sub.14.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/full-cast-f04d7cfd627529894280e09f0e6ab0eb.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/gray_arrow-82fe71d6bddc83b674c667cc3adcd313.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/clock-c224f742e347ad6c375c4afe0ae497aa.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/doctorslogo-8edc676f5bb4e79442674f1fcdf0961e.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/bars.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/footerPulse-369b484fcf3214ba8e1c3003ce930c48.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/doctorslogo.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/bottomArrowBlueLine-f5002f231dd18940f8bfcf47824200ea.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/assets/footerlogo-c4de0fe3373d1c9f17b62ca740b9496e.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745im_/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/system/images/W1siZiIsIjIwMTcvMDkvMTIvMTAwMDcuU3ViLjE0LmpwZyJdXQ/10007.Sub.14.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170914110745/http://www.thedoctorstv.com/articles/4273-exclusive-aaron-carter-s-health-issues-revealed", "title": "Exclusive: Aaron Carter\u2019s Health Issues Revealed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "google-site-verification": "PTIjElD06zLQ9AQMHGKtSeZXudXfRMQyA1bTpVmoEY0", "description": "Aaron Carter has come to The Doctors in hopes of solving his many health issues.
