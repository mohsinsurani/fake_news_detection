Between her penchant for retro fanny packs and her obsession with statement shoes (thigh-highs, transparent booties\u2014you name it, she\u2019s tried it!), the supermodel has a healthy appetite for the most tricky-to-pull-off trends; in fact, she\u2019s been responsible for setting a few of them in motion. It certainly makes the prospect of peeking inside her closet\u2014with Google Daydream\u2019s 360-degree technology, no less\u2014even more intriguing. The supermodel has not one but two wardrobes inside her apartment in Los Angeles, and invited Vogue in for the grand tour earlier this summer.\n\nThe first closet, a traditional walk-in, is packed to the rafters with weird and wonderful fashion treasures: Think 7-inch Ala\u00efa stompers given to her by her brother-in-law, Kanye West; the Birkin bag she uses as a carry-on; the hilarious novelty-print onesies that the Kardashian-Jenners like to wear every year during the holidays. More of a fitting room than a closet, the second space is where all the fun happens, where Jenner puts together her most daring and unexpected outfits; there\u2019s even a colorful mood board of fashion inspiration. Here you\u2019ll find trophy pieces of the coolest kind, including those bubblegum pink Balenciaga legging boots; the teeniest, tiniest Louis Vuitton bags; and rare vintage Vivienne Westwood finds. Then, of course, there are all those priceless archive looks\u2014remember the chain-mail dress Jenner wore on her 21st birthday, or that body-skimming number on the Met Gala red carpet last year? See Jenner unpack those fashion memories, while scanning every nook and cranny of her space, in the 360-degree video, above.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5991f5026ef75c55b036a0b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-kendall-closet.jpg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/image/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632a00cca50112cdb12ead28/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6320a658865823be1b681c82/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6320e23f0a8e0a2d00bab485/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/609eadba3150cbc8d304e13c/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202021-05-14%2520at%252012.38.43%2520PM.png", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/633a6cf9e15addd21b68038a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632cc576682912b849a990c1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5991f5026ef75c55b036a0b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-kendall-closet.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Chioma Nnadi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-closet-google-daydream-360-degrees", "title": "Experience Kendall Jenner\u2019s Closet in 360 Degrees", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Step inside Kendall Jenner's closet and scan every nook and cranny of the supermodel's two (yes, two) closets.", "id": "5991afa248f10d45959bced3", "keywords": "kendall jenner", "news_keywords": "kendall jenner", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5991afa248f10d45959bced3", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Step inside Kendall Jenner's closet and scan every nook and cranny of the supermodel's two (yes, two) closets.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5991f50048f10d45959bcf10/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/00-tout-kendall-closet.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5991f50048f10d45959bcf10/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/00-tout-kendall-closet.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5991f5026ef75c55b036a0b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-kendall-closet.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Experience Kendall Jenner\u2019s Closet in 360 Degrees", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/kendall-jenner-closet-google-daydream-360-degrees"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-08-15T13:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-15T13:00:00.000Z", "author": "Chioma Nnadi"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5991f5026ef75c55b036a0b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/00-social-tout-kendall-closet.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Experience Kendall Jenner\u2019s Closet in 360 Degrees"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502802000.0, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
