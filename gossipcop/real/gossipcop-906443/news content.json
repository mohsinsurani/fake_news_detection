The queen was presenting a Bible she signed to a 10-year-old student who won a contest for the best religious studies project at her school when the funny exchange took place.\n\nThe 91-year-old monarch asked the student if she \u201clooked after\u201d her younger sister. The girl\u2019s mom jumped in saying: \u201cIt\u2019s the other way around,\" according to the Daily Mail.\n\nThe queen replied, \u201cIt\u2019s like that with Charlotte and George,\u201d noting how the 2-year-old princess keeps a watchful eye over her older brother, the prince.\n\nBossy Princess Charlotte? Quite so, says Queen Elizabeth! The Duchess of Cambridge / EPA\n\nAccording to the father of the lucky student, who won the same prize as his daughter in 1990, Charlotte's inclination to watch over her older brother is typical sibling behavior.\n\n\"It is often the case that a younger child is more confident,\" he said at the event. \"It is second child syndrome.\"\n\nPrincess Charlotte looks out fro the balcony of Buckingham Palace with her brother and parents during last year's Trooping the Colour parade.

Last year, the Duchess of Cambridge reportedly told a fellow mom that her daughter Charlotte was \u201cthe one in charge\u201d at home.\n\nAnd last fall, Prince William The Duke of Cambridge, her father, joked that his daughter is \u201cgoing to be trouble when she gets older.\u201d\n\nThe young princess, who recently started nursery school, will get plenty of chances to look after her big brother when their parents head to Sweden and Norway for a four-day visit later this month.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_39/1284858/charlotte-june-17-2017-01.JPG", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-600x300,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_02/1309708/ss-180110-charlotte-tease.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_pop_charlotte_180116_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2018_02/1309214/charlotte-today-180118-inline2_15952e03d74053310a9e5cd35d06ad9e.fit-760w.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_03/1310730/george-charlotte-today-tease-180116.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201801/tdy_pop_charlotte_180111_1920x1080.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_03/1310730/george-charlotte-today-tease-180116.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eun Kyung Kim", "Kensington Palace Via Epa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/news/princess-charlotte-looks-after-big-brother-prince-george-queen-reveals-t121234", "title": "Princess Charlotte is the boss at home, the queen reveals", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/news/princess-charlotte-looks-after-big-brother-prince-george-queen-reveals-t121234", "title": "Princess Charlotte is the boss at home, the queen reveals", "description": "Who's the boss?
