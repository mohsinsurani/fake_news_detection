Super stubborn,\u201d the doctor joked referring to the multiple attempts to get him to shift his position.\n\n\u201cHe gets it from his mom,\u201d quipped Portwood\u2019s boyfriend, Andrew Glennon. \u201cI have three sisters so I thought it would be a girl for some reason. But this is great, this is fantastic.\u201d\n\nAn ecstatic Portwood let out an audible gasp and clapped her hands together. And daughter Leah, 9, (with ex Gary Shirley) is just as excited that boy will be joining the family. Shirley and his wife Kristina, however, have some reservations.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s always said, like, that was on her Christmas list, she wanted a baby brother, she wanted a baby brother but she put it like from us\u201d Kristina told Shirley. \u201cI\u2019m like, you\u2019re not going to get a baby form us. She hasn\u2019t spent a lot of time with her mom since she\u2019s been pregnant.\u201d\n\nShirley agreed and mentioned Portwood\u2019s ex fiance Matt Baier, who she split with in August. \u201cShe\u2019s getting used to Andrew too. A lot of changes. Leah, she went through a lot because, Matt is out of the picture. He was her buddy, who she did a lot with,\u201d he said. \u201cThen her mom wasn\u2019t coming around. Then Andrew comes into the pictures, three weeks later, she\u2019s pregnant. It\u2019s like a lot to take in for her. It\u2019s quite a bit.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly broke the news in November that the MTV personality is expecting her first child with the cinematographer.\n\n\u201cWhen I first found out, I was a little scared,\u201d the 16 and Pregnant alum told Us that month. \u201cI just kind of sat down and thought about it and realized that it was a big step in my life and it was a good thing actually, and I was really happy within 30 minutes.\u201d\n\nPortwood and Glennon met in the summer of 2017 while she was filming Marriage Boot Camp with Baier.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Paula Abrahamson"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-amber-portwood-learns-sex-of-baby-no-2-watch/", "title": "Pregnant Amber Portwood Learns Sex of Baby No. 2: Watch", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Pregnant Amber Portwood learned the sex of her baby on the Monday, February 19, episode of 'Teen Mom\u2019 \u2014 watch her reaction", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Watch Pregnant Amber Portwood Learn the Sex of Her Baby", "description": "Pregnant Amber Portwood learned the sex of her baby on the Monday, February 19, episode of 'Teen Mom\u2019 \u2014 watch her reaction", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-amber-portwood-learns-sex-of-baby-no-2-watch/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-20T15:47:23+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-02-20T15:47:23+00:00"}, "author": "Rachel Paula Abrahamson", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Watch Pregnant Amber Portwood Learn the Sex of Her Baby", "description": "Pregnant Amber Portwood learned the sex of her baby on the Monday, February 19, episode of 'Teen Mom\u2019 \u2014 watch her reaction", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/amber-portwood-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C201px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@rachelpaula", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1519141643.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
