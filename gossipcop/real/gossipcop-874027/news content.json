The Cromwell family from the classic \u201990s Disney Channel Original Movie Halloweentown about a grandmother who takes her grandchildren away for an adventure in Halloweentown, where, if you didn\u2019t know, Halloween is celebrated all year long.At a festival this week, Marnie (Kimberly J. Brown), Sophie (Emily Roeske), Dylan (J. Paul Zimmerman), and Gwen (Judith Hoag) returned to Halloweentown \u2014 and they didn\u2019t even have to worry about Kalabar.\n\n\u201cThe fam bam is back together!\u201d Brown captioned a sweet Instagram post of the Cromwells at the annual Spirit of Halloweentown festival in St. Helen, Oregon, where the first movie was shot.\n\nSadly though, the magical matriarch of the family wasn\u2019t there. Debbie Reynolds, who played Grandma Aggie in the original movie and all three subsequent sequels, died almost a year ago. The reunited cast members all lovingly shared memories of their on-screen grandmother to a crowd of fans.\n\n\u201cThis movie would not be the lasting Halloween tradition that it is without all of you,\u201d Hoag, who played Reynolds\u2019 daughter, said to the crowd, Comicbook reports. \u201cIt was an honor to do these movies and it was a huge honor to work with the absolutely incredible, iconic, unbelievable, creative, talented Debbie Reynolds.\u201d\n\nWhen Brown first announced the family reunion, she teased that there would be a special tribute to the friendliest witch there ever was when the family came together, saying, \u201cWe wanted to do a special tribute to her and her role as Grandma Aggie and have a small monument set up there for her, so we\u2019re going to do that this year during the lighting ceremony.\u201d\n\nCheck out some more photos from the Cromwell family reunion below:", "images": ["https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F07%2F14%2FJosh-Hartnett-The-Faculty-071422.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Few.com%2Fimg%2Fmisc%2F300x250_magazines_and_more.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F05%2FBrett-Goldstein-Hannah-Waddingham-Three-Rounds-080522-2.jpg", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F10%2Fhalloweentown1-2000.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20100%20100'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2022%2F08%2F16%2FBetter-Call-Saul_081622_4.jpg"], "top_img": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F10%2Fhalloweentown1-2000.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Weldon", "October", "At Pm Edt"], "canonical_link": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/19/halloweentown-cast-reunited/", "title": "The cast of Halloweentown reunited to celebrate Debbie Reynolds", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#111", "keywords": "Reunions", "news_keywords": "Reunions", "description": "The cast of the Disney movie shared stories and sweet pictures on Instagram of the reunion at the annual Spirit of Halloweentown festival in Oregon.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"title": "The cast of 'Halloweentown' reunited to celebrate Debbie Reynolds", "type": "article", "site_name": "EW.com", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/19/halloweentown-cast-reunited/", "description": "The cast of the Disney movie shared stories and sweet pictures on Instagram of the reunion at the annual Spirit of Halloweentown festival in Oregon.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F10%2Fhalloweentown1-2000.jpg", "width": 2000, "height": 1000}}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/19/halloweentown-cast-reunited/", "media": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F10%2Fhalloweentown1-2000.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/19/halloweentown-cast-reunited/", "title": "The cast of 'Halloweentown' reunited to celebrate Debbie Reynolds", "description": "The cast of the Disney movie shared stories and sweet pictures on Instagram of the reunion at the annual Spirit of Halloweentown festival in Oregon.", "site": "@ew", "image": "https://imagesvc.meredithcorp.io/v3/mm/image?q=60&c=sc&poi=face&w=2000&h=1000&url=https%3A%2F%2Fstatic.onecms.io%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2Fsites%2F6%2F2018%2F10%2Fhalloweentown1-2000.jpg"}, "fb": {"app_id": 2485718348341688, "pages": 52150999700}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "url": "https://ew.com/tv/2017/10/19/halloweentown-cast-reunited/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508367600.0, "source": "https://ew.com", "summary": ""}
