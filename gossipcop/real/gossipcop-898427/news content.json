In the future, \u201csmart dust\u201d is more likely to be the direction things go\u2013sensors so small that they could be injected undetected.\n\nThe downside to microchipping yourself or you offspring? You could be vulnerable to getting hacked.\n\nAlso Read: Here's Why You Hear That One Song Over and Over in 'Black Mirror'\n\n\u201cU.S.S. Callister\u201d VR game\n\nDid the VR game in this episode remind anyone else of the Oasis in \u201cReady Player One\u201d? If you\u2019ve ever played a game in VR, you understand why Callister would be such a hot company, and why they\u2019d be so busy leading up to Christmas.\n\nYou can already play games with a digital look-alike \u2014 like in NBA 2K, for example. As for a \u201cdigital clone\u201d? Yeah, that exists, too. Scientists have created digital clones of animals, and some have created bots of themselves that can interact with others without their own actual involvement.\n\n\u201cHang the DJ\u201d dating app\n\nThe tech in this episode honestly seems pretty similar to the VR used in \u201cU.S.S. Callister,\u201d but repurposed to learn who your heart desires. And while that tech isn\u2019t quite here, there is such a thing as VR dating.\n\nThe show \u201cVirtually Dating,\u201d a partnership between Cond\u00e9 Nast Entertainment and Facebook, follows couples who are photo-scanned to get a photo-realistic version of themselves and date in virtual reality. This might be way cooler in the future \u2014 imagine falling in love with someone who lived, say, on another continent, all through\n\nVR. Right now, the would-be lovebirds are right next to each other, they just have VR headsets on.\n\nAlso Read: 'Black Mirror' Fans, Rejoice! Netflix Sets Season 4 Release Date for This Year (Video)\n\nThe automated pizza delivery in \u201cCrocodile\u201d\n\nWhen Mia is looking out her hotel room \u2014 just after murdering her ex-boyfriend because he was going to come clean about a previous murder they covered up together 15 years prior \u2014 she sees an automated pizza delivery truck accidentally hit a pedestrian.\n\nThis becomes a storyline throughout the episode for Mia, an insurance agent trying to figure out what happened to her client. Yes, that memory collecting device is crazy, but Domino\u2019s Pizza has already tried out robot pizza delivery in Germany.\n\nThe bot in question, from Starship Technologies, can hold up to five medium pizzas and navigates at four miles per hour using cameras and short-range ultrasonic sensors, according to Wired.", "images":
