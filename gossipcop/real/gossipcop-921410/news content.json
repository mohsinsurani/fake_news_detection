The designer \u2014 who specializes in formal unisex clothing \u2014 ended up making them gossamer white Grecian gowns made of draped silk jersey, inspired by Cate Blanchett\u2019s ethereal elvin character in the \u201cLord of the Rings\u201d films. He also incorporated a cashmere turtleneck for Tortorella to wear under his dress, as well as trousers for both the bride and groom.\n\n\u201cI did try to convince them to incorporate some black in their look,\u201d Morrison says with a laugh, saying that he was surprised they wanted traditional white. \u201cBut in the end [the all-white] was perfect because it created a solid look.\u201d\n\nTortorella called the gowns \u201ctimeless androgynous paraphernalia mimicking Romanesque sculpture that fluidly blends masculine and feminine.\u201d He added, \u201cThe looks are everything we\u2019ve ever dreamed of.\u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/180321-epic-wedding-photos-03.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/180321-epic-wedding-photos-03.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/03/180321-epic-wedding-photos-03.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Raquel Laneri"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/03/21/younger-star-wears-gender-bending-outfit-for-his-polyamorous-queer-wedding/", "title": "\u2018Younger\u2019 star wears gender-bending outfit for his polyamorous queer wedding", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
