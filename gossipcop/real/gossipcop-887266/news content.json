The singer recently told The Cut that her body image influences the way she dresses, which we first read about on StyleCaster.\n\n\"I actually have had the pleasure of a fluctuating body type, where one day I can literally fit into something that is body-con, and then the next day \u2014 the next week \u2014 I need something oversized,\" she told The Cut. \"I need a little crop here and a high-waist there to hide that part, you know?\"\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 11, 2017 at 5:37pm PDT\n\n\"I really pay attention every day when I go into the closet about what's working for my body that morning. I feel like that's how everyone should go after fashion, because it's an individual thing,\" she continued.\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 11, 2017 at 5:11am PDT\n\nThe singer explained that she takes certain factors into account while planning an outfit.\n\n\"If you take it further, it\u2019s like: What week are you having? You having a skinny week? You having a fat week? Are we doing arms this week? We doing legs this week? We doing oversized?\" she said.\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 13, 2017 at 1:59pm PDT\n\nRegardless of how she feels, Rihanna said that she sees fashion as something fun.\n\n\"I love to play with silhouettes as well, but I think it's important to make sure that you wear the thing that works for your body the best, and that's flattering,\" Rihanna explained.\n\nA post shared by badgalriri (@badgalriri) Oct 8, 2017 at 8:05pm PDT\n\nNo matter what she's wearing or how she's feeling, we're obsessed with Rihanna's trendsetting, runway-inspired sense of style.", "images":
