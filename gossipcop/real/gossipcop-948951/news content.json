Confidential,\u201d and Pearce suggests in a new interview with Australian talk show host Andrew Denton that Spacey got inappropriate with him during production. Spacey has been accused of sexual harassment and abuse by serval men, including \u201cStar Trek: Discovery\u201d and \u201cRent\u201d actor Anthony Rapp.\n\nDuring the interview, Pearce was asked about Spacey\u2019s history of abuse and working with the actor early in their careers. Pearce did not want to reveal too much about his experiences with Spacey, but he did imply nonprofessional behavior when he said, \u201cYeah. Tough one to talk about at the moment. Amazing actor, incredible actor. Mmm. Slightly difficult time with Kevin, yeah.\u201d\n\nPearce followed the comment with the following remark, \u201cHe\u2019s a handsy guy. Thankfully I was 29, and not 14.\u201d According to Yahoo Entertainment, Denton\u2019s audience could be heard gasping at Pearce\u2019s revelation.\n\nRelated Kevin Spacey Formally Charged in U.K. for Sexual Assault, Set for Court Thursday\n\nKevin Spacey Charged with Four Counts of Sexual Assault in the U.K. Against Three Men Related The 200 Best Horror Movies of All Time\n\nQuentin Tarantino's Favorite Movies: 40 Films the Director Wants You to See\n\nMonarchy/Regency/Kobal/Shutterstock\n\nPearce\u2019s implication would not be the first time a high profile actor has come forward to reveal Spacey\u2019s behavior on set.
