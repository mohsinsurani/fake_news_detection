Prince Harry secretly traveled to see girlfriend Meghan Markle in Toronto, Canada, to celebrate Easter weekend with the Suits actress, a source tells Us Weekly.\n\n\u201cHe had planned to visit her after she started filming and it will be one of a few trips while she\u2019s working on Suits,\u201d the insider tells Us of Harry\u2019s decision to spend the holiday in Toronto, where Markle, 35, is currently filming season 7 of the USA series. (E! News was the first to report Harry\u2019s visit to Toronto.)\n\nThe source adds: \u201cIt\u2019s been a few weeks since they were last together, one of their longest stints apart, and they were really missing each other.\u201d\n\nHarry\u2019s visit to Toronto comes more than a month after he and Markle attended pal Tom \u201cSkipp\u201d Inskip\u2019s wedding in Jamaica on March 2. An eyewitness told Us that the handsome royal, 32, goofed off and danced for his ladylove at the beachside ceremony.\n\n\u201cAs music started to play, Harry busted out with some dance moves and Meghan looked on adoringly at him,\u201d the insider told Us at the time. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t shy at all about dancing and just stood next to the table snapping his fingers and dancing for her.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Harry and Markle began dating in June of last year. Another source recently told Us that the hunky redhead plans on popping the question in the near future. \u201cThey will be engaged by the end of summer,\u201d the source said, adding that the couple \u201chave spoken candidly about their future. They see a life together.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/prince-harry-meghan-markle-350-84f2bd6d-38ba-4ce8-a6c8-36d14eca798b.jpg?crop=0px%2C15px%2C1543px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/prince-harry-meghan-markle-350-84f2bd6d-38ba-4ce8-a6c8-36d14eca798b.jpg?crop=0px%2C15px%2C1543px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Evan Real"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/prince-harry-secretly-visits-meghan-markle-ahead-of-easter-w476798/", "title": "Prince Harry Secretly Visits Meghan Markle Ahead of Easter", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Prince Harry secretly traveled to see girlfriend Meghan Markle in Toronto, Canada, ahead of Easter, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Prince Harry Secretly Visits Meghan Markle Ahead of Easter", "description": "Prince Harry secretly traveled to see girlfriend Meghan Markle in Toronto, Canada, ahead of Easter, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "url": "/celebrity-news/news/prince-harry-secretly-visits-meghan-markle-ahead-of-easter-w476798/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:16:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/prince-harry-meghan-markle-350-84f2bd6d-38ba-4ce8-a6c8-36d14eca798b.jpg?crop=0px%2C15px%2C1543px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/prince-harry-meghan-markle-350-84f2bd6d-38ba-4ce8-a6c8-36d14eca798b.jpg?crop=0px%2C15px%2C1543px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-14T14:48:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:16:05+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Prince Harry Secretly Visits Meghan Markle Ahead of Easter", "description": "Prince Harry secretly traveled to see girlfriend Meghan Markle in Toronto, Canada, ahead of Easter, a source tells Us Weekly \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/prince-harry-meghan-markle-350-84f2bd6d-38ba-4ce8-a6c8-36d14eca798b.jpg?crop=0px%2C15px%2C1543px%2C810px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=78&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1492181280.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
