Introducing imagined characters into her daughter\u2019s life, like the Big Red Heart Balloon.\n\n\u201cVale will be looking out the window and say, \u2018Mommy, look! It\u2019s the Big Red Heart Balloon!\u2019 \u201d says Guthrie, 45. \u201cShe\n\nhas a vivid imagination, and it comes from storytelling.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

And as an adult, you identify with the tree.\u201d", "images":
