Go back-to-school shopping. \u201cIt\u2019s so fun!\u201d the actress, who will celebrate her 50th birthday next month, tells PEOPLE in a new interview for this week\u2019s issue.\n\nAnd while she doesn\u2019t consider herself much of a shopper for clothes, school supplies are another story. \u201cI always loved back-to-school shopping, and I realize that I still love it,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cBut what we really love to shop for is all the stuff \u2014 the binders, the pencils, the pencil case, the lunch box.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

And now you can be home and be a global citizen. It\u2019s really quite astounding and incredible.\u201d\n\nCalzedonia\n\nThat said, it also means her children are aware of the chaos the world is dealing with, domestically and internationally. The star handles it by addressing it head on. \u201cOur country is not at its best right now, and that can be very discouraging and frustrating,\u201d she says.\n\n\u201cYou have to not give up hope,\u201d she continues. \u201cThis is the time you have to rise as a community and as a household and as a country and try to make voices be heard. And that\u2019s what I have to instill in my children, who are certainly old enough to be aware of politics and things going on in the world.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s very important for my husband and me to be honest with them and help them feel like they still have a voice for the things that they believe in,\u201d Roberts explains.\n\nMike Marsland/WireImage\n\nFROM PEN: Watch Jennifer Lopez Tear Up Remembering Her Twins Being Born\n\n\n\nHer children aren\u2019t the only twins Roberts is raving about at the moment, either. As a close friend of George and Amal Clooney, the Wonderstar says \u201cthey won\u2019t need tips\u201d on parenting their own duo, Alexander and Ella, 3 months.\n\n\u201cI just know when to chuckle to myself,\u201d she adds. \u201cI know when it\u2019s really hard and when it gets easier. But they\u2019re doing great. They\u2019re great parents. I haven\u2019t met [the twins] yet \u2014 I\u2019ve just seen cute, cute pictures! I have a very good present [for them], but since I haven\u2019t sent it, I can\u2019t say what it is.\u201d\n\nRead more from our new interview with Julia Roberts in the latest issue of PEOPLE, on
