At least, it wasn\u2019t equal to what the leading men were raking in.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019m just now to the point where I\u2019m getting paid the same as my male co-stars,\u201d Wood said in a recent interview with Sharon Waxman, TheWrap\u2019s founder and CEO.\n\nAlso Read: 'Westworld' Season 2: It's Gonna Get 'Uncomfortable' for Lee as Maeve's 'Unwilling Hostage' (Video)\n\nWith the sophomore installment about to premiere, Wood found out she was getting a bump for Season 3 equal to the likes of Anthony Hopkins and Ed Harris \u2014 the men of Jonathan Nolan and Lisa Joy\u2019s drama (well, the latter still is, as of that messy freshman year finale).\n\n\u201cI was just told that, you know, \u2018Hey you\u2019re, you\u2019re getting equal pay.\u2019 And I was like [gasp]. And I almost got emotional,\u201d Wood said. \u201cI was like, \u2018I have never been paid the same as my male counterparts \u2026 Never, never.'\u201d\n\n\u201cI found out \u2026 I\u2019m always fighting for that,\u201d Wood added. \u201cAnd I have turned down projects \u2014 \u201cWestworld,\u201d it\u2019s like, I get it a little more,\u201d she said laughing. \u201cIt\u2019s like, \u2018Well, you\u2019re Anthony Hopkins or Ed Harris.\u2019 But I think now we\u2019re all doing equal amounts of work and really hard work.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: 'Westworld' Stars Jimmi Simpson and Simon Quarterman Portraits (Exclusive Photos)\n\nWood said up until now, she has been making \u201cpretty much the same amount of money on things for years.\u201d\n\n\u201cI have not moved,\u201d Wood said. \u201cAnd I\u2019m not saying I\u2019m in like dire straits. I\u2019m very lucky \u2026 It\u2019s more about if you\u2019re getting paid fairly, or the same, or if you\u2019re getting paid less simply because you\u2019re a woman, that\u2019s not fair.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot of politics, but there\u2019s a lot of things that are now being talked about in a different way,\u201d Wood added. \u201cThere is a lot of stuff that goes on behind the scenes. There is a lot of trying to make things equal and trying to make things fair. I don\u2019t know, there is a lot of stuff. But this is the first time that somebody made a point of being like, \u2018Hey you\u2019re getting this. And you deserve it.\u2019 And that was nice.\u201d\n\nEarlier this month, HBO boss Casey Bloys addressed the topic of pay parity at the premium cabler following comments made by an exec who said the bump in salaries the cast of \u201cBig Little Lies\u201d received for Season 2 \u201cshort of raped\u201d the network.\n\nAlso Read: 'Westworld' Season 2: It's Gonna Get 'Uncomfortable' for Lee as Maeve's 'Unwilling Hostage' (Video)\n\n\u201cOne of the things that\u2019s come out of thinking about the movement and some conversations with Reese [Witherspoon], who\u2019s really at the forefront, is something we\u2019ve done recently,\u201d Bloys told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cWe\u2019ve proactively gone through all of our shows \u2014 in fact, we just finished our process where we went through and made sure that there were no inappropriate disparities in pay; and where there were, if we found any, we corrected it going forward. And that\u2019s is a direct result of the Times Up movement.\u201d\n\nBloys added that pay parity \u201cbecomes more of an issue when you get into Season 2 and Season 3, assuming the show is a success.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhen you\u2019re putting a show together, people come in with different levels of experience and maybe some people have won awards or something that makes them stand out. But when you get into Season 2 or 3 of a show and the show is a success, it is much harder to justify paying people wildly disparate numbers, and that\u2019s where you have to make sure that you\u2019re looking at the numbers \u2014 that they don\u2019t end up just on the path they were on from the pilot stage. So, the thing that has been interesting about the whole movement is that it really is reminding everybody to do what\u2019s right, and I think it\u2019s retraining all of our thinking.\u201d\n\nAlso Read: UnWrapping 'Westworld' Season 1 With Jimmi Simpson and Simon Quarterman (Exclusive Video)\n\nHBO declined TheWrap\u2019s request for comment on this story.\n\nWatch the full interview above.\n\n\u201cWestworld\u201d Season 2 will premiere Sunday at 9/8 c on HBO.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Evan-Rachel-Wood-Westworld.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Westworld-Season-2-Trailer.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Evan-Rachel-Wood-Westworld.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/evan-rachel-wood-westworld-equal-pay-male-co-stars-season-3-video/", "title": "Evan Rachel Wood Is \u2018Just Now\u2019 Receiving the Same Pay as Male \u2018Westworld\u2019 Co-Stars (Exclusive Video)", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f9f9f9", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-title": "Evan Rachel Wood Is \u2018Just Now\u2019 Receiving the Same Pay as Male \u2018Westworld\u2019 Co-Stars (Exclusive Video)", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/evan-rachel-wood-westworld-equal-pay-male-co-stars-season-3-video/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-04-16T17:20:36-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Jennifer Maas", "parsely-tags": "anthony_hopkins, casey-bloys, ed_harris, evan_rachel_wood, hbo, jeffrey_wright, jonathan-nolan, lisa-joy, westworld, westworld-season-2, wrap-women", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Evan-Rachel-Wood-Westworld-160x105.png"}, "description": "\"I've\u00a0never\u00a0been paid the same as my male counterparts.
