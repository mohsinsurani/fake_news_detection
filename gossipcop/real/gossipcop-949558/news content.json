Today is America\u2019s birthday, and we are making it GREAT again!\u201d he continued.\n\nIn one of the photos, the pair smiled with their arms around each other, while in another, Guilfoyle, 49, was seen shaking the president\u2019s hand in the Oval Office.\n\nGuilfoyle also documented the festive fourth on her own social media account, sharing a photo of the pair smiling while holding hands outside of the White House.\n\n\u201cAn incredible afternoon at the White House! Thankful and proud to be an American! God bless all our troops & God keep our nation safe. Happy Independence Day \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\u2764\ud83d\udc83\ud83c\udffe@donaldjtrumpjr,\u201d she captioned the snapshot.\n\nTrump Jr. and Guilfoyle reportedly started dating in April, just a month after Trump Jr.\u2019s estranged wife, Vanessa, filed for divorce after more than 12 years of marriage. The former couple\u2019s divorce has yet to be finalized.\n\nThe July 4th visit comes just a week after the president\u2019s eldest son and the Fox News host went on a fishing trip together in Montana.\n\nTrump Jr. also gave his father a series of bizarre shoutouts on social media for the July Fourth holiday, sharing a series of patriotic fan-created images on Instagram.\n\nIn one image, Trump is depicted wearing an old-fashioned uniform while holding a massive weapon in one hand. Meanwhile, a bald eagle is perched on his other arm, while an American flag waved in the background amid battle imagery.\n\n\u201cThis is amazing. #fourthofjuly #4thofjuly #trump #maga\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83e\udd85\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8,\u201d his son captioned the image.\n\nThe second post appears to depict his father as Salt Bae, only instead of salt, \u201cFreedom Bae\u201d is sprinkling red white and blue stars.\n\n\n\n\u201cNewly discovered footage of Freedom Bae!!! Just sprinkling a bit of freedom for all of us to enjoy this #independenceday weekend.

In one hand the man holds a shotgun, while in the other he holds an American flag.\n\n\u201cLeaving work today like\u2026\u201d was written alongside the image.\n\n\u201cCouldn\u2019t have said it better myself,\u201d Trump Jr. captioned the scene. \u201c#maga
