But this isn\u2019t supposed to be easy. My father, and this administration, expects to be transformative.\u201d\n\nIvanka continued, \u201cI think some of the distraction and some of the ferocity I was a little blindsided by on a personal level. But for me, I\u2019m trying to keep my head down, not listen to the noise and just work really hard to make a positive impact in the lives of many people.\u201d\n\nThe businesswoman was asked how the president, 70, felt after watching former FBI Director James Comey\u2018s Senate testimony last week. \u201cMy father felt very vindicated in all the statements that he has been making and feels incredibly optimistic,\u201d Ivanka said. (Trump abruptly fired Comey in May amid the FBI\u2019s investigation into whether Russia interfered with the results of the 2016 U.S. presidential election.)\n\n\u201cWe are really focused on why the American people elected Donald Trump as their president,\u201d the fashion designer added.\n\nDuring Monday\u2019s interview, Ivanka also shut down reports that her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, was involved in palace intrigue. \u201cThere is a 24-hour news cycle that gets fed by and is encouraged by lots of salacious details,\u201d Ivanka said. \u201cAt the end of the day, we are all focused on the work, and that\u2019s very true for Jared. He is somebody who just likes to get things done. So, he doesn\u2019t get involved in all that.\u201d\n\nAn Ivanka source recently told Us Weekly that the former model and Kushner, 36, often go toe-to-toe with the commander in chief. \u201c[They] are a big influence on Donald and sometimes he takes other opinions into account and does something they disagree with,\u201d the insider exclusively told Us.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ivanka-trump-6d5fe908-9f0c-491f-bbba-1f03baa869a1.jpg?crop=351px%2C1px%2C1099px%2C577px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ivanka-trump-6d5fe908-9f0c-491f-bbba-1f03baa869a1.jpg?crop=351px%2C1px%2C1099px%2C577px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ivanka-trump-blindsided-by-level-of-viciousness-in-washington-w487409/", "title": "Ivanka Trump 'Blindsided' by 'Level of Viciousness' in Washington", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Ivanka Trump revealed in an interview on 'Fox & Friends' on Monday, June 12, that she was caught off guard by the 'level of viciousness' in Washington, D.C. \u2014 watch", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Ivanka Trump Was 'Blindsided' by 'Level of Viciousness' in Washington", "description": "Ivanka Trump revealed in an interview on 'Fox & Friends' on Monday, June 12, that she was caught off guard by the 'level of viciousness' in Washington, D.C. \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/ivanka-trump-blindsided-by-level-of-viciousness-in-washington-w487409/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:59:19+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ivanka-trump-6d5fe908-9f0c-491f-bbba-1f03baa869a1.jpg?crop=351px%2C1px%2C1099px%2C577px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ivanka-trump-6d5fe908-9f0c-491f-bbba-1f03baa869a1.jpg?crop=351px%2C1px%2C1099px%2C577px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-06-12T14:12:50+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:59:19+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ivanka Trump Was 'Blindsided' by 'Level of Viciousness' in Washington", "description": "Ivanka Trump revealed in an interview on 'Fox & Friends' on Monday, June 12, that she was caught off guard by the 'level of viciousness' in Washington, D.C. \u2014 watch", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ivanka-trump-6d5fe908-9f0c-491f-bbba-1f03baa869a1.jpg?crop=351px%2C1px%2C1099px%2C577px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497276770.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
