It was a long time coming. Enough is enough. You get to a point where you\u2019re just ready to move on and you can\u2019t take it anymore.\u201d\n\nGregg DeGuire/WireImage\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ve just got to move on, and sometimes you\u2019ve got to think about yourself instead of trying to people please,\u201d she added.\n\nBut the next month, Patridge ended her romance with polo player Nic Roldan to rekindle their relationship, a source told PEOPLE in May 2011.\n\nThings weren\u2019t all smooth sailing: Bohan was arrested for public intoxication that May. Bohan spent about eight hours in jail in Hermosa Beach, California, on the misdemeanor charge before being released on bail, according to TMZ.\n\nBy December 2011, however, Patridge was gushing to PEOPLE that her romance with Bohan was thriving after leaving TV behind.\n\n\u201cFilming a reality show really takes a toll on relationships because your mindset is to create good TV,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s hard on relationships, so after the show, Corey and I really worked on what was going on with us. We spent time together.\u201d\n\nBohan popped the question in November 2015. Patridge told PEOPLE at the time that after securing her father\u2019s permission, Bohan took her to the Summit House in Orange County, California, to propose \u2013 with her family hiding in wait.\n\nAudrina Patridge/Instagram\n\n\u201cWhen dessert time came he ordered cheesecake and the waiter brought it out on a platter with a beautiful silver cover,\u201d she shared. \u201cI noticed all the waitresses gathering with phones and thought, \u2018What is going on?\u2019 Then all of a sudden the waiter lifted the silver cover and I saw the ring in a box with white rose petals on the plate.\u201d\n\nBefore they could make it down the aisle, though, Patridge announced her pregnancy in December 2015. \u201cGod has a plan for us, and even though it is all happening so fast, I am confident that I\u2019m ready to be a mama,\u201d she wrote on social media at the time.\n\nKevin Winter/Getty Images\n\nThe couple\u2019s daughter, Kirra Max Bohan, was born in June of the next year \u2013 just in time to be the guest of honor at their November 2016 wedding in Hawaii. The star gushed on her blog, \u201cWe were thrilled to bring both our families and friends together to celebrate our lifelong commitment in one of our favorite vacation spots.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will never forget November 5th, 2016 \u2014 I had the best time of my life and can\u2019t imagine it any other way,\u201d she said.\n\nDespite her happiness, Patridge admitted to Momtastic that she dealt with haters because she chose to have a baby before getting married.\n\n\u201cWho are they to judge?\u201d she said. \u201cYou always have those few haters who are going to be negative in every situation. At the end of the day nobody is perfect. You have to do what\u2019s good for you.\u201d", "images":
