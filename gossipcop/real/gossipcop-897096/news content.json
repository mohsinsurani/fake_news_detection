Many people have sang the song: \"I'ma buy you a drank / (Ooh wee) I'ma take you home with me.\" But the actual lyrics are: \"I'ma buy you a drank (And then) I'ma take you home with me.\"\n\nIn retrospect, this makes a lot more sense. But don\u2019t feel too bad if you\u2019ve been messing up the lyrics for the past decade. T-Pain insists the lyrics are \"whatever you want it to be.\" He\u2019s just grateful that you enjoy the record.\n\nThe news sparked shock and denial.\n\nT-Pain wasn\u2019t done. Shortly after he cleared up the lyrics for \"Buy U a Drank,\" he turned his attention to the 2010 DJ Khaled track \"All I Do Is Win,\" which featured him, Rick Ross, Ludacris, and Snoop Dogg. Many people misheard the hook\u2019s lyrics as: \"Everybody hands go up / And they stay there, and stay there.\" But T-Pain revealed that the actual line is: \u201cAnd they stay there, and they say yeah.\u201d\n\nHe apologized for the misunderstanding.\n\nTwitter's mind was blown for a second time today:", "images": ["https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/ajxqmdc8xqemlltdoaot/t-pain-aoki-foundation-fundraiser-2017", "http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6685975&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://images.complex.com/complex/image/upload/t_author_pic/drsyqqzhwwwmfi53ewrr.jpg", "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,dpr_auto,f_auto,q_auto,w_1400/fl_lossy,pg_1/ajxqmdc8xqemlltdoaot/t-pain-aoki-foundation-fundraiser-2017?fimg-ssr-default", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns=\"http://www.w3.org/2000/svg\" viewBox=\"0 0 203 115\"%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/ajxqmdc8xqemlltdoaot/t-pain-aoki-foundation-fundraiser-2017", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joshua Espinoza"], "canonical_link": "https://www.complex.com/music/2017/11/t-pain-clarifies-buy-u-drank-all-i-do-is-win-lyrics", "title": "You\u2019ve Probably Been Singing These T-Pain Lyrics Wrong for Years", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "ICK39wBGvCQQMHpEUykVHWF8Ox_0MME-_qxe6ixFUik", "theme-color": "#000000", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "T-Pain clarified the hooks on \u201cBuy U a Drank\u201d and DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cAll I Do Is Win.\u201d", "robots": "index, follow, max-snippet:-1, max-image-preview:large, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"type": "website", "title": "You\u2019ve Probably Been Singing These T-Pain Lyrics Wrong for Years", "description": "T-Pain clarified the hooks on \u201cBuy U a Drank\u201d and DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cAll I Do Is Win.\u201d", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/2017/11/t-pain-clarifies-buy-u-drank-all-i-do-is-win-lyrics", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,w_1200/fl_lossy,pg_1/ajxqmdc8xqemlltdoaot/t-pain-aoki-foundation-fundraiser-2017", "site_name": "Complex"}, "fb": {"app_id": 310521533114641, "pages": 117696581735620}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "You\u2019ve Probably Been Singing These T-Pain Lyrics Wrong for Years", "description": "T-Pain clarified the hooks on \u201cBuy U a Drank\u201d and DJ Khaled\u2019s \u201cAll I Do Is Win.\u201d", "url": "https://www.complex.com/music/2017/11/t-pain-clarifies-buy-u-drank-all-i-do-is-win-lyrics", "image": "https://images.complex.com/complex/images/c_fill,f_auto,g_center,h_300,q_auto,w_600/fl_lossy,pg_1/ajxqmdc8xqemlltdoaot/t-pain-aoki-foundation-fundraiser-2017", "site": {"id": 13049362}}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.complex.com", "summary": ""}
