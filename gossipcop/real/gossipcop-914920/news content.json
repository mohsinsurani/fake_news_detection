That\u2019s his MO. He needs to bring up things that happened years ago because there\u2019s nothing for him to talk about,\u201d Jax Taylor told Us Weekly exclusively when asked about James rapping about the former SUR bartender\u2019s indiscretion with Faith Stowers in front of Jax\u2019s fianc\u00e9e, Brittany Cartwright, during the Monday, December 3, episode of Vanderpump Rules. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really have much going on in his life. There\u2019s nothing there. There\u2019s no substance to him. It gets to the point where it\u2019s like, \u2018What else do you got man?\u2019 You\u2019ve got nothing else anymore. We don\u2019t really talk to him much anymore.\u201d\n\nBrittany, who accepted Jax\u2019s proposal in the premiere, noted to Us that she has been \u201cnothing but nice\u201d to James, so he had no reason to embarrass her in front of her colleagues and the guests at SUR.\n\n\u201cI was crying and, like, ran out,\u201d the Kentucky native explained. \u201cHe tries to say that that was about Jax, but Jax wasn\u2019t there. I was the one that was there, I was the one that was embarrassed in front of the entire crowd, not Jax. So him trying to be like, \u2018That was about Jax,\u2019 that doesn\u2019t make sense. That\u2019s no ground to stand on because I was the one who got hurt that day.\u201d\n\nEven Lala Kent, who used to be the DJ\u2019s only ally on the Bravo series, is no longer friends with James after he went after her close friends and fianc\u00e9 Randall Emmett.\n\n\u201cI guess, fortunately, it hasn\u2019t affected my life in a negative way, not being friends with him. So I\u2019m good,\u201d Lala told Us. \u201cHe has always been an extremely verbally abusive friend to me and I always shook it off because I knew that it was coming from a hurt place and I knew it really only happened when he was under the influence. But when you start attacking someone who I\u2019m going to spend the rest of my life with, you might as well be attacking my mother as well.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt was just something that I couldn\u2019t bounce back from,\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd now the people that I have in my world like Katie [Maloney], Kristen [Doute], Stassi [Schroeder], a friendship with James would never work because the people in my world don\u2019t care for him. So I\u2019ve moved on.\u201d\n\nRegarding the season premiere drama with James, Scheana Shay simply added, \u201cNothing with James surprises me.\u201d\n\nVanderpump Rules airs on Bravo Mondays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-James-Kennedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-James-Kennedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-lala-kent-slam-james-kennedy/", "title": "Jax Taylor, Brittany Cartwright, Lala Kent Slam James Kennedy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "Exclusive", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Jax Taylor and the cast of \u2018Pump Rules\u2019 were not happy with James Kennedy after he embarrassed Brittany Cartwright during the season 7 premiere\u00a0\u2014 exclusive", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "\u2018Pump Rules\u2019 Cast Slams James After He Embarrasses Brittany at SUR", "description": "Jax Taylor and the cast of \u2018Pump Rules\u2019 were not happy with James Kennedy after he embarrassed Brittany Cartwright during the season 7 premiere\u00a0\u2014 exclusive", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/jax-taylor-brittany-cartwright-lala-kent-slam-james-kennedy/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-09-30T22:02:44+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-James-Kennedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-James-Kennedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-12-04T13:00:38+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-09-30T22:02:44+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "\u2018Pump Rules\u2019 Cast Slams James After He Embarrasses Brittany at SUR", "description": "Jax Taylor and the cast of \u2018Pump Rules\u2019 were not happy with James Kennedy after he embarrassed Brittany Cartwright during the season 7 premiere\u00a0\u2014 exclusive", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/12/Jax-Taylor-James-Kennedy.jpg?crop=0px%2C27px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543928438.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
