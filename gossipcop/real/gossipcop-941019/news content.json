And most of all, thank you to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School Class of 2018.\n\nWhen you think of commencement speakers, you think of people who are inspirational, people who are eloquent, people who have changed the world. When you think of high school students, you think of people who are a little immature and slightly awkward and still learning to be an adult. Welcome to opposite day.\n\nToday you\u2019re graduating from high school. You should feel incredibly proud of yourselves. That doesn\u2019t mean you should rest on your laurels \u2014 or your yannys. Some of you will grow up to hear yanny, some of you will grow up to hear laurel. But the most important thing to know is that neither of these things will matter by the end of the summer. Here\u2019s what will matter: You, the Class of 2018, will have graduated, and you won\u2019t be classmates anymore. You\u2019ll be adults who Facebook search each other at 2 in the morning for the next 10 years.\n\nBut more important than that, you\u2019ll be out in the real world. So before you go, I wanted to share a few thoughts with you. Not advice necessarily, just a few things I\u2019ve learned that helped me along the way. The first thing is this: When something feels hard, remember that it gets better. Choose to move forward, and don\u2019t let anything stop you. I met many of you earlier this year at the March for Our Lives in Washington, D.C. It was an amazing day. Thank you for your courage and your bravery and for giving amazing speeches I could never possibly live up to. My wife and I brought our two little girls because we wanted them to see what hope and light looks like. And as I was standing there watching you guys, in awe, I was lucky enough to stand with a lot of your teachers. And let me tell you something: Your teachers are so proud of you. Really, they were like, \u201cI taught him! I taught her! I taught them history!\u201d And now you\u2019re making history. It\u2019s pretty cool. And that\u2019s just a few of you I was able to meet. I can only imagine what the rest of this class is accomplishing and will be able to accomplish. And your teachers, everyone, they\u2019re all so proud of you.\n\nMy teachers weren\u2019t really proud of me like that. I wasn\u2019t really the best student. I wouldn\u2019t say I was dumb; I just had \u201cother strengths.\u201d I didn\u2019t always feel like studying, so I had to go to summer school. My Mom and Dad were like, \u201cLook at you, Mr. Smart Guy, huh? Now you\u2019re going to go to summer school. How does that make you feel? Ruin your whole summer now?\u201d It made me feel awful. I went to my bedroom. I cried. But here\u2019s the thing, I got up and went to summer school, and I met 15 versions of myself. Everyone was funny and slightly dumb, and I loved it. I loved summer school. It was fantastic. I met my people.\n\nSo my point is \u2014 a lot of you already know this \u2014 every bad experience can have something good that comes out of. Sometimes things that seem like setbacks can take our lives in totally new directions and can change us in ways we don\u2019t expect and they make us better and stronger. You guys have already proved that to everyone. You took something horrific, and instead of letting it stop you, you started a movement \u2014 not just here in Florida, not just in America, but throughout the whole world. The whole world has heard your voice, and that was you making a choice. That was you choosing to take something awful and using it to create change. That was you choosing hope over fear.\n\nAnother thing I want to say is: Keep making good choices. I\u2019m not saying it because I think you need to learn it. I\u2019m saying it because you already taught it to all of us. I can\u2019t promise you that life will be easy, but if you make good choices and keep moving forward, I can promise you that it will get better in ways that we haven\u2019t even thought of yet\n\nThat brings me to another thing I want to tell you guys, which is: We have no idea what the future holds, and that\u2019s OK. Don\u2019t get too hung up on it. My advice to you is don\u2019t think about what you want to do. Think about why you want to do it, and the rest will figure itself out. I love what I do. I get to tell jokes and make people laugh and it\u2019s awesome. People always ask me, \u201cWhat\u2019s the best part of your job?\u201d And I say, \u201cI get to make people happy.\u201d You know, it\u2019s great. I\u2019ll give you an example. About six or seven months ago, I ran into this girl on the street. She came up to me and she said, \u201cOh I just want to let you know that I was going through a tough time. I was very depressed, and you got me through my depression. And I\u2019ve watched all your clips on YouTube, and I just want to thank you so much for getting me through such a tough time.\u201d And then we talked for about 20 minutes. And then she goes, \u201cCan I get a selfie?\u201d I go, \u201cYeah, of course.\u201d So we take a selfie, and then she goes, \u201cCan we get one more for Snapchat?\u201d And I go, \u201cYeah, yeah of course.\u201d So we take another one, and then I said goodbye to her, and as she\u2019s leaving, she said out loud, \u201cOh my God, I just met Jimmy Kimmel.\u201d The point is: I love my job, and I know I could make her laugh if she knew who I was.\n\nA question people ask me a lot is, \u201cWhat would you tell your younger self?\u201d And there\u2019s so many things I\u2019d say, but the first one would be: Lay off the carbs. The second, I would say, is listen. Listen to everyone around you. Hear other voices. There are so many different voices in the world, and we\u2019re all different voices, different flavors, different colors. But we\u2019re all on the same rainbow. And we need red just as much as we need yellow and purple and orange and blue and green and burgundy. There\u2019s good in everyone, so find what\u2019s good in people. If we listen to each other, we can find it. Another thing I\u2019d tell my younger self is: Work hard for everything. Put one foot in front of the other, and keep going \u2014 day by day, moment by moment. You always have the chance to be building something, working on something, pushing something up the hill, practicing every day \u2014 rain or shine, in the mood or not. It\u2019s not easy, but you have to keep trying and keep failing and having goals and pushing them ahead every day.\n\nI\u2019d also say, take good care of yourself. Check in with yourself every day. Put your phone down, and be silent for a moment or two. And be kind, and think ahead, and have courage. Try new things. Remember the past, but don\u2019t stay there. Honor your fellow humans. Keep laughing. Celebrate anything you can as often as you can \u2014 because it\u2019s fun. Write letters and send them with a stamp in the mailbox. Try that. Say hello to people. Smile more often. Be kind to people who wait on your table, bag your groceries, move your furniture. And when you dance, dance from the inside.\n\nIf I could give you one last piece of advice, it would be this: Don\u2019t ever get off your parents\u2019 wireless plan. Ride that train as long as possible because you don\u2019t know how expensive data is.\n\nOn our show, we write out thank you notes every Friday. For the most part, they\u2019re funny or at least they try to be. But today, I want to say a real thank you. I want to thank you guys, personally, for showing us what it looks like to have integrity and courage and bravery in the face of terrible tragedy. Thank you for showing me and the whole world that there is hope. Most commencement speakers, they\u2019ll get up here and they\u2019ll talk in the future tense. \u201cYou will succeed. You will make us proud. You will change the world.\u201d Most commencement speakers, they say, \u201cYou are the future.\u201d But I\u2019m not going to say that because you\u2019re not the future. You\u2019re the present. You are the present. You are succeeding. You are making us proud. You are changing the world. So keep changing the world, and keep making us proud. Thank you so much for having me, and congratulations to the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Class of 2018.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ocean-underwater.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/2018-commencement-speakers-quotes-advice.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jimmy-fallon-speech-parkland-graduation.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/jimmy-fallon-speech-parkland-graduation.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katie Reilly"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5300396/jimmy-fallon-speech-stoneman-douglas-graduation/", "title": "Read Jimmy Fallon's Full Speech to Parkland Graduates", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Jimmy Fallon delivered a surprise commencement address to Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School graduates Sunday.
