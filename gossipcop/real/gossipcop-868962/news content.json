She stalks me and my mom.\"\n\nkenya is a dumb ugly evil bitch. \u2014 Brielle Biermann (@BrielleZolciak) July 23, 2017\n\ni don't need to! she stalks me and my mom https://t.co/cWAms2y9Cn \u2014 Brielle Biermann (@BrielleZolciak) July 23, 2017\n\nMoore didn't directly address Biermann, though she Instagrammed a glam photo of herself on Sunday, and called out her \"haters.\"\n\n\"#Aboutlastnight Everywhere you look there are haters... don't let them dull your shine or steal your joy,\" Moore wrote. \"#Shine #happy #thatsMrsDalyToYou #whytheystaymad #obsessed #kenyamoore #rhoa.\"\n\nBut Biermann didn't let the feud die there. Later, she posted a screenshot of a text message exchange between her and a male friend, who commented on Moore's Instagram photo with a pointed diss.\n\n\"You can't dull somethin that don't shine tho,\" he wrote. \"Miss Moore needaDoLess.\"\n\n\"He's not wrong tho,\" Biermann wrote of the exchange.\n\nMeanwhile, 39-year-old Zolciak didn't directly address her daughter's tweets, though she Instagrammed a Mark Twain quote reading, \"Anger is an acid that can do more harm to the vessel in which it is stored than to anything on which it is poured.\"\n\n\"Remember this ... or make sure you have friends around you who can remind you of this,\" she added.\n\nMoore and Zolciak have made no secret about their bad blood. In May, Moore threw some serious shade at the mother of six during her appearance on The Breakfast Club on Power 105.1.\n\n\"Kim needs a check so Kim will be back,\" Moore said at the time of Zolciak's then still rumored return to RHOA.\n\n\n\nZolciak later Instagrammed a clip of the shady comment, writing, \"Hmm this sh** is funny!! 6 season in on Don't Be Tardy, multi million dollar skincare line in less then 6 months @kashmerekollections meanwhile you sell your hair care products out of the trunk of your car and paying Sally's beauty supply to do an appearances there AND you are spending what you do have on your 3rd paid boyfriend.\"\n\n\"Sweetie don't try and come for me so you can have a story line for next season,\" she continued.\n\nWATCH: Kim Zolciak Horrifies Daughter Brielle Biermann After Grabbing Husband Kroy's Crotch\n\nEarlier this month, Zolciak confirmed that she'll be returning to RHOAafter leaving the show in the middle of its fifth season.
