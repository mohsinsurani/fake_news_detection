Since her film debut in 1992, she made the transatlantic journey from art-house muse to major Hollywood force, mesmerizing audiences with her volcanic on-screen range. Cruz can play many things, but she\u2019s at her best when tapping into her deep well of strength and passion, bringing to life characters on the brink of meltdown: wives and mistresses scorned, lovers in the throes of desire, even the fiery daughter of a pirate. It was her turn as a manic artist in Woody Allen\u2019s Vicky Cristina Barcelona (2008) which earned her the Oscar, but her dozens of roles big and small before that\u2014in Alejandro Amen\u00e1bar\u2019s Open Your Eyes (1998); Stephen Frears\u2019s The Hi-Lo Country (1998); Pedro Almod\u00f3var\u2019s All About My Mother (1999) and Volver (2006)\u2014secured her status as a peerless, fearless star.\n\nOf late, Cruz has gone a bit under the radar, taking time to raise a family with her husband (and frequent co-star), Javier Bardem. But this fall brings another wave of transformation her way. She will be seen next month in Murder on the Orient Express, Kenneth Branagh\u2019s star-studded adaptation of the Agatha Christie novel. As a missionary named Pilar Estravados, Cruz adds a Spanish twist to the role Ingrid Bergman made famous in the book\u2019s first film adaptation in 1974. A slew of familiar faces round out the cast of the high-speed mystery: Willem Dafoe, Judi Dench, Johnny Depp, and Michelle Pfeiffer, to name a few. And then early next year she will embody the inimitable Donatella Versace in what might be the most anticipated TV event of 2018: Ryan Murphy\u2019s The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story.\n\nIn anticipation of her next big moment, Cruz had an intimate phone conversation with a friend who has been there since the early days, before she made history: Oscar winner Gwyneth Paltrow.\n\nGWYNETH PALTROW: I was trying to remember when we first met, but I\u2019m afraid I can\u2019t.\n\nPEN\u00c9LOPE CRUZ: We had lunch at Madeo in Los Angeles. We were alone and talking about our deepest secrets, as if we had known each other for 20 years. It was around the time I was doing All the Pretty Horses [2000].\n\nPALTROW: Wow. We\u2019ve been friends for a long time. We\u2019ve been through so much together.\n\nCRUZ: And even though we live so far away and don\u2019t spend nearly enough time together, when I see you, it\u2019s like it was only yesterday.\n\nPALTROW: I was thinking the other day about how you used to study dance. Was your goal to become \u00e2\u0080\u00a8a ballerina?\n\nCRUZ: That\u2019s what I wanted as a little girl. By the time I went to ballet school at age 4, I was already asking to play the role of Carmen. I didn\u2019t realize then that the reason I liked dancing was because it was just another form of acting. I was hard-core, training something like five hours a day, six days a week. But when I did my first movie, when I was around 17, I just fell in love with acting. That\u2019s when I stopped dancing.\n\nPALTROW: Do you miss it?\n\nCRUZ: I miss the freedom I felt when I was dancing. I remember it as some kind of trance. I imagine singing is like that for you. You have such an amazing voice.\n\nPALTROW: It\u2019s totally like that. How did you get your first job?\n\nCRUZ: I got an agent when I was 15, and she sent me to a casting for Jam\u00f3n Jam\u00f3n [1992]. And I got the job. For both Javier and I, that was the movie that actually started both our careers.\n\nPALTROW: You were 17 when you did that?\n\nCRUZ: I think I was, but I was lying so much about my age that I can\u2019t be sure.\n\nPALTROW: Most actresses try to make themselves younger, but you were making yourself older.\n\nCRUZ: I\u2019ve spent most of my career trying to make myself older, for different reasons. Journalists have been asking me, since I was, like, 22, \u201cAre you afraid of aging?\u201d That is such a crazy question for a 22-year-old girl or, for that matter, for a 42-year-old. I combat that craziness by refusing to answer the question.\n\nPALTROW: It\u2019s amazing, Hollywood\u2019s obsession with the aging of women. And how much scrutiny we get for being whatever age we are.\n\nCRUZ: My mom worked very hard to raise us, as did my dad, without bullshit. I\u2019ve always had a real sense of rootedness in family and reality. It\u2019s not like I\u2019m proud of the values I have, because I don\u2019t feel like they\u2019re up to me\u2014they just come from the way I was raised. I\u2019m rooted by the things I\u2019ve seen in my mom, the things I admire in her. And in my father. When it comes to talking about aging as an actress, I feel like, \u201cWhat the fuck? I\u2019m not going to give you even two minutes to honor your question. It doesn\u2019t deserve that.\u201d Something changed when I gave birth to my daughter. I started thinking, \u201cCome on, it\u2019s 2017. Why do women still have to be talking about this? It\u2019s crazy.\u201d That sense only got bigger when I had children.\n\nPALTROW: Of all my friends, I think you love acting the most. When you talk about something you\u2019re doing, when you\u2019re preparing for something, you have this enthusiasm and this passion that, from my perspective, has never waned. Speaking for myself, I don\u2019t feel the same passion for it that I used to.\n\nCRUZ: It\u2019s helped, I\u2019m happy to say, that my ego has gotten smaller over time. I used to be so afraid about what people were going to think of me, if I was going to be accepted, if I was going to be loved. I put a lot of energy into the perception of myself. When I became a mother\u2014almost seven years ago\u2014something very deep changed in me, where I really don\u2019t care about a lot of the stuff I used to care about before. That\u2019s part of growing up, and now I have to go through other tests that life will put in front of me. I have new fears now.\n\nPALTROW: Around the time I turned 40, I felt completely liberated from other people\u2019s perceptions or expectations of me.\n\nCRUZ: I wouldn\u2019t for a second change the way I feel now for the way I felt in my twenties. How I see the world, how I look at acting\u2014everything has changed. It has, in a way, brought me back to the beginning, when I was 4 and loving dancing, loving getting in the skin of other characters and exploring the beauty of human behavior. I get so much happiness from being a student again, from exploring. Whatever happens with the result, if I\u2019ve had that process, I feel like it has been something good, that it has taught me something new. If I\u2019m 80 and I have a new character in my hands and a new story to tell, I\u2019m going to feel that same healthy fear. It\u2019s like food for me.\n\nPALTROW: I admire that. It\u2019s so cool to hear how it feeds you like that.\n\nCRUZ: Speaking of food, I admire what you are doing. I wrote you as much in an e-mail a few months ago, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s very brave what you do with Goop. You\u2019re opening a lot of people\u2019s eyes.\u201d Sometimes people are resistant to look at those things, but I feel like that\u2019s because, in a way, they know you\u2019re talking a lot of truth. There are very few people in the world who are making real changes. What you\u2019re doing is huge. The ones who don\u2019t know, they will know soon.\n\nPALTROW: Thank you so much, but I need to get back to my interview here. I am so excited for Murder on the Orient Express. I was an Agatha Christie obsessive when I was a teenager.\n\nCRUZ: I love Kenneth Branagh and everybody in this cast. Kenneth called me and said, \u201cI\u2019m thinking about you to play Pilar. Would you like to do this?\u201d I said yes. The 13 of us together on that train, it was incredible.\n\nPALTROW: Were you really on a train?\n\nCRUZ: Even though it was fake, we really felt like we were traveling. Everywhere I looked, I was like, \u201cThere\u2019s Judi Dench! And Michelle Pfeiffer! And this one! And that one!\u201d I taught all of them to play Werewolves and Villagers. I would set up a time and place for us all to play, but then I wouldn\u2019t go. And then the next day, everyone would come up to me and say, \u201cIt\u2019s your fault we didn\u2019t sleep. We played for seven hours.\u201d It was the perfect game for this cast because it\u2019s all about lying and manipulating.\n\nPALTROW: How does it work when you go on location? Does the whole family come with you?\n\nCRUZ: Yes. We try to take turns when it comes to working, except, of course, when we\u2019re in the same movie, like with Loving Pablo.\n\nPALTROW: Did you shoot that in Colombia?\n\nCRUZ: Yeah, in Bogot\u00e1.\n\nPALTROW: I\u2019ve always wanted to go.\n\nCRUZ: It was great being there. The people were so sweet to us. And it was very important to be there, because we had to really master the accent in Spanish and then translate it into English. It\u2019s a very different accent than the way we speak.\n\nPALTROW: The other project of yours that I\u2019m dying over is The Assassination of Gianni Versace. I saw pictures. You look incredible as Donatella.\n\nCRUZ: From the moment I got the call from Ryan Murphy, I thought, \u201cWhy did you think of me for that character? That\u2019s very \u2026 interesting.\u201d I know her a little bit, and I really like her. I had a few questions about how he was going to handle her portrayal, but he\u2019s so classy, and he\u2019s very respectful to people. This is a delicate story, because I\u2019m playing someone who is alive, someone who lost her brother in a horrible way, and someone who still misses him very much 20 years later. I was not used to the rhythm of doing television.\n\nPALTROW: It\u2019s fast.\n\nCRUZ: Getting four monologues two days before the shoot? And I was doing English with an Italian accent! I was like, \u201cThis is impossible.\u201d But then you just do it.\n\nPALTROW: When I did Glee, I was like, \u201cWhat do you mean we\u2019re shooting a whole musical number in half a day?\u201d I couldn\u2019t believe it. And then after TV, you go back to doing a movie and you\u2019re like, \u201cThis is so slow!\u201d\n\nCRUZ: I know! Now I\u2019m shooting a movie with Asghar Farhadi, the director of The Salesman and A Separation, in Spain. I look at my dialogue and I\u2019m like, \u201cUhh, okay. I got this.\u201d [laughs]\n\nPALTROW: How did you go about preparing to play Donatella Versace? Did you watch interviews?\n\nCRUZ: I worked a lot with a dialogue coach to find the way that Donatella speaks, which is a little different from the way she spoke in the \u201990s. The accent that she has, it\u2019s Italian with a very international flavor\u2014very rock \u2019n\u2019 roll. I didn\u2019t want to do an imitation of Donatella, or a caricature. I wanted to try to capture the essence of who she is.\n\nPALTROW: Did you speak to her about it?\n\nCRUZ: A little bit. I needed that conversation. I really hope that when she sees the show, she\u2019s going to be happy. I\u2019m sure there are going to be scenes that are hard for her to watch, because it\u2019s a lot about the loss of her brother, which, of course, I have so much respect for. I did it with all my love. From that place of devastation, she had to keep this company going in his honor. I don\u2019t know if she ever said this, but it was a way of keeping him alive.\n\nPALTROW: Do you think you\u2019ll do more TV?\n\nCRUZ: Why not? I would love to work with Ryan and his team again.\n\nPALTROW: Have you done a play?\n\nCRUZ: No, I\u2019m not brave enough to do that yet.\n\nPALTROW: Do you want to?\n\nCRUZ: At some point, maybe when my kids are older. Now isn\u2019t the time to commit to something that\u2019s every day at the same time for months. I studied theater for years, and I\u2019ve never been more nervous than when I was in front of the other students. Somebody offered me Tennessee Williams\u2019s The Rose Tattoo on Broadway, and I was really tempted, but I said no. Call me a coward.\n\nPALTROW: It\u2019s scary! I ask because for somebody who loves the craft as much as you do, I think you might really love it\u2014once you get past the fear.\n\nCRUZ: Yes, I think once I do it it\u2019s going to be such an addictive feeling. But not yet. [laughs]\n\nPALTROW: What is it like shooting a movie with Javier?\n\nCRUZ: The first time we worked together as a couple was in Loving Pablo. I was a little worried about playing these characters who are so cruel to one another\u2014like, how was that going to work? But it went great. We were there to help each other and protect each other, and the director is one of our best friends. We felt like it was the three of us together.\n\nPALTROW: What do you like to do when you\u2019re not working?\n\nCRUZ: We infrequently take holidays, because the kids are young and because of our jobs. I try to travel no more than we have to. I\u2019ve only been away from my kids for a day and a half in almost seven years. I\u2019ve had to do that three times, and I\u2019m hoping it can stay that way. When I\u2019m not working, I\u2019m taking time to be a mother. I can manage in the kitchen, although I will never cook as well as you do.\n\nPALTROW: That\u2019s not true.\n\nCRUZ: Yes, it is! I\u2019ve never seen anything like it. When you cook, it\u2019s like I\u2019m eating in the best restaurant in the world. And you do it with such ease, like, \u201cOh, I\u2019ll just put this gigantic chicken that has 25 different flavors in the oven\u2014I\u2019ve been working on it for the last five hours.\u201d Your house is like a three-Michelin-star restaurant.\n\nPALTROW: You\u2019re sweet, but the truth is that I just really like it. Okay, it\u2019s getting late over there.\n\nCRUZ: Thank you, Gwyneth, so much for doing this.\n\nPALTROW: Oh my god, are you kidding? Te quiero mucho.\n\nCRUZ: Te quiero mucho.
