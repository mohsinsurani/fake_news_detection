If you over-condition your hair, each the cuticle will be heavily coated, making it impossible for other products, such as serums and oils, to penetrate and work effectively.\n\nOver-conditioning can occur in several ways:\n\nHow can I tell if I'm over-conditioning my hair?\n\nIf you have thick and dry hair, over-conditioning may seem impossible. However, product build-up is possible on any hair type. You'll notice your hair becoming unmanageable, soft, limp, or flat. Any sort of updo will be impossible, as your hair has no natural grip.\n\nOver-conditioning thin, fine hair weighs it down and makes it look oily and perhaps stringy. It's probably easier to see signs of over-conditioning on this hair type.\n\nMy hair is over-conditioned. What can I do?\n\nThe best way to tackle over-conditioned hair is to use a clarifying shampoo to remove any product build-up. Christophe Robin Clarifying Shampoo is perfect at reviving over-conditioned hair and making it more manageable.\n\nYou can also try a clarifying scrub such as Christophe Robin Cleansing Purifying Scrub. Exfoliating your scalp once a week will help prevent product build-up that blocks follicles and leads to itchiness and a greasy feeling.\n\nIf your hair has become soft and limp due to over-conditioning, consider a protein treatment. Proteins help to strengthen and stiffen each hair strand to add texture back into the hair. We recommend evo mane attention protein treatment 150ml.\n\nHow can I prevent over-conditioning?\n\nTo prevent over-conditioning, it's important to use the right amount of conditioner and rinse it out thoroughly. Building a clarifying shampoo or scalp scrub into your regular routine will also help to stop product build-up. Conditioning is a crucial step to achieving healthy, beautiful hair, regardless of your hair types. However, conditioning is also a step that has to be carefully monitored and managed for best results. If you see signs of over-conditioned hair, it's important to remove the gunk to retain gorgeous locks.", "images": ["https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/bigstock_woman_unhappy_with_the_conditi_54565763/1c9186aecef2c3d55737d2ff667208d0/bigstock-Woman-Unhappy-With-The-Conditi-54565763", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/h/y/hydrate_me_wash_png.png?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/refundid.png?w=100&fmt=webp", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/287/679/K%C3%A9rastase_R%C3%A9sistance_Extentioniste_Bain_Shampoo_250ml.png?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/7JJkLFRq70uBYbOFAahED6/09356b5d797bb38c56263f8a76a6ea0e/AtHomeHairPamperingHasReachedNextLevel_Mirenesse_ThermalWrapnRepairMaskCap_.jpg_transformations_f_auto_w_700_h_540_c_fill_g_auto?w=330&h=270", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/5uA5biiHMW79JR9FhOrXIV/7d3aebfe01899019282610813ecdee50/christophe-robin-cleansing-purifying-scrub-by-christophe-robin-122.png_transformations_f_auto_w_500_h_500?w=700&h=540", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/0m93BHx08lmFKRFrS2uS8/4e809c2aa778641dc6d6188453793e93/KevinMurphy_AngelMasque_11052018_0015.jpg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/Footer-Icons.jpg?w=301&h=143&fmt=webp", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/flag_of_new_zealand.svg", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/5uA5biiHMW79JR9FhOrXIV/7d3aebfe01899019282610813ecdee50/christophe-robin-cleansing-purifying-scrub-by-christophe-robin-122.png_transformations_f_auto_w_500_h_500?w=330&h=270", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/media/catalog/product/a/n/angel_wash-01-testnew.jpg?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/8r0rXZOklnv8Q6U1c0tGY/b8d669eec933cc2fd3151d4c095c2f40/Evo_WaterKillerDryShampoo_22052018_0055.jpg?w=330&h=270", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/263/784/ELEVEN_Australia_Hydrate_My_Hair_Moisture_Shampoo_300ml_%28ELE132%29_Hero.png?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/270/873/ELEVEN_Australia_Keep_My_Colour_Blonde_Shampoo_300ml_%28ELE137%29_Hero.png?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/flag_of_australia.svg", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/7JJkLFRq70uBYbOFAahED6/09356b5d797bb38c56263f8a76a6ea0e/AtHomeHairPamperingHasReachedNextLevel_Mirenesse_ThermalWrapnRepairMaskCap_.jpg_transformations_f_auto_w_700_h_540_c_fill_g_auto?w=700&h=540", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/267/588/ELEVEN_Australia_I_Want_Body_Volume_Shampoo_-_300ml_%28ELE122%29_Hero.png?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/8r0rXZOklnv8Q6U1c0tGY/b8d669eec933cc2fd3151d4c095c2f40/Evo_WaterKillerDryShampoo_22052018_0055.jpg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/backtotop.svg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/269/813/Olaplex-no.4-with-badges.png?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/logo-2018-1.svg", "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/0m93BHx08lmFKRFrS2uS8/4e809c2aa778641dc6d6188453793e93/KevinMurphy_AngelMasque_11052018_0015.jpg?w=330&h=270", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/images/adore-society-icon-logo-tagline-white.svg", "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/pim_media/000/274/069/ELEVEN_Australia_Deep_Clean_Shampoo_%28ELE142%29_Hero.png?w=180&h=180&fmt=webp"], "top_img": "https://images.ctfassets.net/pi28xy1s107o/bigstock_woman_unhappy_with_the_conditi_54565763/1c9186aecef2c3d55737d2ff667208d0/bigstock-Woman-Unhappy-With-The-Conditi-54565763", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Pippa Bond", "She Her"], "canonical_link": "https://www.adorebeauty.com.au/hair/conditioner/guide/over-conditioning", "title": "Is There Such a Thing as Over-Conditioning Hair?", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#201F26", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "facebook-domain-verification": "kw6tvly4ycvpdgeqoejdnnfii6lwfk", "description": "Over-conditioning hair is down to poor application and can cause product buildup.
