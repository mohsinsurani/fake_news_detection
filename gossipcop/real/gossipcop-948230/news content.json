The pair put the term \u201ccontouring\u201d on then map, perfected the ultimate nude lip and even collaborated on the most versatile eye shadows, lipstick and glosses for KKW Beauty. It\u2019s no wonder he\u2019s amassed a following of 5.4 million followers tracking his every swipe and lip color choice on Instagram as Makeup by Mario.\n\nAs the artist behind nearly all of Kardashian West\u2019s most iconic beauty looks, Bronx-born Dedivanovic has access to the most luxurious makeup on the market. But that doesn\u2019t mean he isn\u2019t obsessed with incredible drugstore products, too.\n\nIn honor of his new partnership with No7, we caught up with the makeup artist to find out exactly what beauty bargains he loves to find at the drugstore. He picked out nine total \u2014 scroll down to find out what they are and why he chose each one. (Bonus: If you get them all, it cost you less than $100! It would be $87.73 to be exact.)\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Voluminous Carbon Black Mascara \u2013 $5.79\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve been using this for more than 15 years. It\u2019s so classic. I\u2019ve tried so many of the new luxury mascaras that come out, but I always somehow wind up going right back to my Voluminous Carbon Black. There are even some clients who definitely use it because of me.\u201d\n\nBuy It! L\u2019Or\u00e9al Voluminous Carbon Black Mascara, $5.79; target.com\n\nLooking for more style content?

I have it all over the house and in all my travel bags. I feel like it cures everything, from a blemish to discoloration. I like this one in particular because it comes in a spray bottle, which they usually do not.\u201d\n\nBuy It! Walgreens Tea Tree Oil Spray, $7; at walgreens stores (find a location nearest you here)\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Inside the Kardashian-Jenner Family\u2019s Inner Circle of Stylists, Assistants and More\n\nNo7 Lift & Luminate Foundation \u2013 $15.99\n\n\u201cI first discovered the brand when I was in London years ago before No7 was in the U.S, I bought like 100 items! Now I love this foundation. It makes your skin look radiant, smoother and firmer. It has a luminous finish, which I would definitely choose over matte skin.\u201d\n\nBuy It! No7 Lift & Luminate Foundation with SPF 15, $15.99; walgreens.com\n\nArdell Individual Lashes \u2013 $4.99\n\n\u201cI have so many pairs of these because I use it the most. I don\u2019t love huge lashes and these are the most natural-looking. When you\u2019re learning to apply them on yourself, especially if you don\u2019t have a steady hand, rest your elbow on some surface in front of you, like a desk. It makes a world of a difference.\u201d\n\nBuy It! Ardell Individual Lashes, $4.99; ulta.com\n\nNeutrogena Healthy Defense SPF 50 \u2013 $15.99\n\n\u201cI haven\u2019t been the best with SPF my whole life \u2014 a part of me still wants to get color when I\u2019m outside \u2014 but ever since I hit 35 I\u2019ve been trying to use it. My dermatologist put me on this one and I like it because it isn\u2019t greasy.\u201d\n\nBuy It! Neutrogena Healthy Defense Daily Moisturizer with SPF 50, $15.99; ulta.com\n\nL\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris Elnett Hairspray \u2013 $14.99\n\n\u201cI use hairspray on my client\u2019s eyebrows all the time [to keep them in place]. And on myself, this is the only hairspray I can use that actually holds my hair without making it look completely crispy and helmet hard!\u201d\n\nBuy It!

It\u2019s not sticky, which I love. And this color is universally flattering.\u201d\n\nBuy It! No7 High Shine Lip Gloss in Pink Latte, $9.99; walgreens.com\n\nCeraVe Moisturizing Cream \u2013 $12.68\n\n\u201cIf you don\u2019t have a great canvas, makeup isn\u2019t going to look good. If I have time, I start with a mask on my clients for 10 or 15 minutes before we start, then I do brows and then go into moisturizers. This one is great for sensitive skin and doesn\u2019t make you break out.\u201d\n\nBuy It! CeraVe Moisturizing Cream, $12.68; walmart.com\n\nNo7 Peach Velvet Blush \u2013 $12.99\n\n\u201cEver since I started doing makeup nearly two decades ago, peach blush as been my go-to for so many skin tones.
