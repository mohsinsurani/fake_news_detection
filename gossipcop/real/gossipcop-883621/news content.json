She later attended Portland State University for two years, majoring in theater and psychology.[5] Afterward, Madison moved to Los Angeles and attended Loyola Marymount University.[4]\n\nTo afford her college tuition, Madison competed to become a Hawaiian Tropic model and worked as a waitress at Hooters.[6] Her appearance at these venues led to invitations to the Playboy Mansion and at the age of 21, after more than a year of such visits, Madison asked permission from Hugh Hefner and was eventually allowed to move in at the mansion.[7]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nRelationship with Hugh Hefner and Playboy [ edit ]\n\nFacing credit card debt and potential homelessness, in August 2001, Madison moved into the Playboy Mansion and officially became one of Hugh Hefner's girlfriends.

However, in an interview at the Playmate of the Year luncheon in May 2008, Hefner said, \"I love Holly very much and I think we're going to be together the rest of my life, but marriage isn't part of my puzzle. It's not a personal thing; I just haven't had much luck with marriages.\"[9] Reflecting on her time at the mansion, Madison has said her feelings for Hefner were attributable to Stockholm syndrome.[8]\n\nOn October 7, 2008, Madison announced that her relationship with Hefner had ended, but that she, Bridget Marquardt and Kendra Wilkinson were \"still filming stuff together\".[10] Hefner confirmed the breakup, saying, \"If Holly says it's over, I guess it's over\".[11] Madison was later among the former Playmates who spoke out in the docuseries Secrets of Playboy.[12][13]\n\n2003\u20132009: The Girls Next Door [ edit ]\n\nThe Girls Next Door was an E!

It's not a vanity credit. I'm super excited to learn from the best and take on new responsibilities.\"[23] The show premiered on December 6, 2009, and ran for two seasons.[24]\n\n2022: Secrets of Playboy [ edit ]\n\nIn 2021, Madison shared in an interview some of the dark sides of the Playboy lifestyle, as further revealed in 2022 in the A&E documentary series Secrets of Playboy.[25] Madison was the subject of the show's second episode which aired in January 2022.[26] She described, among other things, the Playboy Mansion as \"dangerous\" and \"very cult-like\" and accused Hefner of manipulating her in order to advance her career and even attempting to offer her quaaludes during their first sexual encounter in the summer of 2001.[26] She also said that she was often addicted to alcohol during their relationship and that Hefner would often have photographs taken of her and his other girlfriends when they were naked after getting wasted.[26] Madison alleged this enabled him to use blackmail in order to maintain their relationship.[26] She also maintained her previous allegation that she had \"Stockholm syndrome\" during her relationship with Hefner as well, stating \"I definitely thought I was in love with Hef but it was very Stockholm syndrome, very Stockholm syndrome.\"[26]\n\nPublications [ edit ]\n\nIn 2015, Madison released her memoir Down the Rabbit Hole: Curious Adventures and Cautionary Tales of a Former Playboy Bunny.[27] The book details her life in the Playboy Mansion and the beginning of her recovery afterward.[28]\n\nIn May 2016, Madison released her second memoir, The Vegas Diaries: Romance, Rolling the Dice and the Road to Reinvention,[29] which also debuted on the New York Times Best Seller list.[30] The book chronicles her journey toward reinvention and self-acceptance in glamorous Las Vegas.[31]\n\nPersonal life [ edit ]\n\nIn 2009, Madison said, \"I'm never dating anybody again. I don't need a man. I'm really happy with myself and being with my friends... I'm focused on forwarding my career. I'm working on producing my own shows.
