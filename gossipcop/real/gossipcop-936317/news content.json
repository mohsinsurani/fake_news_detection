Despite having normal legs, Silverman has been given two extra hands - one placed on Rae's shoulder while also somehow planting one on the floor beneath the stage.\n\nAfter releasing the cover, GQ issued an \"apology\" on their website.\n\nREAD MORE:\n\n* Does Reese Witherspoon have three legs on the cover of Vanity Fair?\n\n* 'Unrecognisable' Britney Spears in Photoshop fail\n\n* Stella Maxwell in Victoria's Secret Photoshop fail\n\n* Victoria Beckham's thigh gap wasn't a Photoshop fail, says Vogue editor\n\n\"GQ would like to apologise to Kate McKinnon, Issa Rae, and Sarah Silverman for the egregious mistakes made in the process of creating the cover for our 2018 comedy issue, the latest in our pantheon of mostly annual love letters to the funniest humans we know. Our intention was to celebrate the three super-funny superstars, who are all that is smart and perceptive and riotous and necessary in comedy right now. We deeply regret that the results violated GQ's rigorous standards of editorial excellence and the laws of nature.\"\n\nThe cover is a hilarious parody of the 2018 Hollywood Issue of GQ's fellow Cond\u00e9 Nast publication, Vanity Fair, in which Reese Witherspoon appeared to have three legs and Oprah Winfrey had an extra hand.", "images": ["https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/p/x/d/x/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1pxepk.png/1526600001785.jpg"], "top_img": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/p/x/d/x/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1pxepk.png/1526600001785.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/104015288/gq-mocks-vanity-fairs-photoshop-fail-with-spoof-cover", "title": "GQ mocks Vanity Fair's photoshop fail with spoof cover", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "fb": {"app_id": 207633159308175, "pages": 21253884267}, "verify-v1": "RazNiYjuvNuEsMeFXxfR9l9cDZIKxcq2VjQZA25CHgM=", "msapplication-config": "/sics-assets/images/favicons_v2/browserconfig.xml", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "description": "The magazine which, like Vanity Fair, is owned by Conde Nast has issued an 'apology statement': &quot;Mistakes were made.&quot;", "source": "Stuff", "og": {"description": "The magazine which, like Vanity Fair, is owned by Conde Nast has issued an 'apology statement': &quot;Mistakes were made.&quot;", "title": "GQ mocks Vanity Fair's photoshop fail with spoof cover", "url": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/104015288/gq-mocks-vanity-fairs-photoshop-fail-with-spoof-cover", "type": "article", "image": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/p/x/d/x/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1pxepk.png/1526600001785.jpg", "site_name": "Stuff"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-17T23:33:20.421Z", "section": "life-style", "modified": "2018-05-17T23:33:20.421Z"}, "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-title": "GQ mocks Vanity Fair's photoshop fail with spoof cover", "parsely-link": "https://www.stuff.co.nz/life-style/life/104015288", "parsely-image-url": "https://resources.stuff.co.nz/content/dam/images/1/p/x/d/x/a/image.related.StuffLandscapeSixteenByNine.1420x800.1pxepk.png/1526600001785.jpg", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-05-17T23:33:20.421Z", "parsely-section": "life-style", "parsely-tags": "life-style,life", "tags": "life-style,life", "parsely-post-id": 104015288}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526600000.421, "source": "https://www.stuff.co.nz", "summary": ""}
