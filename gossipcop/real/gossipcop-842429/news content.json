Learned a lot. For example, it takes approximately 12.6 minutes for all the passengers to get over the shock of me jumping on the boat and thinking I'm a DJ lookalike.\"\n\nSome of the guests couldn't quite wrap their heads around what was happening: \"One passenger even said, 'Oh the real Rock is much smaller than this guy,'\" Johnson wrote. \"I threw his ass off the boat.\"\n\nIt was announced last week that Johnson has officially signed on to produce and star in a Disney live-action movie based on the classic Adventureland ride. As all Disney aficionados know, the iconic attraction -- which first opened all the way back in 1955 at Disneyland -- is led by skippers who guide the boat along the winding rivers of Asia, Africa and South America.\n\nThe skippers are known for their goofy jokes, and thankfully, The Rock knows the importance of their beloved corniness: \"Yes, with me as the Cruise Skipper there will be an abundance of puns,\" he wrote.\n\n\"Best part about this surprise research day was knowing how FUN of an experience we're gonna work hard to create for families around the world. That's the part that gets [me] excited the most,\" he added. \"It's the cruise of a lifetime. And trust me, you'll want me as your Skipper. Just don't forget to bring the Skipper's beer.\"\n\nRELATED: The highest-grossing Disney films of all time:", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190830/aol-logo.svg", "https://s.yimg.com/ny/api/res/1.2/csZxOr8GJ1DduJ1YIW8ZVQ--/YXBwaWQ9aGlnaGxhbmRlcjt3PTEyMDtoPTgw/https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/hlogos/aol_Light.png", "https://s.aolcdn.com/aoldotcom-releases/lazyload/blank.gif", "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/omaFtx.PDQ1BPNzmJTNz5Q--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f5ac97cb8ee9d43d39f1b68c06c9a2e4/205146975/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-04-10%2Bat%2B10.29.19%2BAM.png"], "top_img": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/omaFtx.PDQ1BPNzmJTNz5Q--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f5ac97cb8ee9d43d39f1b68c06c9a2e4/205146975/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-04-10%2Bat%2B10.29.19%2BAM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aol Staff", "Jennifer Kline", "April"], "canonical_link": "https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/04/10/dwayne-johnson-surprises-disney-world-jungle-cruise/22033820/", "title": "Dwayne Johnson surprises Disney World guests on Jungle Cruise ride: 'They thought I was a lookalike'", "meta_data": {"oath": {"guce": {"consent-host": "guce.aol.com"}}, "twitter": {"site": "@AOL", "dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"googleplay": "com.aol.mobile.aolapp"}, "name": {"googleplay": "Aol App"}, "url": {"googleplay": "https://www.aol.com/22033820.html"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@AOL", "domain": "www.aol.com", "description": "You have to feel bad for the family that almost got a FastPass and then was like, 'Let's do Splash Mountain instead.'", "image": {"identifier": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/omaFtx.PDQ1BPNzmJTNz5Q--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f5ac97cb8ee9d43d39f1b68c06c9a2e4/205146975/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-04-10%2Bat%2B10.29.19%2BAM.png", "src": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/omaFtx.PDQ1BPNzmJTNz5Q--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f5ac97cb8ee9d43d39f1b68c06c9a2e4/205146975/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-04-10%2Bat%2B10.29.19%2BAM.png"}, "title": "Dwayne Johnson surprises Disney World guests on Jungle Cruise ride: 'They thought I was a lookalike'", "account_id": 66237835}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=646100661,app-argument=https://www.aol.com/22033820.html", "news_keywords": "Disney World, Cruise Skipper", "robots": "index,follow", "author": "AOL Staff", "google-site-verification": "ko2245Ra2QPRrivJQepBc3qAXmApiF8Wrb1nbWAP_jc", "msapplication-config": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/aolfp/metadata/browserconfig.xml?q=12347133", "msapplication-TileColor": "#39f", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/aolfp/metadata/mstile-144x144.png", "msvalidate.01": "AC51FE4BBA33843E8A3FC86F4B7024F2", "p": {"domain_verify": "96bae1739d3231d21abe59a638021d5d"}, "referrer": "unsafe-url", "theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "category": "entertainment", "publish-date": "April 10, 2017", "description": "You have to feel bad for the family that almost got a FastPass and then was like, 'Let's do Splash Mountain instead.'", "al": {"android": {"app_name": "Aol App", "package": "com.aol.mobile.aolapp", "url": "https://www.aol.com/22033820.html"}, "ios": {"app_name": "Aol App", "app_store_id": 646100661, "url": "https://www.aol.com/22033820.html"}}, "og": {"type": "website", "app_id": 183146218394780, "image": "https://s.yimg.com/uu/api/res/1.2/omaFtx.PDQ1BPNzmJTNz5Q--~B/aD02NzU7dz0xMDI4O2FwcGlkPXl0YWNoeW9u/https://o.aolcdn.com/images/dims3/GLOB/legacy_thumbnail/1028x675/format/jpg/quality/85/http://o.aolcdn.com/hss/storage/midas/f5ac97cb8ee9d43d39f1b68c06c9a2e4/205146975/Screen%2BShot%2B2017-04-10%2Bat%2B10.29.19%2BAM.png", "description": "You have to feel bad for the family that almost got a FastPass and then was like, 'Let's do Splash Mountain instead.'", "title": "Dwayne Johnson surprises Disney World guests on Jungle Cruise ride: 'They thought I was a lookalike'", "url": "https://www.aol.com/article/entertainment/2017/04/10/dwayne-johnson-surprises-disney-world-jungle-cruise/22033820/"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/aol"}, "fb": {"app_id": 183146218394780}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1491778800.0, "source": "https://www.aol.com", "summary": ""}
