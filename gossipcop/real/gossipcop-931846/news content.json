Though, it wasn\u2019t always that way. First attending the event back in 2007, Rihanna was always well-dressed, but it took a few more go-arounds on the famed museum steps for her emerge as an ascended master of Met Gala dressing.\n\nHer past Met Gala looks vary from a tailored suit in 2009, to a revealing Stella McCartney white two-piece gown in 2014. On the 2015 red carpet, Rihanna was undeniably one of the best dressed in attendance wearing a yellow Guo Pei gown with an insanely elaborate train and a matching headpiece that made headlines and maybe one of the most memorable MET Gala looks of all time. In 2017, she stole the show again in Comme des Gar\u00e7ons. Here is a look back at Rihanna at the Gala from 2007 to 2021.\n\n2007: \u201cPoiret: King of Fashion\u201d Getty Images At 2007\u2019s MET Gala, \u201cPoiret: King of Fashion,\u201d Rihanna wore a white Georges Chakra gown with silver embellishments, paired with mesh gloves. She carried a red rose as an additional accessory.\n\nGetty Images 2007 was Rihanna\u2019s first Met Gala, and one with a loser theme, so while it was a solid effort, clearly the best was yet to come.\n\n2009: \u201cThe Model as Muse\u201d Getty Images Rihanna chose a Dolce & Gabbana suit and bow tie paired with black stilettos for 2009\u2019s \u201cThe Model as Muse\u201d Met Gala.\n\nGetty Images The theme was all about the people that wear the clothes, rather than a central clothing theme itself. Still, Rihanna certainly made a statement with this menswear-inspired look.\n\n2011: \u201cAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\u201d Getty Images Wearing a black lace Stella McCartney gown at the 2011 MET Gala, \u201cAlexander McQueen: Savage Beauty\u201d, Rihanna accessorized with a long side-braid and emerald earrings.\n\nGetty Images It was another year where the exhibition theme was about a specific designer, which can be hard to channel when you\u2019re paired with another fashion house.\n\n2012: \u201cSchiaparelli And Prada: Impossible Conversations\u201d Getty Images Rihanna wore a black Tom Ford gown in a crocodile-embelish texture in 2012. The theme was \u201cSchiaparelli And Prada: Impossible Conversations.\u201d\n\nGetty Images She paired the look with a chic updo, accentuating the fact the side of her head was shaved at the time.\n\n2014: \u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion\u201d Getty Images Rihanna wore a white Stella McCartney two-piece for the 2014 edition, \u201cCharles James: Beyond Fashion.\u201d\n\nGetty Images Clearly, she was ahead of the game when it came to wearing formal croptops.\n\n2015: \u201cChina Through The Look Glass\u201d Getty Images 2015 was the year Rihanna began to really earn her reputation as the queen of dressing on theme. The exhibition that year was entitled \u201cChina Through The Looking Glass,\u201d and Rihanna wore a yellow gown designed by Chinese designer Guo Pei who said that \u201conly women who have the confidence of a queen could wear it.\u201d\n\nGetty Images She accented the look with a headpiece fit for a queen.\n\n2017: \u201cRei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art Of The In-Between\u201d Getty Images The \u201cavant-garde\u201d mandate of the 2017 red carpet for the \u201cRei Kawakubo/Comme des Gar\u00e7ons: Art Of The In-Between\u201d exhibition tripped up many, but Rihanna knew what to do. She was one of the few to actually wear Comme des Gar\u00e7ons, and arguably the one to pull it off best.\n\nGetty Images The flower-inspired look may have eaten others up, but Rihanna remained the prettiest blossom in the bunch.\n\n2019: \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination\u201d Getty Images The theme in 2018 was \u201cHeavenly Bodies: Fashion and the Catholic Imagination,\u201d so what did Rihanna do? She dressed as the pope. She tapped Maison Margiela designer John Galliano to create the look, though it was actually based on one he had designed for a man while he was at the helm of Dior.\n\nPhoto by Jamie McCarthy/Getty Images Her beauty that night was simple, letting the outfit do the talking.\n\n2021: \u201cIn America: A Lexicon of Fashion\u201d Photo by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue Ok, so apparently Rihanna isn\u2019t always interested in nailing the theme. For the 2021 exhibition, \u201cIn America: A Lexicon of Fashion,\u201d she wore a look from Demna Gvasalia for Balenciaga. \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant and that\u2019s my take on American fashion,\u201d she said on the red carpet.\n\nPhoto by Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for The Met Museum/Vogue 2021 marked a first for Rihanna. It was the first time she walked the red carpet with a romantic interest, current boyfriend A$AP Rocky.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/05/02/5907d8dfc18025126ab6b7d9_best-8.jpg?w=374&h=528&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/9/15/9d1deb9c-6c16-4a7b-ba0c-77dd9f51100e-gettyimages-1340169672.jpg?w=374&h=542&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020f070c05f057f6126f7a_GettyImages-144016245.jpg?w=374&h=562&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020d1d0c05f057f6126f70_3.jpg?w=374&h=561&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/9/15/47141f8f-600d-442c-827e-1ebf84b4e4d2-gettyimages-955806320.jpg?w=414&h=623&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4987&fp-y=0.3437", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/05/02/5907e10c0c05f057f612721a_GettyImages-675622042.jpg?w=374&h=563&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/9/15/a7586a8f-bc9d-49f9-afa7-a9b424c58c4f-every-met-gala-rihanna-look.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020ef1c18025126ab6b57f_GettyImages-144006278.jpg?w=374&h=562&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020d20cb562d05c337f3f0_6.jpg?w=374&h=580&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020e5bc18025126ab6b57b_GettyImages-472445750.jpg?w=374&h=528&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020d200c05f057f6126f72_4.jpg?w=374&h=503&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020d1dc18025126ab6b575_2.jpg?w=374&h=553&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020d1d0c05f057f6126f6e_1.jpg?w=374&h=561&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020f1bcb562d05c337f3f8_GettyImages-488343221.jpg?w=374&h=557&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/9/15/ee588069-4390-4aae-ba40-664854493de6-gettyimages-1340176860.jpg?w=374&h=339&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/9/30/280da00f-7d01-4de6-a23c-037ca661e68c-getty-1395026081.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.5107&fp-y=0.2196", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020f47c18025126ab6b581_GettyImages-488374153.jpg?w=374&h=551&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/05/07/5af0dd2041f5e511788015cd_GettyImages-955753464.jpg?w=374&h=563&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/9/15/3597b13a-dbd8-4114-8ef3-8ec40735cc74-gettyimages-955754354.jpg?w=374&h=563&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020d2acb562d05c337f3f4_11.jpg?w=374&h=256&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/9/29/1e8c2eb5-bb40-4ce5-bedf-b3ecc912368a-getty-1419997105.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4987&fp-y=0.2098", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2017/04/27/59020ebac18025126ab6b57d_GettyImages-660030526.jpg?w=374&h=561&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/9/15/a7586a8f-bc9d-49f9-afa7-a9b424c58c4f-every-met-gala-rihanna-look.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/rihanna-met-gala-red-carpet-every-look", "title": "All of Rihanna's Met Gala Looks From Ingenue To Queen of the Red Carpet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/fashion/rihanna-met-gala-red-carpet-every-look", "type": "article", "title": "A Look Back at Every Look Rihanna Has Worn To The Met Gala", "description": "It took Rihanna a few years to get a hang of things.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2021/9/15/a7586a8f-bc9d-49f9-afa7-a9b424c58c4f-every-met-gala-rihanna-look.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "It took Rihanna a few years to get a hang of things."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
