My fans too, I feel they gave me a reason to live and I\u2019m forever grateful.\u201d\n\nHer daily struggle to stay sober\n\nLast year the \u201cSorry Not Sorry\u201d singer was honored with the Spirit of Sobriety Award during the annual Brent Shapiro Foundation for Drug Prevention Summer Spectacular.\n\n\u201cEvery day is a battle,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cYou just have to take it one day at a time; some days are easier than others and some days you forget about drinking and using, but for me, I work on my physical health, which is important, but my mental health as well,\u201d Lovato said, adding that she was seeing her therapist twice a week. \u201cI make sure I stay on my medications. I go to AA meetings. I do what I can physically in the gym. I make it a priority.\u201d\n\nOpening up about being bipolar\n\nIn 2015 Lovato was spokeswoman for the \u201cBe Vocal: Speak Up for Mental Health\u201d campaign and talked to Women\u2019s Health about why she went public with her mental health issues.\n\n\u201cI remember sitting with my manager and my family and talking to them about whether or not to speak out about the issues that I was dealing with,\u201d she said. \u201cI knew that there were two options: I could either not talk about my stint in rehab and hope that it went away, or I could talk about it and inspire people to get help for their issues, as well, so that\u2019s exactly what I did.\u201d\n\nHer sobriety relapse after six years\n\nLast month Lovato released the song \u201cSober\u201d in which she revealed she had relapsed.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so sorry I\u2019m not sober anymore/And I\u2019m sorry for the fans I lost who watched me fall again/I wanna be a role model, but I\u2019m only human,\u201d Lovato sang.\n\nSoon after she tweeted a video of her emotional performance of the song in Lisbon, Portugal.\n\nTonight I took the stage, a new person with a new life.
