In September, she made a cameo in another CBS show, the reboot of \u201cMurphy Brown,\u201d where she applied to be Brown\u2019s personal secretary.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180921093701-madam-secretary.jpg?q=x_3,y_254,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180921093701-madam-secretary.jpg?q=x_3,y_254,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180921093701-madam-secretary.jpg?q=x_3,y_254,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aaron Pellish"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/hillary-clinton-colin-powell-madam-secretary/index.html", "title": "Clinton, Powell, Albright guest star on \u2018Madam Secretary\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Clinton, Powell, Albright guest star on 'Madam Secretary' | CNN Politics", "description": "Former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright offered their fictional successor Elizabeth McCord some advice on the rise of white nationalism in America Sunday on CBS's \"Madam Secretary.\"", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180921093701-madam-secretary.jpg?q=x_3,y_254,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/10/08/politics/hillary-clinton-colin-powell-madam-secretary/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Clinton, Powell, Albright guest star on 'Madam Secretary' | CNN Politics", "description": "Former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright offered their fictional successor Elizabeth McCord some advice on the rise of white nationalism in America Sunday on CBS's \"Madam Secretary.\"", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180921093701-madam-secretary.jpg?q=x_3,y_254,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cnnpolitics"}, "description": "Former secretaries of state Hillary Clinton, Colin Powell and Madeleine Albright offered their fictional successor Elizabeth McCord some advice on the rise of white nationalism in America Sunday on CBS's \"Madam Secretary.\"", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "politics", "theme": "politics", "article": {"published_time": "2018-10-08T12:03:23Z", "modified_time": "2018-10-08T12:03:23Z", "tag": "colin powell, hillary clinton, madeleine albright, political figures - us", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "colin powell, hillary clinton, madeleine albright, political figures - us", "author": "Aaron Pellish", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1538953200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
