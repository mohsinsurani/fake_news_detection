Ray J and Princess Love are expecting their first child together.\n\nThe \u201cSexy Can I\u201d singer, 36, announced the news while appearing as a guest cohost on The Real on Monday, November 27. \u201cLove is on my mind. Love is on my heart. Princess and I are expecting,\u201d he gushed before standing up and clapping for himself.\n\n\u201cI\u2019mma be a dad,\u201d Ray J (real name William Norwood Jr.) continued. \u201cI\u2019m nervous, excited. It finally happened. My first one.\u201d\n\nThe on-off couple tied the knot in Los Angeles in August 2016. Their fertility struggles were chronicled throughout season 4 of Love & Hip Hop: Hollywood, and they further expressed their frustrations during the VH1 reality series\u2019 reunion special in October.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know the process of it \u2014 when it actually happened, what night \u2014 but it was special because we was trying for a while,\u201d Ray J, who starred in a sex tape with ex Kim Kardashian in 2003, said on The Real. \u201cIt\u2019s not as easy as people think. For some people, they just go on tour and get everybody pregnant. But for me, it was love. We took our time, and as we were taking our time, it just took a little while.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cI Hit It First\u201d crooner, who is the brother of singer Brandy and first cousin of rapper Snoop Dogg, went on to explain that he and his model wife, 33, do not know the sex of their child just yet. \u201cI want to have a little girl first because it\u2019s like daddy\u2019s little girl,\u201d he explained. \u201cA little boy is probably going to be a little aggressive, so I just want to be able to have some peace first. But whatever God blesses us with, I\u2019m happy.\u201d\n\nAfter Ray J announced the news, Princess Love shared a photo of her growing baby bump on Instagram. \u201cIt\u2019s such a blessing from God to be able to carry our child,\u201d she captioned the post. \u201cWe kept this to ourselves until after the first trimester because it\u2019s bad luck to announce too early. But we\u2019re so proud to share this journey with you guys. Thank you for all of the love and prayers.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s such a blessing from God to be able to carry our child.
