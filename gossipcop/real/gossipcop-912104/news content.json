It is a great fit as long as you are growing together, and I think up until this point we\u2019ve really grown together. Even if one starts to grow, the other catches up and vice versa,\" she explained.\n\nBut, she said, a healthy marriage takes constant fine-tuning.\n\n\"I think a couple needs to be conscious and to want to do the work and be willing to look at the parts of you that need work,\" said the star. \"Both of us have been pretty aware and willing to do that. We\u2019ve always had the same values. But we\u2019re not perfect! Are you kidding? We fight like other couples, we disagree about things, we have days where we don\u2019t really like each other.\"\n\nJenna Dewan Tatum poses with her husband, Channing Tatum, at the premiere of his film \"War Dog: A Soldier's Best Friend\" in November 2017. Getty Images\n\nOne thing that brings joy to the couple's life? Their 4-year-old daughter, Everly \u2014 or \"Evie,\" as Mom calls her. But Dewan Tatum isn't sure yet if she and her hubby will add to the family.\n\n\"I haven\u2019t yet made my decision, and I\u2019m leaving it to the universe to show me the way. I love the idea of another child, and it might be in the cards, but I\u2019ll know when I know,\" she explained. \"A lot of women I know plan it, and that\u2019s their decision, they want it within three years, but that was not a possibility for us. It felt too overwhelming.\"\n\nFor now, said the star, \"I\u2019m so thrilled with one child. If the desire (for another child) comes around, it will happen, that\u2019s the way I look at it.\"", "images":
