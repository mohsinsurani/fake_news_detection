After all, he got plenty of training in the matter as one of the members of the quintessential millennial boy band 98 Degrees, crooning various sweet nothings into the camera and the faces of thousands of screaming female fans. A skill that has clearly translated to his marriage with Vanessa Lachey as the couple have been together since 2011, have three children together under the age of 5, and are still going just as strong as ever. And on Sunday Nick proved that he offers another invaluable skill to his wife \u2013 an extremely high tolerance for grossness \u2013 gamely digging through their garbage to find Vanessa\u2019s lost wedding ring.\n\nWhen the couple tied the knot six years ago, in addition to the already impressive 4-carat engagement ring featuring an Asscher-cut diamond surrounded by trapezoid baguettes that the former pop star bought for Vanessa, he also got a very substantial wedding ring to add to his bride\u2019s bling. The couple returned to New York jeweler David Bader, of Bader and Garrin, who designed Minnillo\u2019s engagement ring, to pick out a substantial platinum eternity band of Asscher-cut diamonds that also would match Lachey\u2019s own platinum band with includes 24 square diamonds. But having such heavy bands clearly comes with some consequences as it seems Vanessa recently lost hers in the family trash can by accident.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Nick and Vanessa Lachey Are \u2018All Hands on Deck\u2019 in Raising Three Kids: \u2018There\u2019s No Spontaneous Date Nights\u2019\n\nOn Saturday morning, the former boy bander posted a photo of his wife\u2019s ring sitting in the midst of a pile of trash, dirt and hair, writing in the caption, \u201cThis is true love after 6 years of marriage\u2026\u2026digging through dirty diapers and trash to find your wife\u2019s missing wedding ring!! #success\u201d While Lachey should undoubtedly be nominated for the best husband award of 2017 for this recovery feat, given that he has three small children he\u2019s probably pretty used to dealing with some of the less glamorous things in life and is an old pro at this point. Besides, dealing with a little dirt and diapers seems pretty worth it to save tens of thousands of dollars from winding up in the local landfill.\n\nWould you dig through your garbage to find your S.O.\u2019s wedding ring?
