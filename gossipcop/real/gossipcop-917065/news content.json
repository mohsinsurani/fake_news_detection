The famous talk show host gifted her new mom friend and 'A Wrinkle in Time' co-star, Mindy Kaling, the best gift. Here's a hint: It involves two men and a U-Haul truck.\n\nFor the average mom, a new baby usually means gifts of flowers, cards and maybe some homemade meals. But when you\u2019re a celebrity mom with famous friends, those are all just basic.\n\nMindy Kaling got her baby an amazingly glam stroller because of course she would In case you haven\u2019t heard, Mindy Kaling recently welcomed a baby girl named Katherine in December. We know\u2014she\u2019s got to be the coolest mom ever, right? And, like most friends do when a new baby arrives, her A Wrinkle in Time co-star, Oprah Winfrey, wanted to give her a special gift.\n\n\u201cI got a call from my assistant,\u201d Mindy told USA Today. \u201cShe said \u2018Oprah\u2019s assistant contacted me, she\u2019d like to drop off a present.\u2019 I\u2019m thinking, that\u2019s so nice, like, (it\u2019s) probably flowers. I had a kid, I\u2019m a single mom. That\u2019s really nice Oprah remembered.\u201d\n\nLittle did Mindy know that there was a pleasant surprise headed her way.\n\n\u201cTwo men are going to be coming to your house, they said, with a U-Haul truck,\u201d Mindy continued. Oprah, sitting beside Mindy in the interview, agreed with a simple, \u201cTrue.\u201d\n\n\u201cAll you want in life is to hear that two men in a U-Haul truck are coming to your house because Oprah sent them. I was supposed to go to work that day (but I was like), I gotta be here.\u201d\n\nWe totally feel you on that, Mindy! You\u2019d have been crazy not to sit around and wait. So what was it?\n\n\u201cThey arrived with a hand-carved bookcase, prettier than any professional dollhouse you had ever seen that contained a hundred of the classic essential books in children\u2019s literature,\u201d Mindy continued. \u201cAnd I held my baby up to it and I said, \u2018Did you see what Miss Winfrey did for you?'\u201d\n\nBut that was not all!\n\nIn classic Oprah fashion, she went above and beyond to make the gift even sweeter and had each book branded with \u201cKatherine\u2019s Book Club\u201d on it\u2014AWWW! Oprah officially wins the Best Baby Gifter EVER title in our books, but apparently, the gift wasn\u2019t up to The Mighty Ope\u2019s standards.\n\n\u201cIt wasn\u2019t as perfect as I wanted it to be,\u201d Oprah said. She had envisioned the dollhouse to look like the treehouse Mindy\u2019s Wrinkle character, Mrs. Who, lives in. But Mindy disagreed by saying, \u201cNow it only looks like a beautiful castle.\u201d To which Oprah replied, \u201cIt was the best I could do.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s the most amazing gift,\u201d said Mindy, and we definitely agree with that.\n\nCan we please be friends with DOPErah, please? We\u2019re super jealous.\n\nRead more:\n\nCelebrity push presents: From the sweet to the over-the-top\n\n13 baby shower gifts you probably never thought of", "images": ["https://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mindy-Kaling-and-Oprah-Winfrey-768x432-1519837307.jpg", "https://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/close.png", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/71ee57a4ef2616fe9dd09bd8957c8c96?s=128&d=mm&r=g", "https://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/reasons-why-mindy-kaling-with-a-great-mom-1280x960-344x226.jpg", "https://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/themes/todaysparent.com/assets/images/logo.png", "https://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/plugins/rdm-daac-notice/public/images/info.png", "https://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mindy-Kaling-and-Oprah-Winfrey.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.todaysparent.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Mindy-Kaling-and-Oprah-Winfrey.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jessica Spera"], "canonical_link": "https://www.todaysparent.com/blogs/trending/oprah-bought-mindy-kaling-the-most-epic-baby-gift-ever/", "title": "Oprah gave Mindy Kaling the most thoughtful baby gift EVER", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "description": "Oprah gifted her new mom friend and 'A Wrinkle in Time' co-star, Mindy Kaling, the best gift.
