In her interview, Kim described the reunion as \u201ctraumatizing\u201d and vowed she will NEVER return to the series.\n\n\u201cIt was horrible. It was disgusting,\u201d said Kim about her return to RHOA for season 10. \u201cThe reunion was so f\u2013king traumatizing. There was a complete attack. You only saw a few minutes [of me] from the reunion, but it was three and a half hours of me sitting on the couch to the point where I didn\u2019t hear anything after about two hours. They were talking [about] my kids are so ugly. Kenya Moore was saying my kids are so ugly, they\u2019re so stupid, and they\u2019re not going anywhere.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s disgusting. She\u2019s pretty nasty. She\u2019s evil. Kenya\u2019s not a good person. You don\u2019t have a good heart,\u201d continued Kim.\n\nHost Brandi, who has also feuded with Kenya in the past during their time on Celebrity Apprentice, also got in on the Kenya bashing action! \u201cShe\u2019s like the devil. She\u2019s like Omarosa [Manigault]. I worked with both of them. It was hell,\u201d shared Brandi.\n\nUnfortunately for Kim, she also got a ton of public backlash after she was shown complaining to host Andy Cohen backstage at the reunion about some of her castmates referring to her as racist. During that convo, Kim made an odd comment when she told Andy that racism wasn\u2019t really a real thing, and that it\u2019s only making headlines nowadays due to social media. While she has since apologized for that comment, Kim made it clear that she is still upset over that convo, as she feels she was edited out of context.\n\n\u201cYou don\u2019t even get to see the 45 minutes in the bathroom [of what] really happened between Andy and I. I just think that they edited out of context a lot,\u201d shared Kim. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t finish my statement, you make me look like somebody I\u2019m not. It just puts a bad taste in my mouth. After being on this network for 11 years, it\u2019s like you can\u2019t tether on the line of racism in this day and age. It\u2019s not funny. I don\u2019t find it f\u2013king funny. It\u2019s gross.\u201d\n\nIn addition to blaming RHOA producers for bad editing, she also blames her former co-stars for what she sees as playing the race card.\n\n\u201cThey know damn well that I\u2019m not racist,\u201d said Kim about the RHOA cast. \u201cSo, to pull that f\u2013king card is disgusting.\u201d\n\nShe added, \u201cI\u2019ll never go back. I really envisioned it to be so different but there\u2019s so much hatred in these girls\u2019 hearts. It\u2019s fun to banter back and forth and cut up and whatever, but this was downright f\u2013king nasty, dirty.\u201d\n\nKim then went on to reveal how some of the ladies requested that Kroy stop coming to cast events with her, adding that Kroy compared that reqeust to slavery.\n\n\u201cWe got a phone call that Kroy could no longer drive me to scenes. Kroy said slavery ended a long time ago,\u201d shared Kim. \u201cWe drink at these scenes so I\u2019m not going to drink and f\u2013king drive. They called and said he can no longer drive [you], two of the women have complained. Kroy said slavery ended a long time ago sweety.\u201d\n\nThe topic turned to Kim\u2019s strained relationship with her parents, who she hasn\u2019t seen or spoken to in over six years, as she revealed they remain estranged.\n\n\u201cNo,\u201d answered Kim when asked if she talks to her mom. \u201cAnd I\u2019m okay with it though, like I wasn\u2019t okay with it for so long. As a mother, if you mess with my kids and you start selling stories that aren\u2019t true, and you affect my kids? [I\u2019m done].\u201d\n\nShe seems to be referencing an interview her parents did years ago, in which they confirmed that Kim\u2019s eldest two daughters, Brielle and Ariana Biermann, don\u2019t have the same father.\n\nShe was also asked about her estranged relationship with Kroy\u2019s parents. They don\u2019t have a relationship with Kroy as well since he married Kim. Oddly enough, Kim said she sort of understands why Kroy\u2019s parents didn\u2019t want their son to marry her.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t think they ever necessarily hated me but I just wasn\u2019t their vision [for their son],\u201d she shared. \u201cI was 31, yes I have a bachelor\u2019s degree in nursing, I went to college, but I had two kids. And I told Kroy that if I saw Housewives, like the chain-smoking, drinking wine, cursing like a sailor, I would be like ugh [as well].\u201d\n\nAdditionally, Kim was asked about her kids cursing up a storm on the show, and she appeared to want to blame their big sister Brielle, 21, for being the bad influence.\n\n\u201cKJ, I mean what do you expect? He has a 21-yr-old sister at the end of the day,\u201d said Kim. \u201cBut he\u2019s so well behaved in school. He doesn\u2019t say it around other people. He won a huge award at school for his behavior so the kids are just so great at school and then they come home. It\u2019s more me. He would never say that in front of Kroy.\u201d\n\nOn the topic of Brielle, Kim admitted that her daughter lacks motivation when asked what Brielle does these days, adding that Brielle\u2019s main focus now is Instagram.\n\n\u201cWell, she wants to start on her own podcast actually, [but] she is so busy with Instagram,\u201d admitted Kim. \u201cIt\u2019s insane [how much money she\u2019s making]. She does so well. She\u2019s very authentic and very real. and only will post what she believes in but she\u2019s not overly motivated. When you make that kind of money on Instagram though, it\u2019s like you think I\u2019m going to wait tables?\u201d\n\nShe did add that Brielle is a great big sister, who actually spends nights at her home, in order to be closer to her young siblings, despite having her own place now.\n\n\u201cShe has her own apartment but yeah, she\u2019s at the house with me,\u201d explained Kim. \u201cShe has a huge high rise [apartment] in Buckhead which is like Beverly Hills, you know. She has this beautiful apartment and she comes to our house every night and sleeps.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe uses [her apartment] on the weekends,\u201d added Kroy, who was also present during the interview, although he barely said anything.\n\n\u201cShe has younger siblings that she\u2019s so connected with. She picks them up from school [and] she has lunch with them. She\u2019s super involved,\u201d continued Kim.\n\nFinally, Kim was asked when viewers can expect to see the new season of Don\u2019t Be Tardy.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know. They said December. Usually, we\u2019ve aired by now. I swear it\u2019s coming,\u201d answered Kim.\n\nPhotos Credit: Michael Simon/startraksphoto.com,", "images": ["https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/themes/soledad/images/penci-holder.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/retina-pin2k-logo-1.png", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/feed-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201000%20774'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Kim-Zolciak-talks-Kenya-Moore-and-Brielle-Biermann.jpg"], "top_img": "https://realityblurb.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/Kim-Zolciak-talks-Kenya-Moore-and-Brielle-Biermann.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sola Delano", "Ace Infphoto.Com."], "canonical_link": "https://realityblurb.com/2018/09/03/kim-zolciak-slams-rhoa-cast-and-evil-kenya-moore-calls-reunion-traumatizing-plus-she-talks-strained-relationship-with-kroys-parents-brielles-instagram-career/", "title": "Kim Zolciak Slams RHOA Cast!
