Is it the voyeur in all of us being fed by Kima Kardashian and Kylie Jenner's snippety videos, or is it the little schadenfreude demon inside needing its fix? Here at MEAWW we tackle celebrity news and reveals as we would any other news, and before you laugh, think back to all the times you made your way to the celebrity gossip section of a website before the politics section. Not laughing anymore are ya!\n\nWhether it's Hollywood gossip or celebrity breaking news, we aim to bring you not just the facts, but the speculation as well \u2013 because as we all know too well, that when it comes to celebrities \u2013 as advertised, the grape doesn't fall far from the vine.\n\nWritten in a style that neither kowtows nor bullies, we treat our celebrities exactly as they would treat us (ahem), with respect, decorum and a healthy helping of gossip just to keep things balanced. All this without getting too personal, well, almost.\n\nMEAWW is no pasty newsletter. We deliver the exclusive inside track into the hottest goings-on in la la land from Hollywood news to Hollywood gossip. Be it an A-lister headed for splitsville or an up-and-comer Kardashian wannabe headed straight for the down-and-goer, celeb news has always been about the journey, never the destination. And here at MEAWW we've got a set of entertainment news wheels like you wouldn't believe. And we love to travel!\n\nRead all about your celebrities, the ones you like and the ones you loathe, as they battle the brutal world of glitz, glamor and beauty or maybe even live a little bathed in the limelight of what they sell. Summer or winter, we're a site for all seasons.\n\nAnd while we specialize in trending celebrity news, we love looking back at the great celebrity stories from yesteryear to get the much-needed injection of nostalgia about the simpler times, when celebrities really got up to high-jinks and weren't simply railroaded for an idiotic and badly-timed tweet.\n\nAnd if you've had enough of entertainment news gossip and are on a search to see if your celebs are doing something a bit more substantial, then we've got that for you too. From charitable donations that will make your eyes water, to social justice commentary fit for the office of the late, great RBG; if today\u2019s entertainment news has it, we probably did first.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just sizzling celeb gossip that we cover, we\u2019re all over the aisle when it comes to celebrity weddings, celebrity births, and all the celebrity announcements that make your day. If it features on the red carpet, it features at MEAWW.\n\nAnd if, unfortunately, we must cover a celebrity death, then be sure that our coverage is more than just a celebration of their life, it\u2019s a montage of memories, emotion and poignancy.\n\nSo if you're looking for the latest celebrity news on your favourite, actor, actress, musician, social media influencer, next superstar, or even gaming hotshot, then MEAWW is the place not just to visit, but stay for your hourly dose of celebrity gossip, Hollywood news and everything else under the sun and if you watch closely, you might even emerge enlightened.\n\nAll that's left now is for you is to bookmark this page, share it with your friends and enemies, sign our metaphorical fanzine and make sure that in your time of dire need for Hollywood gossip you always end up at the right place. Where stars come to shine and rumors go to find a new set of wings. Celebrity News at MEAWW, because we really do care where we stand.\n\nAs Lady Gaga said: \"If you don't have any shadows you're not in the light\"", "images": ["https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/default_800_420.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/cross.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=430778077119553&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/favicon.ico", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/assets/m_fb.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v3/assets/search-icon.svg", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/assets/m_twitter.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/meaww-small.svg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-H0NCC_W8rVWV7.gif", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=ULYDq1CJLq20jn", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,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", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,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\n                      ", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,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", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/assets/m_copy_link.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/logo_blue.svg", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/assets/m_whatsapp.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/Default.png", "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/assets/m_1_share.png"], "top_img": "https://dab57h0r8ahff.cloudfront.net/v4/assets/favicon.ico", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://meaww.com/news/celebrity", "title": "celebrity", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow", "keywords": ",meaww,article,articles,read", "description": "Get all the celebrity news, rumors & scandal that rock the celebrity world. \u2713 Stay up to date today.
