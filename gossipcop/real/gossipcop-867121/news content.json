Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan will be joined by Disney officials in dedicating the stamps.\n\n\u201cThe Postal Service is highlighting the Disney Villains and the pioneering spirit of the Ink and Paint Department that brought many of these characters to life,\u201d said Brennan. \u201cThese Forever stamps are our way of saying Disney Villains will forever entertain us and serve as a tribute Disney\u2019s artistry and storytelling skill.\u201d\n\nEach stamp showcases one of 10 classic Disney Villains set against a blue background.\n\nFrom left: the Queen (Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs), Honest John (Pinocchio), Lady Tremaine (Cinderella), the Queen of Hearts (Alice in Wonderland) and Captain Hook (Peter Pan),\n\nFrom left: Maleficent (Sleeping Beauty), Cruella De Vil (One Hundred and One Dalmatians), Ursula (The Little Mermaid), Gaston (Beauty and the Beast) and Scar (The Lion King).\n\nhe words \u201cUSA\u201d and \u201cForever\u201d appear in the top right corner or bottom right corner of each stamp and the name of the classic villain and the movie in which the character appears runs along the left edge.\n\nThe Art of Animation\n\nBeginning in 1923, as part of Walt Disney Animation Studios, Disney\u2019s Ink & Paint Department helped create classic animated films. Its artists brought life to countless memorable characters, including many iconic Disney Villains. One of the first groups of its kind, Disney\u2019s Ink & Paint Department was yet another stop on the road to creating an animated film.\n\nArt director Derry Noyes of Washington, DC, worked closely with Disney Creative Director, David Pacheco and the team at Walt Disney Studio\u2019s Ink and Paint Department to design this issuance.\n\nThe Disney Villains from the Walt Disney Studio\u2019s Ink & Paint Department stamps are being issued as Forever stamps that are always equal in value to the current First-Class Mail service 1-ounce price.\n\nOrdering First-Day-of-Issue Postmarks\n\nCustomers have 60 days to obtain the first-day-of-issue postmark by mail.
