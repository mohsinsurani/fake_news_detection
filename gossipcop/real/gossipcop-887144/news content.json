Lest there be any ambiguity, this statement clarifies my intention and feelings.\u201d\n\nWoody Allen addressed the \u201cvery sad\u201d Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal in a new interview where the filmmaker admitted that he was unaware of the severity of the claims against the producer.\n\n\u201cNo one ever came to me or told me horror stories with any real seriousness,\u201d Allen told the BBC. \u201cAnd they wouldn\u2019t, because you are not interested in it. You are interested in making your movie. But you do hear a million fanciful rumors all the time. And some turn out to be true and some, many, are just stories about this actress or that actor.\u201d\n\nThe director and the producer have a long business relationship: Allen-directed films like Mighty Aphrodite and Bullets Over Broadway were distributed through Weinstein\u2019s Miramax, while The Weinstein Company co-produced Allen\u2019s Vicki Christina Barcelona.\n\nMira Sorvino, who won a Best Supporting Actress Oscar for her role in Mighty Aphrodite, recently opened up about her own experience with Weinstein, an encounter that resulted in \u201cmany sleepless nights.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved,\u201d Allen said. \u201cTragic for the poor women that were involved, sad for Harvey that [his] life is so messed up. There\u2019s no winners in that, it\u2019s just very, very sad and tragic for those poor women that had to go through that.\u201d\n\nAllen, who has similarly faced allegations of sexual abuse \u2013 including accusations levied by his son Ronan Farrow, who penned the New Yorker\u2018s expose into Weinstein \u2013 also voiced concern that the aftermath of the Weinstein scandal would result in \u201ca witch hunt atmosphere\u201d in Hollywood and beyond.\n\n\u201cYou also don\u2019t want it to lead to a witch hunt atmosphere, a Salem atmosphere, where every guy in an office who winks at a woman is suddenly having to call a lawyer to defend himself. That\u2019s not right either,\u201d Allen said. \u201cBut sure, you hope that something like this could be transformed into a benefit for people rather than just a sad or tragic situation.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=204436500352178&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-82178360-31046737-2289-490a-a452-7e5363ae9956.jpg?w=1024&h=808&crop=1", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-rollingstone-2022/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-82178360-31046737-2289-490a-a452-7e5363ae9956.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-82178360-31046737-2289-490a-a452-7e5363ae9956.jpg?w=500&h=375&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Kreps"], "canonical_link": "https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-news/woody-allen-harvey-weinstein-thing-is-very-sad-for-everybody-125485/", "title": "Woody Allen: \u2018Harvey Weinstein Thing Is Very Sad for Everybody\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#df3535", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Woody Allen addressed the \"very sad\" Harvey Weinstein sexual assault scandal in a new interview.", "news_keywords": "Harvey Weinstein, sexual misconduct, Woody Allen", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "rollingstone", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 125485, "author": "Daniel Kreps", "pmc-category": "(Sub)Culture,(Sub)Culture News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2017-10-15T19:53:00"}, "pmc-tag": "Harvey Weinstein,sexual misconduct,Woody Allen", "title": "Woody Allen: \u2018Harvey Weinstein Thing Is Very Sad for Everybody\u2019", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-is_free": "no", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Daniel Kreps", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "RS", "application-name": "RS", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 125485, "title": "Woody Allen: 'Harvey Weinstein Thing Is Very Sad for Everybody'", "published_at": "2017-10-15 19:53:00", "image": "https://www.rollingstone.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/gettyimages-82178360-31046737-2289-490a-a452-7e5363ae9956.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Woody Allen", "topics": "(Sub)Culture News", "body": "UPDATE: Woody Allen has clarified his comments on Harvey Weinstein after originally stating, \"\"The whole Harvey Weinstein thing is very sad for everybody involved.\" \"When I said I felt sad for Harvey Weinstein, I thought it was clear the meaning was because he is a sad, sick man,\" Allen said (Via Variety). \"I was surprised it was treated differently.
