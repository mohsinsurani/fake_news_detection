The streets of Manhattan have been filled with all things animal print and plaid, especially in the form of structured suits. On Sunday, Emma Roberts hopped on the bandwagon in the most refined way by showing us how to mix prints like a pro.\n\nAlthough the concept of mixing prints was once considered a major fashion foul, Roberts proves that these days, it's more than OK. The 27-year-old actor was photographed leaving her hotel in New York City wearing relaxed, plaid pants with a long-sleeve black-turtleneck sweater. Roberts completed the fall look with a long-line, leopard-print coat that she delicately draped over her shoulders and a pair of understated white boots.\n\nThe American Horror Story veteran is no stranger to animal print, as Roberts spent much of last winter in an oversized leopard-print coat, which she paired with cut-off jeans and a white t-shirt. The actor was also photographed in early August wearing the perfect cheetah-print shirt dress.\n\nThis time around, Roberts made the ultimate statement by combing her love for leopard with perfectly tailored, plaid trousers.\n\nPierre Suu/GC Images\n\nThe two best parts about this Roberts-inspired trend are the endless amount of options that come with it, as well as how easy it is to recreate within your own wardrobe. The pieces the trend requires can be paired together for a stylish statement or worn on their own for a more subdued look. As any fashion-conscious person will agree, nothing is better than a piece that works double duty in your closet.\n\nAhead, the leopard-print coats and plaid pants The Zoe Report is eyeing right now.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/7/7ae50634-889e-481a-9989-89a739329f25-309003825_3367345386834599_2336885476108707963_n.jpg?w=110&h=110&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4126&fp-y=0.1562", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/6/d312bbcf-46de-4edf-886d-fa100718219d-getty-1410254553.jpg?w=110&h=110&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.484&fp-y=0.3921", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/4/e79a4659-ba91-4d6c-afd7-80f31b582495-gettyimages-1430303549.jpg?w=110&h=110&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4707&fp-y=0.1698", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/c03c649e-f260-404f-8fa8-936916cdddaa-shutterstock_7433992f.jpg?w=248&h=227&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/getty/2022/10/5/aceeb50b-4d85-405c-b320-6509520aee3b-getty-1419952463.jpg?w=110&h=110&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4747&fp-y=0.3244", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/55bec8e8-91d5-457c-acee-6b19bc667cec-alc.jpg?w=330&h=585&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/f3291bcb-d847-4267-ac01-3526c0e3579a-_103981335.jpg?w=330&h=506&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/9bc79c85-21fe-4c7c-847e-cc88e9b5c393-18083351478excl_3.jpg?w=330&h=413&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/c8240a3a-3c1f-40db-b462-a76bb5c98081-ganni.jpg?w=330&h=366&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/79281f7e-e817-415f-b865-c57761df8712-1068505_in_pp.jpg?w=330&h=495&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/d2f8cf1f-1971-462e-9c0f-063a738876bd-forever-21.jpg?w=330&h=405&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/20ac4ed9-5b9b-4c91-bf99-05cbc42f2243-nmtx9lb_mu.jpg?w=330&h=413&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/9db001d6-7f8a-4a27-aaf1-226e5f121774-9830350_fpxtif.jpeg?w=330&h=402&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/42259ee7-0c43-4f06-9d13-6bc6d417436a-emma-roberts-embed.jpg?w=414&h=621&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/c03c649e-f260-404f-8fa8-936916cdddaa-shutterstock_7433992f.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2018/9/12/c03c649e-f260-404f-8fa8-936916cdddaa-shutterstock_7433992f.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thezoereport.com/p/how-to-mix-prints-according-to-emma-roberts-11886281", "title": "Emma Roberts Mixed Two Of The Season's Biggest Prints & Somehow Pulled It Off", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@thezoereport", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/thezoereport"}, "og": {"site_name": "The Zoe Report", "url": "https://www.thezoereport.com/p/how-to-mix-prints-according-to-emma-roberts-11886281", "type": "article", "title": "Emma Roberts Mixed Two Of The Season's Biggest Prints & Somehow Pulled It Off", "description": "Two of New York Fashion Week's most popular street style trends have officially blended into one.
