Sure, some people thought I did something wrong in their eyes. But I think it was really wrong of someone to put on top of someone that this is my shame and that I should be ashamed of myself,\u201d she continued. \u201cIt\u2019s not a nice thing to tell someone they should be ashamed of themselves. Except Donald Trump.\u201d\n\nShe also recounted the photo session when, at the age of 15, Cyrus worked with renowned photographer Annie Leibovitz for the Vanity Fair feature. \u201cThere was nothing sexualized about this on set,\u201d the former Hannah Montana star said. \u201cIt was every one\u2019s poisonous thoughts and minds that ended up turning this into something that wasn\u2019t meant to be. So actually, I should not be ashamed, they should be.\u201d\n\nCyrus covered a lot of turf during her Q&A with Kimmel, from the thin line between \u201choarding\u201d and \u201ccollecting,\u201d her special packet of peanuts, living with Liam Hemsworth and her \u201cnew projects\u201d in Los Angeles. She kept those plans under wraps, but they\u2019re apparently so important, she gave up smoking pot (her \u201cfirst true love\u201d) to \u201cstay focused.\u201d\n\nCheck out more clips from Miley\u2019s appearance below.\n\nThis article originally appeared on Billboard.com.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/miley_cyrus_on_fk_you_tweet_taking_back_apology_screen_shot2_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/miley_cyrus_on_fk_you_tweet_taking_back_apology_screen_shot2_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lars Brandle Billboard"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/miley-cyrus-defends-retracting-apology-vanity-fair-portrait-1107850/", "title": "Miley Cyrus Defends Retracting Apology for Controversial Vanity Fair Portrait", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"It\u2019s not a nice thing to tell someone they should be ashamed of themselves,\" Cyrus told Jimmy Kimmel about being pressured to apologize for exposing the skin of her back at age 15.", "news_keywords": "Jimmy Kimmel, Jimmy Kimmel Live!, Late-Night TV, Miley Cyrus", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lars Brandle Billboard", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1107850, "title": "Miley Cyrus Defends Retracting Apology for Controversial Vanity Fair Portrait", "published_at": "2018-05-02 09:12:01", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/miley_cyrus_on_fk_you_tweet_taking_back_apology_screen_shot2_0.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Miley Cyrus", "topics": "TV News", "body": "Miley Cyrus doesn\u2019t worry about yesterday.
