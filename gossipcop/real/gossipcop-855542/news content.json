Lea Michele broke down in tears when she met her icon, Celine Dion, backstage at the Billboard Music Awards on May 21. Lea was lucky enough to introduce Celine before her performance of \u2018My Heart Will Go On,\u2019 but Lea had more fun embracing the singer backstage! See the pics here.\n\nLea Michele was one lucky lady on May 21, when she not only got to introduce her icon, Celine Dion, before the singer performed \u201cMy Heart Will Go On,\u201d but she also got a chance to meet and embrace Celine backstage afterwards. \u201cMy heart,\u201d \u201cNo words,\u201d and \u201cI love her,\u201d are three different captions Lea used when she posted pictures of their special interaction, during which Lea broke down in tears and became a blubbering mess.\n\nBefore that interaction, however, Lea took the stage at the BBMAs and introduced her icon with the following speech: \u201c2017 marks the 20th anniversary of one of the most honored films in Academy Awards history \u2014 Titanic. The movie\u2019s theme song, \u201cMy Heart Will Go On,\u201d went to number one around the world and became one of the biggest selling singles of all time. The song is iconic, so it\u2019s only fitting that it be performed tonight by a global superstar, a woman who made it her signature song. And on a personal note, she is a woman who has always inspired me, and inspires countless others with her poise, her dignity, and her strength, and of course, her incredible talent. It\u2019s a true honor for me to introduce her. Ladies and gentlemen, Celine Dion!\u201d\n\nAnd before the show, she told E! News that she\u2019d freak if she got close to Celine. \u201cI\u2019m afraid they\u2019re going to kick me out,\u201d she joked. \u201cI mean, I really am obsessed with her. I think she\u2019s incredible. Just to be in the same building with her today is going to be awesome for me.\u201d\n\nThe lovely @LeaMichele welcomes @celinedion to the #BBMAs stage for a touching performance honoring the 20th anniversary of \"Titanic!\" \ud83d\udc99 pic.twitter.com/1S126hJf0G \u2014 BillboardMusicAwards (@BBMAs) May 22, 2017\n\nHollywoodLifers, what did YOU think of Celine Dion\u2019s performance?
