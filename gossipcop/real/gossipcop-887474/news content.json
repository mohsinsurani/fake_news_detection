Why? Not only is he adorable, but he proved he\u2019s an absolute sweetie when he comforted this crying bridesmaid at Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s wedding, and he\u2019s also shattering gender stereotypes by taking ballet classes.\n\nPrince William and Kate Middleton often share anecdotes about the little royal. Recently, Kate attended an event at the V&A and spoke to one of the venue\u2019s senior curators, Martin Barnes.\n\nAccording to Hello, Barnes explained to her that one of the featured photographers, William Henry Fox Talbot, \u2018wanted nature to draw its own picture on the paper instead of failing with the pencil\u2019. It struck a hilarious note with Kate as it reminded her of Prince George.\n\n\u2018She said, \u2018George would do that!\u2019 \u2013 that is blame the pencil, which was sweet,\u2019 Barnes told the magazine.\n\nBut more recently, William decided to share which Disney film Prince George loves the most \u2013 and to be honest, same.\n\nVideos you may like:\n\nVideo you may like:\n\nAt a recent royal engagement, the Duke of Cambridge was asked by a little boy what TV show Prince George likes to watch.\n\nWilliam responded: \u2018He quite likes The Lion King \u2013 he\u2019s watched that a few times.\u2019\n\nOkay, it\u2019s not a TV show, but it\u2019s great to know that George loves classic Disney.\n\nBut he is also a fan of animated movies, with William elaborating: \u2018He has watched some Lego movies as well\u2026 trying to keep him off the television is hard work!\u2019\n\nWell we have to say, it sounds like Prince George has a great taste in films, which he has clearly inherited from his parents.\n\nDuring an interview with BBC Radio 1, William and Kate revealed that their go-to television series is none other than Game of Thrones.\n\nSee?
