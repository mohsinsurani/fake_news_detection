I want everybody \u2014 me, Gary, [his wife] Kristina, Andrew \u2014 to blend together and stop the back-and-forth,\u201d she continued. \u201cI have a really calm, chill life and I\u2019m happy for the first time, genuinely.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly exclusively confirmed in November that the MTV personality was expecting her first child with the cinematographer.
