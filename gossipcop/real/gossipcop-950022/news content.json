The alphabet formulations--like BB cream, CC cream, and soon DD creams--have joined tinted moisturizers and standard foundation on the shelves as potential skin-perfecting options. But what do they all (supposedly) do? What's the difference between them? And most importantly: Which should you use? We break it down for you.

My sense is that they may be headed for extinction, or at least hibernation. While tinted moisturizers are still on the market and probably still have many fans, I haven\u2019t seen a new launch for one in quite a while--alphabet creams are all the rage now.\n\nEditors' Pick: NARS Pure Radiant Tinted Moisturizer, $45, available here. BB Creams: BB creams are an Asian import that have become super popular in the last two years here in the US. BB creams provide coverage with added skin care benefits like SPF and anti-oxidants--the list goes on depending on what brand you choose. They're lighter than foundation but heavier than tinted moisturizers. While the additives in BB creams can have the same efficacy as they would in stand-alone serums, be careful about counting on BB creams for adequate sun protection. \"My only concern is that since BB cream is generally tinted, women use less on their face,\" Manhattan dermatologist Dr. Heidi Waldorf said. Meaning you won't slather it on the way you do--or should--with a more traditional sunscreen, resulting in inadequate protection.\n\nEditors' Pick: Clinique Moisture Surge CC Cream Hydrating Colour Corrector Broad Spectrum SPF 30, $39, available here. DD Creams: And now get ready for DD creams (sigh). Julep is releasing what it's calling a \"Dynamic Do-All\" cream this summer, and it kinda sounds like a BB/CC hybrid. Weirdly, the cosmetics industry was predicting something completely different for DD creams. Back in November of 2012, a cosmetics industry analyst told Cosmetic Design (a trade website) that a number of DD creams, called \"Daily Defense\" creams were poised to launch, but they aren't for your face--rather they are \"heavy duty body and foot creams.\" So it will be interesting to see if Julep single-handedly just changed that category with its forthcoming launch.", "images": ["https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkxNjc3NzA3/image-title5.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkxNDgxMDk5/image-title2.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTMzMjYxNTAwNTA3NzYxMjgz/11057209_1173981649282434_3313519267407503977_njpg.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkyMDcwOTIz/primary-photo.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/c_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_1280/MTQ3MzQzMTc3NTg0NDg2MzU3/fashionista-hub-thebusines-1.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/assets/MTM0MTYyNjUxNDg2OTMwOTU0/site-nav-logo.svg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODQwMDYyNTA0MDE5NjY0/puppets-and-puppets-spring-2023-best-bags-3.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/cs_srgb%2Cq_auto:good/MTQ1NTQ5OTY2NzI5ODE1NjA3/mtqwndi3ntcznze1oda1njgw-1.svg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_1:1%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTkyODM4NzQzNDExOTI2NzM2/michaela_coel_black_panther_vogue_2022_cover.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/ar_16:9%2Cc_fill%2Ccs_srgb%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_faces:center%2Cq_auto:good%2Cw_620/MTUzMDAxNDU2NjIwODA3MTc1/3lab-bb-cream-promo.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkxNjEyMTcx/image-title4.jpg", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkxODc0MzE1/image-title6.png", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkxNDE1NTYz/image-title1.png", "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkxNTQ2NjM1/image-title3.jpg"], "top_img": "https://fashionista.com/.image/t_share/MTE5NTU2MzIzNDkyMDcwOTIz/primary-photo.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cheryl Wischhover"], "canonical_link": "https://fashionista.com/2013/04/the-difference-between-bb-cc-dd-creams", "title": "The Difference Between BB, CC and DD Creams", "meta_data": {"author": "Cheryl Wischhover", "description": "Which letter is right for you.", "keywords": "bb cream,DD cream,Beauty,beauty,foundation,CC cream,Dr.Heidi Waldorf,Julep,Clinique,Nico Guilis", "section": "Beauty", "pagetype": "article", "companies": "Image Title1; Image Title2; Image Title3; Image Title4; Image Title5; Image Title6", "tags": "bb cream, DD cream, beauty, foundation, CC cream, Dr.Heidi Waldorf, Julep, Clinique, Nico Guilis", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "item-id": "ci01ada20de003f41e", "published": "2013-04-25T21:58:10Z", "modified": "2017-11-09T16:01:52Z", "dcterms.rightsHolder": "Breaking Media, Inc.
