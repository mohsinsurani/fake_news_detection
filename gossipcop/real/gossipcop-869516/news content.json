Your health care provider will look at your face and ask you to move your facial muscles by closing your eyes, lifting your brow, showing your teeth and frowning, among other movements.\n\nOther conditions \u2014 such as a stroke, infections, Lyme disease, inflammatory conditions and tumors \u2014 can cause facial muscle weakness that mimics Bell's palsy. If the cause of your symptoms isn't clear, your health care provider may recommend other tests, including:\n\nElectromyography (EMG). This test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity. An EMG measures the electrical activity of a muscle in response to stimulation. It also measures the nature and speed of the conduction of electrical impulses along a nerve.\n\nThis test can confirm the presence of nerve damage and determine its severity.

Blood tests. There is no blood test for Bell's palsy. But blood tests can be used to rule out Lyme disease and other infections.\n\nTreatment\n\nMost people with Bell's palsy recover fully \u2014 with or without treatment. There's no one-size-fits-all treatment for Bell's palsy. But your health care provider may suggest medications or physical therapy to help speed your recovery. Surgery is rarely an option for Bell's palsy.\n\nBecause the eye on the affected side doesn't close, it's important to take steps to protect and care for that eye. Using lubricating eye drops during the day and an eye ointment at night will help keep your eye moist. Wearing glasses or goggles during the day and an eye patch at night can protect your eye from getting poked or scratched. In severe cases of Bell's palsy, an eye doctor may need to monitor the eye.\n\nMedications\n\nCommonly used medications to treat Bell's palsy include:\n\nCorticosteroids, such as prednisone. These are powerful anti-inflammatory agents. If they can reduce the swelling of the facial nerve, the nerve will fit more comfortably within the bony corridor that surrounds it. Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Steroids started early improve the likelihood of complete recovery.\n\nsuch as prednisone.

Corticosteroids may work best if they're started within several days of when your symptoms started. Steroids started early improve the likelihood of complete recovery. Antiviral drugs. The role of antivirals remains unsettled. Antivirals alone have shown no benefit compared with placebo. Antivirals added to steroids may benefit some people with Bell's palsy, but this is still unproved. Despite this, an antiviral drug, such as valacyclovir (Valtrex) or acyclovir (Zovirax), is sometimes given in combination with prednisone in people with severe facial palsy.\n\nPhysical therapy\n\nParalyzed muscles can shrink and shorten, which may be permanent. A physical therapist can teach you how to massage and exercise your facial muscles to help prevent this from occurring.\n\nSurgery\n\nIn the past, decompression surgery was used to relieve the pressure on the facial nerve by opening the bony passage that the nerve passes through. Today, decompression surgery isn't recommended. Facial nerve injury and permanent hearing loss are possible risks associated with this surgery.\n\nRarely, plastic surgery may be needed to correct lasting facial nerve problems. Facial reanimation surgery helps make the face look more even and may restore facial movement. Examples of this type of surgery include an eyebrow lift, an eyelid lift, facial implants and nerve grafts. Some procedures, such as an eyebrow lift, may need to be repeated after several years.\n\nThere is a problem with information submitted for this request.

However, in some cases when you call to set up an appointment, you may be referred immediately to a doctor who specializes in the nervous system (neurologist).\n\nIt's good to prepare for your appointment. Here's some information to help you get ready.\n\nWhat you can do\n\nWrite down any symptoms you're experiencing. Be sure to include any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.\n\nBe sure to include any that may seem unrelated to the reason for which you scheduled the appointment.
