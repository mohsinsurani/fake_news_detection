AMC released a statement confirming that Bernecker's family had \u201cdecided that he will be removed from life support.\"\n\nGimple said: \u201cOur production is heartbroken by the tragic loss of John Bernecke. John\u2019s work on The Walking Dead and dozens of other movies and shows will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations.\n\n\u201cWe are grateful for his contributions, and all of us send our condolences, love, and prayers to John\u2019s family and friends.\u201d\n\nThe show's stars, including Norman Reedus (Daryl), Jeffrey Dean Morgan (Negan) and Lauren Cohan (Maggie), all paid touching tribute to Bernecker.\n\nAccording to Coweta County Coroner Richard Hawk, Bernecker died of blunt force trauma experienced due to his fall.\n\nSAG-AFTRA and the Atlanta office of the Occupational safety and health Administration have launched investigations into the incident. AMC has confirmed that production on The Walking Dead has \u201ctemporarily shut down.\u201d\n\nIn the 911 call placed after the fall, a colleague of Mr Bernecker\u2019s tells the dispatcher that the stunt man fell \u201cabout 25 feet off of a balcony straight onto concrete.\u201c\n\n\n\n\u200bBernecker's work can be seen in films such as The Hunger Games: Catching Fire, Logan, and the forthcoming Black Panther.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jacob Stolworthy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-stuntman-died-john-bernecker-season-8-scott-gimple-tribute-amc-a7842526.html", "title": "The Walking Dead cast pay tribute to stuntman who died after on-set accident", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "'John\u2019s work will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations'", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "The Walking Dead cast has paid tribute to the stuntman who died in an on-set accident", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/the-walking-dead-stuntman-died-john-bernecker-season-8-scott-gimple-tribute-amc-a7842526.html", "type": "article", "description": "'John\u2019s work will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations'", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Jacob Stolworthy", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 317, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 6, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-07-15T10:58:08.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176299319"}, "twitter": {"title": "The Walking Dead cast has paid tribute to the stuntman who died in an on-set accident", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "'John\u2019s work will continue to entertain and excite audiences for generations'", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/07/15/11/walking-dead.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "The Walking Dead,The Walking Dead season 8,John Bernecker,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500116288.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
