You are the love of my life Hailey Baldwin and I wouldn\u2019t want to spend it with anybody else.\u201d\n\nReps for Bieber and Hailey did not immediately respond to requests for comment.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/07/baldwin-bieber1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/07/baldwin-bieber1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/07/baldwin-bieber1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["July"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/07/10/justin-bieber-asked-stephen-baldwin-for-haileys-hand/", "title": "Justin Bieber asked Stephen Baldwin for Hailey\u2019s hand", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
