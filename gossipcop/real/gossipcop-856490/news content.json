News. \"He's his happy, healthy self and Christina was being overly cautious by taking him to the hospital to be checked out.\"\n\nWhile the original Instagram post that Christina posted of her son next to the pool has since been deleted, according to Entertainment Tonight, one commenter wrote, \"as a mother it is scary to have a toddler being that close to a pool!\"\n\nChristina wrote back to the comments, saying, \"OMG 1. It's a beach entry if he fell in it's only a foot high, he would be ok 2. It's not his first time in or around the pool, but thanks for your \"concern\" aka judgment 3. AND most importantly I am right there and could be to him in 3 seconds SMH at this .....!!!!\"\n\nWhile Child Protective Services was called to the hospital to question El Moussa and the nanny after
