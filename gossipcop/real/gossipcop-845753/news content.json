{"url": "https://www.thewrap.com/snatched-review-amy-schumer-goldie-hawn/", "text": "The Amy Schumer-Goldie Hawn comedy \u201cSnatched\u201d should really be called \u201cAmy and Goldie Go to Ecuador\u201d and be one in a churned-out series like the \u201cBlondie\u201d movies of the 1940s. That kind of context might help this sloppy, fitfully funny trifle go down easier than it does now, shouldering the mantle of summer event comedy, eagerly awaited follow-up to Schumer\u2019s breakout hit \u201cTrainwreck,\u201d and return after a 15-year multiplex hiatus for screen legend Goldie Hawn.\n\nThe build-up felt formidable: the promise of a zeitgeisty, unapologetically raunchy stand-up comic and a screwball icon taking the female buddy comedy to the \u201cenne\u201d-th power. But what we\u2019ve gotten in \u201cSnatched\u201d is an uninspired, scattershot disaster romp that mostly serves the talents of one half of the marquee pairing, underuses the other half, and struggles to blend R-rated humor, foreign misadventure, and oil-and-water mother-daughter dynamic into a cohesive diversion.\n\nThere are plenty of worse comedies out there, but \u201cSnatched\u201d has that vexing air of disappointment to it.\n\nWatch Video: Amy Schumer and Goldie Hawn Have Got a Gun in New 'Snatched' Trailer\n\nIt also feels like three movies stitched together with hectoring and vagina jokes. The first is a snicker-worthy if tepid urban dating comedy that could just as easily have been a chunk on \u201cInside Amy Schumer.\u201d As self-centered Emily, fired from her retail job and dumped by her disengaged rock n\u2019 roll boyfriend (Randall Park) right before their planned vacation to Ecuador, Schumer is in familiar territory here, mining social embarrassment and misplaced ambition for queasy laughs. (Though it stretches credibility that even someone as clueless as Emily would not ask for time off from even a job she hates, as a joke establishing cluelessness, Schumer knows how to sell it.)\n\nEmily\u2019s last resort for licking her wounds is decamping to her mom\u2019s, with the expected judgment and frustration that entails. A onetime wild girl forced to become a single mom, Linda (Hawn) is now a cheery shut-in with lots of cats, an agoraphobic manboy for a live-in son (Ike Barinholtz), and a fear of what lies outside her suburban home. Emily hasn\u2019t always been on the best of terms with her, but desperate for a South American plus-one, she begs her mom to go, and in the interest of repairing a fractured relationship, Linda accepts.\n\nAlso Read: Can 'King Arthur' or 'Snatched' Dethrone 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol 2' at Box Office?\n\nMovie number two emerges, which is a predictable fish-out-of-water lark in sunny environs. Linda, swaddled in clothes and suspicious of everyone, can\u2019t relax at their fancy beachside resort, while Emily is ready for anything, especially after meeting a handsome, flirtatious stranger (Tom Bateman) at the hotel bar. After he escorts her to a nighttime forest bacchanale of drinking, dancing and Capoeira, he offers to take Emily and her mom on a culture-expanding excursion the next day.\n\nThe trip is a trap, however, and the women are summarily kidnapped, thrown into a dingy cell, and held for ransom by a ruthless sort named Morgado (Oscar Jaenada), who \u2014 if we\u2019re keeping tabs on Hollywood\u2019s representation of foreign lands \u2014 is the first native character, and one of the only ones, with more than three lines.\n\nWhat follows, once the women escape and must fend for themselves in the wilds of the Ecuador-Colombia border with a vengeful captor on their tail, is the third movie inside \u201cSnatched,\u201d a sputtering \u201cOutrageous Fortune\u201d update that you wish had more of the fleet, funny, even emotional crackle of \u201cRomancing the Stone.\u201d\n\nWatch Video: Amy Schumer's Dad Cries When He Meets His Idol, Goldie Hawn\n\nDirector Jonathan Levine (\u201c50/50,\u201d \u201cThe Night Before\u201d), no visual stylist, seems truly lost when the canvas of Katie Dippold\u2019s string-of-hazards screenplay grows from the usual two-person shticking \u2014 including a frequently returned-to gag in which Emily\u2019s distraught brother repeatedly calls a disinterested State Department employee (Bashir Salahuddin) \u2014 to include wacky doings (chases, killing, forced ziplining) in exotic locations. \u201cSnatched\u201d seems almost afraid of taking on any breadth or scope, or evoking anything like real peril.\n\nSave the occasionally jangly/funny setpiece \u2014 seeking help from a dubiously intrepid tour guide (Christopher Meloni), a tapeworm extraction by a friendly village doctor, and the rescue efforts of befriended lesbian couple Ruth (Wanda Sykes) and her mute ex-special forces partner Barb (a hilarious Joan Cusack) \u2014 \u201cSnatched\u201d never finds solid comedic footing.\n\nThe biggest casualty on that front is how thinly drawn Hawn\u2019s character is, and how weakly the issues between Emily and Linda play out when \u201cSnatched\u201d takes a breath between mishaps to find real feeling. Schumer has plenty of room to mine Emily\u2019s many faults for uncomfortable laughs, and even genuine hurt as an emotional mess looking for respect rather than evaluation in her mother\u2019s eyes. (She was similarly affecting in \u201cTrainwreck\u201d\u2018s daughter scenes.) But it\u2019s a one-sided affair, with Hawn hamstrung by \u201ctold you so\u201d reactions and displays of matriarchal strength that any actress her age could pull off.\n\nConsidering this sun-kissed Oscar winner\u2019s \u201970s-\u201980s heyday at the forefront of fizzy movie comedy, it\u2019s surprising she gets hardly any chances to turn Linda into her own agent of silly mayhem. Though you can see real fondness between the veteran and the up-and-comer as they go through the motions of frazzledness and reconciliation, \u201cSnatched\u201d doesn\u2019t do their matchup any favors.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/AmySchumer.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png",
