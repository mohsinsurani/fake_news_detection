A week before the wedding, as worldwide anticipation reached a fever pitch, Kate reportedly made a special trip with William to Diana\u2019s burial site\u2014venturing 90 minutes\u2019 northwest of London to the 13,000-acre Althorp Estate that has belonged to the Spencer family since the 16th century. The pair reportedly took a boat to lay flowers at Diana\u2019s Oval Island resting place; wandered the princess\u2019s ancestral estate; and walked through the arboretum where William and Harry planted trees as children.\n\n\u201cIt was very important for William to take Kate to visit his mum just before their wedding day,\u201d a source told The Mirror at the time. \u201cDiana is still a huge part of her boy\u2019s everyday life and always will be. Even though Kate never met Diana she knows what an incredible woman she was and it is very important to her she can share and understand William\u2019s love and grief for his mum. . . . It is tragic that she won\u2019t be there to see the wedding and that she never got to meet his bride.\u201d\n\nThe tributes continued. Though William and Kate married at a different site than Charles and Diana\u2014Charles, an architecture and music buff, had opted for the more handsome, acoustically sound St. Paul\u2019s Cathedral\u2014the bride and groom incorporated other homages. Like Diana, Kate had a small blue bow sewn into her wedding dress for good luck, and antique lace repurposed in the design as her \u201csomething old.\u201d (Aside from those touches\u2014plus the white color, long sleeves, and gauzy veil\u2014there were few other similarities between Kate and Diana\u2019s wedding dresses. Kate\u2019s gown\u2014a Sarah Burton for Alexander McQueen design, rumored to cost $434,000, was an elegant A-line, with an elaborate bodice appliqu\u00e9 woven with shamrock, roses, and lilies, and a nine-foot train.)", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ae0ce4ea342ec2552ce8866/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tout-and-lede-diana-and-kate.jpg",
