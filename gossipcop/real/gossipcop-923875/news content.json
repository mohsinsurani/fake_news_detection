Morrison played Emma Swan in the series, while Goodwin played Snow White/Mary Margaret Blanchard. Dallas starred as Prince Charming/David Nolan, and de Ravin played Belle/Lacey.\n\nThe four are the latest former cast members to book returns for the show\u2019s finale. Previously, Tony Amendola, Lee Arenberg, JoAnna Garcia Swisher, Robbie Kay, Sean Maguire, Victoria Smurfit, Keegan Tracy, Beverley Elliott, and Jared Gilmore were all confirmed to appear in the final two episodes.\n\nABC announced in February that \u201cOnce Upon a Time\u2019s\u201d seventh season would be the show\u2019s last. The seventh season was a creative reboot for the show, which lost core cast members like Morrison when their contracts ended after the sixth season. The show also moved from its longtime Sunday night timeslot to Fridays, where it has suffered a noticeable ratings decline. Season 7 is currently averaging a 0.5 rating in adults 18-49 and 2.4 million viewers, down over 40% in the demo and over 20% in total viewers from Season 6.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=1000"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Joe Otterson"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/once-upon-a-time-series-finale-jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin-josh-dallas-emilie-de-ravin-1202732727/", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Series Finale to Bring Back Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "\"Once Upon a Time\" is bringing back a host of familiar faces for the show's upcoming series finale.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202732727, "author": "Joe Otterson", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-03-21T13:00:12"}, "pmc-tag": "ABC,Jennifer Morrison,Once Upon A Time", "title": "\u2018Once Upon a Time\u2019 Series Finale to Bring Back Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "tv", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "tv", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Joe Otterson", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "application-name": "Variety", "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/once-upon-a-time-series-finale-jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin-josh-dallas-emilie-de-ravin-1202732727/?ia_markup=1"}, "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202732727, "title": "'Once Upon a Time' Series Finale to Bring Back Jennifer Morrison, Ginnifer Goodwin", "published_at": "2018-03-21 13:00:12", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/jennifer-morrison-ginnifer-goodwin.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 28, "tags": "Once Upon A Time", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "\"Once Upon a Time\" is bringing back a host of familiar faces for the show's upcoming series finale.\r\n\r\nFormer \"Once Upon a Time\" stars Jennifer Morrison, Ginner Goodwin, Josh Dallas, and\u00a0Emilie de Ravin have all been confirmed to return for the show's final episode, which is set to air on May 18.\r\n\r\nAll four of the actors departed the ABC fairy tale series after its sixth season.
