Based on the beloved 2007 Pixar film \"Ratatouille,\" the new dark ride officially opened on Oct. 1 at Epcot as part of the expansion to the France World Showcase pavilion.\n\nRemy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure is a family-friendly attraction where guests feel as if they shrink to the size of a rat and race through Gusteau\u2019s restaurant in the newly expanded France pavilion at EPCOT at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Harrison Cooney/Courtesy of Disney\n\nThe \"Ratatouille\"-themed attraction first debuted in Walt Disney Studios Park at Disneyland Paris in 2014, and the Epcot version is nearly identical. To reach the attraction, guests will wander through the beautiful new expansion of the France pavilion, where they'll find a new crepe restaurant, La Cr\u00eaperie de Paris, and whimsical architecture inspired by the film (unique details include a fountain featuring bursting Champagne bottles and Remy). After entering through a Parisian theater, guests will follow the queue to the rooftops of Paris, where they'll put on 3D glasses and board trackless ride vehicles shaped like rats.\n\nGuests enter a French artist\u2019s loft featuring French-inspired paintings, cupboards filled with art supplies and two magical canvases that come to life in the queue for Remy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure in EPCOT at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Matt Stroshane/Courtesy of Disney\n\nGuests will experience the sights, sounds, and even smells as they scurry through Gusteau's restaurant with a combination of physical sets and 3D scenes. Ride vehicles move and tilt to create a more immersive experience, and the result is an adorable attraction that captures the fun, whimsy, and magic of the film.\n\nThe family-friendly attraction is a welcome addition to the World Showcase; this Epcot area is known for its internationally inspired eats and drinks in 11 beautiful pavilions. Before this attraction opened, there were only two rides at the World Showcase: the Gran Fiesta Tour Starring the Three Caballeros and Frozen Ever After. The addition of this attraction (on the opposite side of World Showplace) offers another Disney movie-inspired experience in the area and gives ride-loving guests (and kids who might not appreciate the varied food and beverage options as much as an action-packed attraction) something else to look forward to on their trip around the lagoon.\n\nRemy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure is a family-friendly attraction where guests feel as if they shrink to the size of a rat and race through Gusteau\u2019s restaurant in the newly expanded France pavilion at EPCOT at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Harrison Cooney/Courtesy of Disney\n\nTom Fitzgerald, portfolio creative executive at Walt Disney Imagineering, told Travel + Leisure that while the shopping, culture, and dining found at the World Showcase is a beloved part of Epcot's DNA, they wanted to add something new for families with younger kids. So, Fitzgerald asked, why not add storytelling to the celebration of architecture, music, history, and culture that has been a part of this park since day one?\n\nPixar and Walt Disney Studios filmmakers \"look to countries around the world for inspiration to tell stories, and these stories are wonderful, so why can't they become part of it?\" said Fitzgerald. So, they looked to films where a country became a major character \u2014 an integral part of the story \u2014 and landed on bringing Disneyland Paris' \"Ratatouille\"-themed attraction to the France pavilion at Epcot.\n\nFitzgerald continued, saying that the addition of these attractions \"broadens what World Showcase is.\" He added, \"I hope we continue in the future, as these great movies that are love letters to these countries come out, that we add them... It will help Epcot continue to grow.\"\n\nThe iconic Gusteau\u2019s restaurant sign hangs in the distance past the Remy\u2019s Ratatouille Adventure attraction in the newly expanded France pavilion at EPCOT at Walt Disney World Resort in Lake Buena Vista, Fla. Harrison Cooney/Courtesy of Disney\n\n\"The World's Most Magical Celebration,\" an 18-month long event celebrating Disney World's 50th anniversary, kicks off on Oct. 1 with the official opening of this attraction and many more exciting happenings, including the debut of two new nighttime spectaculars (at Epcot and Magic Kingdom), new food and beverages options, and more.\n\nElizabeth Rhodes is an associate digital editor at Travel + Leisure who loves all things theme parks.
