Some background information to know about Rae is that she is a huge Drake fan.\n\nShe\u2019s so much of a fan that she puts the rapper\u2019s lyrics into every episode of Insecure as sort of an easter egg for fans to listen for. She told Hot New Hip Hop doing, \u201cthat was a personal thing for me, but that\u2019s not something that we bang you over the head with.\u201d\n\nSupposedly at the after party, E!
