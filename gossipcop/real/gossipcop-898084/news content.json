She is extremely overjoyed, but if she\u2019s being honest, due to the fact that she had a miscarriage the last time she was pregnant, she\u2019s pretty much terrified at the moment that it will happen again. She feels weird even announcing this at all, and would rather wait until her child heads off to college to tell anyone, but she figures she should probably share this news before someone sees her waddling around with her mid-section protruding and announces it first.'\n\n\"All I really know for sure is that this experience has changed me forever. I know it\u2019s made me grateful for every moment of my current pregnancy, and I hope it will make me a better mother in some capacity when I can finally hold the child that has been in my heart in my arms,\" she added. \"To all the women out there who are dealing with fertility issues, have gone through a miscarriage or are going through the pain of it currently, allow me to leave you with this message: You are not alone. And, it is perfectly OK to not be OK right now.\"\n\nRead her entire piece here, and watch the video below for more.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'Big Bang Theory' Star Melissa Rauch Announces Pregnancy, Candidly Discusses Painful Past Miscarriage\n\n'Big Bang Theory' Star Melissa Rauch Is Pregnant!
