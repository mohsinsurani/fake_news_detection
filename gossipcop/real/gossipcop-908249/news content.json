News cohost Giuliana Rancic with a laugh on the red carpet at the 2018 SAG Awards. When Bibb chimed in, \u201cAnd a healthy sense of humor,\u201d her boyfriend added, \u201cYes, humor is important. She\u2019s very funny.\u201d\n\nLater that night, Rockwell elaborated on his love for the model. \u201cShe\u2019s my beloved,\u201d he told Us. \u201cShe keeps me laughing. \u2026 She\u2019s really talented and funny herself. She reminds me of a young Mary Tyler Moore.\u201d\n\nThe pair met in Los Angeles in 2007 while he was filming Frost/Nixon. The Moon actor previously dated Piper Perabo, while Bibb was married to businessman Rob Born from 2003 to 2004.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/902360942_leslie-bibb-sam-rockwell-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/902360942_leslie-bibb-sam-rockwell-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/902360942_leslie-bibb-sam-rockwell-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sam-rockwell-reveals-his-relationship-rule-with-leslie-bibb/", "title": "Sam Rockwell Reveals His Relationship \u2018Rule\u2019 With Leslie Bibb", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Exclusive", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Sam Rockwell opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about keeping the romance alive with his girlfriend, Leslie Bibb \u2014 find out what he said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sam Rockwell: This Is My Relationship \u2018Rule\u2019 With Leslie Bibb", "description": "Sam Rockwell opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about keeping the romance alive with his girlfriend, Leslie Bibb \u2014 find out what he said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sam-rockwell-reveals-his-relationship-rule-with-leslie-bibb/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-06-04T17:08:00+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/902360942_leslie-bibb-sam-rockwell-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/902360942_leslie-bibb-sam-rockwell-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-06-04T17:08:00+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sam Rockwell: This Is My Relationship \u2018Rule\u2019 With Leslie Bibb", "description": "Sam Rockwell opened up to Us Weekly exclusively about keeping the romance alive with his girlfriend, Leslie Bibb \u2014 find out what he said", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/902360942_leslie-bibb-sam-rockwell-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528132080.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
