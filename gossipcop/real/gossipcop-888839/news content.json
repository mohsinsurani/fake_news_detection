She said she considered undergoing IVF with her third husband, Mark Levinson, when she first started filming the HBO series, but reconsidered after experiencing grueling working hours.\n\n\"That was my early 40s and I had just started filming Sex and the City, the chances of getting pregnant with these procedures was, everyone was talking about it,\" Cattrall recalled. \"But, I thought to myself, \u2018Wow, I have 19-hour days on this series. I have weekends where I finish at Saturday morning. My Monday morning would start at 4.45 a.m. and go to one or two in the morning.\"\n\n\"How could I possible continue to do that, especially in my early 40s?\" she continued. \"And then I realized what a commitment it was just to do the procedures. I thought, 'I don\u2019t think this is going to happen.' It was the first moment -- it was extraordinary -- in my life where I thought, 'Maybe I\u2019m just not going to do this.'\"\n\nCattrall said she now dedicates herself to mentoring young actresses.\n\n\"Yes, I think it\u2019s part of being a woman to have that,\" she replied when asked if she felt maternal. \"But obviously fate, timing, luck, destiny -- I don\u2019t know -- and that\u2019s when I started mentoring young actresses. In particular, that\u2019s where I thought I have a place to be a mom here -- not a biological mom, but a mom and an auntie and a friend.\"\n\n'Sex and the City' Actor Seemingly Shades 'Toxic' Kim Cattrall With Tweet\n\nEarlier this month, Cattrall clapped back at a fan on Twitter, and said she was moving on from playing her SATC character, Samantha.\n\nWatch below:", "images": ["https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566846.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-569414.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566425.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567192.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566171.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566831.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Kaye_GettyImages-1429667472_300.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=79-eWDg7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sexandthecity_gettyimages-102887911_0.jpg?h=64010ded&itok=xTFXRApP", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567063.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566844.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567203.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567230.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567075.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%202.01.34%20PM.png?h=597e033f&itok=1KV1Fu0Z", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567824.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567077.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566814.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-570909.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566845.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-571432.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1280x720/public/brightcove/videos/images/posters/KIMINTHECITY.jpg?h=469ef122&itok=-mQH-065", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566030.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sexandthecity_gettyimages-102887911_0.jpg?h=64010ded&itok=xTFXRApP", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Antoinette Bueno"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-cattrall-says-shes-never-been-friends-her-sex-and-city-co-stars-89699", "title": "Kim Cattrall Says She's 'Never Been Friends' With Her 'Sex and the City' Co-Stars", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "Kim Cattrall is getting candid about her real-life relationship with her 'Sex and the City' co-stars.", "keywords": "News, TV, Kim Cattrall, Sex and the City", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-cattrall-says-shes-never-been-friends-her-sex-and-city-co-stars-89699", "title": "Kim Cattrall Says She's 'Never Been Friends' With Her 'Sex and the City' Co-Stars", "description": "Kim Cattrall is getting candid about her real-life relationship with her 'Sex and the City' co-stars.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sexandthecity_gettyimages-102887911_0.jpg?h=64010ded&itok=xTFXRApP", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Kim Cattrall is getting candid about her real-life relationship with her 'Sex and the City' co-stars.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Kim Cattrall Says She's 'Never Been Friends' With Her 'Sex and the City' Co-Stars", "creator": "Antoinette Bueno\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kim-cattrall-says-shes-never-been-friends-her-sex-and-city-co-stars-89699", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-10/sexandthecity_gettyimages-102887911_0.jpg?h=64010ded&itok=xTFXRApP"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
