According to Entertainment Weekly, Fonda revealed plans for the trio to team up for a modern revival.\n\n\u201cMy role is as an executive producer, and I\u2019m working with the writers, with Lily, and talking to the writers,\u201d Fonda told reporters at the Television Critics Association panel. \u201cRight now, Dolly, Lily and I are all intending to be in it.\u201d\n\nThe film, said Fonda, will tackle current issues in the workplace like changing technology and corporate voyeurism.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry to say the situation is worse today,\u201d she said. \u201cToday a lot of the workforce is hired by an outside company. Who do you talk to if you have a problem?\u201d\n\nRumors of a remake swirled earlier this year when it was revealed that Rashida Jones and the original screenwriter, Patricia Resnick, teamed up to co-write a script. At the time, Parton was eager to reprise her role for a follow-up film.\n\n\u201cAll these years we\u2019ve talked about doing a sequel to 9 to 5 and it never made any real sense until just recently,\u201d Parton said to Entertainment Weekly previously. \u201cWe decided that we are going to do another one. We are trying to get the script and all that, everyone is very interested and we\u2019ve all agreed that we\u2019d love to do it if it\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nAdded Parton, \u201cI told them we better get after it or it\u2019s going to be 95 instead of 9 to 5.\u201d\n\nNo word on when production for 9 to 5 will begin for Parton, but in the meantime, the Tennessee native has her hands full with several major projects. In addition to acting, Parton\u2019s production company, Dixie Pixie Productions, has teamed up with Warner Bros. Television and Netflix to create eight original films based on her music. The films are set to air on Netflix in 2019.", "images": ["https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Dolly-Parton-9-to-5-1532613478.jpg", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/themes/soundslikenashville-v2/assets/images/brand/logo-mini-w.png", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/themes/soundslikenashville-v2/assets/images/brand/logo-main.png", "https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=X2NWm1aMp4Z352", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=260180471043367&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII=", "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/11/Store-Ad-1573510267.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Dolly-Parton-9-to-5-1532613478.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/dolly-parton-return-9-5-sequel/", "title": "Dolly Parton to Return for '9 to 5' Sequel with Original Costars", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "It's official - Jane Fonda has confirmed plans for herself, Dolly Parton and Lily Tomlin to return for a sequel to their movie, 9 to 5!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Dolly Parton to Return for '9 to 5' Sequel with Original Costars", "description": "It's happening!", "url": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/news/dolly-parton-return-9-5-sequel/", "site_name": "Sounds Like Nashville", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.soundslikenashville.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/FB-Dolly-Parton-9-to-5-1532613478.jpg", "width": 599, "height": 316, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/soundslikenashville", "author": "lafferlauren", "published_time": "2018-07-26T16:02:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-27T14:55:46+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@laurlaff1", "site": "@SoundsLikeNash", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Lauren Laffer", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "generator": "WordPress 5.9.2", "p": {"domain_verify": "99dae4a28a5644b1db204730b5be7ccc"}, "fb": {"pages": 58155286816}, "google-site-verification": "UIk94odLuKBOAyMvPay3LTMGDzELhrLFtwppaywdaiw"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532620923.0, "source": "http://www.soundslikenashville.com", "summary": ""}
