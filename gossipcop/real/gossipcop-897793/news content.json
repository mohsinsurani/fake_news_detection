When all is said and done, 25 different pieces will make up the entire image. Now that is a puzzle we don't mind putting together!\n\nOn the first day of Christmas, Kardashian's youngest child, Saint, stole the show.\n\n25 DAYS OF CHRISTMAS BY @EliLinnetz pic.twitter.com/jPAJNyj6C0 \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) December 1, 2017\n\nDay two was all about North featuring a bit of Kim and Kourtney Kardashian.\n\nDAY 2 pic.twitter.com/TW4nQhKaab \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) December 2, 2017\n\nAnd on Dec. 3, 2017, it was Reign Disick who took center stage.\n\nDAY 3 pic.twitter.com/cPEbAcruap \u2014 Kim Kardashian West (@KimKardashian) December 3, 2017\n\nIn November 2017, the mom of two revealed to Entertainment Tonight that she was in charge of this year's card but definitely wasn't planning on doing it ever again.\n\n\"Just to wrangle ever single family member was so exhausting. I thought it would be really easy. It was really tough. But it'll be a good one this year, I think our best yet,\" she said.\n\n\"It definitely gave me a little bit of anxiety with all the kids running around just thinking, 'Holy sh*t. How am I going to do three kids?' I'm really freaking out,\" she admitted. \"It was kind of a freak-out moment for me.\"\n\nSo far, we've only seen the kids of the Kardashian-Jenner clan. It will be interesting to see whether or not we get a glimpse of Kylie or Khloe's baby bump in the photo\u2014or, better yet, a pregnancy announcement within the card.\n\nWhile we wait and see who will be the next family member to pop up on Kardashian's quasi advent calendar, read up on why we're worried about Kylie Jenner's baby.", "images": ["https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nicki-swift-icon-white.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_black.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/nickiswift_logo_white_2.svg", "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/kim-kardashian-teases-family-christmas-card-like-an-advent-calendar/intro-1512341048.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/kim-kardashian-teases-family-christmas-card-like-an-advent-calendar/intro-1512341048.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Briana Trusty"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nickiswift.com/98759/kim-kardashian-teases-family-christmas-card-like-advent-calendar/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Teases Family Christmas Card Like An Advent Calendar", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/kim-kardashian-teases-family-christmas-card-like-an-advent-calendar/intro-1512341048.jpg", "title": "Kim Kardashian Teases Family Christmas Card Like An Advent Calendar - Nicki Swift", "description": "It's beginning to look a lot like a Kardashian Christmas.", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.nickiswift.com/98759/kim-kardashian-teases-family-christmas-card-like-advent-calendar/", "site_name": "NickiSwift.com"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "thumbnail": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/kim-kardashian-teases-family-christmas-card-like-an-advent-calendar/intro-1512341048.jpg", "twitter": {"title": "Kim Kardashian Teases Family Christmas Card Like An Advent Calendar - Nicki Swift", "description": "It's beginning to look a lot like a Kardashian Christmas.", "site": "@NickiSwiftCeleb", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://www.nickiswift.com/img/gallery/kim-kardashian-teases-family-christmas-card-like-an-advent-calendar/intro-1512341048.jpg"}, "title": "Kim Kardashian Teases Family Christmas Card Like An Advent Calendar - Nicki Swift", "description": "It's beginning to look a lot like a Kardashian Christmas.", "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-03T17:47:24+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-06-22T13:26:07+00:00", "author": "Briana Trusty"}, "fb": {"pages": 915319058545299, "use_automatic_ad_placement": "enable=true ad_density=default"}, "p": {"domain_verify": "f7a286f935bd433580c2d31f5d66fea9"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512323244.0, "source": "https://www.nickiswift.com", "summary": ""}
