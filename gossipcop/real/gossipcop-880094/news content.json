The biggest stars in television make sure to pull out all the style stops on the carpet. And leading up to the show, celebs tap their army of stylists, makeup artists, estheticians and hair stylists to get them primped and ready to go for biggest night in television. Everyone from Heidi Klum to Oprah can\u2019t help but share behind-the-scenes sneak peeks at what it\u2019s like to get ready for a big awards show, from getting their nails primped to sneaking in a quick facial to look red carpet ready.\n\nOutstanding Lead Actress nominee (she\u2019s also up for Outstanding Drama Series) Elisabeth Moss started her Sunday morning early with celeb-loved skincare specialist Joanna Vargas. The master facialist massaged in a depuffing sheet mask over the actress\u2019s eyes so any dark circles will disappear by the time she hits the red carpet tonight.\n\nWATCH: Fabulous Feathers and Radiant Rainbow Gowns Dominate the 2017 Emmy Awards Red Carpet\n\n\u201cTotally normal Sunday, nothing unusual happening here\u2026 \ud83d\udc81\ud83c\udffc @joannavargasnyc #emmys#handmaidstale,\u201d Moss captioned the photo.\n\nProject Runway host Heidi Klum always loves sharing getting ready Instagram videos with her fans as she preps for shows. So of course, she didn\u2019t hold back for the Emmys. Klum showed off her bare skin at the start of the video, then hyperlapsed through her lengthy glam routine with makeup artist Linda Hay and hair stylist Lorenzo Martin (who used Kenra Professional haircare products to style her locks!).\n\nLooking for more style content?

And Winfrey\u2019s all about keeping it real, admitting \u201cit\u2019s a process y\u2019all\u201d on an Instagram shot getting a pedicure. \u201cNow onto the nail and feet thang with @footnanny,\u201d she said.\n\nNot long after, the star sat in the makeup chair getting glam on for the show. Her makeup artist Derrick Rutledge used a light nude pencil to highlight under Winfrey\u2019s brow bones and down the center of her nose. \u201cLet the facebeat begin!\u201d she said.\n\nRELATED PHOTOS: Editors\u2019 Picks!

Before hitting the red carpet, the star showed off his dapper purple paisley suit jacket to his fans on Twitter, then posed for a quick photo op with his dad, who\u2019s his date for the evening.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m getting ready for the Emmys. See I haven\u2019t really got my bow tie on yet, but I got the jacket on, the pants, the shoes, yeah. So we\u2019re gonna have time right? And hopefully we get an award!\u201d McLaughlin said.\n\nInstead of simply showing us how she got ready for the Emmys, Black-ishstar Tracee Ellis Ross took a different approach by singing an impromptu song on Instagram about how she got prepped.\n\n\u201cGood morning. Hello. I wanted to do a little song. I have done a mask. I\u2019ve done two. I have hydrated. I\u2019ve shaved. I\u2019ve bathed. I am making a video. Making a video!

Hair stylist Adir Abergel posted the star\u2019s hairstyle mid-way through, captioning the photo, \u201cCan\u2019t wait to share the final look with you.\u201d\n\nBut once Biel headed to the carpet, she faced a dilemma in her car: the AC went out! \u201cWhen the AC is broken en route to the Emmy\u2019s you thank God for the ice in your drank. #emmys\u201d the actress shared as she struggled to stay cool in the L.A. heat.\n\nLea Michele couldn\u2019t hold back her excitement for the show, posting a selfie with her BFF and hair stylist Sarah Potempa and makeup artist M\u00e9lanie Inglessis getting her ready for the show by blending in her foundation with the MakeupDrop silicone sponge. \u201cIt\u2019s almost time! \u2728 #GlamSquad #Emmys,\u201d Michele captioned the photo.\n\nIt looks like Orange Is The New Black star and nominee Uzo Aduba\u2018s keeping her hair coily and natural, just like Union, but posted a Boomerang on Instagram as she got her brows touched up. \u201cIt\u2019s that time, ladies and gentlemen!
