She\u2019s the love of my life, but I just try to do everything to be there for her, but there\u2019s literally no appreciation for anything ever.\u2019\n\nHowever, Scott owned up to the breakdown of the long term relationship and was adamant that the 37-year-old was not aware about how much she means to him.\n\n\u2018I just hope that one day she understands that I would never want to be with anybody but her.\u2019\n\nScott and Kourtney are parents to 7-year-old Mason, Penelope, 4 and 2-year-old Reign.\n\nMORE : Watch Kylie Jenner \u2018rap\u2019 along to Tyga\u2019s new track despite claims that the couple split\n\nMORE : Madonna threw shade at Pepsi after Kendall Jenner fiasco in the slickest way ever", "images": ["https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/ipso-logo.jpg", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Metro-56e2.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/470328450.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C617", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michaels-Bar-6a30.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BHM-0569.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scott.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C56px%2C1024px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png"], "top_img": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scott.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C56px%2C1024px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Elizabeth Adetula"], "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/04/06/scott-disick-admits-he-still-gets-turned-on-by-ex-kourtney-kardashian-6558761/", "title": "Scott Disick admits he still gets \u2018turned on\u2019 by ex Kourtney Kardashian", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/scott.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C56px%2C1024px%2C538px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "title": "Scott Disick admits he still gets 'turned on' by ex Kourtney Kardashian", "description": "Blimey.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160}, "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "description": "Scott Disick has admitted that he still has the hump for Kourtney Kardashian.
