That dangerous friendship, burning away \u2013 who else will be lost to the flames?\"\n\nWe have to give full marks to the fans who already called this a couple of weeks ago, after noticing clips in the trailers of Missy lying on what looked like a piano (below) just like the one the Doctor gave his captive at the end of episode 4.\n\nOf course, there are still plenty of mysteries and surprises still to come in this series, from the identity of the evil monks and the return of John Simm\u2019s Master to why we keep seeing Peter Capaldi\u2019s Doctor regenerating early, not to mention how exactly Missy will play into the wider action when she finally escapes/is released from the vault.\n\nBut for now, we\u2019re just basking in the metaphorical light of ONE mystery finally solved. As the Doctor would be sure to testify, it\u2019s nice to be out of the dark once in a while.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nDoctor Who continues on BBC1 on Saturday 27th May at the later time of 7.45pm", "images": ["https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2021/07/radiotimescom-logo2-2c180e8.png?quality=90&resize=120,23", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/05/138071.b974bfa5-c716-4061-a0f9-ff8c18dcfe3f.jpg?resize=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2022/05/001-SE-2-3-Cover-page-001-4f5ace0-e1654865469212.jpg?quality=90&resize=75,68", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/05/137008.4410823d-4f61-474e-914f-735fa96bbd86.jpg?quality=90&fit=620,413", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/08/cropped-radiotimes-header-logo-ad1202c.png?quality=90&resize=220,46", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2019/12/ipso-sq-7800070.png?quality=90&resize=80,80", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2022/10/Marvellous-square-ee54d11.jpg?quality=90&resize=93,84", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2021/07/radiotimescom-logo2-2c180e8.png?quality=90&resize=600,113", "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/05/138071.b974bfa5-c716-4061-a0f9-ff8c18dcfe3f.jpg?resize=620,413?quality=90&resize=620,414"], "top_img": "https://images.immediate.co.uk/production/volatile/sites/3/2017/05/138071.b974bfa5-c716-4061-a0f9-ff8c18dcfe3f.jpg?resize=620,413", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Huw Fullerton"], "canonical_link": "https://www.radiotimes.com/tv/sci-fi/doctor-who-fans-correctly-guessed-who-was-hidden-in-the-vault/", "title": "Doctor Who fans correctly guessed who was hidden in the vault", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "title": "Doctor Who season 10: Vault mystery revealed!
