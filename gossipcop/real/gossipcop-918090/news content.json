I sent it to my fianc\u00e9 [Andrew Joblon] in the waiting room to show him that I was ok. I wasn\u2019t. I\u2019ve never felt more broken in my life. I debated sharing this so soon and I\u2019m still frightened about making such a private struggle public, but I\u2019m doing it anyway because it\u2019s important,\u201d she wrote in the emotional Instagram post.\n\nFollowing the procedure, Holt says she spent hours on the internet in search of similar stories from women, desperately seeking a community where she could feel comforted.\n\n\u201cAfter my D & C, I spent hours on the internet searching for women who had been through it. I was desperate to find someone, anyone, who could relate to what I was feeling. Someone to tell me that the depression and hopelessness were normal. That it wasn\u2019t my fault. That I wasn\u2019t broken forever. I found a community of women who shared my exact experience. Who were open and vulnerable about miscarriage, something that isn\u2019t often or openly discussed. It breaks my heart to think that losing a baby feels like something we have to keep to ourselves. Why is it any different than the death of a loved one? How is it any less meaningful? Here is what I have learned as I begin to crawl out of the dark hole: support is everything,\u201d she wrote.\n\nShe also championed the support of her fianc\u00e9 Joblon.\n\n\u201cI could not have survived this without the unconditional love of my partner. Despite his pain, he was my rock and my safety net. I will never know how to thank him,\u201d she wrote.\n\nHolt shared several words of encouragement to those coping with pregnancy loss.\n\n\u201cTo anyone out there who has been through a miscarriage, I understand you,\u201d she said. \u201cI share every bit of your pain and you are not alone. Please be kind to yourself and I hope that you will be comfortable sharing your story too.\u201d\n\nHolt and Joblon got engaged in December 2017.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/gettyimages-695544388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/gettyimages-695544388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/03/gettyimages-695544388.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["March"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/03/05/originals-star-claire-holt-suffers-miscarriage/", "title": "\u2018Originals\u2019 star Claire Holt suffers miscarriage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
