You use extreme violence. You see a lot of people who never work again. For even speaking up the whole thing is that they cut your head off so that the next person doesn't speak.\"\n\nCrews said has plenty of supporters as well, like his Everybody Hates Chris co-star Imani Hakim and director Paul Feig, who tweeted in support of Crews earlier this month. \"What I've been doing is just exposing. If this is the end of my career, just end it now,\" Crews said. \"[Because] I'm [going to] keep living, I'm [going to] keep doing my thing. But if I don't do another Expendables, then let's not do another one. I'm OK with that.\"\n\n\"They don't want to see me comment, but I'm not going anywhere,\" he added. \"They lead this thing through shame. [They] shame you so you feel like you gotta hide in the house... [But] once you get rid of shame, you get to step off the slave plantation. And I get to be free. This is a good thing.\"\n\n(Lerner reportedly did not respond to requests for comment, according to BuzzFeed.)\n\nRead more stories about people speaking up about alleged sexual misconduct:\n\nWatch how this lupus advocate finds beauty in her illness:", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/6308e862dc0dd5dff43dca59/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5aac137756bb3c0877194751/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Terry%20Crews%202018.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/63346c7c628bb121dd55ff8e/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5aabde1d7a73fd2b02ff3aa4/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/terry-crews-wont-let-hollywood-silence-him.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6331c3e0c30da13c7dd6297a/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/631fa3cf7babfd3e0f994412/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5aac137756bb3c0877194751/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Terry%20Crews%202018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Emily Wang"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/terry-crews-alleged-sexual-assault-interview", "title": "Terry Crews Talks Backlash Against Sexual Assault Allegations", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "In a recent interview, Terry Crews opened up to \"BuzzFeed\" about why he will continue to speak out about his alleged sexual assault by agent Adam Venit, no matter how much pressure he receives to be silent.", "id": "5aabdfc70ac1d5278174d14d", "keywords": "snd,terry crews,sexual assault,sexual harassment,#metoo,time's up,sexual misconduct", "news_keywords": "snd,terry crews,sexual assault,sexual harassment,#metoo,time's up,sexual misconduct", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5aabdfc70ac1d5278174d14d", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In a recent interview, Terry Crews opened up to \\\"BuzzFeed\\\" about why he will continue to speak out about his alleged sexual assault by agent Adam Venit, no matter how much pressure he receives to be silent.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5aabde1d7a73fd2b02ff3aa4/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/terry-crews-wont-let-hollywood-silence-him.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5aabde1d7a73fd2b02ff3aa4/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/terry-crews-wont-let-hollywood-silence-him.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The actor called Hollywood a \"very violent place.\"", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5aac137756bb3c0877194751/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Terry%20Crews%202018.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Terry Crews Opens Up About Hollywood's Backlash Toward His Sexual Assault Allegations", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/terry-crews-alleged-sexual-assault-interview"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-03-16T18:59:03.811Z", "modified_time": "2018-03-16T18:59:03.811Z", "author": "Emily Wang"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "The actor called Hollywood a \"very violent place.\"", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5aac137756bb3c0877194751/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Terry%20Crews%202018.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Terry Crews Opens Up About Hollywood's Backlash Toward His Sexual Assault Allegations"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1521226743.811, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
