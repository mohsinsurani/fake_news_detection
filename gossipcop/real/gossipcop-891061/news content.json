That\u2019s what Channing Tatum, Pink, Jimmy Kimmel, and a whole bunch of other parents did recently for a hilarious section of the Jimmy Kimmel show (which Channing has recently been guest-hosting), and the results are just as funny (or as mean, depending on your outlook), as you\u2019d expect. Scroll down to see for yourself. Some of the responses are predictable, but others might just surprise you\u2026(h/t: 22words)\n\nThere\u2019s nothing scarier for a kid on Halloween than being told that all of their candy has been eaten\n\nSo that\u2019s exactly what Channing Tatum, Pink, and Jimmy Kimmel did to their children recently!\n\nPink tried the same thing with her daughter Willow\n\n\u201cLast night, while you were sleeping, mommy and I ate all of your Halloween candy,\u201d Jimmy Kimmel told his daugher\n\nSome people found the prank mean and unfair\n\nOthers however thought it was just some light-hearted fun\n\nWhat do you think?", "images": ["https://www.boredpanda.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/people-not-realizing-who-they-are-talking-latest.jpg",
