But not on the small screen.\n\nFocus Features announced Friday it has set an official production timeline for a cinematic continuation of the beloved British television series, one that will release in theaters with key members of the show\u2019s principal cast returning for the project.\n\nThough an official cast list has yet to be revealed, EW has learned Michelle Dockery, Hugh Bonneville, Maggie Smith, and Joanne Froggatt \u2014 each of whom have appeared in the PBS series since its first season back in 2010 \u2014 will be among those coming back for the movie, which begins filming later this year. Focus Features and Universal Pictures International are distributing the film around the world.\n\nThe show\u2019s Oscar-winning creator Julian Fellowes wrote the film\u2019s screenplay and is set to produce the picture alongside Carnival Films\u2019 Gareth Naeme, Liz Trubridge, and executive producer Nigel Marchant. The Book Thief filmmaker Brian Percival, who helmed the show\u2019s pilot episode, will direct. Plot details are still under wraps.\n\nAcross six seasons of its original run, Downton Abbey \u2014 set in the wealthy Crawley family\u2019s country estate as it followed their intricate lives as well as those of the servants they employed at the turn of the 20th century \u2014 garnered a steady international following and sustained critical acclaim. It won three Golden Globes and 15 Emmys on top of 69 total nominations over the years.\n\n\u201cWhen the television series drew to a close it was our dream to bring the millions of global fans a movie and now, after getting many stars aligned, we are shortly to go into production,\u201d Naeme said of the film via press statement. \u201cJulian\u2019s script charms, thrills and entertains and in Brian Percival\u2019s hands we aim to deliver everything that one would hope for as Downton comes to the big screen.\u201d", "images":
