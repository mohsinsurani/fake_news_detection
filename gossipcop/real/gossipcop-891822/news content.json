That\u2019s because Chip and Joanna Gaines\u2019 new line, Hearth and Hand, will officially be launching at Target stores and Target.com.\n\nWhile we're still mourning the announcement that \"Fixer Upper\" is ending, Chip and Joanna Gaines have more in store for us. Nathan Congleton / NBC\n\nThe collection was created exclusively for Target in collaboration with the HGTV couple\u2019s home and lifestyle brand, Magnolia. From home decor to family sleepwear, the line features pieces in the rustic-chic style we\u2019ve come to love and expect from the duo \u2014 and at a fraction of the cost. For example, items like these embroidered placemats start at just $4.99. (Score!)\n\nThe icing on top of the Magnolia cake? The line comes at the perfect time for holiday shopping and decorating.

All I know is she\u2019s so excited about this collection that she wants to register for our wedding all over again.\u201d\n\nStoneware Dinner Plate, $5.99 Target\n\nThe line features over 300 pieces that includes everything from farmhouse-inspired dinnerware to a sweet wooden dollhouse.\n\nWooden Dollhouse with Furniture, $129.99 Target\n\n\u201cThe products were designed for everyday life and inspired by the moments in life that bring people together, so our hope is that these products help families do just that,\u201d Joanna said in a statement. \u201cThe idea that we can help make someone\u2019s home feel even more lovely and inviting for the holidays and beyond is something really special.\u201d\n\nCan\u2019t wait until the official launch to see what\u2019s in store? Target has released a sneak peek of the line. Below is just a sample of the items that will be available.\n\nGalvanized House Lantern, $32.99, Target\n\nTarget\n\nListed as one of Joanna\u2019s everyday favorites, this lantern can be paired with
