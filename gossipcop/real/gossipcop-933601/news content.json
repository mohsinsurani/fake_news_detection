So good catching up with these goofballs. All \u2764\u201d\n\nDobrev, 28, and Somerhalder, 38, met on the set of TV\u2019s \u201cVampire Diaries\u201d in 2009 and dated for over three years, calling it quits in 2013.\n\nWhen Dobrev decided to leave the show in 2015, rumors spread that she was leaving because of her ex and his whirlwind romance with the \u201cTwilight\u201d actress.\n\nReed also addressed the chatter on Tuesday. \u201cFor the last few years we thought addressing any baseless rumors with silence was the best way,\u201d Reed wrote on Instagram, \u201cSo here\u2019s to putting an end to all those fake stories of on set jealousy, betrayal, made-up-friendships lost & women hating women. Because at the end of the day, that\u2019s what this is about: teaching girls that you have to hate other girls only breeds a generation of women who believe you have to hate other women. And that\u2019s what these magazines, websites and blogs don\u2019t understand. That is the harmful unintended consequence of their bulls\u2013t stories and we have a moral responsibility to fix that. Let\u2019s turn this page together, as we all walk into the next chapter peacefully.\u201d\n\nSomerhalder and Reed began dating in 2014 and were engaged after just six months. The couple wed in April 2015.\n\n\u201cThey look happy and I am happy and so I don\u2019t see why there should be a problem with that,\u201d Dobrev said at the time, \u201cThe drama is in the media, it\u2019s not with us.\u201d\n\nDobrev was back on set in Georgia to film the \u201cVampire Diaries\u201d series finale.\n\n\u201cThis is my true final goodbye, as today I shot my last scene of the \u2018Vampire Diaries\u2019 forever,\u201d she wrote on Instagram on Monday, \u201cComing back for the series finale has been a whirlwind of emotion, nostalgia, love, tears of joy and bittersweet endings. It feels like the beautiful closure we all needed, myself included, and I couldn\u2019t have been happier to come home to be with my \u2018TVD\u2019 set family and friends.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/screen-shot-2017-02-07-at-2-25-36-pm.png?w=1172", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/02/screen-shot-2017-02-07-at-2-25-36-pm.png?w=1172", "keywords": [], "authors": ["February"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2017/02/07/nina-dobrev-hangs-with-ex-ian-somerhalder-and-wife-nikki-reed/", "title": "Nina Dobrev hangs with ex Ian Somerhalder and wife Nikki Reed", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
