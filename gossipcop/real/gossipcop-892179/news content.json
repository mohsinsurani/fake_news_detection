Amal Clooney stepped out in a stunning, loose-fitting two-piece dress for an event in Davos, Switzerland, on Tuesday, January 17, amid reports that she may be pregnant.\n\nThe 38-year-old human rights attorney looked poised in a flattering taupe-colored dress that cut away at the midriff to reveal a silvery-gray sheath material underneath. Her husband, George Clooney, opted for a classic black-on-black look for the Tina Brown\u2013helmed Women of Impact dinner.\n\nAlso in attendance at the high-profile dinner was outgoing Vice President Joe Biden, who sweetly greeted the Hollywood couple at the dinner.\n\nAmal has been dogged with reports of a possible pregnancy since she and Oscar winner George, 55, appeared at an L.A. screening for the Netflix documentary The White Helmets on Monday, January 9.\n\nThat night, the Lebanese-born lawyer ditched her signature figure-hugging outfits for a floral frock that hung loosely on her slender frame. Amal paired the dress with black tights and black booties. Shortly afterward, several outlets reported that Amal was not only pregnant, but pregnant with twins. (New York magazine, AOL.com and Lebanon\u2019s Daily Star are among those speculating the news.)\n\nThe famously private couple tied the knot in a lavish, star-studded ceremony in Venice, Italy, back in September 2014, after a brief courtship. They have largely kept the details of their relationship out of the public eye, though Clooney did slyly joke about their marriage in an interview with Entertainment Tonight in October 2016.\n\n\u201cAnd they said it wouldn\u2019t last,\u201d the Hail, Caesar! star joked at the time. \u201cAh, we proved them wrong!\u201d The Oscar winner added that the couple celebrated their two-year wedding anniversary in a very low-key way. \u201cWe mostly drank,\u201d he said. \u201cI [made] dinner and we had a nice, a very romantic second anniversary.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/amal-clooney-pregnancy-george-clooney-ddcc833f-e88a-47b2-ba00-ace0f77bf3e8.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C986px%2C518px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/amal-clooney-pregnancy-george-clooney-ddcc833f-e88a-47b2-ba00-ace0f77bf3e8.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C986px%2C518px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Joyce Chen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amal-clooney-steps-out-in-loose-fitting-dress-amid-pregnancy-rumors-w461629/", "title": "Amal Clooney Steps Out in Loose-Fitting Dress Amid Pregnancy Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Amal Clooney stepped out in a stunning, loose-fitting two-piece dress for an event in Switzerland on Tuesday, January 17, amid pregnancy rumors \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Amal Clooney Steps Out in Loose-Fitting Dress Amid Pregnancy Rumors", "description": "Amal Clooney stepped out in a stunning, loose-fitting two-piece dress for an event in Switzerland on Tuesday, January 17, amid pregnancy rumors \u2014 read more", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/amal-clooney-steps-out-in-loose-fitting-dress-amid-pregnancy-rumors-w461629/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:56:04+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/amal-clooney-pregnancy-george-clooney-ddcc833f-e88a-47b2-ba00-ace0f77bf3e8.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C986px%2C518px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/amal-clooney-pregnancy-george-clooney-ddcc833f-e88a-47b2-ba00-ace0f77bf3e8.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C986px%2C518px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-01-18T18:35:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:56:04+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Amal Clooney Steps Out in Loose-Fitting Dress Amid Pregnancy Rumors", "description": "Amal Clooney stepped out in a stunning, loose-fitting two-piece dress for an event in Switzerland on Tuesday, January 17, amid pregnancy rumors \u2014 read more", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/amal-clooney-pregnancy-george-clooney-ddcc833f-e88a-47b2-ba00-ace0f77bf3e8.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C986px%2C518px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1484764500.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
