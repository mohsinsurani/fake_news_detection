Just make sure they don\u2019t touch my two-egg scramble. I seem crazy, no? Clearly I\u2019m not having a good week. Adam, of three years, announces he went on a date, and that takes me by surprise. But it\u2019s not as surprising as the passive-aggressive digs my friend continues to make about me. I see you\u2026\n\nBethenny can invite whomever the hell she wants to Puerto Rico, but could it be that I didn\u2019t express any interest in going because she didn\u2019t express any interest in having me go? I didn\u2019t know she and Dorinda were going until they were already there. While she talks smack about me on the show, I\u2019m saying how proud I am of her. Wow\u2026at this point, I'm just sitting back with popcorn like the rest of you, watching this TV character (who I thought was a good friend) continue to take cheap shots. It\u2019s strange that she would say I have no interest in what is going on in Puerto Rico. I was writing checks. I\u2019d asked her many times how things were going. A good friend of mine works with Michael Capponi, and I connected her and Bethenny.\n\nOn the other hand, I really don\u2019t give a damn, because my actions speak for themselves. I won\u2019t bore you here recounting the endless places I\u2019ve been to or the stories I\u2019ve brought back exposing neglect, destruction, and people\u2019s sufferings. I did a story once on the landmine crisis, and the head of the campaign went on to win a Noble Peace prize. I\u2019m not bragging \u2014 it wasn\u2019t my prize \u2014 but I brought attention to a horrible atrocity, and a good thing happened as a result. It may not be private planes, cargo ships, and cash cards, but it\u2019s something.\n\nI am socially aware and politically active. Even when it is uncomfortable, as you saw last season, when I was part of a large \u201cget out the vote\u201d campaign for Hillary Clinton. I know, I know \u2014 I was wrong. Trump won. Sure, it didn\u2019t end as I would have liked (understatement), but I remain committed to the idea that good government will bring about good change. I am also grateful to private citizens like Bethenny who step up to fill in the gaping holes. I just don\u2019t understand why she\u2019s fully committed this season to talking about me as though I\u2019m a Miss America contestant who banged her prom date. Haahaahaaa.\n\nMaybe we\u2019ll find out next week.
