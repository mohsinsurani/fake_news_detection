Sorry, but after nine-plus months of pregnancy, it is seemingly impossible to bounce back like the Kylie Jenner\u2019s of the world. That kind of rebound must cost copious amounts of money and requires plenty of free time the average new mom won\u2019t have for another 18 years. Thankfully, among Hollywood\u2019s elite are the cool-moms with realistic body goals like Jessie James Decker. The now mother-of-three took to Instagram to share her postpartum tummy along with a friendly reminder to not be so hard on yourself\u2014we couldn\u2019t be more thrilled to see this beautiful star spit facts.\n\n\u201cKeepin it real! 3 weeks post and I\u2019m still very swollen. The 3rd has been by far the hardest recovery, but I\u2019m feeling stronger every day. Little Forrest is such an amazing baby and the easiest one of the 3. I\u2019ve updated you all throughout my entire pregnancy and how much my tummy/baby were growing monthly so I felt like I should share where I\u2019m at post baby,\u201d Decker writes.\n\nThe country singer and her NFL husband Eric Decker share three beautiful children together: Vivianne Rose, 4, Eric Jr., 2, and Forrest Bradley, who was born on March 31st of this year.\n\nDecker continued, \u201cIt sure is incredible what the body can do and I\u2019m so grateful! I know I say this after each baby but remember what our bodies just when[sic] through for 9 months and be proud, don\u2019t stress over post baby body, just enjoy your new baby because these are beautiful moments and memories you will cherish forever (aaaand drink your coffee to survive the no sleeping all night long ha!)\u201d\n\nPreach body positivity Decker! We couldn\u2019t have said it better ourselves. We shouldn\u2019t forget that Decker is not only fitness-obsessed (as seen on her show \u201cEric & Jessie\u201d) but she is also a South Beach Diet brand ambassador, and even she is setting realistic expectations despite the pressures of work and being in the public eye.\n\nHere's to hoping other women follow in Decker\u2019s footsteps by embracing the realities of postpartum life rather than promoting unhealthy standards for the female body. Thanks, Decker for your inspiring post and for always \u201cKeepin' it real!\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/week_by_week_card/public/shutterstock_457189861.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://www.parents.com/sites/parents.com/themes/parents/images/parenting_shop.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/week_by_week_card/public/images/p_101675201.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/scale_1500_1500/public/images/ptMXloNDE68ueQF10XvTxBWu1nTqmqmB.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.meredith.com/parents/images/marketing/Registration/OnsiteDefaults/200x100_11837_1_DSDFLT.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://c.betrad.com/pub/icon1.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/week_by_week_card/public/screen_shot_2016-12-05_at_12.43.07_pm.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/week_by_week_card/public/melissa_fumero.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/week_by_week_card/public/images/p_101963545.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/week_by_week_card/public/images/550_101917322.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/scale_1500_1500/public/images/ptMXloNDE68ueQF10XvTxBWu1nTqmqmB.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Pardee"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303/https://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/moms-dads/jessie-james-decker-is-keepin-it-real-3-weeks-postpartum-with/", "title": "Jessie James Decker Is 'Keepin' It Real' 3 Weeks Postpartum With a Meaningful, Body-Positive Instagram Post", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, maximum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=0", "googlebot-news": "noindex", "FacebookShareMessage": "The country music star took to social media just weeks after giving birth to her third child Forest Bradley Decker to share a dose of postpartum reality we can get behind.", "mdp": {"contentType": "story"}, "description": "The country music star took to social media just weeks after giving birth to her third child, Forest Bradley, to share a dose of postpartum reality we", "fb": {"admins": 1561750258, "app_id": 72125855925}, "og": {"site_name": "Parents", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303/https://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/moms-dads/jessie-james-decker-is-keepin-it-real-3-weeks-postpartum-with/", "title": "Jessie James Decker Is 'Keepin' It Real' 3 Weeks Postpartum With a Meaningful, Body-Positive Instagram Post", "description": "The country music star took to social media just weeks after giving birth to her third child, Forest Bradley, to share a dose of postpartum reality we", "updated_time": "2018-05-01T16:14:39-0400", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303im_/https://images.parents.mdpcdn.com/sites/parents.com/files/styles/scale_1500_1500/public/images/ptMXloNDE68ueQF10XvTxBWu1nTqmqmB.jpg", "video": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180502005303/https://www.parents.com/parenting/celebrity-parents/moms-dads/jessie-james-decker-is-keepin-it-real-3-weeks-postpartum-0/"}}, "article": {"section": "Parenting", "tag": "Babies", "published_time": "2018-04-30T13:20:21-0400", "modified_time": "2018-05-01T16:14:39-0400"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525108821.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
