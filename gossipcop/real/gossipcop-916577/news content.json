Getty Images\n\nWhich is how Winfrey came to taste her very first Auntie Anne's pretzel!\n\n\"One of my favorite things in our friendship is to teach her normal poor people [things],\" DuVernay recently told E! News. \"Like, if you're not a billionaire.\"\n\nShe explained that one day she was visiting Winfrey and shared an Auntie Anne's pretzel with her. \"She's [Oprah] like, 'Oh my gosh, this is incredible! What chef? What bakery?'\" recalled the director. \"And I said, 'It's called Auntie Anne's pretzels. It's just in the mall or the airport.\"\n\nJust a small selection of Auntie Anne's goodness.

The company, which has been around since 1988 and is based in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, now has over 600 locations around the globe.\n\nBut of course, they're not exactly a health food. As a Weight Watchers investor and spokeswoman, Winfrey has recently gotten into the comfort food business by putting a healthy spin on some classic dishes with her O, That's Good! food line \u2014 so we don't think she's been eating Auntie Anne's everyday.\n\nAuntie Anne's now has the Oprah seal of approval.

Having bit into her first one, Winfrey then had other questions, like, there are pretzel stands at the airport?\n\nAs DuVernay recalled, laughing, \"She's like, 'The airport?' and I'm like, 'So regular people have to walk through an airport to get to the flight usually.\"\n\nThat's one way to keep her grounded!\n\nFollow Randee Dawn on Twitter.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320841/auntie-annes-pretzels-today-inline-1-180227.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320842/auntie-annes-pretzels-today-inline-2-180227.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320885/oprah-tries-auntie-annes-today-tease-split-180227.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320843/oprah-and-ava-today-tease-1-180227.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320885/oprah-tries-auntie-annes-today-tease-split-180227.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Randee Dawn"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/food/oprah-tried-her-first-auntie-anne-s-pretzel-she-s-t123953", "title": "Oprah tried her first Auntie Anne's pretzel and she's in love", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/food/oprah-tried-her-first-auntie-anne-s-pretzel-she-s-t123953", "title": "Oprah tried her first Auntie Anne's pretzel and she's in love", "description": "We think Oprah now has a new favorite thing!", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320885/oprah-tries-auntie-annes-today-tease-split-180227.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320885/oprah-tries-auntie-annes-today-tease-split-180227.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@TODAYshow", "creator": "TodayShow", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x512_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_09/1320885/oprah-tries-auntie-annes-today-tease-split-180227.jpg", "title": "Oprah tried her first Auntie Anne's pretzel and she's in love", "description": "We think Oprah now has a new favorite thing!", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "The director of \"A Wrinkle in Time\" told E!
