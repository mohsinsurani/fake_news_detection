I was sore and it hurt to walk.\u201d\n\nThe next hearing in the case has been set for August 8.\n\nEarlier the model and entrepreneur appeared on \u201cGood Morning America\u201d with Bloom in an interview which aired Monday morning before the hearing.\n\nChyna told \u201cGMA\u201d she was \u201cdevastated\u201d by Kardashian\u2019s actions.\n\n\u201cLike, this is a person I trusted,\u201d she said. \u201cI just felt\u2026betrayed.\u201d\n\nShe denied claims she engaged with the photos by liking some of the images her ex posted, saying she has Kardashian blocked on Instagram.\n\nShe said she decided to pursue legal action after speaking with her former love with whom she shares an eight-month-old daughter, Dream.\n\n\u201cThe moral of the story is he doesn\u2019t respect me,\u201d said Chyna, whose real name is Angela White. \u201cIf you can\u2019t respect me, you have to respect the law.\u201d\n\nBloom said on Friday she had filed for a temporary restraining order against Kardashian on behalf of her client.\n\nRelated: Lisa Bloom puts Rob Kardashian on notice over tirade against Blac Chyna\n\nCalifornia has laws regarding \u201crevenge porn\u201d in which a person can be charged for publicly releasing unauthorized nude images of another person to cause them emotional distress.\n\nThe former couple has had a tumultuous relationship that\u2019s been documented on both social media and their E! reality series \u201cRob & Chyna.\u201d\n\nThings were also complicated by the fact Chyna shares a son with rapper Tyga, who left her to begin dating Kardashian\u2019s younger sister, Kylie Jenner.\n\nOn Monday\u2019s \u201cGMA\u201d appearance, Bloom defended Chyna against those who say the reality star already exposes a great deal of herself in her own social media postings.\n\n\u201cAny explicit photos that she may have chosen to post in the past that\u2019s her choice,\u201d Bloom said. \u201cThis is like saying that a woman can\u2019t be raped if she previously chose to have sex with someone. It\u2019s her body, it\u2019s her choice,each and every time.\u201d\n\nChyna said she and Kardashian split in December and there is absolutely no hope of a reconciliation. She said she has not heard from any of his family members since Kardashian\u2019s social media postings last Wednesday.\n\nChyna addressed speculation that she got pregnant as a revenge ploy against the Kardashians or to get money out of the reality mogul family, Chyna denied it.\n\n\u201cI was already Blac Chyna before the Kardsahians,\u201d she said.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929104601-lisa-france-profile-image.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order.jpg?q=x_3,y_156,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order.jpg?q=x_3,y_156,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/entertainment/blac-chyna-gma-restraining-order/index.html", "title": "Blac Chyna granted restraining order against Rob Kardashian", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "'Devastated' Blac Chyna granted restraining order against Rob Kardashian | CNN", "description": "Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order.jpg?q=x_3,y_156,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/07/10/entertainment/blac-chyna-gma-restraining-order/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "'Devastated' Blac Chyna granted restraining order against Rob Kardashian | CNN", "description": "Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170710103419-blac-chyna-restraining-order.jpg?q=x_3,y_156,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Blac Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order barring Rob Kardashian from coming near her or posting about her online.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-07-10T13:12:14Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-11T20:21:17Z", "tag": "blac chyna, celebrities, rob kardashian, internet and www, lisa bloom, social media, technology, law and legal system, restraining orders, trial and procedure", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "blac chyna, celebrities, rob kardashian, internet and www, lisa bloom, social media, technology, law and legal system, restraining orders, trial and procedure", "author": "Lisa Respers France", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499641200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
