If you don\u2019t, grab one anyway\u2014because this is the most exciting thing you\u2019re going to read all day. It turns out the movie Twitter dreamt up about Rihanna and Lupita Nyong\u2019o playing a pair of genius scammers is actually coming to life.\n\nEntertainment Weekly reported Monday that Netflix has secured a deal for the concept at the Cannes Film Festival after a \u201cdramatic negotiation session.\u201d Rihanna and Nyong\u2019o will star, Ava DuVernay will reportedly direct, and Issa Rae will write the script. Rae\u2019s team confirmed to Vanity Fair that the project is in the works, adding that the original Twitter users who imagined the concept for this film will be credited and included in some form.\n\nDuVernay also seemed to confirm the news on Twitter, tweeting, \u201cWe deserve nice things,\u201d and sharing a link to the movie news on Twitter Moments.\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe prospective movie was inspired by a photo of Rihanna and Nyong\u2019o side by side at a Miu Miu fashion show in 2014.\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe picture went viral on Tumblr shortly after it was taken, then took the Internet by storm again recently when Twitter user 1800SADGAL tweeted it out, joking that in the image, \u201cRihanna looks like she scams rich white men and lupita is the computer smart best friend that helps plan the scans.\u201d", "images":
