The Chrisley Knows Best star runs a tight ship and he tries to always know what\u2019s going on with his famous offspring. Recently, Savannah Chrisley opened up about her relationship with Detroit Pistons rookie Luke Kennard and it turns out that Todd has been involved in their relationship, as expected.\n\nChrisley Knows Best wrapped Season 5 on the USA network in April and there are rumors that the Chrisleys might be moving to another network. That\u2019s probably why Savannah and Todd Chrisley appeared as guests on E\u2019s Daily Pop.\n\nWhile they were there, co-hosts Catt Sadler, Justin Sylvester, and Carissa Culiner wanted the scoop on Savannah\u2019s relationship with rising NBA star Luke Kennard.\n\nSavannah and Luke have been getting pretty serious lately and many fans of Chrisley Knows Best have wondered what Todd thinks of it all.\n\nDinner with the fam \u2764\ufe0f @marycarlisle @rickyyoungmusic @lukekennard5 #nashvillenights A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley) on Jul 8, 2017 at 8:54pm PDT\n\nIt turns out that Savannah\u2019s famous father approves of her man. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s letting Savannah run all over the place, though.\n\n\u201cHonestly, I wasn\u2019t [afraid] because, for the first time, he\u2019s an awesome human being,\u201d Savannah gushed.\n\n\u201cThere was no hesitation about it. It started off very pure and right. [Todd] was involved from the very beginning. That\u2019s the way to do it.\u201d\n\nSavannah hasn\u2019t always been upfront with her dad about the boys she was dating. Previously, she preferred to hide her suitors from Todd Chrisley because he is strict and likely wouldn\u2019t have liked her choice in boyfriends.\n\n\u201cShe has been a \u2018Shady Sheila\u2019 in her past,\u201d Todd said of Savannah. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to worry about that because Luke is a wonderful, fine young man whose integrity and morals are beyond reproach. His family is just wonderful, good, God-fearing people.\u201d\n\nYep y'all\u2026he's my guy \ud83d\ude0d could not be more proud of him!! Thank you for choosing me @lukekennard5 \u2764\ufe0f #nbabound\ud83c\udfc0 #dukenation #myboyfriendishot A post shared by Savannah Faith Chrisley (@savannahchrisley) on Jun 22, 2017 at 3:56pm PDT\n\nAs for how Savannah and Luke met, it turns out that they just happened to be eating out with their respective families in Los Angeles when Luke noticed his girlfriend\u2019s beauty.\n\nSavannah said that they were seated near each other in a restaurant, prompting Luke to look her up on Instagram and flatter her with compliments.\n\nSavannah and Luke started dating not long after the restaurant encounter. Fast forward to now and it looks like Savannah and her basketball star boyfriend are getting pretty serious.\n\nDuring the interview, Todd complimented Savannah and Luke on their good looks. It seems that Todd values great genetics almost as much as he cares about morals and values.\n\n\u201cThey make a great looking couple,\u201d Todd quipped. \u201cI can\u2019t have somebody ratchet coming in here trying to tear up my DNA.\u201d\n\nSavannah took the bait and started talking about babies. The Chrisley Knows Best star said that she can\u2019t handle having an ugly baby.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt sounds like Savannah Chrisley and Luke Kennard are pretty serious and possibly even headed for the altar. Good thing Todd Chrisley approves.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Beyonc\u00e9-Jay-Z-Fight-Over-Blue-Ivy-Carter-300x277.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/daniel-craig-1-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Tiny-Defends-Zonnique-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Usher-And-Tameka-Foster-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Porsha-Williams-Bernice-Burgos-300x258.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/avatar_user_37_1498827391-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Chris-Massey-300x150.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Savannah-Chrisley-Todd-Chrisley.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Todd-Chrisley-Chrisley-Knows-Best-700x466.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/savannah-and-todd-chrisley-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Beyonce-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/Savannah-Chrisley-Todd-Chrisley.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Shaunee Flowers"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170726065932/http://celebrityinsider.org/savannah-chrisley-opens-up-about-dating-nba-rookie-luke-kennard-and-where-todd-chrisley-fits-into-their-relationship-53153/", "title": "Savannah Chrisley Opens Up About Dating NBA Rookie Luke Kennard And Where Todd Chrisley FIts Into Their Relationship", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Shaunee Flowers", "news_keywords": "Chrisley Knows Best, Luke Kennard, savannah chrisley, Todd Chrisley,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Chrisley Knows Best, Luke Kennard, savannah chrisley, Todd Chrisley,", "description": "It has to be hard to be the guy who dates Todd Chrisley's daughter.
