Why is James Franco allowed in? Said too much. Nite love ya #goldenglobes,\" Sheedy wrote, according to screenshots captured by various publications.\n\nShe then tweeted, \"Ok wait. Bye. Christian Slater and James Franco at a table on @goldenglobes #MeToo\"\n\nThe actress later added, \"James Franco just won. Please never ever ask me why I left the film/tv business,\" sparking speculation that she was alluding to Franco's alleged involvement in her decision to leave the entertainment industry.\n\nFranco directed Sheedy in an off-Broadway production of The Long Shrift in 2014. The same year he was the centre of controversy amid reports that he propositioned a 17-year-old girl online after meeting her outside his Broadway show Of Mice and Men.\n\nSlater, who was nominated for Best Supporting Actor in a television series, was charged with one count of battery in 1997 for assaulting his girlfriend. In 2005, he was charged with third-degree sexual abuse, although the allegation was later dropped.\n\nSheedy last appeared in X-Men: Apocalypse in 2016.\n\nFranco was among hundreds of stars wearing all-black this year, as well as a \"Time's Up\" pin supporting the recently-launched initiative fighting sexual harassment and gender inequality in Hollywood and beyond. He was up against Hugh Jackman, who was nominated for The Greatest Showman, Steve Carrell for Battle of the Sexes, Ansel Elgort for Baby Driver and Daniel Kaluuya for Get Out in the category.\n\nThe actor is yet to comment on Sheedy's remarks.", "images":
