If you\u2019re worried about looking even slightly childish, this probably isn\u2019t the strap type for you, which likely resembles the overalls you wore as a kid. However, they\u2019re great for petite or tall frames who may need to adjust straps for length \u2014 there\u2019s a lot of wiggle room here. You can also wear them looser for a more laid-back, boyfriend vibe, or make them tighter to sit higher and less slouchy on the chest.\n\n\n\nAlso, keep in mind that metal buttons and buckles may or may not be the most comfortable. They\u2019re cold on bare skin and can push into the shoulder if you\u2019re carrying a heavy tote. But, there\u2019s no denying that this is the classic overalls look, perfect with a striped tee or simple turtleneck for that effortless French, street-style worthy feel.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/public/0ec/0,0,600,315/x/1451610/image.png", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg"], "top_img": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/public/0ec/0,0,600,315/x/1451610/image.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mercedes Viera", "Eliza Huber", "Alyssa Coscarelli", "Alexandra Polk", "Jinnie Lee", "Ray Lowe", "Cortne Bonilla", "Amanda Randone", "Overalls Detail Shopping Guide"], "canonical_link": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cool-overalls-details", "title": "How To Find YOUR Perfect Pair Of Overalls", "meta_data": {"title": "Overalls Detail Shopping Guide", "description": "Everything you need to know to find your perfect pair of overalls.", "og": {"url": "https://www.refinery29.com/en-us/cool-overalls-details", "title": "How To Find YOUR Perfect Pair Of Overalls", "description": "Everything you need to know to find your perfect pair of overalls.", "image": {"identifier": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/public/0ec/0,0,600,315/x/1451610/image.png", "secure_url": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/public/0ec/0,0,600,315/x/1451610/image.png", "width": 600, "height": 315}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "How To Find YOUR Perfect Pair Of Overalls", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@refinery29", "description": "Everything you need to know to find your perfect pair of overalls.", "image": "https://s2.r29static.com/bin/public/0ec/0,0,600,315/x/1451610/image.png"}, "pinterest": {"image": "https://s1.r29static.com/bin/entry/19b/26,0,408,552/x/1451609/image.png"}, "fb": {"app_id": 155023867867753, "pages": "86973707921,587074007996399,269626263209765,509115739117952,1562713254009921,583745561686633,656112191237463,284423314989162,974273182666651,192477361634120"}, "article": {"publisher": "refinery29"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#fd5b4e", "p": {"domain_verify": "b10faeb45f92f5ebf0073a215d615ea9"}, "entry_template": "entry.slideshow", "author": "Alyssa Coscarelli"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.refinery29.com", "summary": ""}
