On Saturday, it was at Hank's hockey game in Las Vegas where mom and dad cheered him on.\n\nWilkinson shared several posts from the marathon day of sports on her Instagram story. One shows Baskett taking a selfie with little Alijah by his side, with the caption, \"proud Papa.\"\n\nAnother pic shows a group shot of the couple's cheer squad, which included Wilkinson's mother, Patti. \"GOOO Hank. Game number three,\" the reality star captioned the snap.\n\n6:41 am hockey time. Mama, papa and sister Alijah there to support lil Hank. \ud83c\udfd2 @KendraWilkinson Go lil Hank! \ud83c\udfd2Vegas supporting Lil Hank and he will be a future, major athlete \ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\ude4c\ud83c\udffb team work makes the dream work! pic.twitter.com/gyMW5GLApb \u2014 Stephanie bode (@stephaniebode2) May 26, 2018\n\nWilkinson has documented her journey -- both the upsand the downs -- frequently on social media. And while she has described her split with Baskett as leaving her \"beyond sad and heartbroken,\" she appears to be making strides in moving on. She changed her look recently, going brunette. She's been getting out and even hit a red carpet or two. And she publicly sought out advice on sex and dating recently, which resulted in some amusing responses from fans.\n\nFor more on Wilkinson's divorce, watch the video below.\n\nKendra Wilkinson Files for Divorce From Hank Baskett This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\nKendra Wilkinson Mourns Death of Her Dog: 'She Lived Her Best Life'\n\nKendra Wilkinson Claps Back at Mom Shamers After Feeling 'Pushed Into a Corner' Following Divorce Filing\n\nHank Baskett Responds to Kendra Wilkinson's Divorce Filing\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/1280_kendrawilkinson_040218.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=b-rp5XBe", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_970x546/public/images/2018-04/1280_kendrawilkinson_040218.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=xeLTOIRU", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Kaye_GettyImages-1429667472_300.jpg?h=6c83441f&itok=79-eWDg7", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/Screen%20Shot%202022-10-08%20at%202.01.34%20PM.png?h=597e033f&itok=1KV1Fu0Z", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2018-05/1280_emmy_getty962232046.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=BEtVal36"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/1280_kendrawilkinson_040218.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=b-rp5XBe", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Haas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/kendra-wilkinson-and-hank-baskett-reunite-for-sons-hockey-games-nearly-2-months-after-divorce", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett Reunite for Son's Hockey Games Nearly 2 Months After Divorce Filing", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "Despite their split, the pair have been super supportive of their two children and have gotten together on more than one occasion.", "keywords": "News, Kendra Wilkinson, Hank Baskett", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kendra-wilkinson-and-hank-baskett-reunite-for-sons-hockey-games-nearly-2-months-after-divorce", "title": "Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett Reunite for Son's Hockey Games Nearly 2 Months After Divorce Filing", "description": "Despite their split, the pair have been super supportive of their two children and have gotten together on more than one occasion.", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/1280_kendrawilkinson_040218.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=b-rp5XBe", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Despite their split, the pair have been super supportive of their two children and have gotten together on more than one occasion.", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Kendra Wilkinson and Hank Baskett Reunite for Son's Hockey Games Nearly 2 Months After Divorce Filing", "creator": "Brian Haas\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/kendra-wilkinson-and-hank-baskett-reunite-for-sons-hockey-games-nearly-2-months-after-divorce", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-04/1280_kendrawilkinson_040218.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=b-rp5XBe"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
