He didn\u2019t specify how he believed the network had put her anonymity in jeopardy. A spokesperson for NBC News told Today: \u201cthe network has protected the employee\u2019s anonymity all along and will continue to do so.\u201d\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a hunt underway to figure out who she is,\u201d Wilkenfeld said. \u201cAnd I think that\u2019s going to have a chilling effect on other women who might want to come forward and tell their stories.\u201d\n\nOn Nov. 29, NBC announced it fired Lauer after receiving the woman\u2019s complaint. The specifics of the woman\u2019s allegations have not been made public. Variety and the New York Times later reported additional allegations of sexual harassment and sexual assault against Lauer. In a statement on Nov. 30, Lauer said that some of the allegations were untrue or mischaracterized, but said \u201cthere is enough truth in these stories to make me feel embarrassed and ashamed.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, another woman has detailed her own experience with the former Today show co-anchor. On Thursday, Variety published a first-person account from Addie Zinone, who said that she had a consensual relationship with Lauer when she was a 24-year-old production assistant on Today. Zinone said that the month-long relationship began after Lauer took her to lunch to give her professional advice. They later had a consensual encounter in one of the studio\u2019s dressing rooms.\n\nLauer has not commented on Zinone\u2019s essay. His attorney did not immediately respond to TIME\u2019s request for comment.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m putting my name and face out there to squash any doubts about the allegations from other women against Matt Lauer. I\u2019m validating their stories because some of our experiences are similar,\u201d Zinone wrote. \u201cI want these women to know that I believe them, I want to help empower them and collectively we have a voice to change things.\u201d\n\nWrite to Samantha Cooney at samantha.cooney@time.com.", "images": ["https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/ocean-underwater.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1101671215_400.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Samantha Cooney"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5066133/matt-lauer-accuser-lawyer-essay/", "title": "Matt Lauer\u2019s First Accuser Lives in \u2018Constant Fear\u2019 of Being Discovered, Lawyer Says", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The attorney for the woman who came forward with allegations against Matt Lauer said she lives in fear of being discovered.", "og": {"title": "Matt Lauer\u2019s First Accuser Lives in \u2018Constant Fear\u2019 of Being Discovered, Lawyer Says", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5066133/matt-lauer-accuser-lawyer-essay/", "description": "Also, a former production assistant has detailed a consensual relationship with Lauer", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5066133/matt-lauer-accuser-lawyer-essay/", "description": "The attorney for the woman who came forward with allegations against Matt Lauer said she lives in fear of being discovered.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5066133/matt-lauer-accuser-lawyer-essay/", "title": "Matt Lauer\u2019s First Accuser Lives in \u2018Constant Fear\u2019 of Being Discovered, Lawyer Says", "description": "Also, a former production assistant has detailed a consensual relationship with Lauer", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/matt-lauer.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
