I have talked about it enough. I did what was best for my body at that time, and I have moved on from it.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Jenelle Evans Says She Has PTSD from Road Rage Incident: \u2018He Almost Knocked My Son Out\u2019\n\nHer divorce from Rogers was finalized prior to the birth of son Kaiser, 4, with ex-fianc\u00e9 Nathan Griffith.
