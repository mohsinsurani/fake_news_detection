And hanging out.\n\nSwift, known for her particularly personal interaction with fans, chronicled the store visit in her Instagram Stories.\n\n\u201cWe always have this tradition of going to Target to go buy the album, and so we\u2019re going to go do that,\u201d Swift told her Instagram followers before heading to the West Nashville store on White Bridge Road.\n\nInside, she approached fans and engaged with them as they approached her, signing albums and FaceTiming with fans\u2019 friends who couldn\u2019t make it to the store.\n\n\u201cI live across the street and just came to get this for dinner,\u201d said a man in one of the videos as he stood next to Swift, holding a jar of spaghetti sauce and his phone while FaceTiming friends in Kentucky. \u201cAnd that happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s just shopping out here, chillin\u2019 on White Bridge,\u201d said one woman who was talking to someone on her cellphone as Swift\u2019s Instagram account documented the conversation.\n\nAlong for this special trip were a few squad members including Clare, Eliotte, Mel and Kamilah. And for those who aren\u2019t die-hard Swifties, these talented ladies are just some of her backup singers and dancers. Check out some of the fan-captured pictures below.\n\nEarly sales figures suggest Taylor Swift is on course to break her own chart record with new album Reputation. The album, released on November 10, has sold 1.05m copies in its first four days on sale, according to Nielsen Music figures reported by Billboard.", "images": ["https://promotionmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Taylor-Swift-Target.jpg", "https://promotionmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/promo-logo1x.png", "https://promotionmusicnews.com/wp-content/plugins/instagram-feed/img/placeholder.png", "https://promotionmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/promo-logo-mobile1x.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20750%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://promotionmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/sb-instagram-feed-images/promotion1983.jpg"], "top_img": "https://promotionmusicnews.com/wp-content/uploads/Taylor-Swift-Target.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://promotionmusicnews.com/taylor-swift-target-trip", "title": "Taylor Swift and Her Squad Surprise Shoppers During Target Trip", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, height=device-height, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0", "description": "Nashville residents making a Tuesday night run to Target found themselves running straight into Taylor Swift.
