Yup, you guessed it: Chrissy Teigen and John Legend shared plans about Baby No. 2. And if things go according to plan, it looks like little Luna might be getting another sibling sooner rather than later. We bet the new baby will be just as adorably angelic as Baby Luna was.\n\nWe\u2019re SO excited at the thought of more cuteness from this family. Teigen already taught Luna how to mock her dad and lets Luna pick out her own shoes. (And yes, she\u2019s already a pro at walking in heels, because of course she is.) Can you imagine even MORE incredible Instagram posts and hilarious tweets from Teigen about mom life? We. Are. Ready.\n\nThough Teigen and Legend have been open about trying and their aspirations for more children in the past, both shared that a second baby is likely happening soon. They spoke to the press about it while being honored at different events this week. Talk about a power couple.\n\nAfter winning the Woman of the Year award at the inaugural Revolve Awards in Los Angeles on Thursday, Teigen told E! News that she and Legend are continuing to try for another child to join Baby Luna.\n\n\"I feel good, I feel good, we're still trying,\" Teigen said. \"I'm going for, I mean, hopefully in the next few years. Because for me, I really want to just knock 'em out. That's my dream, I want to just be pregnant kind of for the rest of my life. Not for the rest of my life, but the rest of my fertile life. So we'll see.\"\n\nMeanwhile, in New York, where Legend was being honored at the NAACP LDF National Equal Justice Awards, he expressed similar excitement about a future baby.\n\n\"We want more, we'll hopefully have another one in the near future. We're working on it, Legend told E! News.\n\nThe dynamic duo has already proved how amazing they are as parents in raising Baby Luna.\n\nWe\u2019re thankful that they share all the cuteness with us on Instagram.\n\nTeigen has been particularly honest about the challenges of raising children. Earlier this year, she wrote a powerful essay for Glamour about overcoming postpartum depression. She has also been candid about her experience with infertility and using the process of frozen embryo transfer to conceive.\n\nIn 2016, Teigen told InStyle magazine that she and John started with 20 embryos. By the end, three were determined to be normal. After challenges with the first embryo, the second was baby Luna, and the third is a male embryo. So it\u2019s looking like when it\u2019s time for Baby #2, he\u2019ll be a boy.\n\nWe wish them the absolute best of luck, and can\u2019t wait to see another baby Legend!", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/11/04/picture-of-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-luna-walking-photo.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/11/04/picture-of-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-luna-walking-photo.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2017/11/04/picture-of-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-luna-walking-photo.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bethany Biron"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/when-chrissy-teigen-john-legend-want-to-get-pregnant-baby-no-2/", "title": "This is when Chrissy Teigen and John Legend want to get pregnant with baby #2 - HelloGiggles", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend have been planning for Baby No. 2 for a while now.
