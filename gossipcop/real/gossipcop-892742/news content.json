the kids from \"Stranger Things\" even have what it takes to form the perfect boy band.\n\nIf they ever wanted to do that.\n\nThe cast from the Netflix fright fest has been making the late-night TV rounds this week, and during their latest stop \u2014 to \"The Late Late Show With James Corden\" \u2014 they proved they have what it takes with their mastery of Motown music and moves.\n\nFinn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp joined host Corden for a faux flashback to their days before they became small-screen stars, when they were all part of a quintet called The Upside Downs.\n\n\"Some people thought it was weird that James hung out with us, because he's an adult, but we actually went to school with him,\" Wolfhard said in the \"Behind the Music\"-like bit. \"Yeah, he was held back a couple of years, but we were in the same grade.\"\n\nAnd, eventually, the same band.\n\nThe mock documentary even showed how their musical path led to the \"Stranger Things\" gig \u2014 for all but Corden, who bombed when he auditioned for the role of Eleven.\n\n11 is the loneliest number pic.twitter.com/LMVHotwyMR \u2014 That Late Late Show (@latelateshow) November 9, 2017\n\nEven though their Motown days were behind them, they couldn't resist the opportunity to get the band back together for one last show.\n\nThat's where the fiction ends.\n\nThe cast of \"Stranger Things\" (Finn Wolfhard, Gaten Matarazzo, Caleb McLaughlin and Noah Schnapp) performs in a sketch with James Corden during \"The Late Late Show.\" CBS\n\nWhen The Upside Downs took the stage for a medley hits \u2014 from The Jackson 5's \"I Want You Back\" to The Temptations' \"My Girl\" \u2014 the performance was genuinely fantastic.\n\nIs there anything these kids can't do?",
