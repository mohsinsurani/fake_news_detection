This may seem like an unexpected group of celebrities, but nothing brings people together like neon lights, a kiddie-pool bubble bath, and a dance floor.\n\n\"I wanted random people in my video,\" Lovato told MTV News correspondent Gaby Wilson this week, ahead of her VMA performance on Sunday. \"I wanted people to be like, what? Like, I wanted Bill Nye the Science Guy to be in it too, but I don't think he was available. Too cool for my video.\"\n\nYep, that's right: Demi wanted to turn up with your childhood science teacher, but because she couldn't, she recruited the other celeb cameos via text messages. \"I thought Paris would be, like, awesome to be the DJ,\" Lovato explained. \"Wiz is a friend of mine \u2014 we go to the same gym \u2014 and then Jamie Foxx, I had just been over to his house for a party. And so I was like, I'd love for you to be in my video, and he is so freakin' funny, so having him in it was a blast.\"\n\nBut whatever happens, it's good to know you always count on Demi to host a fabulous party.", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:79ad7f25-c2ed-4cf9-a1ba-6e57be5286f5?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:b1784125-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c45b759e-5caf-44a0-a5f1-07d21156312b?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:af26ecc9-8660-466d-954d-47a5d29bbd2d?quality=0.7"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:b1784125-e0ec-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mtv.com/news/mku3pl/demi-lovato-sorry-not-sorry-celebrity-cameos-interview", "title": "Demi Lovato Reveals Why Wiz Khalifa And Paris Hilton Star In 'Sorry Not Sorry'", "meta_data": {"app_version": "d8d613330-2688-2022-10-07", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "VMA performer Demi Lovato spoke to MTV News about her new 'Sorry Not Sorry' music video, which stars Paris Hilton, Wiz Khalifa, and Jamie Foxx.
