And also the theme of the show this year is very much about unity and coming together as a format.\"\n\nFriday morning, the singer had slammed the ban in a tweet that urged the CMA to reverse the guidelines.\n\nI'm sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines. In 3...2....1..... \u2014 Brad Paisley (@BradPaisley) November 3, 2017\n\n\"I'm sure the CMA will do the right thing and rescind these ridiculous and unfair press guidelines,\" he wrote. \"In 3...2....1.....\"", "images": ["https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171008043632-jason-aldean-snl-tom-petty-las-vegas-cold-open-1024x576.jpg", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/video/bvp/images/1.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-D1yc5zQgjmqr5.gif", "https://i.cdn.turner.com/money/images/1.gif", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171103104617-brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-780x439.jpg", "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/.element/img/8.0/newsletters/reliable_sources/rs-with-button_large1x1.jpg", "https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnnbusiness.png", "https://money.cnn.com/.element/cnnm-3.0/img/logo/logo_cnn.svg"], "top_img": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171103104617-brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-780x439.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa France"], "canonical_link": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/media/cma-media-ban/index.html", "title": "Country Music Association reverses ban on media questions about Las Vegas shooting", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1140", "date": "2017-11-03 11:26:38", "title": "Country Music Association reverses ban on media questions about Las Vegas shooting", "keywords": "Country Music Association, Awards Season, country music, celebrities", "news_keywords": "Country Music Association, Awards Season, country music, celebrities", "author": "Lisa France", "section": "media", "og": {"title": "Country Music Association reverses ban on media questions about Las Vegas shooting", "type": "article", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/media/cma-media-ban/index.html", "image": {"identifier": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171103104617-brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-780x439.jpg", "width": 780, "height": 439}, "site_name": "CNNMoney"}, "fb": {"app_id": 521848191196480}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNMoney", "url": "https://money.cnn.com/2017/11/03/media/cma-media-ban/index.html", "title": "Country Music Association reverses ban on media questions about Las Vegas shooting", "image": "https://i2.cdn.turner.com/money/dam/assets/171103104617-brad-paisley-carrie-underwood-540x304.jpg"}, "DC.date.issued": "2017-11-03T11:26:38"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1509667200.0, "source": "https://money.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
