A new report claims to have the answer \u2014 and you may be surprised!\n\nAre Prince William, 35, and Kate Middleton, 36, calling it quits in the baby-making department? The two welcomed their third child, Prince Louis, just last month on April 23, and it seems the royals are perfectly content with their family of five \u2014 at least for NOW! William and Kate are also proud parents to son George, 4, and 3-year-old daughter Charlotte. There\u2019s no question these two have their hands full with three kids under five!\n\n\u201cThey are absolutely thrilled with having three [children],\u201d a royal source told Us Weekly in their latest edition. \u201cThey are soaking up every minute they can. Their dream was always to have three kids. Kate knew she wanted a third not long after having Charlotte, but this time around they seem very content.\u201d Of course though, as the source added, \u201cNever say never!\u201d After all, both Kate and William have expressed in the past that they want a large family.\n\nAside from Louis\u2019 debut pics outside of St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, which took place just hours after he was born, Kensington Palace shared two new photos of the youngster just last weekend on May 5. Both images were taken by Kate, and in one, little Charlotte is holding her baby brother and giving him a sweet kiss on his forehead. \u201cCharlotte is really enjoying having a younger brother to play with. She\u2019s taking her big sister duties very seriously,\u201d another palace source shared with Us Weekly.\n\nThis image of Prince Louis was taken by The Duchess of Cambridge at Kensington Palace on 26th April. The Duke and Duchess would like to thank members of the public for their kind messages following the birth of Prince Louis, and for Princess Charlotte\u2019s third birthday. pic.twitter.com/bjxhZhvbXN \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) May 5, 2018\n\nThe insider added that Charlotte and George have \u201ca great bond,\u201d and now a \u201csimilar connection is growing between Charlotte and Louis.\u201d Aw! These royals truly are one big happy family! As HollywoodLife.com previously reported via People, Prince Louis \u201ccompletes them.\u201d \u201c[Kate] is one of three siblings, and it\u2019s a good family size. Boy-girl-boy is pretty cool as well,\u201d royal biographer Ingrid Seward told the publication. We couldn\u2019t agree more!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/royal-baby-4-ftr.jpg?w=620", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://pmcfootwearnews.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/irina-shayak.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://1.gravatar.com/blavatar/19b58cb6c78c5979ec1022eb449ecdf2?s=144", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=p-6fKiDaopTGEQg&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=15476338&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://pmcdeadline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/tabitha.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2017/06/kathleen-harper.jpg?w=64&h=64&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://s3.amazonaws.com/heartbeat.pmc.com/track?host=hollywoodlife.com&path=%2F2018%2F05%2F10%2Fkate-middleton-prince-william-baby-4-more-kids-after-prince-louis%2F&ct=article&lob=hollywoodlife&loc=us&env=desktop&post_id=3137628", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/selena-gomez-met-gala-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://i0.wp.com/www.indiewire.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/atl_211_0244r.jpg?resize=230%2C135", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/royal-baby-4-ftr.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/does-sammi-regret-not-joining-jersey-shore-ftr.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?v=noscript", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/lhh-teairra-mari-devastated-over-sex-tape-leaking-she-feels-violated-ashamed-ftr1.jpg?w=143&h=80&crop=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/http://pmctvline2.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/chicago-fire-recap.jpg?w=200&resize=230%2C135", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747im_/https://pmchollywoodlife.files.wordpress.com/2018/05/royal-baby-4-ftr.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathleen Harper", "Celebrity Baeditor"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180511040747/http://hollywoodlife.com/2018/05/10/kate-middleton-prince-william-baby-4-more-kids-after-prince-louis/", "title": "Do Prince William & Kate Middleton Want Baby #4 After Welcoming Prince Louis?", "meta_data": {"description": "Do Prince William &amp; Kate Middleton already have babies on the brain?
