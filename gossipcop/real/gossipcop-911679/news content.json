It gives prolific creator-producer Murphy two series on Netflix, along with the upcoming Ratched.\n\nRESX/Shutterstock\n\nAs he does on all of his shows, Murphy will direct the pilot for The Politician, described as a one-hour comedy with social commentary. If Streisand and Paltrow\u2019s deals close, Streisand will be part of the production team as well as directing, with Paltrow also expected to produce. It would be the first major TV series role for both feature actress.\n\nDetails about the plot and characters in The Politician are being kept under wraps, but according to a source close to the project, it revolves around the politician aspirations of Platt\u2019s Payton, a wealthy Santa Barbarian, and every season will revolve around a different political race his character is involved in.\n\nRex/Shutterstock\n\nI hear that Platt will have musical numbers in several episodes of the show.

The Politician marks Murphy and Falchuk\u2019s fourth television series as co-creators, joining 9-1-1 as well as FX\u2019s American Horror Story and the upcoming Pose (co-created by Steven Canals).
