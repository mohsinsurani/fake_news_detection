It's the time of year when audiences find out if their favorite shows are being canceled or renewed, along with announcements of plenty of new projects. The CW seems to be building a fresh, diverse roster of programming geared toward supernatural themes. The Charmed reboot, in particular, has endured failed attempts before finally advancing to a series order in 2018.\n\nWhile Charmed is getting the most attention, it's not the only new series coming to The CW this year. The network is about to deliver a mix of shows, both rebooted from prior incarnations and created from scratch, and all five new TV series boast an incredible amount of diversity with regards to their cast and crew. Even though some of the new shows aren't too surprising, there's plenty for viewers to look forward to this fall.\n\nDeadline reports that Charmed is one of five new shows that have been ordered to series. Roswell, New Mexico is the network's other reboot, which features a similar premise to the original Roswell but with an immigration twist. Legacies has also been picked up, which is set in the same universe as The Vampire Diaries and The Originals. Aside from those three reboots/spinoffs, the other two shows are both new programs: sports drama All American and procedural In The Dark, which follows a blind woman who solves crimes with the help of her service dog.\n\nCharmed revolves around a trio of sisters in a small college town, played by Madeleine Mantock (pictured above), Melonie Diaz, and Sarah Jeffery, whose ambitions involve protecting their home from powerful demons and \"toppling the patriarchy.\" Roswell, New Mexico, meanwhile, is based on the Roswell High School book series like the original show, but it focuses on the daughter of undocumented immigrants, who not only discovers that her high school crush is an alien but also uncovers a vast government conspiracy.\n\nAll American, based on the life of pro football player Spencer Paysinger, concerns an athlete from south Los Angeles who is recruited to play for Beverly Hills High; he encounters the drama of clashing cultures and worlds along the way. Then, Legacies continues where The Vampire Diaries and The Originals left off by following a new generation of \"witches, vampires, and werewolves\" at the Salvatore School for the Young and Gifted.\n\nClearly, The CW has found something that works with its audience in its focus on the supernatural and fantastical. The original Charmed and Roswell series were successful enough to warrant the eventual reboots, and the network adding enough modern twists to make them feel fresh. The shows also celebrate diversity in a major way. All American, meanwhile, joins Black Lightning as the second CW series with a mostly African American cast, while Roswell, New Mexico joins Jane the Virgin as the newest CW series with a predominantly Latino cast. All five new shows come from female writers, which is certainly helping in breaking down that barrier in the entertainment industry.\n\nSource: Deadline\n\nGive Screen Rant a Thumbs up!\n\nPeaky Blinders Creator Has Plans For Seasons 6 & 7\n\nShare On Facebook Tweet This Reddit This Share This Email\n\nLooking for an AD FREE EXPERIENCE on ScreenRant?", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614781b958aa33abd672f3978ec.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29ab5efdec090dd1bd94c65bd2.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a060e5d468f261848fe9b14ab.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3d6ec4c755e8046b66ba3d16b.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4ad197dea153fbf680a8f3429.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe494e2afb2d6717be022f03158.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cfe90b745527f88220f1fb6bda.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=297467373958238&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-CW-logo-with-Charmed-cast-in-background.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b440d85cf9d231002f8682acc57.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb94a50adf8897bb84dae2f505e.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a92962d713fb6f36e5e624c81.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-CW-logo-with-Charmed-cast-in-background.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Thomas Bacon", "Nicholas Raymond", "Michael Kennedy", "Molly Freeman", "Kevin Yeoman", "Dan Zinski"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336/https://screenrant.com/cw-orders-charmed-reboot-another-vampire-diaries-spinoff/", "title": "CW Orders Charmed Reboot, Vampire Diaries Spinoff, & More", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=3.0, width=device-width", "description": "The CW orders five new shows to series, including Charmed and Roswell reboots as well as a new Vampire Diaries spinoff titled Legacies.", "og": {"title": "CW Orders Charmed Reboot, Vampire Diaries Spinoff, & More", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336im_/https://static3.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/The-CW-logo-with-Charmed-cast-in-background.jpg", "width": 1400, "height": 700}, "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180512224336/https://screenrant.com/cw-orders-charmed-reboot-another-vampire-diaries-spinoff/", "locale": "en_US", "description": "The CW has ordered 5 new shows to series!", "site_name": "ScreenRant"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-05-12T09:05:53Z", "section": "TV News"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1526115953.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
