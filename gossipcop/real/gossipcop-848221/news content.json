Gilles also had no lawyer representing her at the hearing.\n\nBakman said he had presented six pieces of evidence and a sworn declaration from the singer which were taken into consideration by judge Shirley Watkins.\n\nJudge Watkins ruled: \u201cMiss Brown has need for a restraining order for Miss Gilles. The court will issue a personal and stay away order as requested.\u201d\n\nThe ruling means Gilles must not harass Mel and must stay at least 100 yards clear of her \u2014 it now extends until midnight on May 3, 2022.\n\nLast month Mel\u2019s legal team got a temporary restraining order on Gilles to gain access to a storage locker Mel claimed contained sex tapes and photos.\n\nThe star claimed Gilles and Belafonte had threatened to make them public in an effort to destroy her reputation.\n\nThe storage locker was briefly touched on in Wednesday\u2019s hearing with Bakman revealing they were now aware of more than one storage facility.\n\nAfter the hearing he told The Sun: \u201cThere are other storage units that we are aware of but we have not obtained an order to get into those.\n\n\u201cWe are attempting to work that out with the opposing counsel.\u201d\n\nHe also confirmed the singer had not been able to get \u201cwhat she needed\u201d from the original storage unit.\n\nHe added: \u201cAt this point we are attempting to resolve the issue formally with Mr Belafonte\u2019s attorney.\u201d\n\nMel filed for divorce from Belafonte in March and then went on to file a restraining order against her estranged husband.\n\nThe ex-Spice Girl alleges a catalog of physical abuse and claimed Belafonte impregnated Gilles during their marriage.\n\nShe also claims he taped threesomes they had with other women and has been using the tapes to extort her. She alleged the tapes are being kept in a storage locker which only he and nanny Gilles have access to.\n\nBelafonte\u2019s lawyer Grace Jamra has previously said: \u201cIt will be clear to everyone that there are no sex tapes in the storage \u2026 [Gilles] had nothing to do with the storage facility. In fact, Ms. Brown terminated Lorraine before the items were placed in storage.\u201d\n\nGilles, who once looked after the singer\u2019s children Phoenix, 18, Angel, 10, and Madison, 5, sued Mel for defamation last month.\n\nIn it the former nanny, who is now married to Michael Bleau, alleges Mel knew about her relationship with Belafonte and instigated threesomes with them both.", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/mel-b-nanny.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2013/08/the-sun_logo.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=84", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/mel-b-nanny.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2017/04/mel-b-nanny.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hugo Daniel", "Zoe Nauman", "The Sun", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thesun.co.uk/tvandshowbiz/3476649/mel-b-wins-five-year-restraining-order-against-former-nanny-lorraine-gilles-who-claims-they-had-a-sexual-relationship/", "title": "Mel B\u2019s restraining order against nanny extended to 2022", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
