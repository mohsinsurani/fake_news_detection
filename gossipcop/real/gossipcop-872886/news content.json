News. \"If there are two people that decide not to be together, it shouldn't really be a heartbreak for everyone.\"\n\nThe funny woman, who is married to her equally hilarious husband, Dax Shepard, believes we should focus on the good times that formed the former couple's eight-year marriage. \"You should say, 'Oh, they tried. But that doesn't discount the lovely years they had together,'\" she said. \"If I ever get divorced, I'm still going to be like, 'Wow, I loved being married to that man.'\"\n\nVIDEO: Kristen Bell & Dax Shepard's Cutest Instagram Moments\n\nBell was quick to blast rumors that Pratt's rise in Hollywood played a part in the pair's split. Instead, she admitted that marriage is really hard\u2014especially when you shoot movies in faraway places without your significant other. \"It's a little more nuanced I think than people want to acknowledge. I think it's the truth,\" she said, revealing that she and husband go to couple's therapy and are careful to differentiate between a disagreement and an argument.\n\nBut at the end of the day, the actress says she chooses to remain positive after a breakup. \"I'm glad I spent my time with that person,\" she mused. \"We may have to make different choices, [and] those choices might make us sad for a while, but ultimately you have to make hard choices in life. I don't fault anyone for making them.\"\n\nRELATED: Anna Faris and Chris Pratt Have Split and the Internet Can't Deal\n\nWise words, Kristen!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/08/081117-kylie-jenner-lead.jpg?itok=wiVzKxom", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/all/themes/instyle/images/instyle-logo.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/images/2017/08/081117-princess-diana.jpg?itok=bgiwamKJ", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/1502450818/081117-carrie%20underwood-01.png?itok=0HW5QqzD", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/1502462422/081117-harry-potter-home-lead.jpg?itok=x_roZFby", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/1502448851/081117-chrissy-teiegen-john-legend-lead.jpg?itok=6wSitEcp", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/08/081117-kelly-rowland.jpg?itok=ImmP_a0p", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/150x180/public/images/2017/08/081117-hamilton-lottery.jpg?itok=VBXNl89G", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/08/081117-kristen-bell-and-anna-faris.jpg?itok=chDH58pf", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/08/081117-liam-and-chris-hemsworth.jpg?itok=kdz7pO2V", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/1036056483/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAYAAAAfFcSJAAAAAXNSR0IArs4c6QAAAARnQU1BAACxjwv8YQUAAAAJcEhZcwAADsQAAA7EAZUrDhsAAAANSURBVBhXYzh8+PB/AAffA0nNPuCLAAAAAElFTkSuQmCC", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/06/062617-kylie-kenner-travel-beauty-lead_1.jpg?itok=Z6UlqkxR", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/dunham-swift-2000_1.jpg?itok=ifzaJsX8", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/320x384/public/images/2017/06/062617-salma-hayek-topless-selfie-lead.jpg?itok=n2On3i3Q", "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1381046852207528&ev=PixelInitialized"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/08/081117-kristen-bell-and-anna-faris.jpg?itok=chDH58pf", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048/http://www.instyle.com/news/kristen-bell-advice-anna-faris-chris-pratt-split", "title": "Kristen Bell Has Some Advice for Anyone Heartbroken over Anna Faris and Chris Pratt's Split", "meta_data": {"twitter": {"title": "Kristen Bell Has Some Advice for Anyone Heartbroken over Anna Faris and Chris Pratt's Split @InStyle", "image": {"src": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/08/081117-kristen-bell-and-anna-faris.jpg?itok=chDH58pf"}, "site": "@InStyle", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."}, "og": {"site_name": "InStyle.com", "title": "Kristen Bell Has Some Advice for Anyone Heartbroken over Anna Faris and Chris Pratt's Split", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/08/081117-kristen-bell-and-anna-faris.jpg?itok=chDH58pf", "type": "article", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20170811153048/http://www.instyle.com/news/kristen-bell-advice-anna-faris-chris-pratt-split", "description": "Don't cry because it's over, smile because it happened."}, "fb": {"pages": 18938064984}, "bringhub": {"mode": "shop-this-post", "shopThisPostElement": ".ins-shop-this-post"}, "ins": {"channel": "Videos"}, "description": "Kristen Bell urges heartbroken fans to find the silver lining in Anna Faris and Chris Pratt's split in a new interview with E!
