Remember, these 20-somethings are responsible for covering up multiple murders.\n\n\u201cWe are gonna jump a little bit in time so everyone can start in a more restful, low-key place,\u201d creator Peter Nowalk tells The Hollywood Reporter ahead of the show\u2019s late-September premiere. \u201cWe\u2019ll be starting at the beginning of their second semester of their second year in law school. They\u2019re halfway done. It\u2019s their winter semester.\u201d\n\nBut unlike in previous years, there\u2019s no big, life-changing event that starts off the season.\n\n\u201cEveryone\u2019s more in a normal place, probably how most of us live our lives without murders happening all the time. It\u2019s really nice just to be eased into where they are.\u201d\n\nThere is, however, a big question that will be introduced in the season premiere.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s how I always start the writers each year,\u201d Nowalk says. \u201cWhat is our Who is under the sheet? Who killed Sam? Who shot Annalise? This year, the question is not a \u2018who,\u2019 it\u2019s a \u2018where.\u2019 It\u2019s very different than the other seasons, which is why I love it, but it\u2019s still a really great mystery.\u201d\n\nMake no mistake, Nowalk says \u2014 the reveal of said question will still be a major moment in the episode.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s still a crazyballs, roller-coaster, what-the-fuck-happened mystery. We\u2019ll find out that question \u2014 in fact, one of the characters will even say it by the end of the first episode.\u201d\n\nWhen the Shondaland series picks up, the answers to many questions left hanging in the season three finale will be answered.\n\n\u201cAsher and Michaela are going to be living together, Laurel will have made a decision about whether or not to have the baby and Annalise will really have had time to breathe and say, \u2018OK, what do I want my life to look like now that I am disgraced and starting at rock bottom? How can I build my life back from that?'\u201d\n\nLaurel\u2019s storyline in particular will see major repercussions from the events of the finale, when the audience learned that it was Laurel\u2019s childhood friend, under orders from her father, who killed Wes (Alfred Enoch).\n\n\u201cWe have to start the season wondering does Laurel have any idea that her dad basically killed Wes, and what is she going to do about that if she does? Wes was the heart of the show, and now he\u2019s dead. I think someone has to work to still solve his murder, because it\u2019s unsolved. Annalise feels like that\u2019s just what they have to live with, but I don\u2019t think Laurel wants to give up on that answer yet.\u201d\n\nPlus, the audience will find out what Connor (Jack Fallahee) said to Oliver\u2019s (Conrad Ricamora) proposal.\n\n\u201cThe proposal is on the table, and we\u2019ll see them talk about it in a way that I find is kind of fun and unexpected in our premiere, and will come to a mutual decision about what to do,\u201d Nowalk says. \u201cI will say their relationship is just getting deeper, and what\u2019s really fun is for them to each be finding out things they didn\u2019t know about each other, as well as the audience is finding that out. For example, we\u2019re gonna meet one of Connor\u2019s parents, and Oliver will meet one of those parents.\u201d\n\nAnd then there\u2019s Annalise, whose murder charges were dropped but whose reputation was seriously harmed by the allegations. How will she interact with her former students now that she\u2019s no longer teaching \u2014 and after pinning Rebecca\u2019s and Sam\u2019s deaths on their dead BFF?\n\n\u201cThat is a great question,\u201d he comments. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna answer it in the premiere. Does she want them in her life anymore? Does she still think that they all have to band together to protect each other? Or does she feel like it\u2019s time they all go their separate ways? There will be a major decision about that and a major shift in the show in the premiere.\u201d\n\nContinues Nowalk, \u201cWhen Annalise takes on her first client, you\u2019ll see it\u2019s someone from her past that really works into her emotional story of looking for redemption. All of the clients so far are people that either we know or that are cases that are gonna get her further in her redemption journey.\u201d\n\nAnnalise\u2019s storyline will provide plenty of opportunities for Davis to show off her Oscar-winning chops.\n\n\u201cThe best part and also the scariest part about getting to write for Viola is she can do anything. The challenge for me and the writers is always to give her new things to play. I think we\u2019re doing that,\u201d Nowalk says. \u201cWe are introducing this Jimmy Smits character, whom she has to interact with a lot. I don\u2019t want to say what his character is, but they have some amazing scenes together that are using all of Viola\u2019s talents and craft to the best of our ability. With every season, it\u2019s like, \u2018Oh my God, are we giving Viola enough to do, or are we taking advantage of this gift we\u2019ve been given?\u2019 I think, so far, we\u2019re doing a pretty good job.\u201d\n\nHow to Get Away With Murder returns Thursday, Sept. 28 on ABC.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/how_to_get_away_with_murder_go_cry_somewhere_else.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/145766_0444_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/145766_0444_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jean Bentley"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/how-get-away-murder-season-4-spoilers-pete-nowalk-interview-1033575/", "title": "\u2018How to Get Away With Murder\u2019: Inside the Road to \u201cRedemption\u201d in Season 4", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The big question of season four is not a \"who\" but a \"where,\" says creator Peter Nowalk.", "news_keywords": "Fall TV Preview, How to Get Away With Murder, Pete Nowalk", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Jean Bentley", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1033575, "title": "'How to Get Away With Murder': Inside the Road to \"Redemption\" in Season 4", "published_at": "2017-08-31 08:35:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/145766_0444_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Pete Nowalk", "topics": "TV News", "body": "When How to Get Away With Murder returns for its fourth season in the fall on ABC, the law student acolytes of Annalise Keating (Viola Davis) will, against all odds, be halfway through their second year of law school.
