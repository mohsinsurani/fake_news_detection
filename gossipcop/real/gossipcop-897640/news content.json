Robin in DC's live-action Titans series and the first look at him in costume teased an amazingly faithful and modern adaptation of the comics. Today however, alongside the reveal of the \"DC Universe\" streaming service we have two more images of Thwaites, all bruised and battered, in full costumes and it's... perfection.\n\nTitans follows young heroes from across the DC Universe as they come of age and find belonging in a gritty take on the classic Teen Titans franchise. Dick Grayson and Rachel Roth, a special young girl possessed by a strange darkness, get embroiled in a conspiracy that could bring Hell on Earth. Joining them along the way are the hot-headed Starfire and loveable Beast Boy. Together they become a surrogate family and team of heroes.\n\nRelated: Jason Todd Actor Curran Walters Wraps Filming On DC's Titans\n\nBelow are a pair of brand new, high-res official photos of Thwaites suited up - the first a close-up where you can see the battle damage and eye makeup under the mark, and the other, the first full look at the Titans Robin costume. Update: Brenton Thwaites confirms on Instagram that he's finished filming DC's Titans.\n\nTitans is one of several pieces of original programming helping launch the ambitious DC Universe streaming platform which was unveiled earlier today. DC Universe aims to let users on any device read comics and few television and film programming, both classic and new and essentially offer the best ever package of this type for fans. Alongside Titans, DC universe will be home to several other live-action and animated series including Doom Patrol, Swamp Thing, Young Justice: Outsiders, and Harley Quinn.\n\nadvertising\n\nDeveloping...\n\nadvertising\n\nGive Screen Rant a Thumbs up!\n\nJodie Whittaker Breaks the Glass Ceiling (Literally) In Doctor Who Promo\n\nShare On Facebook Tweet This Reddit This Share This Email\n\nadvertising", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/cb-logo-full-white.afca2e29.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/sr-logo-full-white.b0cc2b44.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tv-logo-full-white.642d3d01.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=297467373958238&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/ts-logo-full-white.54beb4cf.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tq-logo-full-white.7436bde3.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Robin-in-live-action-Titans.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tr-logo-full-white.090c581a.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=21868715&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/mm-logo-full-white.fe72c74c.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/bg-logo-full-white.8242bbb9.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tt-logo-full-white.04a6f0d4.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/hc-logo-full-white.5f66cfe4.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://q.quora.com/_/ad/91f52889f6a04390a65ad2591c59986e/pixel?tag=ViewContent&noscript=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/th-logo-full-white.7684e614.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://screenrant.com/public/build/images/tg-logo-full-white.fc9e742a.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507im_/https://static0.srcdn.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Robin-in-live-action-Titans.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christopher Fiduccia", "Michael Kennedy", "Hannah Shaw-Williams", "Kevin Yeoman", "Caitlin Leale"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180908043507/https://screenrant.com/titans-robin-costume-images-brenton-thwaites/", "title": "Epic FULL Look at Brenton Thwaites as Robin in Titans", "meta_data": {"viewport": "user-scalable=yes, initial-scale=1.0, width=device-width", "description": "Brenton Thwaites is playing Dick Grayson a.k.a.
