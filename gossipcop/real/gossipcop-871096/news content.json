At the time, the comedian said he was willing to give President Trump the benefit of the doubt.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not like I wanted to give him a chance that night,\u201d Chappelle clarified to Colbert \u201c[But] I feel like a lot of white Americans finally got to see what an election night looks like for many black Americans every cycle.\u201d\n\nChappelle believes Americans will not only weather Trump\u2019s presidency, he suggested that his policies will create better voters. \u201cIn the last six months I think we\u2019re all getting an education about the presidency,\u201d Chappelle added. \u201cI don\u2019t know that I\u2019ve ever heard in the popular discourse people discussing ethics this much. And I didn\u2019t even realize how ethics were necessarily supposed to work at that level of government, and he\u2019s putting all this stuff on the forefront.\n\n\u201cI think [Trump]\u2019s gonna make a more informed and better voter,\u201d Chappelle said. \u201cHe\u2019s a polarizing dude. He\u2019s like a bad DJ at a good party.\u201d\n\nLast November, just days after Trump\u2019s election win, Chappelle delivered a remarkable opening monologue on Saturday Night Live. The comedian remembered attending a White House party \u2013 where the majority of the revelers were black \u2013 during the final weeks of President Obama\u2019s tenure. \u201cI saw how happy everybody was,\u201d he recalled. \u201cThese people who had been historically disenfranchised. It made me feel hopeful and it made me feel proud to be an American and it made me very happy about the prospects of our country.\u201d\n\n\u201cIn that spirit,\u201d he continued, \u201cI\u2019m wishing Donald Trump luck. And I\u2019m going to give him a chance, and we, the historically disenfranchised, demand that he give us one too.\u201d\n\nChappelle is performing at Radio City Music Hall for much of August.
