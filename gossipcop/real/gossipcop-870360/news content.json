The Cougar Town alum, 38, recalled a funny run-in she had with the Oscar winner after the pair reunited during Live! with Kelly and Ryan on Monday, July 31.\n\nPhilipps was filling in for Kelly Ripa during the daytime talk show. Afterward, she posted a photo with McConaughey, 47, and Ryan Seacrest on set and dished about the past in the caption.\n\n\u201cWait. I didn\u2019t get to tell this story cause when you\u2019re hosting, you know, ITS NOT ALL ABOUT YOU. But years ago, at a pre-oscar party when Heath [Ledger] and Michelle [Williams] were both nominated for Brokeback, Matthew McConaughey came up to congratulate them and we were introduced,\u201d the actress wrote.\n\n\u201cHe talked with us for about 10 mins and when he left he said, \u2018Heath, Michelle, congratulations and best of luck to you this weekend. Marc, it was nice to meet you. WHIMSY, it was a pleasure!'\u201d she continued. \u201cWe obviously didn\u2019t correct him cause who cares?!- he\u2019s Matthew McConaughey! He can call me whatever he wants! But we all just about died. And Michelle to this DAY sometimes calls me Whimsy. And it always makes us laugh. Also. He\u2019s so hot.\u201d\n\nPhilipps also reunited with an old pal on Monday. It just so happens, her former Dawson\u2019s Creek costar James Van Der Beek was a guest during the show.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-busy-philipps-zoom-5b593dc2-e8b3-4806-9b68-d86d0a7cc90f.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C865px%2C454px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-busy-philipps-zoom-5b593dc2-e8b3-4806-9b68-d86d0a7cc90f.jpg?crop=0px%2C38px%2C865px%2C486px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-busy-philipps-zoom-5b593dc2-e8b3-4806-9b68-d86d0a7cc90f.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C865px%2C454px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Stephanie Webber"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matthew-mcconaughey-once-called-busy-philipps-whimsy-w495269/", "title": "Matthew McConaughey Once Called Busy Philipps 'Whimsy'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Busy Philipps shared the best story about Matthew McConaughey from years ago \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Alright, Busy Philipps' Story About Matthew McConaughey Is Amazing", "description": "Busy Philipps shared the best story about Matthew McConaughey from years ago \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/matthew-mcconaughey-once-called-busy-philipps-whimsy-w495269/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:46:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-busy-philipps-zoom-5b593dc2-e8b3-4806-9b68-d86d0a7cc90f.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C865px%2C454px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-busy-philipps-zoom-5b593dc2-e8b3-4806-9b68-d86d0a7cc90f.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C865px%2C454px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-08-01T15:10:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:46:13+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Alright, Busy Philipps' Story About Matthew McConaughey Is Amazing", "description": "Busy Philipps shared the best story about Matthew McConaughey from years ago \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/matthew-mcconaughey-busy-philipps-zoom-5b593dc2-e8b3-4806-9b68-d86d0a7cc90f.jpg?crop=0px%2C54px%2C865px%2C454px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=80&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501600200.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
