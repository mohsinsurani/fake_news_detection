On Wednesday, mere hours after NBC announced that it had fired the Today anchor because of a complaint about alleged sexual misconduct, Variety has dropped a report with hideous allegations about the TV star\u2019s alleged behavior. The claims run the gamut: he made lewd sexual remarks about female colleagues; he once invited a female employee to his secluded office, then showed her his penis; he gave one female colleague a sex toy with \u201can explicit note about how he wanted to use it on her,\u201d Variety writes.\n\nThe allegations don\u2019t stop there. Lauer would also reportedly quiz female producers about their sex lives, and play a crass, office-themed version of the game \u201cfuck, marry, or kill.\u201d He also reportedly had a button on his desk that allowed him to lock the door; two women tell Variety that it enabled him to \u201cwelcome female employees and initiate inappropriate contact while knowing nobody could walk in on him.\u201d One former producer \u201cwho knew firsthand of these encounters\u201d also told Variety that Lauer, who is married, allegedly cheated on his wife.\n\n\u201cThere were a lot of consensual relationships, but that\u2019s still a problem because of the power he held,\u201d this person said. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t sleep around town with celebrities or on the road with random people, because he\u2019s Matt Lauer and he\u2019s married. So he\u2019d have to do it within his stable, where he exerted power, and he knew people wouldn\u2019t ever complain.\u201d\n\nRepresentatives for Lauer have not yet responded to Vanity Fair\u2019s request for comment. Variety notes that he could not be reached for comment. The piece is the result of a two-month investigation which stretches back before The New York Times dropped its stunning Harvey Weinstein piece, which kicked off the sexual misconduct reckoning in Hollywood and beyond. Like Weinstein prior to the controversy, Lauer is a powerful figure in the entertainment industry. He\u2019s been the face of the Today show for years, raking in an incredibly lucrative $25-million annual salary, per Variety. That\u2019s why it was a shock for industry insiders to learn that NBC fired him so quickly, before any bombshell investigative report broke the alleged scandal.\n\nShortly after Variety published its report, the Times published one as well, reporting that NBC had received two additional complaints about Lauer. One was from a former employee who says she had sex with Lauer in his office in 2001. She told the Times, she \u201cfelt helpless because she didn\u2019t want to lose her job,\u201d adding that she \u201cdidn\u2019t report the encounter at the time because she felt ashamed.\u201d\n\nNBC\u2019s human resources department contacted her on Wednesday regarding the allegations, she said. Representatives for Lauer did not respond to V.F.\u2019s request for comment about this allegation. Reps for Lauer also did not respond to the Times\u2019 request for comment.\n\nThe announcement about Lauer\u2019s firing was made Wednesday morning by Today anchor Savannah Guthrie, who read a note on air from NBC News Chairman Andy Lack:\n\n\u201cDear colleagues, on Monday night, we received a detailed complaint from a colleague about inappropriate sexual behavior in the workplace by Matt Lauer. It represented, after serious review, a clear violation of our company\u2019s standards. As a result, we\u2019ve decided to terminate his employment. While it is the first complaint about his behavior in the over 20 years he\u2019s been at NBC News, we were also presented with reason to believe this may not have been an isolated incident. Our highest priority is to create a workplace environment where everyone feels safe and protected, and to ensure that any actions that run counter to our core values are met with consequences, no matter who the offender. We are deeply saddened by this turn of events. But we will face it together as a news organization\u2014and do it in as transparent a manner as we can.\u201d\n\n\u201cI will tell you right now, we do not know more than I have just shared with you,\u201d Guthrie said after delivering the statement, later adding that she was \u201cheartbroken\u201d for Lauer, as well as the women who came forward. \u201cWe are grappling with a dilemma that so many people have faced these past few weeks: how do you reconcile your love for someone with the revelation that they have behaved badly? And I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d", "images":
