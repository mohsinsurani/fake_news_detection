It was Nancy Kerrigan, who had her Olympic dream shattered.\u201d\n\nAfter taking a moment to respond, Harding then threatened to end the interview. \u201cThank you so much. I appreciate being on your show, but I think I\u2019m going to have to say, \u2018Have a good night.'\u201d\n\nTaken aback by her decision to cut the interview short, Morgan continued to press, \u201cYou\u2019re going to end the interview, because I think that Nancy Kerrigan was the victim here and not you?\u201d\n\n\u201cYou weren\u2019t letting me finish,\u201d Harding argued. \u201cI think that many people are the victims of abuse every single day and can\u2019t stand up for themselves. People need to be able to understand that we need to stand united and that abuse should not be happening anymore.\u201d\n\nTension continued to grow as Morgan began pressing Harding about her involvement with Kerrigan\u2019s attack. \u201cYou did know, didn\u2019t you? You did know what was happening?\u201d Morgan asked, with Harding responding, \u201cNo I did not know anything prior. \u2026 No knowledge.\u201d\n\nMorgan then abruptly ended the interview soon after.\n\nHarding\u2019s biopic was recently nominated for three Golden Globes including best picture, comedy or musical. Although hesitant to be involved with the film, Harding told The Hollywood Reporter that she found Robbie\u2019s portrayal worthy. \u201cI was so nervous to watch it, but when I saw it, I wasn\u2019t watching a movie about me. I was watching Margot, and then I went, \u2018Oh my goodness. That\u2019s about me,'\u201d Harding said.\n\nView clips of her Good Morning Britain interview here.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tonya_harding_and_piers_morgan_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tonya_harding_and_piers_morgan_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tonya_harding_and_piers_morgan_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lexy Perez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/tonya-harding-threatens-end-tense-piers-morgan-interview-1073369/", "title": "Tonya Harding Threatens to End Tense Piers Morgan Interview", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "During an appearance on 'Good Morning Britain,' the former ice skater grew visibly frustrated after Morgan began implying that she used the film 'I, Tonya' to \"play the victim.\"", "news_keywords": "I Tonya, international, Piers Morgan", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lexy Perez", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1073369, "title": "Tonya Harding Threatens to End Tense Piers Morgan Interview", "published_at": "2018-01-09 12:43:16", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/tonya_harding_and_piers_morgan_-_split_-_getty_-_h_2018_0.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Piers Morgan", "topics": "News", "body": "Tonya Harding threatened\u00a0to walk out of an interview with Piers Morgan after the Good Morning Britain host implied that the former ice skater is using the film\u00a0I, Tonya to \u201cplay the victim\u201d and questioned her involvement with in the attack on her rival Nancy Kerrigan.\r\nOn the show to discuss the movie starring Margot Robbie, Harding grew visibly frustrated as Morgan began implying that the film victimized her, rather than Kerrigan, whom Morgan believed was the true victim.\r\n\u201cMaybe it suits you to play the victim,\u201d Morgan told Harding. \u201cBut I think the victim in all this wasn\u2019t you.
