Simulated blood drips from the screens. These political and social messages told through current events are important aspects of the show, but as Jackson\u2019s creative director Gil Duldulao tells it, there\u2019s much more behind the narrative: It\u2019s the story of Janet Jackson\u2019s life.\n\nThe two-part \u201cState of the World\u201d tour traveled across the U.S. between September and December 2017, then from July to August of this year. The concert made it to two music festivals \u2014 Panorama and Essence Fest \u2014 in between, with the Global Citizens Festival in New York now on the schedule for Sept. 29 as well. But the first and second legs of the tour are subtly different \u2014 from the tracklist and arrangement of songs to the choreography and staging.\n\nWho\u2019s responsible for making these decisions? None other than Duldulao, the 39-year-old Hawaii native who started out at 16 as her backup dancer. (He lied and said he was 18 years old at the time so he could get an audition.) As the story goes, Duldulao then didn\u2019t speak to Jackson for the next year and a half. He simply never got an opportunity. But their working relationship eventually bloomed, and Duldulao is now clocking his 23rd year on the Jackson team.\n\nWhen crafting the second leg of the show with Jackson and musical director Daniel Jones, Duldulao started with the set list, he explained over the phone one recent afternoon. Due to Jackson\u2019s packed travel schedule, they didn\u2019t have as much time as other tours to get a complete overhaul of the performance together.\n\n\u201cWhen she lived in England, we\u2019d stay up late at night sending each other videos and Facebook stuff just to crack up,\u201d he says. \u201cBut we\u2019d also work. She knows exactly which songs would be great to go into another song, or she knows which ones would work well in a medley.\n\n\u201cThe thing is, Janet was in a completely different space compared to part one of \u2018State of the World,\u2019\u201d he continues. \u201cI wanted to tell a story from top to bottom of the journey from where she was even a year ago, to now.\u201d\n\nDuldulao\u2019s knowledge of Jackson\u2019s catalogue is in-depth \u2014 perhaps it goes without saying, since he\u2019s entrenched in Jackson media on a daily basis. But he recalls her first music videos in one breath and sings the entire first verse to \u201cEverytime\u201d in the next. He can detail the reasoning for placing a backup dancer in an exact spot on stage from a show that happened last November. From his perspective, Jackson\u2019s perfectionist spirit and photographic memory are no different from his \u2014 part of the reason they mesh so well.\n\nJanet Jackson and Gil Duldulao\n\nFor \u201cState of the World,\u201d he and Jackson went through a list of songs and started crossing things out that didn\u2019t jive with this new concept.\n\n\u201cI was just like, \u2018OK, why don\u2019t we start with \u2018Truth,\u2019 your slow section?\u201d he says. \u201cTo tell how Janet got here, how she had her career before and had her fans and family. Then that leads into \u2018I Get Lonely,\u2019 which was the time when she was single, you know? The songs fit well with the storyline of who she is now and what it took her to get to this place.\u201d\n\nDuldulao pushed Jackson to tweak some of the songs she performed, down to which verse she chose to sing on stage. As a result, Jackson\u2019s set list for these recent shows is full of throwback songs and B sides, like Heavy D\u2019s feature on the remix of her classic track \u201cAlright.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said to her, \u2018There are so many bridges from songs that we\u2019ve done that must be explored,\u2019\u201d he explains. \u201cI figured we should just play with the music. Let\u2019s not get so used to what we have been doing, you know? That\u2019s why I was like, \u2018We\u2019ve been doing the breakdown on \u2018I Get Lonely\u2019 forever. Let\u2019s just keep that out.\u2019 Then Daniel goes, \u2018You remember that Heavy D?\u2019 And we added it in.\n\nDuldulao started out as a backup dancer for Jackson, then climbed the ranks to his current position.\n\nDuldulao\u2019s job was to turn that musical side of the performance into a story that the audience could pick up on. Because of his work as a choreographer, he says people think he only likes dance music, tunes he can groove to. But Jackson\u2019s thought-provoking songs \u2014 those that speak of bigotry, prejudice and social injustices \u2014 are actually some of his favorites.\n\n\u201cIf we were to release \u2018Rhythm Nation\u2019 right now, it would still speak to the masses,\u201d he says of Jackson\u2019s 1989 hit. \u201cThat whole album is such a great message and it\u2019s relevant to what\u2019s going on now. I still get the chills and sometimes get teary-eyed watching our opening piece of the show.\n\n\u201cShe doesn\u2019t really need to say much, and for me, creatively, I don\u2019t need to say much because what we feel and how we feel about what\u2019s going on in the world and in her life is on that stage.\u201d\n\nMore From the Eye:\n\nThe Passions and Politics of Constance Wu\n\nThere Is a Cat Fashion Show, and It\u2019s Held in New York City\u2019s Algonquin Hotel\n\nPaddle and Party for Pink Raises $1.4M for Breast Cancer Research", "images": ["https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1378822052216463&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dsc6008.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dsc6008.jpg?w=1000&h=563&crop=1", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-31f3D02tYU8zY.gif", "https://ct.pinterest.com/v3/?tid=2612680468235&pd[em]=&noscript=1", "https://wwd.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-wwd-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://dc.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=609602&fmt=gif"], "top_img": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dsc6008.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maxine Wally"], "canonical_link": "https://wwd.com/eye/people/janet-jackson-gil-duldulao-state-of-the-world-tour-1202770887/", "title": "Gil Duldulao Tells Stories Through Janet Jackson\u2019s \u2018State of the World\u2019 Tour Performances", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-wwd-2021/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/a9597fffaf6885dd6f870d1269ef3b72.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "Through their performances, Jackson and Duldulao convey messages of love overcoming hate, knowledge trumping ignorance \u2014 and how the singer is living her life right now.", "fb": {"pages": 19457049254}, "news_keywords": "Music", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "wwd", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202770887, "author": "Maxine Wally", "pmc-category": "People", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-08-09T07:40:17"}, "pmc-tag": "Music", "title": "Gil Duldulao Tells Stories Through Janet Jackson\u2019s \u2018State of the World\u2019 Tour Performances", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "eye", "pmc-is_free": "yes", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-strategiccontent": "no"}, "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Maxine Wally", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "WWD", "application-name": "WWD", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://wwd.com/eye/people/janet-jackson-gil-duldulao-state-of-the-world-tour-1202770887/?ia_markup=1"}, "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202770887, "title": "Gil Duldulao Tells Stories Through Janet Jackson's 'State of the World' Tour Performances", "published_at": "2018-08-09 07:40:17", "image": "https://wwd.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/dsc6008.jpg?w=1024", "tags": "Music", "topics": "People", "verticals": "Eye", "body": "Janet Jackson\u2019s \u201cState of the World\u201d concert opens with images of the civil war in Syria, the names of unarmed black men killed by police officers and symbols of white supremacist groups.
