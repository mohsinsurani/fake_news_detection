I knew that name would forever have a destructive connotation in the island and yet, I have a musical theater brain, so that\u2019s where I went in my head first and I thought, I can flip the sample,\u201d Miranda shared during an interview this morning on NBC\u2019s Today show. \u201cThe hook of almost like praying - thoughts and prayers are great; thoughts and prayers are not enough. We need supplies, we need aid, we need a government response that matches the response of our people, and that\u2019s what the song\u2019s about.\u201d\n\nMiranda says he wanted to make it a catchy tune, because \u201cit's for a good cause, but I want it to spread on its own.\" The composer last month teased on his Twitter feed that he was working on a benefit song.\n\nTwitter\n\n\u201cAlmost Like Praying,\u201d which gives a shout out to each of the island's 78 towns, was recorded in less than a week, with celebrities quick to answer his call for help. Rita Moreno, who acted in West Side Story, and whose family is also from Puerto Rico, is among the song\u2019s performers. Other featured artists include Juan Luis Guerra, Ednita Nazario, Gilberto Santa Rosa, Gina Rodriguez, Camila Cabello and John Leguizamo.\n\nAll proceeds from downloads and streams of \"Almost Like Praying\" will go to the Hispanic Federation's disaster relief fund to aid Puerto Rico.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fveronicavillafane%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F10%2FAlmost-Like-Praying.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316im_/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/veronicavillafane/files/2017/09/Lin-Manuel-tweet.jpg?width=960", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316im_/https://blogs-images.forbes.com/veronicavillafane/files/2017/10/Almost-Like-Praying.jpg?width=960", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316im_/https://1.gravatar.com/avatar/7477b443b064d716765d924f9fce88c2?s=62&d=mm&r=g"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fveronicavillafane%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F10%2FAlmost-Like-Praying.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Veronica Villafa\u00f1e"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316/https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronicavillafane/2017/10/06/lin-manuel-miranda-releases-star-studded-almost-like-praying-song-for-puerto-rico-hurricane-relief/", "title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda Releases Star-Studded 'Almost Like Praying' Song For Puerto Rico Hurricane Relief", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=1,user-scalable=no", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=588647136", "fb": {"app_id": 123694841080850}, "og": {"site_name": "Forbes", "title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda Releases Star-Studded 'Almost Like Praying' Song For Puerto Rico Hurricane Relief", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x315/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fveronicavillafane%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F10%2FAlmost-Like-Praying.png", "updated_time": "2017-10-06T21:53:16-04:00", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316/https://www.forbes.com/sites/veronicavillafane/2017/10/06/lin-manuel-miranda-releases-star-studded-almost-like-praying-song-for-puerto-rico-hurricane-relief/", "description": "The fundraising single features a myriad of celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Luis Fonsi and Gloria Estefan.", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@forbes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lin-Manuel Miranda Releases Star-Studded 'Almost Like Praying' Song For Puerto Rico Hurricane Relief", "description": "The fundraising single features a myriad of celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Luis Fonsi and Gloria Estefan.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316im_/https://thumbor.forbes.com/thumbor/600x300/smart/https%3A%2F%2Fblogs-images.forbes.com%2Fveronicavillafane%2Ffiles%2F2017%2F10%2FAlmost-Like-Praying.png", "creator": "@veronicavillafane"}, "description": "The fundraising single features a myriad of celebrities, including Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Luis Fonsi and Gloria Estefan.", "author": "Veronica Villafa\u00f1e", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/forbes", "author": "Veronica Villafa\u00f1e", "section": "Business", "section_url": "https://www.forbes.com/business/", "id": "blogAndPostId/blog/post/4676-1288", "published": "2017-10-07", "modified": "2017-10-07"}}, "movies": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171007034316if_/https://www.youtube.com/embed/D1IBXE2G6zw"], "publish_date": 1507244400.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
