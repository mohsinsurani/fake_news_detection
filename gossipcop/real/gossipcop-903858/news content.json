Pregnant Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian is getting ready for the arrival of her baby girl, and she\u2019s already filling up her closet with purple and pink clothes!\n\nThe mother-to-be, who is expecting her first child with boyfriend Tristan Thompson, shared a photo of some adorable bright onesies on her Instagram Story on Thursday, March 8. Two of the baby\u2019s new outfits had the words \u201cI love mom\u201d and \u201cI love dad\u201d written on them.\n\nThe Good American cofounder revealed the sex of her baby during the season 14 finale of Keeping Up With the Kardashians on Sunday, March 4. Khlo\u00e9, 33, was in San Francisco with big sisters Kim Kardashian and Kourtney Kardashian, when Kylie Jenner called to deliver the news about the baby\u2019s gender on behalf of her sister\u2019s doctor.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re having a girl!\u201d the Life of Kylie star, 20, revealed over the phone.\n\nThe Revenge Body host was initially in disbelief and said, \u201cYou\u2019re lying! I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m having a girl. \u2026 I\u2019m, like, in a state of shock.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cEveryone told me, \u2018You\u2019re going to feel what you\u2019re having and you\u2019ll just kind of know.\u2019 And then when you find out it\u2019s the complete opposite, it\u2019s just a shock. I just was convinced that I was having a boy, so to be having a girl, it\u2019s just like, \u2018OK, that wasn\u2019t what I thought was going on.\u2019\u201d\n\nFans have also been curious about whether or not the reality star, who is eight months into her pregnancy, will continue her family\u2019s tradition and give her baby a name that starts with K. \u201cI think a T but a K is an option as well,\u201d Khlo\u00e9 tweeted to a fan on Sunday. \u201cThat\u2019s as far as I know.\u201d\n\nUs Weekly exclusively broke the news in September 2017 that Kardashian and the basketball player are expecting their first child together. She then confirmed the pregnancy on Instagram in December with an adorable black-and-white photo of Thompson holding her belly.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/khloe-kardashian2.jpg?crop=111px%2C0px%2C1379px%2C725px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/khloe-kardashian2.jpg?crop=0px%2C18px%2C1530px%2C865px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/khloe-kardashian2.jpg?crop=111px%2C0px%2C1379px%2C725px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-khloe-kardashian-shows-off-cute-pink-baby-clothes/", "title": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian Shows Off Cute Pink Baby Clothes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian is getting ready for the arrival of her daughter and shared an adorable photo of pink and purple baby clothes \u2014 see the pic", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian Shows Off Daughter's Cute Pink Baby Clothes", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian is getting ready for the arrival of her daughter and shared an adorable photo of pink and purple baby clothes \u2014 see the pic", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/pregnant-khloe-kardashian-shows-off-cute-pink-baby-clothes/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-03-09T22:06:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/khloe-kardashian2.jpg?crop=111px%2C0px%2C1379px%2C725px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/khloe-kardashian2.jpg?crop=111px%2C0px%2C1379px%2C725px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-03-09T22:06:43+00:00"}, "author": "Karla Rodriguez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian Shows Off Daughter's Cute Pink Baby Clothes", "description": "Pregnant Khloe Kardashian is getting ready for the arrival of her daughter and shared an adorable photo of pink and purple baby clothes \u2014 see the pic", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/khloe-kardashian2.jpg?crop=111px%2C0px%2C1379px%2C725px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=82&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520633203.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
