(It\u2019s still not too late to book your ticket now to London\u2014yeah, you won\u2019t be able to attend the wedding itself, but you can still sort of camp out nearby and listen for sounds.)\n\nThere are no doubt scores of spreadsheets and multiple binders dedicated to making sure everything goes smoothly for Kate\u2019s sister\u2019s nuptials, and most of the plans remain under wraps. And there is a great number of questions about the wedding itself, including what Pippa will be wearing, and what Kate\u2019s exact role will be, and whether or not we will be gifted with a shot of Meghan Markle and Prince George shaking hands. But what we do know, per a new E! report, is how Pippa, reportedly, has been preparing for the wedding.\n\nThe outlet claims that Pippa has completed a \u201cstrict bridal body boot camp,\u201d a three-month program run out of Grace Belgravia health club. The program, in its description, doesn\u2019t sound too different from a (intensive) gym membership that you might read about a famous person partaking in; the components include \u201ca personal trainer, skincare and leg toning treatments, plus yoga, pilates, spinning, cardio training, dance and meditation classes\u201d and \u201cthe club also offers to arrange home deliveries of specialized healthy meals.\u201d\n\nOh, wait, there\u2019s also this, which sounds positively Paltrow-ian: \u201cThe club also has a team of doctors and specialists who can help with anti-aging treatments including botox, peels, fillers, microdermabrasion and an assortment of laser treatments, as well as IV therapies.\u201d E! notes, of course, that it is \u201cunclear if Pippa has undergone such procedures.\u201d\n\nTheir source claims that Pippa has \u201cmet with her PT about five times a week and mostly sticks to cardio and pilates.\u201d Per the source: \u201cShe feels amazing. Her diet is the healthiest ever\u2014she hasn\u2019t even had a glass of wine in months. She\u2019s had facial treatments sometimes once a week or once a fortnight.\u201d\n\nThis truly is an impressive feat, as, just over the course of writing this post, we have finished off two glasses of wine and did not complete a single facial treatment.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57839c7a3d5bd24b0c64e032/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/wimbledon-royals-ss14.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54d3a8f99f9fa5f230b14590/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/josh-duboff-square.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5919b850d777cc4cc6fdff39/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Pippa-Middleton-Bridal-Body-Boot-Camp.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5919b850d777cc4cc6fdff39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Pippa-Middleton-Bridal-Body-Boot-Camp.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57839c7b3d5bd24b0c64e033/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/wimbledon-royals-ss11.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/57839c7c3d5bd24b0c64e034/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/wimbledon-royals-ss10.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/58f7ab7fbe45e929ab7711e5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pippa-middleton-meghan-markle.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/590c8ecbe55c5f432b0459e0/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/pippa-middleton-james-matthews.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61bb68208185dc60dfd416d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6328d4009abfd8a85cba4488/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5919b850d777cc4cc6fdff39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Pippa-Middleton-Bridal-Body-Boot-Camp.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Josh Duboff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/pippa-middleton-bridal-body-boot-camp-wedding", "title": "Pippa Middleton Completed a \u201cBridal Body Boot Camp\u201d in Advance of Her Wedding", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Kate\u2019s sister prepares to get married this Saturday.", "id": "5919b706f9384520b86c893f", "keywords": "pippa middleton", "news_keywords": "pippa middleton", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5919b706f9384520b86c893f", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kate\u2019s sister prepares to get married this Saturday.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5919b850d777cc4cc6fdff39/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Pippa-Middleton-Bridal-Body-Boot-Camp.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5919b850d777cc4cc6fdff39/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Pippa-Middleton-Bridal-Body-Boot-Camp.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Kate\u2019s sister prepares to get married this Saturday.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5919b850d777cc4cc6fdff39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Pippa-Middleton-Bridal-Body-Boot-Camp.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Pippa Middleton Completed a \u201cBridal Body Boot Camp\u201d in Advance of Her Wedding", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/05/pippa-middleton-bridal-body-boot-camp-wedding"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-15T14:18:33.081Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-15T14:18:33.081Z", "author": "Josh Duboff"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Kate\u2019s sister prepares to get married this Saturday.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5919b850d777cc4cc6fdff39/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/Pippa-Middleton-Bridal-Body-Boot-Camp.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Pippa Middleton Completed a \u201cBridal Body Boot Camp\u201d in Advance of Her Wedding"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1494857913.081, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
