{"url": "https://people.com/royals/lifetimes-harry-meghan-a-royal-romance/", "text": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle\u2019s love story plays out on the small screen in Lifetime\u2019s Harry & Meghan: A Royal Romance, which premieres on Sunday night.\n\nFrom their first blind date to their cozy kitchen engagement, the TV movie captured many of the couple\u2019s milestone moments \u2014 and Parisa Fitz-Henley and Murray Fraser\u2019s uncanny resemblance to the real-life couple is worth a double take!\n\nBut what was real and what was just for show? Here\u2019s a breakdown of the show\u2019s major plot points. And, it goes without saying, spoilers ahead!\n\nTrue: Prince Charles Took William and Harry to Africa After Their Mother\u2019s Death\n\nThe first scene opens with brothers Prince William and Prince Harry traveling through Africa with their father, Prince Charles, just after Princess Diana\u2019s death. In real life, Charles brought his sons there to escape the glare of the spotlight following their mother\u2019s death on August 30, 1997. It was a formative trip for Harry, who fell in love with Africa during that time. \u201cI first came in 1997, straight after my mum died. My dad told my brother and me to pack our bags \u2014 we were going to Africa to get away from it all,\u201d Harry told Town & Country in 2017. \u201cThis is where I feel more like myself than anywhere else in the world. I wish I could spend more time in Africa. I have this intense sense of complete relaxation and normality here.\u201d\n\nFalse: Prince Harry Was Deep Into the Party Scene Just Before Meeting Meghan\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that he was known as the party prince during his 20s, his partying days were well behind him by the time he met Meghan in 2016. In 2005, Harry\u2019s picture was splashed on front pages around the world showing the then-20-year-old wearing a Nazi uniform at a costume party. He made headlines again after naked photos emerged from his strip billiards game in Las Vegas in 2012. But after retiring from the Army in 2015 after 10 years of service, Harry had reformed his wild ways. And he was ready to find love and settle down. \u201cHarry\u2019s drinking days are over,\u201d a source told PEOPLE. \u201cAll of his best friends have settled and had children, so he\u2019s had fewer people to go out and play with. He realized he was getting a bit older and that it was time to settle down a little bit.\u201d Adds Duncan Larcombe, a former royals reporter who traveled with Prince Harry throughout much of the early 2000s: \u201cHe desperately wanted to get married and be happy. He sees his brother has found that. The fact that Meghan arrived when she did completes it for Harry.\u201d\n\nLifetime\n\nOwen Humphreys/PA Wire/AP\n\nTrue: Meghan Took Issue with an Ivory Soap Commercial\n\nThe scene where Meghan was offended by a soap commercial geared towards women rings true. Meghan was inspired to change a TV commercial at the age of 11, after seeing a Procter & Gamble commercial that advertised its Ivory dishwashing soap solely to women. The commercial for the soap struck her as unfair and insensitive when she heard, \u201cwomen all over America are fighting greasy pots and pans.\u201d Meghan\u2019s social studies class had been assigned to watch commercials and assess them. The assignment led to a monumental moment for the future royal. Meghan decided to write to the company and asked them to change their slogan from \u201cWomen all over America\u201d to \u201cPeople all over America.\u201d And her efforts paid off. The commercial aired on TV again, this time with the slogan, \u201cPeople are fighting greasy pots and pans with Ivory care.\u201d About 20 years after seeing the commercial, Meghan gave a speech about the moment at the United Nations, saying, \u201cI remember feeling shocked and angry and also just feeling so hurt. It just wasn\u2019t right and something needed to be done.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Harry and Meghan Confirm They Will Uphold a \u2018Very Important\u2019 Tradition Involving the Wedding Dress!\n\nTrue: Meghan and Harry Were Set Up on a Blind Date\n\nThe newly-engaged couple revealed that they were set up on a blind date in July 2016 and knew very little about each other before they met. \u201cIt was definitely a set-up \u2014 it was a blind date,\u201d Harry said during the couple\u2019s revealing engagement interview. \u201cIt was a blind date for sure.\u201d And as is shown in the movie, Meghan did ask their matchmaker whether Harry was \u201cnice.\u201d \u201cI didn\u2019t know much about him. And so the only thing that I had asked her when said she wanted to set us up was \u2013 I had one question, I said, \u2018Well, is he nice?\u2019 Because if he wasn\u2019t kind it just didn\u2019t \u2013 it didn\u2019t seem like it would make sense,\u201d Meghan said during their interview.\n\nTrue: One of Their First Dates Was a Trip to Botswana\n\nUnlike what was depicted in the movie, Meghan didn\u2019t spend three days waiting for Harry to call her. In real life, Meghan and Harry\u2019s first date was quickly followed by two back-to-back dates in London, so he was already on speed-dial by that point! But after those initial dates, they did travel together to Botswana. \u201cIt was I think about three, maybe four weeks later that I managed to persuade her to come and join me in Botswana,\u201d Harry said of their whirlwind romance. \u201cAnd we camped out with each other under the stars. She came and joined me for five days out there, which was absolutely fantastic. So then we were really by ourselves, which was crucial to me to make sure that we had a chance to know each other.\u201d\n\nLifetime\n\nRhino Conservation Botswana/ Kensington Palace/Getty\n\nFalse: Will and Kate Cautioned Harry About Dating Meghan\n\nIn the movie, Prince William and Kate Middleton aren\u2019t overly supportive of Harry dating Meghan in the beginning and they express their concern over her background. But Meghan\u2019s future in-laws have always been in the couple\u2019s corner. \u201cShe\u2019s been wonderful,\u201d Meghan said of Kate after the couple\u2019s engagement. Harry added: \u201cAmazing, as has William as well, you know, fantastic support.\u201d Meghan, who will be learning on the job, \u201cis funny and serious and extremely hard-working,\u201d a source close to the former Suits star told PEOPLE. \u201cI can imagine Kate will find a great friend in her.\u201d\n\nLifetime\n\nChris Jackson/Getty Images\n\nFalse: Meghan Wasn\u2019t Invited to Pippa Middleton\u2019s Wedding Reception\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that Meghan didn\u2019t receive an invite to Pippa\u2019s wedding ceremony, she was invited to the black-tie reception that followed. Following the ceremony, a source told PEOPLE that Harry would travel back to London to pick Meghan up for the wedding reception in Bucklebury. The royal was spotted driving after the post-church Englefield House party. The fact that she did attend the wedding \u2014 even if it was the post-church nighttime bash \u2014 was yet another sign that the Suits actress and the prince were getting more and more serious.\n\nTrue: A Royal Relative Wore an Offensive Brooch\n\nWhile it didn\u2019t happen at Pippa\u2019s wedding as depicted in the movie, a royal relative did wear an offensive brooch to the Queen\u2019s annual Christmas lunch, which was attended by Meghan in December 2017. Princess Michael of Kent, the wife of the Queen\u2019s first cousin, was pictured arriving at Buckingham Palace wearing a brooch on her left shoulder which appeared to be \u201cblackamoor\u201d jewelry, depicting the bust of a black person with a gold crown and colorful crystals. The brooch drew further criticism due to Meghan\u2019s biracial background (her mother is Black and her father is white) \u2014 and the fact that Princess Michael chose to wear it on the day Meghan was being introduced to many extended royal family members for the first time. Princess Michael of Kent released a statement following the incident that read: \u201cThe brooch was a gift and has been worn many times before. Princess Michael is very sorry and distressed that it has caused offense.\u201d\n\nMark Cuthbert/UK Press/Getty\n\nTrue: Harry and Meghan Wore Matching Bracelets\n\nJust like in the movie, Harry did give Meghan a bracelet that matched his own. The couple started sporting \u201chis and hers\u201d jewelry early on in their relationship. They were spotted wearing the same blue beaded bracelet on several occasions. Prince Harry reportedly picked up the bracelet during one of his trips to Africa. And the gift rarely left the actress\u2019s wrist! She even posted several photos on her now-deleted Instagram account showing off her sweet trinket.\n\nMax Mumby/Indigo/Getty; Megan Markle/Instagram\n\nTrue: Meghan Met the Queen\n\nDuring Meghan and Prince Harry\u2019s revealing engagement interview, the couple revealed that the L.A.-born actress had not only met the Queen a couple times already, she also immediately won over her dogs. \u201cIt\u2019s incredible,\u201d Meghan said about meeting the Queen. \u201cTo be able to meet her through his lens, not just with his honor and respect for her as Monarch, but with the love he has for her as his grandmother. She\u2019s an incredible woman.\u201d Harry then added: \u201cThe corgis took to her straight away. \u2018I\u2019ve spent the last 33 years being barked at \u2014 this one walks in, absolutely nothing.\u201d And Meghan, who has two dogs herself, replied: \u201cThey were laying on my feet during tea!\u201d\n\nFalse: Harry\u2019s Public Statement Led to a Breakup\n\nWhile the movie insinuates that Meghan was in the dark about Harry\u2019s rare public statement in November 2016 that confirmed that he was dating the actress and slammed what he called the racist and sexist abuse she had endured since their relationship was revealed, Meghan was most likely fully supportive of that decision. And it didn\u2019t lead to a brief breakup as was depicted in the movie. Since it was such a rare move for a royal family member to release a statement about their private life, Meghan would have been briefed about the statement at length before it was released.\n\nLifetime\n\nAlexi Lubomirski/REX/Shutterstock\n\nFalse: A Member of Harry\u2019s Inner Circle Tried to Intimidate Meghan\n\nThe character of Annabella, played by Marlie Collins, doesn\u2019t exist in real life. But the royal interloper, who chided Meghan about her TV career, biracial background and even her biological clock, did represent a lot of the criticism the couple was facing when they took their relationship public.\n\nTrue: Meghan\u2019s Ex-Husband Is Producing a Show Based on Her Relationship with Prince Harry\n\nTrevor Engelson, Meghan\u2019s ex-husband, is producing an as-of-yet-untitled show with a premise that sounds awfully familiar \u2014 because it\u2019s based on his own relationship with Meghan, and her relationship with Prince Harry. The description of the show reads: \u201cDivorce is hard. Sharing custody is harder. Sharing custody with the British Royal family when your wife marries a prince, in the unforgiving spotlight of London\u2019s tabloid media, is next level,\u201d according to Deadline. The idea came to be during a discussion between Engelson \u2014 who also works on FX\u2019s Snowfall \u2014 and Dan Farah, another one of the show\u2019s producers, where they imagined what life would have been like if Engelson and Markle had children, and he potentially had to share custody (and all the associated drama) with the royal family. Though the basis of the show was hatched from reality, Deadline does add that, \u201cIt should be noted that the comedy is fictional, the lead characters are not based on Markle or Engelson, who have no kids together, and she has had no involvement in the project.\u201d\n\nIndianapolis Museum of Art /Getty Images\n\nTrue: Meghan Is Not the First Biracial Royal\n\nAlthough it\u2019s doubtful that the Queen showed Meghan a portrait of Queen Charlotte, a biracial royal, during her palace visit, she is, in fact, a real royal. Queen Charlotte of Mecklenburg-Strelitz was married to King George III and was queen for nearly 60 years, until she died in 1818. She\u2019s the grandmother of Queen Victoria and the great-great-great-great-grandmother of the current Queen Elizabeth. Though she was born in Germany, the daughter of a Duke, Queen Charlotte was directly descended from Margarita de Castro y Sousa, which was the black branch of the Portuguese Royal House. Her racial background wasn\u2019t known to the public when she served as queen. It was only discovered many years after her death, thanks to art historians who studied portraits of Charlotte more closely.\n\nHarry & Meghan: A Royal Romance airs Sunday at 8 p.m. on Lifetime.",
