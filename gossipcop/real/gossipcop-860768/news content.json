Several of the women have ongoing cases in which they have sued Mr. Cosby for slander after his representatives suggested that their accounts were fabrications.\n\nThough the charges were based on a single incident involving one woman, the specter of the other allegations hung over the case from the start. Jurors conceded during jury selection that they were aware of the claims, and in his closing argument Mr. McMonagle had cited the \u201cdrumbeat\u201d of highly publicized charges, saying that the case was more media frenzy than legal tribunal.\n\nMr. Steele had wanted to call a dozen other accusers as witnesses to demonstrate a pattern of behavior by Mr. Cosby, but Judge O\u2019Neill allowed just one to testify \u2014 Kelly Johnson, who said that Mr. Cosby had drugged and assaulted her in 1996. Adding weight to the allegations was the revelation in 2015 that Mr. Cosby, in a 2005 lawsuit filed by Ms. Constand, had admitted securing quaaludes so women would have sex with him \u2014 an admission that was introduced last week.\n\nMs. Constand took the witness stand as a proxy for all of Mr. Cosby\u2019s accusers, many of whom told stories similar to hers. None of the other women\u2019s accusations have resulted in prosecution \u2014 in many cases, too much time has passed \u2014 leaving hers as the only formal test of Mr. Cosby\u2019s guilt and, in the eyes of many of them, the only chance for justice.\n\nThe case turned largely on the credibility of Ms. Constand, a former Temple University employee, who testified that in a visit to the home of Mr. Cosby, a Temple trustee, he gave her three pills that he said were herbal. She said the pills left her immobile and drifting in and out of consciousness; he has said they were Benadryl.\n\n\u201cI was jolted awake and I felt Mr. Cosby\u2019s hand groping my breasts under my shirt,\u201d she testified. \u201cI also felt his hand inside my vagina moving in and out, and I felt him take my hand and place it on his penis and move it back and forth.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/us/18COSBY-HP1/18COSBY-HP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1314e83a2a6264e43212d7e094b833e49b8d82f7f16ce125d28b20147039edef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/us/18COSBY-HP1/18COSBY-HP1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/us/18COSBY-HP1/18COSBY-HP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1314e83a2a6264e43212d7e094b833e49b8d82f7f16ce125d28b20147039edef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Graham Bowley", "Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a", "Jon Hurdle"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/arts/television/bill-cosby-trial-day-11.html", "title": "Bill Cosby\u2019s Sexual Assault Case Ends in a Mistrial", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "After the jury could not come to verdict after six days of deliberations, the judge in the sexual assault trial declared a mistrial.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/arts/television/bill-cosby-trial-day-11.html", "type": "article", "title": "Bill Cosby\u2019s Sexual Assault Case Ends in a Mistrial (Published 2017)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/us/18COSBY-HP1/18COSBY-HP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1314e83a2a6264e43212d7e094b833e49b8d82f7f16ce125d28b20147039edef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Bill Cosby, center, stands with his spokesman Andrew Wyatt, left, outside of the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa."}, "description": "After the jury could not come to verdict after six days of deliberations, the judge in the sexual assault trial declared a mistrial."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/06/17/arts/television/bill-cosby-trial-day-11.html", "title": "Bill Cosby\u2019s Sexual Assault Case Ends in a Mistrial (Published 2017)", "description": "After the jury could not come to verdict after six days of deliberations, the judge in the sexual assault trial declared a mistrial.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/us/18COSBY-HP1/18COSBY-HP1-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600.jpg?year=2017&h=900&w=1600&s=77e1cb68089ad7e7513bdb5c4a759cf25e6ac12c354535fb03cfa72096f68e33&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "alt": "Bill Cosby, center, stands with his spokesman Andrew Wyatt, left, outside of the Montgomery County Courthouse in Norristown, Pa."}, "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/24d07cdb-723a-598a-8be6-5f69ee9fcad3"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-17T09:00:25.000Z", "modified_time": "2019-12-10T16:26:43.772Z", "section": "Arts", "tag": "O'Neill, Steven T (1953- )", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005170047, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/24d07cdb-723a-598a-8be6-5f69ee9fcad3", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/987e8f984cb84e668e7e02cd28fc0c2b", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/06/19/us/18COSBY-HP1/18COSBY-HP1-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=1314e83a2a6264e43212d7e094b833e49b8d82f7f16ce125d28b20147039edef&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Graham Bowley, Richard P\u00e9rez-Pe\u00f1a and Jon Hurdle", "news_keywords": "Rape,Bill Cosby,Andrea Constand,Steven T.
