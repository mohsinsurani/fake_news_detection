TV were the ones who made the decision.\n\n\"Our partners at Warner Bros. came to us three weeks ago that they could not deliver Lethal Weapon as we had known it before,\" she explained. \"There were some real challenges in the cast.\"\n\nRelated: Clayne Crawford Fired from Lethal Weapon!\n\nWalden went on to explain that the studio did not want to fire Crawford, but it was something they \"thought long and hard\" about.\n\nMeanwhile, Dana spoke about Seann being drafted in to replace Clayne.\n\n\"We thought about it a lot, and we talked about a lot of different names, and when they came back with Seann and a fantastic showrunner and a great cast and a storytelling engine that works and a fanbase that's very passionate about the show,\" Walden said.\n\nRelated: Seann William Scott Replaces Clayne Crawford on Lethal Weapon!\n\n\"I think we made the right choice.\"\n\nThe good news is that it sounds like Fox is going to be promoting the new season like crazy.\n\n\u201cWe are prepared to support [Lethal Weapon] from a marketing point of view, to educate viewers about [what is] a new dynamic, but a good one. A lot of the show that people love is still intact.\u201d\n\nWill Lethal Weapon be able to continue without Clayne Crawford, or will it be canceled after Season 3? Time will tell.\n\nWhat are your thoughts on everything that's happened TV Fanatics?\n\nWill you give the show a shot?\n\nHit the comments below.\n\nRemember you can watch Lethal Weapon online right here via TV Fanatic.\n\nLethal Weapon returns in the fall.\n\nPaul Dailly is the Associate Editor for TV Fanatic.
