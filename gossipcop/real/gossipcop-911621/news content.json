Time\n\nThe star of the Super Bowl halftime show wasn't Justin Timberlake. It was a 13-year-old trying to get a selfie.\n\nRyan McKenna was captured fiddling with his phone before he got a selfie with the pop star during the performance.\n\nThe image resulted in McKenna becoming the meme of the game.\n\nDuring an interview with Good Morning America on Monday, McKenna said he was capturing a video and his phone shut off, which is why we see him fiddling with his phone in the image.\n\n\"He just came up, and I just jumped right in there,\" he said. \"And he stopped right in our row, so it was perfect.\"\n\nMcKenna said right after it happened, his phone \"just exploded\" with notifications and social media followers.\n\n\"It's crazy. Everyone thinks it's so cool,\" he said.\n\nFollow Brett Molina on Twitter: @brettmolina23.", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5726420686001_5726423167001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5726431709001_5726430442001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad9277fd1cd37429e56b4f0345907c3c92254c99/c=0-173-4385-2650/local/-/media/2018/02/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636534191746371495-GTY-914370400.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad9277fd1cd37429e56b4f0345907c3c92254c99/c=0-173-4385-2650/local/-/media/2018/02/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636534191746371495-GTY-914370400.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brett Molina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/02/05/super-bowl-selfie-kid-reaction-its-crazy/306457002/", "title": "Super Bowl selfie kid on reaction: 'It's crazy'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/news/2018/02/05/super-bowl-selfie-kid-reaction-its-crazy/306457002/tech/news", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Super Bowl selfie kid on reaction: 'It's crazy'", "description": "Young fan trying to get selfie with Justin Timberlake was the Super Bowl's biggest viral star.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/ad9277fd1cd37429e56b4f0345907c3c92254c99/c=0-173-4385-2650/local/-/media/2018/02/05/USATODAY/USATODAY/636534191746371495-GTY-914370400.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Young fan trying to get selfie with Justin Timberlake was the Super Bowl's biggest viral star.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517788800.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
