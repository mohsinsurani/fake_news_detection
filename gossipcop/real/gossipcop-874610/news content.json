Today, the trailer was release for the upcoming season of Lip Sync Battle and Luna\u2019s cameo in it is obviously adorable.\n\nThe fifth season of the show \u2014 yes, there really have been that many installments \u2014 premieres January 17, 2019, and, when it does, Luna Simone Stephens is going to steal the show. The toddler doesn\u2019t lip sync in the next season of the series, but she does cheer on Big Bird and Elmo while they do. All the while Luna sits on her dad\u2019s shoulders and lap, as her mom is on host duty, dancing to The Black Eyed Peas\u2019 2010 hit \u201cI Gotta Feeling.\u201d \u201cWe loooooove Big Bird,\u201d Legend says.\n\nOf course, little else is given away by the trailer. But it does present a wide spectrum of guests in the fifth season of Lip Sync Battle. The guest list is stacked, too. Everyone from Mariah Carey and Serena Williams (doing Beyonc\u00e9, of course) to Darren Criss, Jason Schwartzman, Nico Tortorella, Molly Bernard, Jermaine Dupri, Boris Kodjoe, Pitbull, Vanessa Morgan, Andy Grammer, Andy Roddick, Brooklyn Decker, and Lele Pons make appearances.\n\nWilliams isn\u2019t the only one who takes on Beyonc\u00e9 in the next season; the Fab Five of Queer Eye also do their best Bey impressions. They dressed for the part, too, in the pop star\u2019s Coachella headlining set uniform of cutoff jean shorts and a cropped yellow letterman sweatshirt. There\u2019s even more Bey cosplay as Karamo Brown wears her costume from the music video for \u201cTelephone\u201d as Jonathan Van Ness dons Lady Gaga\u2019s attire from the same clip. \u201cI feel like Beyonc\u00e9, are you kidding me?,\u201d Brown says.\n\nTeigen recently talked about how she and cohost LL Cool J are able to draw so many big names to the show and, apparently, it couldn\u2019t be easier. \u201cHonestly, I don\u2019t have to recruit that many people,\u201d she told Billboard earlier this year as the fourth season premiered. \u201cI get people coming up to me saying that they want to be on the show. And that\u2019s always fun to see at, like, the Met Ball.\u201d Few guests, though, if any, look like they\u2019re having as much fun as her daughter, Luna.", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/12/13/5c11b621fc1d89676e794fda_Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-5.29.46-PM.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/12/13/5c11b621fc1d89676e794fda_Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-5.29.46-PM.png?w=414&h=299&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/6/764827f4-df1b-4787-84b7-37c43c4e6a6f-3cd82bb3-acc7-49da-bffb-7f7faa24f636-theidolhero.webp?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.7573&fp-y=0.6398", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/5/5231dd56-93b4-439a-84d5-464b5353756d-image001-8.jpg?w=160&h=160&fit=crop&crop=focalpoint&auto=format%2Ccompress&fp-x=0.4107&fp-y=0.2996"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/12/13/5c11b621fc1d89676e794fda_Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-5.29.46-PM.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/chrissy-teigen-john-legends-and-luna-on-lip-sync-battle-trailer", "title": "Chrissy Teigen and John Legend\u2019s Daughter Luna Makes Her Lip Sync Battle Debut", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@wmag", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@marissagmuller"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/wmagazine"}, "og": {"site_name": "W Magazine", "url": "https://www.wmagazine.com/story/chrissy-teigen-john-legends-and-luna-on-lip-sync-battle-trailer", "type": "article", "title": "Luna Legend Made Her Lip Sync Battle Debut and Obviously It's Adorable", "description": "Catch her in the trailer for the upcoming season.", "image": {"identifier": "https://imgix.bustle.com/wmag/2018/12/13/5c11b621fc1d89676e794fda_Screen-Shot-2018-12-12-at-5.29.46-PM.png?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "description": "Catch her in the trailer for the upcoming season."}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/3djx4KP2AxA"], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.wmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
