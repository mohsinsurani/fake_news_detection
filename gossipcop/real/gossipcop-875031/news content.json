Click here to get those and more in the PEOPLE Babies newsletter.\n\nSomerhalder referenced Reed\u2019s cover of Fit Pregnancy and Baby, writing, \u201cSeeing these images reminds me of those amazing 9 months that you sacrificed your whole being to grow our little one. The kindness, the beauty and organic nature of these photos makes me so very proud.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou brought such fun and such power into our lives being pregnant but you literally brought the word sexy into pregnancy, we all see it,\u201d he continued. \u201cThank you for being my partner in this life and thank you for inspiring not just me but all others who read, hear or see what your soul gives us.\u201d\n\nFROM PEN: Katherine Heigl Opens Up About Experiencing Her First Pregnancy\n\nPEOPLE confirmed the actors welcomed their daughter on July 25. The couple married in April 2015 after first being spotted together the previous July and getting engaged that January.\n\nReed told Fit Pregnancy and Baby that she and Somerhalder vowed to take \u201cone month of silence\u201d after their daughter\u2019s birth.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll take the baby\u2019s first month for ourselves,\u201d she said, posing for a stunning maternity shoot. \u201cJust the three of us, no visitors, and we\u2019re turning off our phones too, so there\u2019s no expectation for us to communicate \u2026 You don\u2019t get those first 30 days back, and we want to be fully present.\u201d", "images":
