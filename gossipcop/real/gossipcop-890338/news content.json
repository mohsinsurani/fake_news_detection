Actress and comedian Tiffany Haddish, recently took a peek into what really happens when unsuspecting bathroom goers try to ditch the soap and water, and let's just say it's not pretty.\n\nIt\u2019s all part of Method\u2019s newest PSA about washing your hands.\n\n\u201cShe just rinsed \u2014 she didn\u2019t put no soap \u2014that\u2019s how you get sick!\u201d Haddish says as she watches a woman skip out on the soap.\n\nAs one man DOES decide to lather up, Haddish responds, \u201cOh yes, he went for the soap, thank you God, a clean man is a good man!\n\nWhen it comes time to wash your hands after going to the bathroom, here are some facts to consider:\n\n-80% of common infections are spread by hands, according to the CDC.\n\n-111 million workdays will be lost, costing nearly $7 billion in lost productivity between October and May.\n\n-Talking on the phone in the bathroom can spread germs from your respiratory system onto the screen, those particles can live on the surface of your devices for up to 24 hours.\n\nAs for Haddish, when she\u2019s not helping make the world a cleaner place, she's been keeping busy acting and bringing her comedy show to venues around the world. She most recently starred in the hit comedy \"Girls Trip,\" alongside Jada Pinkett Smith, Queen Latifah and Regina Hall, and can also be seen on her new Showtime comedy special, \u201cTiffany Haddish: SHE READY! From the Hood to Hollywood.\u201d\n\nHaddish is set to host SNL with musical guest Taylor Swift on November 11th.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_44/1292813/tiffany-haddish-method-today-171031-tease.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_44/1292813/tiffany-haddish-method-today-171031-tease.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Christina Manna"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tiffany-haddish-fights-dirty-new-psa-hand-washing-t118245", "title": "Tiffany Haddish fights \"dirty\" in new PSA for hand washing", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/popculture/tiffany-haddish-fights-dirty-new-psa-hand-washing-t118245", "title": "Tiffany Haddish fights \"dirty\" in new PSA for hand washing", "description": "Ever wonder how many people actually wash their hands after going to the bathroom?
