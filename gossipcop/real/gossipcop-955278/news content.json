News has an exclusive look at Paul Bettany, Chadwick Boseman, Josh Brolin, Chris Evans, Danai Gurira, Chris Hemsworth, Scarlett Johansson, Anthony Mackie, Elizabeth Olsen and Sebastian Stan filming the devastating finale, culminating in\u2014spoiler alert!\u2014Thanos activating the Infinity Gauntlet and snapping his fingers, wiping out half the galaxy\u2019s population.\n\nBlack Panther? Bye. Groot? Gone. Spider-Man? See ya.\n\nThe final battle occurs after Thanos goes on a smash and grab across the universe to collect all six Infinity Stones, giving him unparalleled power. The Mind Stone is embedded in Vision\u2019s forehead, bringing Thanos to Wakanda\u2014where the Avengers, the Guardians of the Galaxy and a host of other superheroes are preparing to fight him to the death. \u201cWhen Thanos shows up, we really wanted to make this the most powerful moment ever,\u201d executive producer Trinh Tran says in a bonus featurette (included on the digital and Blu-ray editions of the blockbuster). Of course, deciding which heroes would vanish was a challenge. \u201cIn terms of our choices about who Thanos would end up eradicating with his snap, it was very story-focused. How do we pay off each individual character\u2019s storyline most profoundly?\u201d co-director Anthony Russo asks. \u201cThe first person to go is Bucky Barnes, and it\u2019s shot from Captain America\u2019s perspective.\u201d\n\n\n\nSimilarly, Russo notes that Okoye\u2019s \u201cNo. 1 mission in life\u201d is to protect King T\u2019Challa\u2014making it more heartbreaking to watch as she \u201cwatches the king go in front of her.\u201d No matter which characters turned to dust, Russo says, seeing how the surviving heroes react \u201cis very powerful.\u201d\n\nWhere will Captain America (Evans), Okoye (Gurira), Thor (Hemsworth), Black Widow (Johansson), Falcon (Mackie), Scarlet Witch (Olsen) and the other heroes go from here? That question won\u2019t be answered until the fourth and final Avengers film hits theaters in April 2019.\n\nOther bonus features available on Blu-ray and digital include 10 minutes of deleted and extended scenes, a gag reel and audio commentary with the directors and the screenwriters. It also contains more than two hours of never-before-revealed details of the Marvel Cinematic Universe\u2019s unprecedented, 10-year cinematic journey\u2014including a filmmakers round table.\n\nMarvel Studios\u2019 Avengers: Infinity War is available digitally July 31 and on Blu-ray Aug. 14.", "images": ["https://elizabeth-olsen.com/wp/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/hair-flip.gif",
