We see a theme here\u2026 the man has good cheekbones. Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome on stage GQ's Breakthrough Actor Of The Year, James Norton!\n\nHugo Boss Most Stylish Man: Zayn Malik\n\nDoug Inglish\n\nSome might say that going solo after years safely cocooned as a member of one of the world\u2019s most famous bands would be a risky move. Not for this man. His phenomenal first album, Mind Of Mine, hit No1 on both sides of the Atlantic, and with his debut single, \u201cPillowtalk\u201d, became only the third ever Brit to kick-start their solo career at the top of the American charts. But it\u2019s not just music \u2013 with a sense of style that is both effortless and idiosyncratic, it\u2019s our Hugo Boss Most Stylish Man, Zayn Malik.\n\nLegend of the Year: Sir Geoff Hurst\n\nPresented by GQ Editor Dylan Jones", "images": ["https://media.gq-magazine.co.uk/photos/5d1391037fcc8ef54d81f7b5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/11SirGeoffHurst.jpg",
