I love my children more than anything in the world. But like a lot of women, I too struggled with postpartum depression after my first baby was born,\u201d Gellar, 40, wrote.\n\n\u201cI got help, and made it through, and every day since has been the best gift I could ever have asked for,\u201d she continued. \u201cTo those of you going through this, know that you're not alone and that it really does get better.\u201d\n\nGellar \u2014 who also has a 4-year-old son, Rocky James Prinze, with husband Freddie Prinze Jr. \u2014 is the latest celebrity to open up about postpartum depression. Chrissy Teigen did so earlier this year in a personal essay published by Glamour.\n\nThe model and TV host, who has a 1-year-old daughter, Luna, with husband John Legend, wrote, \u201c(P)ostpartum does not discriminate. I couldn\u2019t control it. And that\u2019s part of the reason it took me so long to speak up: I felt selfish, icky, and weird saying aloud that I\u2019m struggling. Sometimes I still do.\u201d\n\nLast fall, Grammy-winning singer Adele discussed with Vanity Fair her own struggle with postpartum depression after she welcomed her son, Angelo, in 2012.\n\n\u201cI had really bad postpartum depression after I had my son, and it frightened me,\u201d she said, adding that it had left her feeling \u201cvery inadequate.\u201d\n\nRELATED", "images":
