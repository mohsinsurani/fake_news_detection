The site's critical consensus reads, \"The Assassination of Versace starts with a bang and unfurls slowly, moving backward through an intricate (and occasionally convoluted) murder mystery anchored by a career-defining performance from Darren Criss.\"[56] On Metacritic, the season has a score of 74 out of 100, based on 35 critics, indicating \"generally favorable reviews.\"[57]\n\nReaction from individuals involved [ edit ]\n\nIn January 2018, the Versace family released a statement criticizing the series. They explained they have \"neither authorized nor had any involvement whatsoever\" in the production of the season, before adding that it \"should only be considered as a work of fiction.\"[58] Executive producer Ryan Murphy answered that the series was \"not a work of fiction\" as it is based on a non-fiction book, Maureen Orth's Vulgar Favors, and that the production team and FX stand by the author and her work. Comparing it to The People v. O. J. Simpson, Murphy added that the season is \"a work of non-fiction obviously with docudrama elements,\" and not a documentary.[58] Following this answer, the Versace family released a second statement, still slamming the series as \"a work of fiction\" because \"the Orth book itself is full of gossip and speculation.\" They also heavily criticized Orth's work, calling it an \"effort to create a sensational story\" with \"second-hand hearsay that is full of contradictions.\" They gave the example of Gianni Versace's medical condition, as Orth claims that Versace was HIV positive at the time of his death.[59]\n\nAntonio D'Amico also criticized the series, deeming some scenes as \"ridiculous\" and insisting that \"so much has been fictionalized\". He also revealed that he does not plan to watch it, but that he would have been happy if Ricky Martin, who plays his role, got in contact to get some insight into his relationship with Versace.[60]\n\nAccording to Ryan Murphy, Donatella Versace was very supportive that Pen\u00e9lope Cruz played her role. As Cruz and Versace are friends, Murphy explained that, when he offered her the role, Cruz asked the permission of Versace before agreeing to do it. He also revealed that, while Cruz was representing the series at the 75th Golden Globe Awards, Versace \"very graciously sent [her] a lovely and huge flower arrangement saying 'good luck.'\"[58]\n\nRatings [ edit ]\n\nAccolades [ edit ]\n\nNotes [ edit ]\n\n^ [6] This episode was available five days before the official premiere for FX+ subscribers.", "images": ["https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/poweredby_mediawiki_88x31.png", "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Special:CentralAutoLogin/start?type=1x1", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/thumb/8/8a/OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg/10px-OOjs_UI_icon_edit-ltr-progressive.svg.png", "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/American_Crime_Story_season_2_poster.jpg", "https://en.wikipedia.org/static/images/footer/wikimedia-button.png"], "top_img": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/American_Crime_Story_season_2_poster.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Assassination_of_Gianni_Versace:_American_Crime_Story", "title": "The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story", "meta_data": {"generator": "MediaWiki 1.40.0-wmf.3", "referrer": "origin-when-cross-origin", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "og": {"image": {"identifier": "https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/en/4/46/American_Crime_Story_season_2_poster.jpg", "width": 640, "height": 960}, "title": "The Assassination of Gianni Versace: American Crime Story - Wikipedia", "type": "website"}, "viewport": "width=1000"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://en.wikipedia.org", "summary": ""}
