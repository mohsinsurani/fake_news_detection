Today, the social media star visited the City of Lights for Virgil Abloh's inaugural show for Louis Vuitton. The designer is a close friend and collaborator of Kim's husband, Kanye West. The last time Kim was in Paris was also for fashion week.\n\nTMZ reports that the Wests were \"surrounded by their muscle,\" so they likely took extra precautions with security this time around. Even behind the big men in suits, Kim could be spotted from a mile away in a bright electric blue wrap coat featuring a waist tie and utilitarian pockets with her go-to biker shorts. Kardashian noted on Twitter that she wore Abloh's collection to the presentation.\n\nGetty Images\n\nHer husband, on the other hand, went with his signature athleisure-inspired look with a printed long sleeve tee that reads messages like \"There is only one freedom,\" \"I am loving,\" and \"Awareness.\"\n\nKim's youngest sister Kylie Jenner was also present, wearing a similar bright ensemble. Her iteration, however, was a neon yellow jumpsuit. The trio sat together in the front row.\n\n\n\nGetty Images\n\nKim went dark on social media and stayed out of the public eye after the robbery in her Paris hotel room almost two years ago. However, she eventually opened up about the experience on camera during Keeping Up with the Kardashians, where she recounted jarring details from the incident such as having the gun held up to her head, thinking she was going to die or get raped, being gagged with duct tape, realizing there was no way out, and fearing for her family.\n\nAfter the episode aired, Kim reflected on the experience on Instagram. \"I would never wish this experience upon anyone, but have learned some valuable lessons & feel so blessed to be safe home with my babies & husband. To my friends, family, and loved ones I can't thank you enough for being there when I needed you the most. To the French police, thank you for your incredible hard work,\" she wrote in her caption.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-attend-the-2020-vanity-fair-news-photo-1613766810.?crop=1.00xw:0.810xh;0,0.0259xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kourtney-kardashian-and-travis-barker-attend-the-2021-mtv-news-photo-1634525387.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.204xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kim-kardashian-attends-the-2019-e-peoples-choice-awards-at-news-photo-1600265679.jpg?crop=0.671xw:1.00xh;0.228xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kanye-west-kim-kardashian-paris-2018-2-1529595229.jpg?crop=0.6668810289389068xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1345854582.jpg?crop=0.765xw:1.00xh;0.172xw,0.00223xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/pictured-kourtney-kardashian-khloe-kardashian-and-kim-news-photo-1599655678.jpg?crop=0.947xw:0.631xh;0.0224xw,0.0481xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2020-06-30-at-10-23-30-am-1593530382.png?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kanye-west-kim-kardashian-paris-2018-3-1529595213.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kanye-west-kim-kardashian-paris-2018-1-1529595316.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kanye-west-and-kim-kardashian-west-attend-the-2016-mtv-news-photo-1595429455.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.667xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-kardashians-key-art-horizontal-1649792381.jpg?crop=0.409xw:1.00xh;0.0641xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/media-personality-kim-kardashian-west-arrives-to-attend-the-news-photo-1617718934.?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.111xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bgus-2096715-001-1617029788.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.774xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kylie-jenner-megan-thee-stallion-lead-1594648702.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kylie-jenner-and-daughter-stormi-webster-arrive-at-nobu-news-photo-1621441169.?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kanye-west-kim-kardashian-paris-2018-00-index-1529595850.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-kanye-west-kim-kardashian-paris-2018-00-index-1529595850.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a21750559/kim-kardashian-paris-first-time-after-robbery/", "title": "Kim Kardashian Returns to Paris for the First Time Since Her Robbery in 2016", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Kim Kardashian Returns to Paris for the First Time Since Her Robbery in 2016", "description": "\u200bKim Kardashian has returned to Paris for the first time since being robbed at gunpoint\u200b of more than $10 million in jewelry in October 2016.
