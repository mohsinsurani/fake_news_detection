The second? The Grapefruit Method, an oral sex technique demonstrated (hilariously) by Tiffany Haddish\u2014without question the breakout star of Girls Trip.\n\nThe Grapefruit Method isn't a new term or something invented by the film\u2013it was actually first popularized back in 2014 by viral tutorial videos from Auntie Angel of Angel's Erotic Solutions. (You can see that here.) But in a scene-stealing moment of the film, Haddish's character, Dina, demonstrates for her friends the oral sex act while using a grapefruit and a banana as props. Since then, the scene has launched many discussions about whether it's for real.\n\nThe directions, according to Dina, are simple: Cut off the top and bottom of a room-temperature grapefruit, then cut a hole in the middle of it. Place the grapefruit on your partner's member, and then...well, twist.\n\nYou can see a portion of it in the clip below:\n\nContent This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\n\"Grapefruiting is an act of love,\" Haddish explained to Entertainment Weekly in an interview. \"Make it mystical and magical.\" It certainly had an effect on-set: Jada Pinkett Smith told EW that Haddish started receiving love letters from the crew after filming. \"That\u2019s true,\" Haddish confirmed. \"Somebody bought me something from Jared jewelry. All the guys started coming to my comedy shows.\"\n\nAnd Auntie Angel herself thinks the movie got it right, with one exception: \"Use a condom,\" she told TooFab. \"There are chances that citrus can get into his urethra, and he can have a bad experience\u2014and, of course, they proved that in the movie.\"", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/6329474bb50d0b1a795b88d8/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1499293398/glamour_women-answer-how-many-sexual-partners.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5976281573aedb63556f3983/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-universal.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/631b42495b698ec11e40b814/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/631cb50c91774a27eec4cefa/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5976281573aedb63556f3983/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-universal.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5976281573aedb63556f3983/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-universal.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Anna Moeslein"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/girls-trip-grapefruit-sex-scene", "title": "So About That Grapefruit Oral Sex Scene in 'Girls Trip'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "There's a scene in 'Girls Trip' where breakout star Tiffany Haddish demonstrates how to use a grapefruit during oral sex.", "id": "59761aa773aedb63556f397d", "keywords": "movies,girls trip,sex,sex tips", "news_keywords": "movies,girls trip,sex,sex tips", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59761aa773aedb63556f397d", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"There's a scene in 'Girls Trip' where breakout star Tiffany Haddish demonstrates how to use a grapefruit during oral sex.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5976281573aedb63556f3983/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-universal.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/5976281573aedb63556f3983/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-universal.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5976281573aedb63556f3983/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-universal.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "So About That Grapefruit Oral Sex Scene in 'Girls Trip'", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/girls-trip-grapefruit-sex-scene"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-07-24T18:00:00.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-07-24T18:00:00.000Z", "author": "Anna Moeslein"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/5976281573aedb63556f3983/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/tiffany-haddish-girls-trip-universal.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "So About That Grapefruit Oral Sex Scene in 'Girls Trip'"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1500919200.0, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
