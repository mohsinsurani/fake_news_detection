However, the Emmy in the category was awarded to Laura Dern for her work in Big Little Lies \u2014 an announcement that prompted Hoffman to scream \u201cDamnit!\u201d multiple times while the camera was still on her.\n\nAs evidenced by Hoffman\u2019s tweets as the night wore on, her disappointed reaction was clearly meant to be a joke. \u201cI hear the media actually taking my reaction seriously? Are you kidding me?\u201d she wrote, later adding, \u201cStephen Colbert knelt by my chair like a knight and told me how happy he is for me and my work and Loved my reaction. Good night.\u201d\n\nThe Internet, of course, loved Hoffman\u2019s flair for the dramatic. \u201cJackie Hoffman\u2019s \u201cDAMN IT! DAMN IT!\u201d is the secret iconic moment of the night,\u201d one Twitter user wrote.\n\nSee some of the best reactions to the moment below.\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jesse-Bryant-skiing-at-JHMR-e1612191790559.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/sean-spicer-snlspicer.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "title": "The Internet Is Loving This Hilariously Over-the-Top Reaction to Losing at the Emmys", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The 2017 Emmys were full of hilarious moments, but the sneaky best bit of the night may have been Jackie Hoffman's reaction to losing.", "og": {"title": "The Internet Is Loving This Hilariously Over-the-Top Reaction to Losing at the Emmys", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "description": "\"What a national treasure\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1", "width": 780, "height": 550}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "description": "The 2017 Emmys were full of hilarious moments, but the sneaky best bit of the night may have been Jackie Hoffman's reaction to losing.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4946101/emmys-2017-jackie-hoffman-losing-reaction/", "title": "The Internet Is Loving This Hilariously Over-the-Top Reaction to Losing at the Emmys", "description": "\"What a national treasure\"", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/screen-shot-2017-09-18-at-9-55-40-am.png?w=780&h=550&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
