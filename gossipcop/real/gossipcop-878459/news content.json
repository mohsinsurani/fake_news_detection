But they don\u2019t realize in 2015 in \u2018Bad Blood,\u2019 Taylor Swift was wearing a black crop top. I really do think, by the way, that Beyonc\u00e9 copied \u2018Bad Blood.\u2019\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s a bold statement from a man who\u2019s already felt the fire of the Lemonade singer\u2019s fans, but Kahn is no stranger to controversy when it comes to his collaborations with Swift.\n\nHe came to Swift\u2019s defense in a statement in 2015, explaining his creative vision with Swift after the \u201cWildest Dreams\u201d video was widely criticized for glamorizing African colonialism.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/taylor-swift-houston.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Jesse-Bryant-skiing-at-JHMR-e1612191790559.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4932012/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood/", "title": "Taylor Swift Video Director Said Beyonce Copied Bad Blood", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Taylor Swift's music video director Joseph Kahn is making an interesting claim that Beyonc\u00e9 copied Swift's video \"Bad Blood.\"", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Video Director Says Beyonc\u00e9 Copied 'Bad Blood'", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4932012/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood/", "description": "Apparently, Joseph Kahn isn't afraid of the Beyonc\u00e9's fan", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4932012/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood/", "description": "Taylor Swift's music video director Joseph Kahn is making an interesting claim that Beyonc\u00e9 copied Swift's video \"Bad Blood.\"", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4932012/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood/", "title": "Taylor Swift Video Director Says Beyonc\u00e9 Copied 'Bad Blood'", "description": "Apparently, Joseph Kahn isn't afraid of the Beyonc\u00e9's fan", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/taylor-swift-music-video-director-says-beyonce-copied-bad-blood.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
