You know, everybody's different. But there was something about him.\"\n\n\"I honestly thought I was asexual \u2014 I'd never been turned on like that in my whole life,\" she said. \"I was like, 'Oh that's that feeling\u2026 okay! That's what they were talking about in Waiting to Exhale.' I just got it. I just didn't have a clue.\"\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nKelly Clarkson at the SiriusXM Meaning of Life album listening session\n\nThe pair, who married in 2013, first met at a rehearsal for the Academy of Country Music Awards in 2006 where she was performing a duet with Rascal Flatts on their tune \"What Hurts the Most.\" Blackstock was the country group's tour manager at the time.\n\n\"My guitar player's wife Ashley was my date for that night and we had just both been in crap relationships,\" Clarkson explained. \"Sometimes it sucks dating because it's so many wrong ones until you get the right one. And we were like, 'Okay, what we've been doing wrong here' \u2014 because it was a country music event and we're both southern girls \u2014 we were like, 'We've been dating skinny jeans and we need Wranglers.' \"\n\n\"Literally, I'm not joking, he walked past us at that time,\" Clarkson continued. \"And he walked by, I was like, ready to take it all off. I just felt something.\"\n\nChristopher Polk/Getty\n\nBrandon Blackstock and Kelly Clarkson as the 2013 Grammy Awards\n\nNothing happened then, of course. He was married at the time to Melissa Ashworth, and as Clarkson was quick to point out to the crowd, she \"ain't that girl.\"\n\n\"Honestly, I didn't even talk to him,\" she said, explaining that it wasn't until 2012, when Blackstock and Ashworth divorced, that Clarkson even saw him again \u2014 well after learning about his split from Blackstock's father, Narvel (who was managing her), and Narvel's now ex-wife Reba McEntire.\n\n\"We didn't really know each other; I had just met him that one time,\" Clarkson recalled. \"Just from that one time, even six years later, I had never really dated anyone. I honest to God thought, 'Is this what it's like to be asexual?' I was just not attracted to people.\"\n\nKevin Mazur/WireImage\n\nKelly Clarkson at the 2012 Super Bowl\n\nClarkson and Blackstock would finally end up meeting at the Super Bowl in 2012, where she was performing the national anthem and Blake Shelton, whom Blackstock manages, was singing \"America the Beautiful\" (alongside his now ex-wife Miranda Lambert).\n\nThe event was high-pressure for Clarkson, and not for the reasons one might think.\n\n\"I was so nervous because it wasn't that I didn't want to suck for the millions of people watching, I didn't want to suck because I was trying to impress a guy,\" Clarkson joked. \"I wanted him to be like, 'Damn.' It had nothing to do with the Super Bowl!\"\n\n\"We didn't even know each other, but he had walked past me once and there was a moment in my crazy head,\" she said. \"He thought I hated him, too. When I finally confessed that, 'I really dig you,' He was so shocked because he thought I hated him. I hadn't let on that I liked him. Inside I was like, 'Ask me out!' but outside I was like, 'I love being single and coming home every night alone. It's awesome.'\n\nBruce Glikas/FilmMagic\n\nBrandon Blackstock and Kelly Clarkson in 2015\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kelly Clarkson Claims She Was Drunk At the From Justin To Kelly Movie Premiere\n\nShe remained coy on what exactly she said that got Blackstock interested (\"It involved alcohol \u2026 you get really bold when you're drunk\"). But looking back, on it all, the \"Because of You\" singer \u2014 who shares four kids with Blackstock now, including 16-year-old stepdaughter Savannah, 10-year-old stepson Seth, 18-month-old son Remington \"Remy\" Alexander and 3-year-old daughter River Rose \u2014 knows that what she has with Blackstock is unique.\n\n\"It's a hard thing to find that feeling,' she said. \"I always tell [Savannah], 'Wait it out. Wait until you get those goosebumps.' Because if it's not, it's not worth it.\"", "images":
