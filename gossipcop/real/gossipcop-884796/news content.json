Petty, 66, died Monday after going into cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu, California.\n\nThe paper on Wednesday published the full audio of the interview with pop music writer Randy Lewis, which lasts for just over an hour. Lewis had interviewed Petty before and the rocker sounds relaxed, easily breaking into laughter, yet eager to discuss the future.\n\nRelated: Tom Petty, Rock Craftsman Admired for Four Decades, Dies at 66\n\n\"I'm excited to get into the studio again. I just have to learn to rest a little bit,\" Petty said. \"Everyone is telling me I need to stop working for a period of time. ... If I don\u2019t have a project going, I don\u2019t feel like I\u2019m connected to anything. I don\u2019t even think it's that healthy for me. I like to get out of bed and have a purpose.\"\n\nAlong with his band the Heartbreakers, Petty helped weave the fabric of American rock-and-roll for decades. Petty and the Heartbreakers had just wrapped up a successful six-month tour on Sept. 25, but when asked if that was the band's last hurrah, Petty chuckled.\n\n\"We laugh and say among ourselves, why do they think we would quit?\" he asked. \"I mean, if one of us went down, or one of us died, or God forbid got sick ... then we\u2019d stop. I think that would be the end of it, if someone couldn\u2019t do it.\u201d\n\nHe admitted that the 53-show, 40th-anniversary tour had been \"grueling\" because it was so long, but expressed interest in getting back to performing after a brief reprieve.\n\nTom Petty performs on the main stage on day 2 of The Isle of Wight Festival at Seaclose Park on June 22, 2012 in Newport, Isle of Wight.

But this keeps us young.\"\n\nPetty and his band were inducted into the Rock 'n' Roll Hall of Fame in 2002 and got to perform four of their hits at the halftime of the Super Bowl in 2008.\n\nHe called the response to his recent tour \"ridiculous.\"\n\n\"It's been very successful \u2014 beyond my wildest dreams,\" Petty said.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201710/2017-10-03T22-55-20-333Z--1280x720.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_03/2175586/171002-tom-petty-ac-529p.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_28/2931056/190618-elizabeth_chuck-byline1144.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms", "Elizabeth Chuck", "Elizabeth Chuck Is A Reporter For Nbc News Who Focuses On Health", "Mental Health", "Particularly Issues That Affect Women"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/tom-petty-s-final-interview-just-days-his-death-working-n807471", "title": "Tom Petty's Final Interview Just Days Before His Death: Working 'Keeps Me Young'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/pop-culture/music/tom-petty-s-final-interview-just-days-his-death-working-n807471", "title": "Days before he died, Tom Petty told interviewer: Work 'keeps me young'", "description": "Days before he died, Petty reflected on the 40th anniversary tour with his band and told a reporter he had no plans to retire because work \"keeps me young.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "title": "Days before he died, Tom Petty told interviewer: Work 'keeps me young'", "description": "Days before he died, Petty reflected on the 40th anniversary tour with his band and told a reporter he had no plans to retire because work \"keeps me young.\"", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "Days before he died, Petty reflected on the 40th anniversary tour with his band and told a reporter he had no plans to retire because work \"keeps me young.\"", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "Days before he died, Tom Petty told interviewer: Work 'keeps me young'", "description": "Days before he died, Petty reflected on the 40th anniversary tour with his band and told a reporter he had no plans to retire because work \"keeps me young.\"", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "type": "article", "unibrow": "Music", "authorThumbnail1": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2019_28/2931056/190618-elizabeth_chuck-byline1144.jpg", "authorName1": "Elizabeth Chuck"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Wed Oct 04 2017 21:05:00 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Wed Oct 04 2017 21:09:25 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_40/2175431/171002-tom-petty-ac-420p.jpg", "next-head-count": 101}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507151100.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
