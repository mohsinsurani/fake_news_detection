Actress Meghan Markle is invited to join boyfriend Prince Harry at Pippa Middleton\u2019s wedding to James Matthews next month, multiple outlets reported this week. However, there\u2019s a caveat.\n\nWhen Middleton, 33, weds Matthews, 41, at St. Mark\u2019s Church in Berkshire on May 20, Markle will not be present for the actual ceremony. According to People, unwritten protocol calls for only the married and engaged partners of invited guests to physically witness the bride and groom exchange vows. The bride and groom are already expected to have a small wedding, though they\u2019re opening up the after-party to a larger number of guests.\n\nWhile the Suits actress will not witness the nuptials, Markle has secured a seat at the couple\u2019s reception. According to Us Weekly, the outdoor party will be held at the Middleton family\u2019s Bucklebury estate later that evening, and a luxury tent will be erected on the grounds of the garden.\n\nMarkle\u2019s invite to the high-profile nuptials indicates that she and Prince Harry are getting rather serious. According to Us, this isn\u2019t the first wedding the two have attended together. The actress also recently joined Harry in Jamaica for his best friend Tom Inskip\u2019s destination nuptials.\n\nOne source tells the magazine that an engagement is expected sometime in 2017. Just this past Easter weekend, Prince Harry joined Markle in Toronto in lieu of formal Easter festivities with Queen Elizabeth II.\n\nWhile Markle has scored a place card at what\u2019s expected to be the wedding of the year, the Canadian native will miss out on loads of cuteness during the ceremony. As previously reported, Kensington Palace confirmed that both Prince George and Princess Charlotte will have starring roles in the wedding as a page boy and a bridesmaid.\n\nIt still remains unknown whether Duchess of Cambridge Kate Middleton will serve in the wedding party, though the Palace also confirmed that she will be attending alongside Prince William.", "images": ["https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/GettyImages-1038262530-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/12/cropped-the-knot-news-logo@2x.png", "https://media-api.xogrp.com/images/cec381d2-93e9-4201-9271-30f51f4fec94~rs_200.h", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-1500.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Questions-About-How-Coronavirus-Could-Affect-Your-Wedding_-Read-This-LEAD-shutterstock-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/shutterstock_1554396644-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/89960078_664744544273850_2656838980867194880_o-120x67.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/authors/elee-9.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/Pippa-Middleton-Kate-Middleton-Bridesmaid-1024x676.jpg", "http://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/GettyImages-630514956-1024x565.jpg", "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/IMG_2127-120x67.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.theknotnews.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/Prince-Harry-Meghan-Markle-1500.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Esther Is The Senior News Editor At The Knot.
