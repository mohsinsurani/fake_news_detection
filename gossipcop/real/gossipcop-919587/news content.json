I was the person that if you had a baby at a party, I would go up to them and shake their hand. On planes when babies would cry, I would be mad at the families. Now I\u2019m like, \u2018Let them cry! Let them do whatever they want! They can sit on me and poop if they want! Whatever they want!'\u201d\n\nThe actress then thanked Colbert for the gift he and his wife sent Katherine, which consisted of white baby clothes. \u201cWith a baby girl, you get sent a lot of colorful things and pink things, and I thought this was so sweet and very fancy,\u201d the actress said.\n\nColbert admitted that the outfit is a bit old-fashioned. \u201cBabies are eternal. They can fit in any time period,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cThis is a little late 19th century.\u201d Kaling responded, \u201cIf I\u2019m crossing the Titanic with my baby, hoping for a new future for myself, this is the outfit I put her in.\u201d\n\nBefore revealing the present Oprah gave to her and Katherine, Kaling wanted to acknowledge Colbert\u2019s present one more time. \u201cI love the outfit that you and Evie gave me. It\u2019s so beautiful and nice,\u201d she began. \u201cIt straight up sucks compared to what Oprah gave me, and I mean that with love.\u201d\n\nKaling explained that she received a call at work stating that Oprah\u2019s gift was being sent to her home accompanied by a U-Haul and two men. \u201cOprah\u2019s present to me was a hand-carved bookcase packed with 100 of the essential children\u2019s books of all literature, and each book was inscribed with a little sticker that said \u2018Katherine\u2019s Book Club\u2019 \u2014 like \u2018Oprah\u2019s Book Club,\u2019\u201d she revealed. \u201cThe bookcase was carved in the shape of an old-timey castle.\u201d After noticing an uncomfortable Colbert, Kaling concluded, \u201cIt\u2019s such a nice present! And yours was such a nice present.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe were gonna do that. I heard Oprah was gonna do it, so we did this instead,\u201d Colbert joked. \u201cI\u2019m very happy for Oprah.\u201d The host then added, \u201cThat\u2019s amazing. She gave me a box of steak knives once.\u201d\n\nThe actress tried one more time to show her gratitude for Colbert\u2019s present. \u201cShe\u2019s so lucky to be able to look like a 19th century baby,\u201d she said.\n\nWatch the full clip below.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mindy_kaling_liked_stephens_baby_gift-h_2018_0.jpg?w=928", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mindy_kaling_liked_stephens_baby_gift-h_2018_0.jpg?w=928", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Katherine Schaffstall"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/mindy-kaling-reveals-oprahs-baby-gift-says-colberts-present-sucks-by-comparison-1093315/", "title": "Mindy Kaling Reveals Oprah\u2019s Baby Gift, Says Colbert\u2019s Present \u201cSucks\u201d by Comparison", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\u201cWe were gonna do that,\" Colbert joked of the media mogul's gift. \"I heard Oprah was gonna do it, so we did this instead.\"", "news_keywords": "Late-Night TV, Mindy Kaling, Oprah Winfrey, Stephen Colbert", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Katherine Schaffstall", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1093315, "title": "Mindy Kaling Reveals Oprah's Baby Gift, Says Colbert's Present \"Sucks\" by Comparison", "published_at": "2018-03-09 08:14:01", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/03/mindy_kaling_liked_stephens_baby_gift-h_2018_0.jpg?w=928", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Stephen Colbert", "topics": "TV News", "body": "New mom Mindy Kaling stopped by The Late Show on Thursday to promote A Wrinkle in Time, though the conversation quickly turned to the topic of her two-month-old daughter Katherine. \u201cI\u2019m a new mom, so I don\u2019t have to be at home with my kid,\u201d Kaling joked after host Stephen Colbert thanked her for being on the show.\r\nAs for her thoughts on motherhood, Kaling said, \u201cIt\u2019s really profound and strange and I was not a kid person at all.
