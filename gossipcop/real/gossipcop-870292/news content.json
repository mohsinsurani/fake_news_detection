Although for years Goop was a lighting rod for derisive attacks on privileged celebrities, it has also emerged as an unlikely model for career development among a certain swathe of Hollywood. NYT\n\nGwyneth Paltrow, the 42-year-old Oscar-winner, conscious-uncoupler and Tracy Anderson devotee, is changing.\n\nPaltrow is in a backroom of a glass-walled apartment (not her own) high over East End Avenue, with striking views of Gracie Mansion and the East River, shedding one outfit \u2013 black leather trousers, black cashmere shell, a black biker jacket \u2013 and donning another.\n\nShe is not alone; with her is Lisa Gersh, the 55-year-old owner of said apartment, a founder of Oxygen Media, the former chief executive of Martha Stewart Living Omnimedia, Tracy Anderson devotee and, as of last month, CEO of Goop, the aspirational \u2013 and controversial \u2013 lifestyle wellness-blog-cum-travel-and-cooking-tip-sheet-cum-shopping website Paltrow founded in 2008, and which Paltrow says she likes to think of as \u201ccontextual commerce.\u201d\n\nBoth women are getting Gooped-up.\n\nWhen they emerge, Paltrow is wearing a gray boy-cut jacket with gold buttons (Goop collaboration with Band of Outsiders, 2013) and cropped gray trousers (ditto); Gersh, a black tailored jacket (Goop collaboration with Stella McCartney, 2013) and leather trousers (Goop collaboration with Mackage, 2014). They are ready for their close-up.\n\nCelebrity commerce\n\nThough for years Goop was a lightning rod for derisive attacks on privileged and tone-deaf celebrities or a \u201cpleasingly wiggy\u201d (in the words of The London Times) guilty pleasure, depending on your point of view, it has also emerged as an unlikely model for career development among a certain swathe of Hollywood.\n\n\u201cThe other day Drew Barrymore and I were talking, and she said, \u2018Thank you for going first and getting all the scratches,\u2019 \u201d Paltrow said, noting that Barrymore had started a cosmetic line, Flower, in 2012. This was not long after Jessica Alba created her site, the Honest Co., to offer natural baby products and diapers; which was only a few years before Blake Lively founded Preserve, a made-in-America crafty vision; and Ellen DeGeneres introduced her E.D. brand, an ambitious project that bowed on QVC last month with holiday home wares and will expand next year into numerous product categories, as well as a website and bricks and mortar retail; and Reese Witherspoon announced that she was starting Draper James, a lifestyle brand, due in 2015.\n\nSo if Paltrow and Gersh think it\u2019s time to stake their claims and raise the ante \u2013 well, it\u2019s understandable.\n\n\u201cCelebrities are increasingly moving from endorsing products to being the product,\u201d said John Demsey, group president of Est\u00e9e Lauder. \u201cThis is only going to get more common.\u201d\n\nThe question is why, and whether it will last.\n\nLucrative role for actresses\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like heroin,\u201d said Graydon Carter, editor of Vanity Fair and host of the New Establishment Summit. \u201cYou get on Twitter, and then you are dispensing advice about face cream to 500 followers, and the next thing you know you are a lifestyle guru.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s really part of a continuum,\u201d said Demsey, who traces the phenomenon back to the first half of the 20th century with Helena Rubinstein and Est\u00e9e Lauder, women who sold their products by painting them in the colors of their own glamorous lifestyles. It moved on through the age of the model-as-spokeswoman (Cindy Crawford, Kathy Ireland); reached its apogee in the form of Martha Stewart; was adapted by reality TV stars, chefs and athletes to their own ends; and finally made the leap to actors, spurred on by the changing economics of Hollywood, the rise of social media and the ease of setting up a business online.\n\n\u201cActors are not making anywhere as much money as they used to,\u201d Carter said. \u201cHollywood is not making the kinds of movies that require gifted performers. They are making the kind of tent pole movies that require rippling abs, and women as extras. So you have to make up that income somehow.\u201d\n\nBuying a lifestyle\n\nBut what, exactly, is someone buying when they buy into Goop or Preserve? Besides a monogrammable wooden longboard ($495, Goop) or a custom-made geometric print Pendleton wool \u201ctrail trench cloak\u201d ($1,350, Preserve), that is.\n\n\u201cA set of values that are associated with Gwyneth,\u201d said Gersh, looking pointedly at the subject, who was sitting kitty-corner to her at her kitchen table, just past the breakfast bar with its basket of healthy snacks, as a case in point.\n\nAdvice and approval, according to Christopher Burch, the entrepreneur co-founder of Tory Burch, among other retail brands, and now DeGeneres\u2019 partner in E.D. \u201cI think most people consider Ellen their buddy or girlfriend, and if your buddy says to you, \u2018You would look really good in this,' you usually think, \u2018Well, OK,'\u201d he said.\n\nIn the case of Goop, that advice comes in the form of weekly newsletters, which feature such musings as \u201cwe\u2019re on an unquenchable quest to experience every type of modality to help us heal, expand and deepen our understanding of all life\u2019s mysteries\u201d (by way of introducing a psychic they had discovered, as well as poking some fun at themselves), and suggestions for where to eat or stay while traveling, including a Los Angeles restaurant with a \u201cpint-sized protein plate.\u201d (Paltrow does not write these but does oversee the choice of subject matter and approves a final edit.)\n\nMaking money, giving back\n\nBeyond their famous founders, all the brands share certain characteristics: an element of e-commerce, a focus on giving back (Preserve donates 5 percent of every sale in its Taste, Style and Home sections to Covenant House; Goop directs subscribers to the Edible Schoolyard Project and Pencils of Promises, among other nonprofits), and the involvement of serious corporate retail. The managing partner of E.D., for example, is Marisa Gardini, former chief executive of Isaac Mizrahi, while Witherspoon hired Andrea Hyde, former president of C. Wonder (another Burch brand) as her CEO.\n\nNot surprisingly, social media has played a crucial role in building the businesses, with new followers daily. Paltrow has 2.03 million followers on Twitter and 541,745 on Instagram; Alba, some 7.72 million Twitter followers and 4,151,783 Instagram; Lively, 120,000 on Twitter and 790,883 on Instagram, and counting. Every one of those followers is a potential customer.\n\n\u201cYou have to constantly catch people\u2019s attention, whether it\u2019s with a new hairstyle or a new boyfriend, but it\u2019s risky to put yourself out there so much,\u201d said the designer and director Tom Ford. \u201cIf people get to know you too closely, they might realize you are just like them, and not as exciting as they thought.\u201d\n\nExposure and criticism\n\nOverexposure can erode mystique, which is a crucial part of movie star appeal. Paltrow\u2019s public discourse, while keeping her in the public eye at a time when she cut down her movie commitments to \u201cabout once a year,\u201d has also attracted its share of vocal critics.\n\nRecently she took to Goop to defend statements she had made about the attractions of working a 9-to-5 job that had provoked a firestorm of ire and that she believed had been misrepresented. \u201cI am constantly perplexed and amazed by how little slack we cut each other as women,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThen there is the taint of commercialism associated with salesmanship, a potential risk for anyone associated with an \u201cartistic\u201d career. Paltrow said this did not concern her because \u201cevery Oscar winner has a cosmetics contract\u201d (this is not entirely true: while Sandra Bullock, Natalie Portman, Reese Witherspoon and Kate Winslet have all embraced the brand ambassador age, Meryl Streep, at least, has stayed away). But \u201cit does impact the way people perceive you,\u201d Kamins said.\n\nToo accessible?\n\n\u201cThe greatest asset in the world is unavailability,\u201d Carter said. Indeed, it is notable that the actors on New York magazine\u2019s \u201c100 most valuable stars in Hollywood\u201d list are almost all famed for their privacy, be they George Clooney or Angelina Jolie. (Witherspoon is the only lifestyle-brand-in-waiting name to make the list, at No. 48). By contrast, Lively used her website to gazump all gossip sites by announcing her pregnancy, while Paltrow notoriously revealed that she and her husband at the time, Chris Martin, were separating on Goop.\n\n\u201cThis is a short game,\u201d Carter said. \u201cThe Internet allowed it to happen, but it may not be the best thing to have happened.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s possible we will all be sitting around in 10 years and saying, \u2018Hey, remember that moment everyone had a clothing line and a blog?'\u201d Ford said. \u201cThe truth is, no one really knows where this will go.\u201d\n\nPaltrow and Gersh, however, have an idea.\n\n\u201cWorld domination!\u201d Gersh laughed. Next to her, Paltrow let loose a nervous giggle and flicked her hair. She may have been imagining the headline the next day. Gersh, however, looked unabashed. It is, after all, what she has been hired to do.\n\nGrowing, but not profitable\n\nWhen Paltrow started the site, she envisioned it as a clearinghouse for friends to enjoy her recipe and travel recommendations, she said, and \u201cnever thought it would be a commercial venture.\u201d She added: \u201cIt was a place to have some freedom\u201d while she was spending more time at home with her children.\n\nIt was Juliet de Baubigny of the venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield Byers (famed for its investments in Facebook, Groupon and Spotify, among other companies), who suggested Paltrow think about turning Goop into a business, introducing her to her first chief executive, Seb Bishop (he left by mutual agreement when Paltrow decided to move the business with her to Los Angeles). The learning curve, she said, \u201chas been enormous.\u201d\n\nThe company is growing\u2013 it has 15 employees, nine in New York (where the corporate side is based) and six in Los Angeles (creative) \u2013 but the Manhattan office is still a shared WeWork space. And while Alba\u2019s Honest Co. recently raised $70 million and is already talking about an initial public offering, Goop is still in \u201cinvestment phase,\u201d business-speak for losing money.\n\nCreative content\n\nBetween the heightened competition and the expansion plans, it\u2019s hard not to wonder if Paltrow considers herself primarily an actor or a businesswoman. \u201cI don\u2019t like to think I have to be one thing or the other,\u201d she said, looking out over the East River at the sunset. Gersh shakes her head and joined in.\n\n\u201cYou know,\u201d she said, \u201clots of people have multiple careers. I was a lawyer, and then one day someone called and the next thing I knew I was in TV \u2013 \u201d\n\n\u201cPeople like to classify you, and when you start pushing out of your box it makes them nervous,\u201d Paltrow said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of resistance to women coming to the table with anything new. But if it were Justin Timberlake or Jay Z or even Donald Trump, everyone would be like, \u2018OK.\u2019 \u201d\n\nShe thought for a moment. \u201cIf I had to say something, I would say I am a generator of creative content,\u201d she said. Gersh nodded approvingly.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/favicon-32.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.heraldsun.com/wps/build/images/heraldsun/square-icon.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/s2zq6h/picture7602728/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/l4uRs.So.156.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.newsobserver.com/akam/13/pixel_22944449?a=dD1jYTkyNTU0MjEzODk5MTI4Y2M5M2UwMjhjNDE5M2JiNDViZTY5NDgxJmpzPW9mZg==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/favicon-96.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.heraldsun.com/wps/build/images/heraldsun/logo-tab.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/logo.svg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/s2zq6h/picture7602728/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/l4uRs.So.156.jpeg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Vanessa Friedman", "- New York Times News Service", "Scott Greenstone", "The Seattle Times"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039/https://www.newsobserver.com/living/fashion/article10135037.html", "title": "The Goop Effect: Gwyneth Paltrow a role model in celebrity commerce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FFFFFF", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.newsobserver.com/wps/build/images/newsobserver/windowsmetro-144.png", "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=399175255, affiliate-data=at=1010lHsN&ct=SmartAppBannerRAL, app-argument=https://www.newsobserver.com/living/fashion/article10135037.html?appNav=smartBanner", "google-site-verification": "0GF1Ok35O1TQ_B8R4lQYz4N1nBr-YJflnAXsHV8ePEo", "googlebot": "noodp, noarchive", "robots": "noindex", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@newsobserver", "title": "The Goop Effect: Gwyneth Paltrow a role model in celebrity commerce", "description": "Gwyneth Paltrow, the 42-year-old Oscar-winner, conscious-uncoupler and Tracy Anderson devotee, is changing.", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220817194039im_/https://www.newsobserver.com/latest-news/s2zq6h/picture7602728/alternates/LANDSCAPE_1140/l4uRs.So.156.jpeg", "alt": "Gwyneth Paltrow began Goop in 2008 as an aspirational \u2013 and controversial \u2013 lifestyle wellness-blog-cum-travel-and-cooking-tip-sheet-cum-shopping blog when her children were young.
