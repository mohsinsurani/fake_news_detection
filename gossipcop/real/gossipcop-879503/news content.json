For all the internet\u2019s good intentions in expressing to me their fondness for dad, it\u2019s very overwhelming to have strangers need me to know how much they cared for him right now,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s harder still to be expected to reach back. So while I\u2019ve got the strength, consider this my one open armed response, before I go take my yearly me time to celebrate his and my birthdays in peace.\u201d\n\nWilliams went on to thank everyone for their support and kind words about her father, before offering up some ideas of how his fans can honor him themselves.\n\n\u201cThank you for loving him. Thank you for supporting him and his life\u2019s work. Thank you for missing him. I do too,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIf you\u2019d like to do something in his honor, volunteer at your local homeless shelter, or look up how to make homeless aid backpacks. Give one in his name. He\u2019d have loved that.\u201d She then tagged these organizations in her post: the Challenged Athletes Foundation, the David Sheldrick Wildlife Trust, and the Reeve Foundation.\n\nShe concluded, \u201cMostly, try to spread some laughter and kindness around. And creatively swear a lot. Every time you do, somewhere out there in our vast weird universe, he\u2019s giggling with you\u2026 or giving a particularly fat bumblebee its wings. Happy early birthday, Poppo. Miss you every day, but especially these ones.\u201d\n\nRobin Williams committed suicide in August 2014. He was diagnosed with Parkinson\u2019s disease but an autopsy later revealed that he suffered from Lewy Body Dementia, which is a type of brain disease that affected his thinking, memory, emotions, and movements. The disorder is the second-most common type of progressive dementia after Alzheimer\u2019s disease.\n\nThe late Williams was one of the most well-known comedic actors in Hollywood and was nominated for four Oscars. The first in 1988 was for his role in Good Morning Vietnam, then again in 1990 for Dead Poet\u2019s Society. Two years later, he was nominated for playing a schizophrenic homeless man in The Fisher King. And, in 1998, he finally won an Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor in the movie Good Will Hunting.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/themes/wallstcheatsheet-v2/images/logo/showbiz_2x.png?x18211", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.bizographics.com/collect/?pid=4708&fmt=gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Zelda-and-Robin-Williams.jpg?x18211", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Zelda-and-Robin-Williams.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1447317708679797&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Zelda-and-Robin-Williams.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Michelle Kapusta"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553/https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/this-is-how-robin-williams-daughter-zelda-celebrates-her-late-fathers-birthday-every-year.html/", "title": "This Is How Robin Williams\u2019 Daughter Zelda Celebrates Her Late Father\u2019s Birthday Every Year", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "google-site-verification": "ktiOxQqv9Xlcn7qytDrsOVw_-MQ9S7bo2G5Iyfu-I9M", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "syndication-source": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/this-is-how-robin-williams-daughter-zelda-celebrates-her-late-fathers-birthday-every-year.html/", "p": {"domain_verify": "936edf149ecbc3171d89b1f25f05e153"}, "description": "Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda, is doing the same thing she's done for the past four years to honor her father on his birthday.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "This Is How Robin Williams' Daughter Zelda Celebrates Her Late Father\u2019s Birthday Every Year", "description": "Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda, is doing the same thing she's done for the past four years to honor her father on his birthday.", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553/https://www.cheatsheet.com/entertainment/this-is-how-robin-williams-daughter-zelda-celebrates-her-late-fathers-birthday-every-year.html/", "site_name": "Showbiz Cheat Sheet", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Zelda-and-Robin-Williams.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Zelda-and-Robin-Williams.jpg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/ShowbizCheatsheet", "tag": "suicide", "section": "Entertainment", "published_time": "2018-07-20T18:31:20-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Robin Williams' daughter, Zelda, is doing the same thing she's done for the past four years to honor her father on his birthday.", "title": "This Is How Robin Williams' Daughter Zelda Celebrates Her Late Father\u2019s Birthday Every Year", "site": "@cheatsheet", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20201126104553im_/https://www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/Zelda-and-Robin-Williams.jpg", "creator": "@cheatsheet"}, "fb": {"admins": 826582091}, "generator": "WordPress 5.4.2", "position": 2}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532125880.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
