She says doctors gave her only around a 3 to 4 percent chance of having a child using her own eggs.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t have a lot of eggs, but I had enough,\u201d said Nielsen, who has four older sons from previous relationships. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t do it later than 42 \u2026 [by then] you might only have seven good eggs. Out of those seven, to make them into an embryo?\u201d\n\nFrom there, an embryo had to be implanted. As she described, the IVF process for her was difficult to undergo.\n\nFor more photos of Nielsen, visit HollywoodLife.com.\n\n\u201cThere was a lot of disappointment,\u201d said Nielsen, now 55. \u201cIt\u2019s that phone call going, \u2018It\u2019s negative.\u2019 It\u2019s the waiting. At times you can feel lonely, because a lot of women don\u2019t talk to each other about it, and we should, because there\u2019s nothing wrong with wanting to have a baby, whether you\u2019re 20, 30, 40 or, in my case, 50.\u201d\n\nShe says she had to remain realistic about her circumstances. \u201cIf you don\u2019t use donor eggs, you have to preserve your own at a reasonable age for there to even be a possibility,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd 80 percent of the time, it doesn\u2019t work.\u201d\n\nThe couple opted to keep the news private for a significant amount of time. They didn\u2019t tell friends and family until the 26-week mark and they didn\u2019t go public with the news until two weeks before her due date.\n\nIn late June, she and Dessi welcomed baby Frida via C-section in Los Angeles. The two weeks between their announcement and the baby\u2019s arrival wasn\u2019t all pleasant, as they endured a lot of criticism.\n\nSince then, things have been smooth sailing.\n\n\u201cMy husband and I have been wanting this so much for so many years,\u201d she said. \u201cI finally have my little princess. Becoming a mother is the most beautiful thing in the world.\u201d\n\nThis article originally appeared on Page Six.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/kevinSpacey.jpeg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/GettyImages-597569672.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/bridgitte-nielson-pregnant1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/348/196/GettyImages-1427614638.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/436b45c1-kushner-kloss-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-411.svg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/sly-wife.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/Kesha-Dr-Luke.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bridgitte-nielson-pregnant1.jpg"], "top_img": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bridgitte-nielson-pregnant1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/07/25/brigitte-nielsen-explains-how-she-got-pregnant-at-54/", "title": "Brigitte Nielsen talks getting pregnant at 54: 'There was a lot of disappointment'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Brigitte Nielsen, who gave birth to her fifth child in June at the age of 54, says she beat the odds.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.title": "Brigitte Nielsen talks getting pregnant at 54: 'There was a lot of disappointment'", "dcterms.abstract": "Brigitte Nielsen, who gave birth to her fifth child in June at the age of 54, says she beat the odds.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Brigitte Nielsen, who gave birth to her fifth child in June at the age of 54, says she beat the odds.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:8964e5fd-6e50-5786-9c42-7541bbb886e6", "dc.source": "New York Post", "dc.date": "2018-07-25", "dcterms.created": "2018-07-25T16:56:47-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-07-25T17:21:32-04:00", "og": {"title": "Brigitte Nielsen talks getting pregnant at 54: 'There was a lot of disappointment'", "description": "Brigitte Nielsen, who gave birth to her fifth child in June at the age of 54, says she beat the odds.", "type": "article", "image": "https://static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/bridgitte-nielson-pregnant1.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/brigitte-nielsen-talks-getting-pregnant-at-54-there-was-a-lot-of-disappointment", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Brigitte Nielsen talks getting pregnant at 54: 'There was a lot of disappointment'", "description": "Brigitte Nielsen, who gave birth to her fifth child in June at the age of 54, says she beat the odds.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/1024/512/bridgitte-nielson-pregnant1.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/brigitte-nielsen-talks-getting-pregnant-at-54-there-was-a-lot-of-disappointment"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/Celebrity News,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "celebrity,entertainment", "classification-tags": "celebrity,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
