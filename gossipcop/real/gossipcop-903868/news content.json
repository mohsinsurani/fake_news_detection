It fits with the third installment of the Fifty Shades franchise, which finds Anastasia Steele and her BDSM-loving boyfriend, Christian Grey, getting married.\n\n\u201cBeen waiting for a lifetime for ya/Been breaking for a lifetime for ya/Wasn\u2019t looking till I found you/Love till I found you,\u201d Liam and Rita sing on the chorus.\n\nIn addition to contributing to the soundtrack, Rita also plays Christian\u2019s sister, Mia, in the film franchise.\n\nFifty Shades Freed, starring Dakota Johnson and Jamie Dornan, hits theaters February 9. The soundtrack arrives the same day.\n\nCopyright \u00a9 2018, ABC Radio.
