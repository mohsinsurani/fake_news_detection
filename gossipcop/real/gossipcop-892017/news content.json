She is kind, loving and she is sweet and very compassionate. I think she works extremely hard, I think she just needs to step back a moment, and take some time and get healthy and take time for her so she can heal.\u201d\n\nHowever, Abraham told PEOPLE in a statement Monday, that her mother\u2019s comments were was very hurtful and she was \u201csad to hear my own mother would say these untrue things about her own child.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s evil and alarming. After all these years, I still have her best interests at heart,\u201d Abraham continued.\n\nThe star admits she does have her struggles but denied suffering from what her mother suggested.\n\n\u201cClinically & honestly, none of my TV show therapists & personal therapist have all said I\u2019m balanced. I started therepy [sic] in my past at the age of 14 due to my mother and I not getting along as our family therapist sided with me about my safety and my life choices that my mother has never been supportive or caring to help guide her own children.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Farrah Abraham Brands Teen Mom OG Costars \u2018Trash Moms\u2019 in Twitter Rant\n\nAbraham said her therapists \u201chave come to the conclusion my mother is jealous\u201d of her.\n\n\u201cI always wish my mother the best as I attended her wedding supporting her. Saying horrible things about your own child after I\u2019m the only one who has ever strived to overlook her demons she fights daily against this brings sadness to our family and I wish her all the best for the sake of my health & safety I wish her all the best,\u201d Abraham said.\n\nFarrah Abraham/Instagram\n\nShe added, \u201cI hope she has enjoyed the Teen Mom MTV ride that Sophia brought to her life as I\u2019m moving on from that toxic environment she dwells in. I hope she ceases talking about me since she does not love me she does not need to speak about me to stay relevant in a disgustingly hateful way. God Bless.\u201d\n\nDanielsen did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment on Monday.\n\nThe mother and daughter have had a fraught relationship for years, which was initially captured on camera for MTV\u2019s 16 and Pregnant. In 2010, Danielsen was arrested on suspicion of domestic abuse after she and Abraham, then 18, allegedly began arguing over childcare for the reality star\u2019s daughter Sophia.\n\nTMZ reported that Danielsen allegedly grabbed Abraham by the throat and then hit her. Abraham ultimately dropped the charges, according to E! News.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Adult Entertainer Farrah Abraham Unleashes After She\u2019s Told Teen Mom \u2018Can\u2019t Continue\u2019 to Film Her\n\nIn March of 2017, during an episode of Marriage Boot Camp: Reality Stars Family Edition \u2014 a program which Abraham appeared on with both her mother and her father to try and improve their relationship \u2014 the two got into an altercation when Danielsen decided to skip out on family therapy to go to a beer festival with her then-boyfriend.\n\n\u201cI like to be surprised, I like to go on little trips, too, but now when it\u2019s a family boot camp and you need to be working on your family \u2026\u201d Abraham said.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to lose my boyfriend,\u201d Danielsen responded.\n\n\u201cYou can lose your daughter because you want to choose a man over your daughter,\u201d Abraham replied.\n\nHowever, in November, the pair seemed to have patched up their relationship as Abraham not only attended her mother\u2019s wedding but also served as her honorary maid of honor.\n\n\u201cThis is going in the family books!\u201d Abraham captioned a series of images shared to social media. \u201dCongrats!
