Reps for the premiere, due to take place at the Paris Theatre, initially cited \u201cunexpected circumstances.\u201d\n\nA source tells The Hollywood Reporter that a New York Times story on the comedian is about to break, and the premiere was canceled in case it is damaging. Additionally, Louis C.K.\u2019s planned appearance on CBS\u2019 The Late Show With Stephen Colbert was also canceled, with William H. Macy taking his place.\n\n(After this story was originally published, The New York Times published an article by investigative reporter Jodi Kanter, who co-bylined the Oct. 5 Harvey Weinstein story, that included five women accusing C.K. of sexual misconduct. The comedian\u2019s publicist, Lewis Kay, responded to the Times: \u201cLouis is not going to answer any questions.\u201d\n\nThe film\u2019s distributor The Orchard released a second statement following the publication of the Times story: \u201cIn light of the allegations concerning Louis C.K. referenced in today\u2019s New York Times, we are canceling tonight\u2019s premiere of I Love You, Daddy. There is never a place for the behavior detailed in these allegations. As a result, we are giving careful consideration to the timing and release of the film and continuing to review the situation.\u201d On Friday, the distributor said it would not be moving forward with the release of the movie, which was set to open in select theaters on Nov. 17, and C.K. released a statement confirming the claims.)\n\nLouis C.K. wrote, directed and stars in I Love You, Daddy. The comedy-drama tells the story of a successful TV writer-producer who attempts to stop his 17-year-old daughter\u2019s (Chloe Grace Moretz) growing admiration and relationship with a 68-year-old filmmaker (John Malkovich). The film also stars Pamela Adlon, Rose Byrne, Charlie Day, Edie Falco and Helen Hunt.\n\nC.K. shot the film entirely in secret last June. He also financed the project and edited it as well. Dave Becky of 3 Arts produced the film alongside C.K., Vernon Chatman, Ryan Cunningham and John Skidmore. Tony Hernandez executive produced.\n\nThe film generated controversy following its premiere at the Toronto International Film Festival in September. TIFF programmers had screened it and given I Love You, Daddy a world premiere after C.K. surprised Toronto organizers, letting them know the film existed.\n\nControversial dialogue appears throughout the film, including the use of the N-word by C.K.\u2019s character and multiple jokes about child rape. C.K. previously defended the inappropriate content to THR. \u201cWe\u2019re depicting oxygen-rich people who live in these beautiful apartments and offices saying whatever they want,\u201d he said. \u201cFolks say shit to each other. You can\u2019t think about the audience when you\u2019re making the thing. If you do, you\u2019re not giving them something that came out of your gut.
