But it looks like she's putting a pause on the precious posts.\n\n\n\nKylie posted a makeup free selfie to her Instagram last night where you can see a small part of baby Stormi's head, but none of her face. She captioned the photo \"i spy with my little eye....\" When one user commented that Kylie \"cut her baby out\", the new mom wasted no time, replying \"yeah I cut my baby out. I'm not sharing photos of my girl right now.\" Instagram account @commentsbycelebs caught the interaction:\n\n\n\nNow, scrolling though Kylie's Instagram, there are a lot of previously posted Stormi photos that have been deleted. The purge seems like an abrupt decision from the social media star, since she's openly shared footage of her daughter to her millions of followers on Instagram and Snapchat in the past few months.\n\nJenner didn't give any clear reason for her decision. It may have to do with media pressure, too many unwarranted comments, or simply just wanting a little bit of privacy. After all, 109 million followers can be intimidating.\n\nWhen Stormi came into the world, Kylie immediately released a mini-documentary titled \"To Our Girl\" which gave us a behind-the-scenes look at her pregnancy, relationship with Stormi's dad Travis Scott, and her journey to giving birth.\n\n\n\nKylie will most likely stick to her signature selfies and keep her mom life private, at least for now.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kim-kardashian-and-kanye-west-attend-the-2020-vanity-fair-news-photo-1613766810.?crop=1.00xw:0.810xh;0,0.0259xh&resize=180:*",
