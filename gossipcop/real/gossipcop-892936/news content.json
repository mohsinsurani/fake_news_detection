Upon seeing the cover photo, Nyong'o spoke out against the publication in a lengthy caption.\n\n\"As I have made clear so often in the past with every fiber of my being, I embrace my natural heritage and despite having grown up thinking light skin and straight, silky hair were the standards of beauty, I now know that my dark skin and kinky, coily hair are beautiful too,\" she began. \"Being featured on the cover of a magazine fulfills me as it is an opportunity to show other dark, kinky-haired people, and particularly our children, that they are beautiful just the way they are.\"\n\nWATCH: Lupita Nyong'o Breaks Down in Tears During Intense Promo for JAY-Z's '4:44' Album\n\nThe 34-year-old actress goes on to slam Grazia for photoshopping the image without asking her permission. \"I am disappointed that @graziauk invited me to be on their cover and then edited out and smoothed my hair to fit their notion of what beautiful hair looks like,\" she continued. \"Had I been consulted, I would have explained that I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"\n\nNyong'o concluded her post by noting that there is \"still a very long way to go to combat the unconscious prejudice against black women's complexion, hair style and texture.\"\n\nMORE: Lupita Nyong'o Says Harvey Weinstein Threatened Her Career After She Refused His Advances\n\nThe Star Wars: The Force Awakens star has made it her mission to change how the world views beauty.\n\n\"European standards of beauty are something that plague the entire world -- the idea that darker skin is not beautiful, that light skin is the key to success and love,\" she told Glamour magazine in 2014. \"I remember seeing a commercial where a woman goes for an interview and doesn't get the job. Then she puts a cream on her face to lighten her skin, and she gets the job! This is the message: that dark skin is unacceptable.\"\n\nShe added, \"Beautiful people have many advantages, but so do friendly people. I think beauty is an expression of love.\"\n\nEXCLUSIVE: Lupita Nyong'o Says She's 'Secretly a Rapper' This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566846.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-568283.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-04/GettyImages-1391924982.jpg?h=2b1a84fd&itok=RAcaH6JM", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-570021.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=vTSxldI1", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567241.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567003.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_vidpic_111017_1280.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=QT2uLz0s", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-571464.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566831.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2013-10/set_lupita_nyongo_180006428_lbusacca.jpg?itok=i01zqDr1", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-565844.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567433.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566844.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567233.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566606.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566481.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/blundstone.png?h=808323c5&itok=rHo4tHPR", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566368.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-570318.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566818.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-569351.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566355.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=vTSxldI1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jackie Willis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/lupita-nyongo-slams-magazine-retouching-her-hair-i-embrace-my-natural-heritage-90840", "title": "Lupita Nyong'o Slams Magazine for Retouching Her Hair: 'I Embrace My Natural Heritage'", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "\"I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"", "keywords": "Fashion, News, Lupita Nyong'o", "fb": {"admins": 3111204, "pages": 106843036179, "app_id": 145337045558621}, "og": {"site_name": "Entertainment Tonight", "type": "Article", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lupita-nyongo-slams-magazine-retouching-her-hair-i-embrace-my-natural-heritage-90840", "title": "Lupita Nyong'o Slams Magazine for Retouching Her Hair: 'I Embrace My Natural Heritage'", "description": "\"I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=vTSxldI1", "width": 1280, "height": 720}}, "msvalidate.01": "DC10472F438B55F3A58638BC31271706", "google-site-verification": "hKpIt34FKZ_qMU81xUdLUw2YzuyZY1pS76p0622Hc7w", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\"I cannot support or condone the omission of what is my native heritage.\"", "site": {"identifier": "@etnow", "id": 23603092}, "title": "Lupita Nyong'o Slams Magazine for Retouching Her Hair: 'I Embrace My Natural Heritage'", "creator": "Jackie Willis\u200d", "url": "https://www.etonline.com/lupita-nyongo-slams-magazine-retouching-her-hair-i-embrace-my-natural-heritage-90840", "image": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2017-11/lupita_nyongo_695791704.jpg?h=c673cd1c&itok=vTSxldI1"}, "Generator": "Drupal 8 (https://www.drupal.org)", "MobileOptimized": "width", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.etonline.com", "summary": ""}
