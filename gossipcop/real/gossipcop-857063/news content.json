Millie told the queen she met Grande backstage before the concert.\n\nThe Monday night blast at Manchester Arena killed at least 22 people and left dozens injured. The blast, which occurred in the venue's foyer, came at the conclusion of Grande\u2019s concert, just after pink balloons had fallen from the arena's ceiling.\n\nGrande's audience at Manchester Arena was mostly young people, many of them teens and pre-teens wearing the singer's signature bunny ears. The queen called it \"very wicked\" to \"target that sort of thing.\"\n\nQueen Elizabeth also met with a 14-year-old girl and her parents and a 12-year-old girl and her mom. The queen told one of the families it was \"very interesting how everybody has united\" in the wake of the attack.\n\nShe also met with a mother who was injured while waiting for her 12-year-old daughter at the concert. The woman, identified as Ruth Murrell, told the queen her daughter attended the concert with a friend. The friend\u2019s mother died in the blast.\n\nBritain's Queen Elizabeth II, right, speaks to Ruth Murrell during the Queen's visit to the Royal Manchester Children's Hospital in Manchester England, to meet victims, May 25, 2017.
