Photo: Taylor Hill/Getty Images for Governors Ball\n\nLately we\u2019ve been wondering: what exactly is the deal between Lorde and Lena Dunham\u2019s ex Jack Antonoff? There have been rumors about the pair floating around for the past couple of months, and earlier this week, the Daily Mail added fuel to the fire by publishing a series of photos of them hugging on the streets of Auckland.\n\nStill, the two collaborators insist that there\u2019s nothing to see here. Back in January, Antonoff claimed that rumors he left Dunham for Lorde were \u201cdumb heteronormative gossip,\u201d and today Lorde was similarly emphatic on an Instagram live chat.\n\n\u201cGuys, no!\u201d Lorde responded to a fan who asked about the rumors. \u201cJack and I are not dating \u2026 I love him. He\u2019s awesome, but we\u2019re not dating!\u201d\n\nThank God, because I don\u2019t know if Taylor Swift could handle another friend breakup right now.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/93d/dd4/6993359860ee6cc420bb272619119c2cdf-elon-musk-settlement.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ad/e7c/6815bdd86bc8134b4c1647a9a97e0f0ec4-23-lorde-jack-antonoff.rsquare.w700.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ad/e7c/6815bdd86bc8134b4c1647a9a97e0f0ec4-23-lorde-jack-antonoff.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd4/409/28254d99ceca593534b46a52a9e49b452b-RISSI-AND-MIKO-SET-1152022.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ad/e7c/6815bdd86bc8134b4c1647a9a97e0f0ec4-23-lorde-jack-antonoff.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Anna Silman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/lorde-speaks-out-about-those-jack-antonoff-dating-rumors.html", "title": "Lorde Finally Speaks Out About Those Jack Antonoff Dating Rumors", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "culture, celebrity, fame, music, lorde, jack antonoff, celebrity rumors, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Lorde Finally Speaks Out About Those Jack Antonoff Dating Rumors", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/lorde-speaks-out-about-those-jack-antonoff-dating-rumors.html", "description": "The singer was spotted getting cozy with Lena Dunham\u2019s ex on the streets of Auckland.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ad/e7c/6815bdd86bc8134b4c1647a9a97e0f0ec4-23-lorde-jack-antonoff.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Lorde Speaks Out About Those Jack Antonoff Dating Rumors", "description": "The singer was spotted getting cozy with Lena Dunham\u2019s ex on the streets of Auckland.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/1ad/e7c/6815bdd86bc8134b4c1647a9a97e0f0ec4-23-lorde-jack-antonoff.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-23T14:14:02.030-05:00", "tag": "culture, celebrity, fame, music, lorde, jack antonoff, celebrity rumors", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "According to photos published by the Daily Mail, Lorde was spotted getting cozy with Lena Dunham\u2019s ex Jack Antonoff on the streets of Auckland.
