Photo: Rochelle Brodin/Getty Images for The Cult Collec\n\nOn Wednesday, the model Kate Upton took to social media to accuse Guess co-founder and chief creative officer Paul Marciano of \u201cusing his power\u201d to sexually and emotionally harass women. According to Business of Fashion, Marciano has previously been accused of sexual misconduct by two other women, and others have shared their stories in the days following.\n\nOn Friday, the model Miranda Vee posted in an Instagram caption that she had met with Marciano (she does not disclose when) at the Guess headquarters, which she says is \u201cactually [an] apartment.\u201d Vee goes on to accuse Marciano of sexually harassing her, and then \u201cpassing her on\u201d to his friend, Mohamed Hadid, the real-estate developer, and father of Gigi, Bella, and Anwar Hadid. (Gigi Hadid was once the face of Guess.) Vee said she was told Hadid was going to meet her for coffee.\n\n\u201cI thought it was a professional meeting but it was just me, him, and Champagne where he date raped me in [an] apartment,\u201d Vee writes. \u201cAll to get a test shoot for Guess.\u201d In September, Vee posted a photo tagging Guess, but it is unclear whether or not it is an official campaign image. Vee does not have a profile on models.com.\n\nVee concludes her post by saying that when she tried to speak about this last year, Hadid and Marciano \u201cmade\u201d her sign a nondisclosure agreement.\n\n\u201cI only agreed to sign because Paul threatened me and said he would get me disappeared if I ever say anything,\u201d Vee wrote. She then hashtagged \u201cTime\u2019s Up\u201d and \u201cMe Too,\u201d adding: \u201cWhy should we have to stay quiet because they have the power?\u201d\n\nHadid denied Vee\u2019s claims in an interview with TMZ on Friday, saying he did agree to meet Vee about two years ago because she claimed to be a fan. However, Hadid says their meeting was \u201cnot a date\u201d and \u201cnot once did [he] touch her.\u201d\n\nHadid added that he\u2019s already spoken to his attorney and plans to file a defamation suit against Vee, suggesting she go to police, not social media.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdb/191/02fcf7eed7040df67ed557496dc86be2d3-02-Mohamed-Hadid.rvertical.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdb/191/02fcf7eed7040df67ed557496dc86be2d3-02-Mohamed-Hadid.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdb/191/02fcf7eed7040df67ed557496dc86be2d3-02-Mohamed-Hadid.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emilia Petrarca"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/model-miranda-vee-mohamed-hadid-rape.html", "title": "Model Accuses Mohamed Hadid of Date Rape, He Denies and Threatens to Sue", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "sexual assault, fashion, style, mohamed hadid, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Model Accuses Mohamed Hadid of Date Rape, He Denies and Threatens to Sue", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/02/model-miranda-vee-mohamed-hadid-rape.html", "description": "Bella and Gigi Hadid\u2019s father says Miranda Vee\u2019s story is \u201ctotally untrue.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdb/191/02fcf7eed7040df67ed557496dc86be2d3-02-Mohamed-Hadid.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Mohamed Hadid Denies Date-Rape Claims From Model", "description": "Bella and Gigi Hadid\u2019s father says Miranda Vee\u2019s story is \u201ctotally untrue.\u201d", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/cdb/191/02fcf7eed7040df67ed557496dc86be2d3-02-Mohamed-Hadid.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@emiliapetrarca", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-02-02T17:27:09.651-05:00", "tag": "sexual assault, fashion, style, mohamed hadid", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "Model Miranda Vee accused Bella and Gigi Hadid\u2019s father, Mohamed Hadid, of date rape after Kate Upton came out against his friend, Guess co-founder Paul Marciano.", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "sexual assault, fashion, style, mohamed hadid", "author": "Emilia Petrarca", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517610429.651, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
