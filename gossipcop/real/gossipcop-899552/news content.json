While there were apparently plans for Affleck to spend some time with his longtime pal, Damon, on Thanksgiving this year, things did not work out.\n\nWhile speaking to E! News, Matt Damon explained exactly what happened on Thanksgiving, and why he and Ben Affleck were unable to see each other. According to Damon, it seems he actually had other plans for the holiday that led to him not being in Los Angeles. The actor shared that rather than spend Thanksgiving in LA, he ended up flying back to Boston in order to spend the holiday with his family there.\n\nDuring his discussion about his holiday plans, Matt Damon laughed and said that it was definitely not Ben Affleck's fault that they did not get to see each other this year for Thanksgiving. Damon jokingly blamed himself for the fact that they did not end up spending any time together on the holiday, saying \"it is not his fault he didn't spend Thanksgiving with me. It's my fault that I left.\" Simply put, there was just no way the two friends could see each other with Matt Damon being in a completely different state.", "images": ["https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/4a918df6a9bd9504e87608b20d87cb49?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/28fd1ecd-acc0-48fc-be3b-21a0f5ef3d90.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/06752bf4-81fd-43b9-8d98-a65ec048434c.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4679120/matt-damon-explains-why-he-and-ben-affleck-did-not-see-each-other-for-thanksgiving-this-year/", "title": "Matt Damon Explains Why He And Ben Affleck Did Not See Each Other For Thanksgiving This Year", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Matt Damon Explains Why He And Ben Affleck Did Not See Each Other For Thanksgiving This Year", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4679120/matt-damon-explains-why-he-and-ben-affleck-did-not-see-each-other-for-thanksgiving-this-year/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "Matt Damon Explains Why He And Ben Affleck Did Not See Each Other For Thanksgiving This Year", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-12-12 04:22:03Z", "section": "Famous Relationships"}, "description": "Matt Damon Explains Why He And Ben Affleck Did Not See Each Other For Thanksgiving This Year", "keywords": "Famous Relationships", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513052523.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
