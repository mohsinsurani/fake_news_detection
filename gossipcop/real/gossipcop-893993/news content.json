I don\u2019t know what that was. But I declined, because I don\u2019t need to be humiliated.\u201d\n\nHost James Corden asked if Viall circled back with an offer for a real date afterwards, and Jones, 39, said he didn\u2019t \u2014 which \u201csays a lot.\u201d\n\nFellow guest Emmy Rossum then chimed in, revealing she used to be part of a Bachelor fantasy league and once saw Viall at the Grove in Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI did that thing that I\u2019m sure people have done to you where you kind of covertly try to take a picture of the famous person,\u201d she said. \u201cThen I texted it to everyone I know.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat was he doing?\u201d asked Jones.\n\nRossum, 31, said Viall was simply enjoying a cup of coffee at Coffee Bean.\n\n\u201cSee, and that\u2019s where it flips the other way,\u201d said Jones. \u201cYou don\u2019t know \u2014 like, what is this guy\u2019s deal? Then he just goes and drinks coffee, like he\u2019s cute [and] normal. Like, I\u2019m so mixed!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou just don\u2019t know where you stand with this guy!\u201d said Corden with a laugh.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t know where he stands with me,\u201d she responded.\n\nYour move, Nick!", "images":
