I\u2019m Dave Chappelle. And I just wanted to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America. Sorry for the interruption. Please continue.\u201d\n\n[protected-iframe id=\u201d4c8cd86ea0882275590e0a5e05f886bb-46934866-65121066\u2033 info=\u201dhttps://players.brightcove.net/769341148/r1La1160g_default/index.html?videoId=5721266188001\u2033 frameborder=\u201d0\u2033 allowfullscreen=\u201d\u201d height=\u201d500px\u201d width=\u201d500px\u201d]\n\nW-O-W!

As Lamar rapped, each of the dancers fell to the ground as gunshot sounds played over the performance. A few minutes later, Lamar would take home the Grammy for Best Rap/Sung Performance for his song \u201cLoyalty,\u201d featuring Rihanna.\n\nWatch the entire performance below:\n\nhttps://twitter.com/DuckworthTDE/status/957779395485323265", "images": ["https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/power-106.jpg?w=150", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gender-reveal-e1663594236141.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RARE-32.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-35.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RARE-36.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/317d727771e6cc9ddc36e8416023cbac?s=40&d=mm&r=g", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-kylie-jenner.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/twitter_pop-culture-grammys-nip.jpg?w=150", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Loretta-Lynn-e1664721624312.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wwii-vet.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-50.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=351158200285883&ev=PageView&noscript=1&eid=351158200285883&cd%5Btags%5D=Bono%2C+Dave+Chappelle%2C+entertainment%2C+Grammys+2018%2C+Kendrick+Lamar%2C+music%2C+National+anthem%2C+people%2C+politics%2C+The+Edge%2C+U2%2C+US+military&cd%5Bpost_category%5D=All+News%2C+Rare+People&cd%5Bpage_title%5D=Kendrick+Lamar+got+the+Grammys+off+to+a+politically+charged+start+with+a+little+help+from+U2+and+Dave+Chappelle&cd%5Bpost_type%5D=post&cd%5Bpost_id%5D=847134&cd%5Bplugin%5D=PixelYourSite&cd%5Bevent_url%5D=rare.us%2Fpeople%2Fkendrick-lamar-got-the-grammys-off-to-a-politically-charged-start-with-a-little-help-from-u2-and-dave-chappelle%2F&cd%5Buser_role%5D=guest", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-kendrick-2018-grammys.jpg?w=662", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KpNhwJ0RxTQPU.gif", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tank-drift.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rare-logo-white-highres.png", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-30-1.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-31.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Haunted-School.png?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/veteran_reunion.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RARE-63.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-33.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-34.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-kendrick-2018-grammys.jpg?w=662", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Former Rare Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://rare.us/people/kendrick-lamar-got-the-grammys-off-to-a-politically-charged-start-with-a-little-help-from-u2-and-dave-chappelle/", "title": "Kendrick Lamar got the Grammys off to a politically charged start with a little help from U2 and Dave Chappelle", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, height=device-height, width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kendrick Lamar got the Grammys off to a politically charged start with a little help from U2 and Dave Chappelle", "description": "\"I just want to remind the audience that the only thing more frightening than watching a black man be honest in America is being an honest black man in America.\" More", "url": "https://rare.us/people/kendrick-lamar-got-the-grammys-off-to-a-politically-charged-start-with-a-little-help-from-u2-and-dave-chappelle/", "site_name": "Rare", "image": {"identifier": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/gettyimages-kendrick-2018-grammys.jpg?w=662", "width": 1200, "height": 627, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RareUSA", "published_time": "2018-01-29T01:08:02+00:00", "modified_time": "2022-09-10T18:13:18+00:00"}, "author": "Former Rare Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Former Rare Staff", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "1 minute"}, "facebook-domain-verification": "8wfvb713aorpq5rhvte8xil2221k7i", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-cropped-mock-siteicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517188082.0, "source": "https://rare.us", "summary": ""}
