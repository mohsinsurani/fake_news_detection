The news of the royal baby's impending birth was announced via the Kensington Palace social media accounts today.\n\n\"Her Royal Highness The Duchess of Cambridge was admitted to St. Mary\u2019s Hospital, Paddington, London earlier this morning in the early stages of labour,\" Kensington Palace shared via Twitter.\n\n\"The Duchess travelled by car from Kensington Palace to the Lindo Wing at St. Mary\u2019s Hospital with The Duke of Cambridge.\"\n\nWhile it was rumored that she had considered a home birth for her third child, Kate will deliver the baby in the Lindo Wing of St. Mary's Hospital in London, which has been preparing for weeks.\n\nNot only has the outside of the wing had a new coat of paint, but parking restrictions have been in effect since April 9. Media positions went up on that date as well.\n\nCrowds of both well-wishers and reporters are currently gathering outside the hospital, where Kate previously delivered both Prince George and Princess Charlotte. Princess Diana delivered both Prince William and Prince Harry in the hospital as well.\n\nRegardless of whether this new child is a boy or a girl, it will be fifth in line to the throne, falling just after Princess Charlotte and just before Prince Harry.\n\nIn her previous two births, Kate had a fairly swift labor, so we could be seeing the little one in not too long. When the new royal baby does arrive, an announcement will be made both via the Kensington Palace Twitter account, and on an easel outside Buckingham Palace, but until then, let the royal baby watch begin!\n\nRelated Story The British Line of Succession\n\nRelated Story Kate Middleton's Best Maternity Looks", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-933038754-1521330455.jpg?crop=0.7120696178584941xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/emma-bridgewater-queen-elizabeth-mugs-1665067947.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/_assets/design-tokens/townandcountrymag/static/images/logos/network-logo.7095410.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/nup-199241-00013-1664551947.jpg?crop=0.563xw:1xh;center,top&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-940593072-1522601510.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0433xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/the-countess-of-wessex-meets-jeanne-mukunilwa-a-survivor-of-news-photo-1664999162.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.197xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-william-prince-of-wales-and-catherine-princess-of-news-photo-1665069426.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.706xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/ava-duvernay-video-1613600478.jpg?crop=0.9765925925925926xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/tc-charlene-style-1654790927.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-duke-of-sussex-and-meghan-duchess-of-sussex-news-photo-1665153667.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.718xh;0,0.0286xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-margaret-1513109245.jpg?crop=0.655xw:0.987xh;0.176xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-princess-of-wales-and-prince-william-prince-of-news-photo-1665065951.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/catherine-princess-of-wales-makes-a-cocktail-as-she-visits-news-photo-1665065724.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.154xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/june-8-2019-britains-queen-elizabeth-ii-c-and-her-family-news-photo-1616597044.?crop=1.00xw:0.753xh;0,0.0408xh&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/toc.h-cdn.co/assets/16/40/640x640/square-1475855109-margaret-peter.jpg?resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-933038754-1521330455.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.705xh;0,0.212xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/screen-shot-2022-10-07-at-10-38-06-am-1665153498.png?crop=0.949xw:1.00xh;0.0272xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/1ae6c55f-9257-442c-afaa-fab7b7ad9ab1_1462465392.jpg?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/princess-margaret-bathtub-the-crown-1572286158.jpg?crop=0.505xw:1.00xh;0.248xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-933038754-1521330455.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.705xh;0,0.212xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.townandcountrymag.com/society/tradition/a19469753/kate-middleton-labor-royal-baby-3/", "title": "Kate Middleton Is in Labor With Royal Baby No. 3!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Kate Middleton Is in Labor With Royal Baby #3 - Kate Middleton Is On Her Way to St. Mary's Hospital", "description": "Kate Middleton is officially in labor!
