{"url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/music/a12096106/taylor-swift-look-what-you-made-me-do-arya-stark/", "text": "Taylor Swift\u2019s brand-new single, \u201cLook What You Made Me Do,\u201d seems obviously about her feuds with people like Kanye West, Kim Kardashian, Calvin Harris, and Katy Perry. But what if they were actually all about a fictional character instead? A corner of the Internet is convinced the lyrics actually tell the story of Arya Stark from Game of Thrones, and the idea makes a lot of sense, if you think about it.\n\nThis content is imported from Giphy. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nBoth Mashable and Entertainment Weekly broke down just how similar the lyrics are to Arya\u2019s character on the HBO show. And they really do reflect Arya\u2019s transformation from a little kid into a badass assassin with a list of grudges.\n\nJust a few examples: \u201cI don\u2019t like your tilted stage/The role you made me play/Of the fool\u201d could be a reference to the actors in Braavos who put on a version of the Stark family\u2019s life\u2014and painted her father, Ned Stark as a buffoon. \u201cI don\u2019t like your kingdom keys/They once belonged to me\u201d could be a reference to Cersei Lannister, who rules the Seven Kingdoms after her family\u2019s treachery killed Ned, who was the hand of the king. \"You ask me for a place to sleep / Locked me out and threw a feast\" could be a reference to Walder Frey, who locked members of her family in his home for the Red Wedding massacre, while she was locked out. And of course, \u201cI\u2019ve got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined/I check it once, then I check it twice\u201d could be a direct reference to Arya\u2019s list of people she intends to kill.\n\nThis content is imported from Giphy.

But who knows: Maybe Taylor is a huge Game of Thrones fan and sees herself in the girl who was wronged\u2014and who now wants to take down all her enemies.\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.

But given the snake imagery used to promote Taylor's new music, wouldn\u2019t she be more like a Sand Snake than a Stark, anyway?\n\nThis content is imported from Twitter.
