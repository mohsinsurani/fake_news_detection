News, two suspects entered the grounds of their Bel Air mansion early on Friday, with the LA Police Department confirming an attempted motor vehicle theft was made around 5am.\n\nThe LAPD has confirmed that a witness saw one suspect enter and exit a vehicle before fleeing while a second suspect, who was hiding in some bushes, also fled; the LAPD also stated some personal items were taken from the car.\n\nA source has claimed the suspect attempted to flee with a cell phone, but was caught by the property's security team.\n\n\"Nothing of Kim or Kanye's was taken. Their armed security handled it. The guy didn't even make it past the driveway. He was startled by their security, and dropped the phone he was trying to take,\" they explained.\n\nIt's also reported members of the security team drew their guns on the suspect as soon as he entered the bottom of the driveway, meaning the intruder never actually made it to the property, with the burgled car being parked at the bottom of the driveway near the street.\n\nKim Kardashian Robbery Show all 10 1 /10 Kim Kardashian Robbery Kim Kardashian Robbery Kim Kardashian West and her husband Kanye arrive back at their town house in New York City last night Rex Kim Kardashian Robbery Kris Jenner is surrounded by security as she leaves the New York residence where her daughter Kim Kardashian West is staying in New York, after her robbery ordeal in Paris, France.
