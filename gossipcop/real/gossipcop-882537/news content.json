Kylie is not confirming anything.\u2019\n\nRyan Seacrest has given an update from the Kardashian household (Picture: YouTube)\n\nThe head of the Kardashian household had been quizzed on her daughter\u2019s pregnancy rumours at the weekend during Milan fashion week.\n\nShe had said at the time that she was \u2018surprised to wake up to the rumours\u2019, adding: \u2018It wouldn\u2019t be the family if something didn\u2019t happen every single day.\u2019\n\nA source close to Kris had also claimed that while Kris was surprise, she will support her youngest daughter \u2018no matter what\u2019.\n\nKris was at Milan Fashion Week when news broke that Kylie is apparently pregnant (Picture: Pixelformula/SIPA/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nRyan\u2019s investigative work comes as the news emerges that Kylie is reportedly desperate for Travis to \u2018put a ring on it\u2019 as soon as she\u2019s given birth.\n\nWhile Kylie, 20, has kept tight lipped about it all so far \u2013 apart from a few teasing Instagram pictures and sources close to her family speaking out \u2013 it\u2019s believed that she\u2019s around five months pregnant and is due to pop in January.\n\nAnd it looks like she\u2019s getting her life in order quickly as, according to US reports, she\u2019s already planning an \u2018amazing\u2019 wedding to take place as soon as she\u2019s lost her baby weight.\n\n\u2018Kylie wants an amazing wedding and wants to be married as soon as she loses all of her baby weight,\u2019 a source told Hollywood Life.\n\nKylie wore a very baggy tee to support boyfriend Travis Scott at the iHeartRadio gig (Picture: Buckner/Variety/REX/Shutterstock)\n\nIt\u2019s claimed she want her baby to have a settled family life and is keen to avoid her first born growing up in a \u2018broken home\u2019, hence why she\u2019s so keen to walk up the aisle with her rapper beau.\n\n\u2018She wants her child to have a father that is always there and someone that will make their relationship forever,\u2019 the source continued.\n\nTravis Scott and Kylie Jenner (Picture: Getty)\n\n\u2018She has seen her family and her exes deal with heartache and broken homes and she wants to have the family life that is a success. So to be married is something she wants very soon and she will be very excited for Travis put a ring on it.\u2019\n\nHowever, other members of the Kardashians apparently think Kylie might be a bit too \u2018naive\u2019 to have a baby at just 20.\n\n\u2018Kylie is very naive,\u2019 a source told People. \u2018Spending time with other people\u2019s kids is obviously completely different than being a mom 24/7. Kylie of course has no idea about all the hard work and sleepless nights.\u2019\n\nTravis Scott performs in April this year (Picture: Bob Levey/Getty Images)\n\nKylie\u2019s dad Caitlyn was also apparently \u2018shocked and disappointed\u2019 at the news.\n\n\u2018Caitlyn was really shocked and disappointed to learn that Kylie is pregnant,\u2019 source close to Caitlyn told Hollywood Life.\n\n\u2018She thinks Kylie is way too young to have a baby, and that she should have waited until she was in a long term committed relationship.\u2019\n\nCaitlyn Jenner was \u2018shocked\u2019 by Kylie\u2019s news (Picture: Getty)\n\nAnd while Kylie and Travis have not yet confirmed they are expecting, Caitlyn appeared to do it for them on Monday.\n\nWhile representatives for Caitlyn denied that she found out on the internet, as had been reported, they told The Sun that all they could say is that she was told \u2018some time ago\u2019.\n\nKylie and Travis, 25. met in April, just weeks after she split from long-term partner Tyga, and later that night Tyga claimed that he was the baby\u2019s father, in a now-deleted Snapchat which featured an image of Kylie and the headline \u2018Kylie is pregnant\u2019, but Tyga had written over the top of the image \u2018Hell nah that\u2019s my kid,\u2019 with four purple devil emojis.\n\nWhile neither of them have addressed the pregnancy rumours on their social media accounts, the pair have been spotted together in Las Vegas, following Travis\u2019 iHeartRadio gig.\n\nKylie was noticeably in a baggy grey T-shirt, hiding her stomach. But the question remains: is there a baby bump underneath?\n\nMORE : Kris Jenner \u2018doesn\u2019t want to see Kylie Jenner\u2019s pregnancy affect\u2019 her multi-million dollar business\n\nMORE : Caitlyn Jenner \u2018confirms\u2019 daughter Kylie Jenner\u2019s pregnancy, has known for \u2018some time\u2019", "images": ["https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/prc_54474121.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&zoom=1&resize=644%2C338", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/ipso-logo.jpg", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Metro-56e2.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Michaels-Bar-6a30.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/prc_54474121.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/BHM-0569.png", "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/themes/metro-parent/img/fallback.png"], "top_img": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/prc_54474121.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Amy Duncan"], "canonical_link": "https://metro.co.uk/2017/09/26/defensive-kris-jenner-declares-kylie-is-not-confirming-anything-over-pregnancy-as-ryan-seacrest-probes-her-live-on-air-6955695/", "title": "Kylie Jenner 'is not confirming anything' over pregnancy, says Kris", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "format-detection": "telephone=no", "google-site-verification": "NRfCb8mBNAy5_f17NpvLZYoY38EzM2dgpcOh_Am9yps", "twitter": {"widgets": {"csp": "on"}, "image": {"src": "https://metro.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/prc_54474121.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630"}, "title": "Defensive Kris Jenner declares Kylie 'is not confirming anything' over pregnancy", "description": "Ryan Seacrest asks the questions we all want to know the answers to.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@MetroUK", "account_id": 138749160}, "ir-site-verification-token": 422605026, "description": "Kris Jenner has declared that daughter Kylie will be keeping schtum on the pregnancy rumours for a while yet.
