Dr. Simone was a doctor who liked to drink, hated exercise and loved her family. Mariah and her Black-adeshi family were at the center of most fights and Quad tried to avoid having sex with her nerdy husband. Oh, and Toya made Kelly Bundy look like a Pulitzer prize winner. Kari was there but she\u2019s undergoing a very personal struggle with her lips and couldn\u2019t be a part of this season.\n\nQuad is back and looking semi-clownish. Her hair is orange, her lips are red and her eyeshadow looks like something out of Face Maker circa 1983. It could be the fact that I\u2019m watching this on a 13 inch TV but all of this color is making my soul hurt. Anyway, she\u2019s shopping at her friend\u2019s store and he brings up the pressure for her to have a child. Okay, is this scene even in English? Quad and Reco sound like the result of James Brown possessing their bodies \u2013 if he was resurrected as a gay Southern man. I think the moral of the story is that Quad doesn\u2019t want to have babies yet but let\u2019s get down to the real story. Reco asked Mariah to pose for his magazine but she said she was busy. He told her he wanted to use Quad but Mariah felt it wasn\u2019t right to use someone else in her circle. Quad cries because her BFF is a selfish moron. I can\u2019t believe she was really crying over this so I choose to believe that there\u2019s more to this story. Maybe Mariah tried to show a family vacation slideshow on Quad\u2019s forehead. I don\u2019t know.\n\nDr. Jackie and Dr. Simone meet and discuss fun facts. For instance, some women forget to remove their IUD for decades and it\u2019s up to these brave souls to remove it. That was just the appetizer for the really fun stuff. Dr. Jackie talks about her husband\u2019s regret over not having a son. The first year of her marriage was when she went through her first bout with cancer. She also had a miscarriage so she wants to discuss using donor eggs with his sperm so he can have a child. Dr. Simone warns her not to do it because she\u2019s busy and she\u2019ll have to give stuff up in order to have a child. The conversation ends abruptly when Dr. Simone has to take off to push the eject button on a patient\u2019s uterus.\n\nMariah ruins her daughter\u2019s self-esteem during a family photo shoot when she tells her that she doesn\u2019t know how to give face and takes her place in the family photo. I see a Lauren Manzo in the making. I don\u2019t know what the Black-adeshi equivalent of provolone and egg salad is but order up a 30 year supply. Stat. Mariah\u2019s family, including her infamous mother, is there for dinner and Mariah asks her nephew Ian about being bullied at school. Mariah\u2019s advice to him is to beat up the girl who\u2019s been hitting him. More specifically, \u201chit it and quit it!\u201d First of all, the girl probably likes him and secondly, has Mariah not heard of school shootings and suicide? Kids are over the top these days. The last thing they need is permission to act out on whatever impulse they have. Third, \u201chit it and quit it\u201d definitely refers to sex. Perhaps she wants him to continue the reality tradition and be a star on MTV\u2019s Teen Dad: Reality Offspring. Then again this is Mariah. She\u2019d probably love for the kid to have a full meltdown so he can\u2019t overshadow her own kids.\n\nMariah says that she and Quad don\u2019t speak anymore and her sister says that Mariah created Quad. Actually, Suzuki invented quads. Mariah says that Rico Chapple, the dress shop man, got in Quad\u2019s ear about Mariah being jealous of her. Mariah\u2019s mother must\u2019ve read her hate mail last season because she\u2019s dressed like she\u2019s going to an inauguration and she\u2019s got a Hilary Clinton weave. Mariah\u2019s mom is disappointed in Quad so you know what that means. Quad\u2019s getting a beat down with a purse.\n\nDr. Simone gets home late from work. She missed her kid\u2019s game because a patient was in labor. Her husband, Cecil, was able to cover parental duties. She feels like she\u2019s trying to juggle lots of balls and based on her husband\u2019s facial expression, there\u2019s definitely a couple of blue balls in the house. Dr. Simone switched to a new billing system and she was prepared for a 3 month pay delay but not the 6 month one that she\u2019s going through. I love a doctor who can admit she\u2019s broke right now and can call herself a bitch in a loving way. I should have gone to medical school. I\u2019m always calling myself names and avoiding calls from collections.\n\nQuad is making breakfast for her husband, Greg. He\u2019s surprised and she makes the point that she can do this now that she doesn\u2019t work. She\u2019s brilliant! Quit work, do one menial task and justify leeching for as long as possible. Momma Joyce from RHOA would be relieved to know that Kandi\u2019s not the only \u2018victim\u2019. I love that she greets her husband politely but says good morning to her dogs like they got a medical degree and give her an eyeshadow allowance. Plus, her husband speaks in a higher pitch than her dogs bark and he doesn\u2019t need to be walked. He might need to be neutered though. She would give him sexy time but he farts in his sleep. I don\u2019t know why we need to hear about this but it makes me understand my perpetual loneliness. Dr. Gregory brings up the baby subject and fails to get her in the mood by basically saying that she\u2019s old. He tells her that she\u2019s on the back-end of thirty and she needs to get started. She laughs it off, says she\u2019s just starting her thirties and secretly pours laxative into his pancake batter.\n\nToya is a stay at home mom. Bravo basically spends 12 seconds catching up on her life of barely taking care of her kids and then has her go over to her dentist and friend\u2019s house. Dr. Heavenly says that Toya isn\u2019t the sharpest knife in the drawer but she likes her spirit\u2026and role on a TV show. Dr. Heavenly is having a soiree for Atlanta\u2019s medial elite and hopes that everyone is on their best behavior. She questions the behavior of Drs. Jackie and Simone at Toya\u2019s sickle cell event. Dr. Jackie offended a plus-sized pageant winner and Dr. Simone was dancing on Toya\u2019s husband. It sounds to me like the two of them went to reality TV school over the hiatus.\n\nDr. Simone borrows a purse from Dr. Jackie for the party and says she\u2019s putting nothing in it.
