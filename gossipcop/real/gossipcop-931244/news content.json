Kelly Ripa celebrated two big anniversaries on Tuesday, May 1. First off, she rang in 22 years of marriage with her husband, Mark Consuelos. On top of that, the day marked one year of her hosting Live With Kelly with co-host Ryan Seacrest!\n\nThe TV personality took to Instagram to give sweet shout-outs to both Mark and Ryan. For Mark, she posted a sweet video collage featuring a bunch of cute photos of the two. \u201cFeliz Aniversario lover! 22 years.
