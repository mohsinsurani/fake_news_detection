But now, they\u2019re going their separate ways.\n\n\u201cThis was the last thing Kaitlyn wanted,\u201d an insider says of the split, which happened a few weeks ago. \u201cShe was willing to fight for the relationship, but there was nowhere for it to go.\u201d\n\nBristowe, 33, and Booth, 31, got engaged on the season finale of The Bachelorette in 2015 and moved in together in Nashville soon after.\n\nStill, wedding plans never got off the ground.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only natural to think about the next steps when you\u2019ve been together for three years,\u201d the source tells PEOPLE in this week\u2019s issue, on stands Friday. \u201cKaitlyn wants to be married and have kids. But it didn\u2019t seem like they were on the same page.\u201d\n\nThe couple\u2019s busy schedules was also a factor. Booth owns a gym in Nashville, and Bristowe has a podcast, Off the Vine, a scrunchie line called Dew, and is working on her music career and a wine label.\n\nWalter McBride/Getty\n\nThey announced that they\u2019d ended their engagement Friday in an exclusive statement to PEOPLE: \u201cAfter three incredible years, we have decided to go our separate ways. This difficult decision comes after thoughtful, respectful consideration. Even though we are parting as a couple, we\u2019re very much committed to remaining friends and we will continue to support each other. Due to the nature of how we met, our relationship has always been very public, and we have enjoyed sharing it with all of you, but we ask that you respect our decision and our privacy at this time.\u201d\n\nFor more on Kaitlyn and Shawn, pick up this week\u2019s issue of PEOPLE, on stands Friday\n\nDavid Burton\n\nUltimately, \u201cit wasn\u2019t one of them who broke things off,\u201d says the source, noting that despite the split, Booth and Bristowe are \u201con good terms.\u201d\n\nStill, \u201cshe\u2019s devastated,\u201d the source says. \u201cThere is a lot of hurt. Kaitlyn tried to make it work. She never thought this would end.\u201d", "images":
