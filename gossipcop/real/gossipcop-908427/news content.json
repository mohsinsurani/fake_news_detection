So for it to be an issue at this point, I don\u2019t think it\u2019s really a conversation yet.\u201d\n\nLuyendyk gave Martinez a rose after their date but told Ashley Iaconetti and Ben Higgins on their Almost Famous podcast that he was shocked that she was 22. \u201cI really expected her to be in her mid-twenties,\u201d he said, adding, \u201cI couldn\u2019t deny the fact that there were a lot of feelings toward her \u2026 At that point in the show, I was probably the most connected to her and that made things really difficult for me.\u201d\n\nThe Bachelor airs on ABC Mondays at 8 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arie-luyendyk-jr-the-bachelor-bekah.jpg?crop=374px%2C0px%2C1342px%2C705px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/arie-luyendyk-jr-the-bachelor-bekah.jpg?crop=374px%2C0px%2C1342px%2C705px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kathy Campbell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/the-bachelors-bekah-martinez-responds-to-age-controversy/", "title": "The Bachelor's Bekah Martinez Responds to Age Controversy", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "The Bachelor's Bekah M. hit back at her fellow contestants who said she is too young for Ari Luyendyk Jr. \u2014 read more", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Bachelor's Bekah M.
