The show, which was announced on May 1st, is currently being called Busy Tonight, and we can\u2019t wait to see another female face in the still overwhelmingly male-dominated world of late-night (not to mention a face we love SO MUCH).\n\nPhilipps spoke to E! News directly on May 13th and provided a little more intel on what her show will entail.\n\n\"It's entertainment. It's my perspective on things,\" she said. \"I am so excited to bring this show to E! I think there's, you know, plenty of space for another female voice in late-night, and I'm so happy that E! is so supportive of female talent.\"\n\nShe said that she\u2019ll be bringing on a ton of celeb guests, and we\u2019re almost positive that Michelle Williams, her BFF/soulmate, will be one of the first (Philipps noted that Williams already voiced an interest).\n\nWhile the show will definitely be bringing viewers into Philipps\u2019 world, there\u2019s one thing she\u2019ll be keeping off-limits \u2014 and that\u2019s stories about her family that they haven\u2019t personally approved. According to the actress and soon-to-be host, her family has always been clear and open about their boundaries.\n\n\"My husband and I discuss things about when I post about our children and my kids actually have a voice in that, too,\" she said. \"My little one is a little too little, so we kind of make the decision for her, but my older daughter definitely has a voice. Like, 'Do not post that picture, Mom.'\"\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BiubreXhdxH\n\nBusy Tonight is set to debut this summer, likely in August, and we can\u2019t wait to see Philipps slay.", "images": ["https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/05/14/busy-philipps.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Dog-Halloween-Costume.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='198' height='178'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg' width='183' height='133'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Taylor-Swift.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jojo-siwa-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/easy-fall-cocktails-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/05/14/busy-philipps.jpg?quality=82&strip=1&resize=640%2C360", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/jessica-knoll-chiara-Aurelia-Mila-Kunis-Finn-Wittrock-1.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=183&h=133&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Kim-Kardashian-Kanye-West.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Serena-Williams-Olympia.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1", "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2022/10/Zooey-Deschanel.jpg?quality=82&strip=all&w=198&h=178&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://hellogiggles.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/7/2018/05/14/busy-philipps.jpg?quality=82&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karen Belz"], "canonical_link": "https://hellogiggles.com/busy-philipps-late-night-show-off-limits-subject/", "title": "Busy Philipps Discussed What Will Be Off-Limits On Her Late-Night Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Busy Philipps chatted with E!
