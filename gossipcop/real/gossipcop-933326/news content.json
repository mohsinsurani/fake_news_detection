The Love & Basketball star opened up in a new interview about the rumors that she was the actress who bit Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s face at a party in December 2017.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the most absurd thing I\u2019ve ever been involved with,\u201d Lathan, 46, said in her June 2018 cover story for Health magazine. \u201cThank God I\u2019ve been in this business for 20 years and have had so many rumors about me. They used to devastate me in my 20s, but in order to survive in this business, you just have to let it roll.\u201d\n\nThe Affair star insisted that she would never have the audacity to do such a thing to Queen Bey, 36, because she is just one of the \u201cFormation\u201d singer\u2019s many fans.\n\n\u201cI adore Beyonc\u00e9,\u201d she added. \u201cI would never do anything malicious like that \u2014 to her, or to anyone. It\u2019s so bizarre. I thought it was the funniest thing ever that it was a news story. It\u2019s so crazy.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, Tiffany Haddish first revealed in an interview with GQ in March that an unnamed actress bit Beyonc\u00e9. \u201cNear the end of the party, Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s at the bar, so I said to Beyonc\u00e9, \u2018Did she really bite you?\u2019 She was like, \u2018Yeah,\u2019\u201d the Girls Trip actress, 38, recalled to the magazine. \u201cI was like, \u2018She gonna get her ass beat tonight.\u2019 She was like, \u2018Tiffany, no. Don\u2019t do that. That bitch is on drugs. She not even drunk. The bitch is on drugs. She not like that all the time. Just chill.\u2019\u201d\n\nLathan was one of the first actresses to be accused of being the perpetrator after Twitter users narrowed down the list of attendees at the party in question. The Alien vs. Predator star quickly shut down the accusations on March 26, tweeting, \u201cY\u2019all are funny. Under no circumstances did I bite Beyonc\u00e9 and if I did it would\u2019ve been a love bite.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-and-beyonce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-and-beyonce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C679px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-and-beyonce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sanaa-lathan-speaks-out-about-absurd-rumors-she-bit-beyonce/", "title": "Sanaa Lathan Speaks Out About \u2018Absurd\u2019 Rumors She Bit Beyonce", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Sanaa Lathan opened up in a new interview about the rumors that she was the actress who bit Beyonce at a party \u2014 find out what she said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Sanaa Lathan Speaks Out About the \u2018Absurd\u2019 Rumors She Bit Beyonce", "description": "Sanaa Lathan opened up in a new interview about the rumors that she was the actress who bit Beyonce at a party \u2014 find out what she said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/sanaa-lathan-speaks-out-about-absurd-rumors-she-bit-beyonce/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-05-08T15:34:11+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-and-beyonce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-and-beyonce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-05-08T15:34:11+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Sanaa Lathan Speaks Out About the \u2018Absurd\u2019 Rumors She Bit Beyonce", "description": "Sanaa Lathan opened up in a new interview about the rumors that she was the actress who bit Beyonce at a party \u2014 find out what she said", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/sanaa-lathan-and-beyonce.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1200px%2C630px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1525793651.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
