In a new interview, with 53-year-old actress revealed her brood has been asked \u201ca couple times\u201d to star on their own reality series but Lori has said her home life is \u201cnot that exciting!\u201d\n\nWhen recently asked on E!\u2019s Daily Pop if she, her hubby of more than 20 years, Mossimo Giannulli, and their two teenage daughters have wanted to enter the reality television world, Lori replied, \u201cNo\u2026 we\u2019ve been asked to do a reality show a couple times\u2026 we\u2019re not that exciting.\u201d\n\nBella, Lori, and Olivia.\n\nThe Fuller House star continued, \u201cI have my two girls, they\u2019re 18 and 19 and they\u2019re doing really well. Olivia Jade\u2019s YouTube channel is doing really well and Bella\u2019s at her first year of college and she\u2019s enjoying it and she\u2019s also pursuing an acting career.\u201d Though Lori\u2019s daughters are now becoming famous themselves \u2014 Olivia Jade\u2019s YouTube channel has 1.3 million subscribers and Bella starred in the 2016 Hallmark movie Every Christmas Has a Story with her mom \u2014 the girls have admitted they \u201csometimes forget\u201d about their mama\u2019s celebrity status.\n\n\u201cI sometimes forget that she\u2019s famous. It\u2019s odd to see her on the TV screen and then turn around and see her cooking dinner,\u201d Bella told Teen Vogue in a previous interview. Olivia similarly added, \u201cI don\u2019t think I even realized the success of the show until I clicked on the Netflix Fuller House promo recently and noticed it had more than 13 million views.\u201d\n\nLori and her husband, Mossimo.\n\nAfter nearly 40 years in showbiz, Lori\u2019s acting career is even busier than ever today \u2014 and she\u2019s luckily able to balance her work and family life with the help of her fashion designer hubby, Mossimo. \u201cIt\u2019s challenging and you go day by day. I\u2019m very lucky that when I\u2019m working, my husband, [the girls\u2019 dad], is around and he\u2019s with them. So they\u2019re \u2014 they always have a parent with them 24/7. And we tag team very well, my husband and I,\u201d she said in a past interview.", "images": ["https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin.jpg?resize=940%2C529&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin-daughters.jpg?fit=400%2C280&quality=86&strip=all&resize=400%2C280", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-16x9.svg", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/TITANIC_300x490_7_11r.gif?fit=300%2C490&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/themes/ami-bauer/assets/build/images/placeholders/placeholder-1x1.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/lori-loughlin.jpg?resize=1200%2C630&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julia Birkinbine"], "canonical_link": "https://www.closerweekly.com/posts/lori-loughlin-family-reality-show-154572/", "title": "Lori Loughlin's Family Isn't Interested in Starring on a Reality TV Show", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "If you've been hoping that Lori Loughlin, her husband, and two daughters might pop up on a reality TV show, you'll be sad to hear this!
