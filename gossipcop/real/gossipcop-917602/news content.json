You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nAfter the stars' surprise appearance, it got even better as Lea brought along co-stars Danielle Brooks and Aussie Yael Stone \u2013 Taystee and Morello, respectively.\n\n\"As an Australian, we've waited a long time for this to happen,\" Yael told the happy couple and gathered guests.\n\n\"And we're really, really proud that we can be here and celebrate you guys individually and celebrate this change across this beautiful country that needed to change. This is a beautiful moment and thank you for sharing it with us!\"\n\nNetflix\n\nLea later showed-off her amazing singing voice by doing a romantic rendition of Ella Fitzgerald's 'Taking a Chance on Love' for the newlyweds. Be still our beating hearts.\n\nThe trio are in the country for Sydney's Gay and Lesbian Mardi Gras alongside other cast members of the popular Netflix show.\n\nOrange is the New Black is due to return for its sixth season later this year.
