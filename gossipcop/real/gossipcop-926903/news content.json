{"url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/zayn-malik-sofia-jamora-gigi-hadid", "text": "Zayn Malik released the action-packed video for his new single \"Let Me\" on Thursday (April 12), and fans were quick to notice a face that was quite similar to ex-girlfriend's Gigi Hadid.\n\nLet's start at the top: The song is essentially about Zayn asking someone to let him love them forever. He makes specific references at a number of points in the song, alluding to wanting \"walks on the beach in April,\" and \"duvet days and vanilla ice cream\" again. Elle has already pointed out that the beach walking thing could be referencing Gigi's birthday, which is in April. According to now-deleted Instagram pictures, the two spent celebrated her birthday in 2016, you guessed it, exploring the beach together.\n\nHowever, while the lyrics are vague enough to keep fans speculating, what seems to be more obvious is his on-screen companion, model Sofia Jamora. Fans on social media have repeatedly noted that she looks strikingly similar to Gigi, between her middle-part blonde hairstyle to even some of her facial features. One person tweeted, \"and also does anyone else think the girl in 'let me' by zayn looks alot like Gigi Hadid?!\" Another fan wrote, \"I\u2019m seeing a lot of comments under the video about Sofia Jamora looking a lot like Gigi and now I can\u2019t unsee it.\"\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631f4e26c31031f236400fc7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a3b2049f01b6d6b153e9a84/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/bri%2520headshot%25202.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632c6615ea4d002a2f878bdc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632de91d5f4164a550afb45f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ad0c4fc83cf8333073d217c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-sofia-fb.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/6320bd94f48fa8fc75dd1f66/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63360d6c55284445707e12b5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63403a02741d4e9d391116dc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633f1aa2038a40336b350a05/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ad0c58da2362e30d614f40f/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/gigi-sofia-lede.jpg"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ad0c4fc83cf8333073d217c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-sofia-fb.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Brianna Wiest"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/zayn-malik-sofia-jamora-gigi-hadid", "title": "Zayn Malik Fans Think Sofia Jamora in His \"Let Me\" Video Looks Like Ex Gigi Hadid", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "After Zayn Malik's video for \"Let Me\" dropped, fans were quick to point out the resemblance between Sofia Jamora and ex-girlfriend Gigi Hadid.", "id": "5ad0b2e8a2362e30d614f405", "keywords": "zayn malik,gigi hadid", "news_keywords": "zayn malik,gigi hadid", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5ad0b2e8a2362e30d614f405", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"After Zayn Malik's video for \\\"Let Me\\\" dropped, fans were quick to point out the resemblance between Sofia Jamora and ex-girlfriend Gigi Hadid.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ad0c1d883cf8333073d2178/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/sofia-tout.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ad0c1d883cf8333073d2178/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/sofia-tout.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "TBH, we kind of see it.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ad0c4fc83cf8333073d217c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-sofia-fb.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Fans Are Convinced the Model in Zayn Malik's New Video Looks Just Like Ex Gigi Hadid", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/zayn-malik-sofia-jamora-gigi-hadid"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-04-13T15:00:30.658Z", "modified_time": "2018-04-13T15:00:30.658Z", "author": "Brianna Wiest"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "TBH, we kind of see it.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5ad0c4fc83cf8333073d217c/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/gigi-sofia-fb.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Fans Are Convinced the Model in Zayn Malik's New Video Looks Just Like Ex Gigi Hadid"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523631630.658, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
