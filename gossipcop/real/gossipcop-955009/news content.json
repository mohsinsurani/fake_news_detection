The musician\u2019s wife, Luisana Lopilato, announced via Instagram on Thursday, July 26, that she gave birth to their third child, a daughter.\n\n\u201cHow to explain that our heart explodes with love? That there\u2019s not enough hours in a day to think about it. I thank God for making us this gift of life and happiness! Because looking in her eyes is looking at heaven itself!\u201d she wrote in her native Spanish alongside a black-and-white photo of the baby girl\u2019s hand. \u201cWe love you to infinity and beyond. We waited for you not only to grow as a family \u2026 you gave us light, hope, you are and will be our souls\u2019 life.\u201d\n\nBubl\u00e9, 42, and Lopilato, 31, who wed in her native Argentina in 2011, announced the actress\u2019 third pregnancy in February. They are also the parents of sons Noah, 4, and Elias, 2.\n\nThe arrival of the couple\u2019s new bundle of joy comes nearly two years after their eldest son was diagnosed with liver cancer. \u201cLuisana and I have put our careers on hold in order to devote all our time and attention to helping Noah get well,\u201d the four-time Grammy winner said in a statement posted on his Facebook page in November 2016. \u201cAt this difficult time, we ask only for your prayers and respect for our privacy. We have a long journey in front of us and hope that with the support of family, friends and fans around the world, we will win this battle, God willing.\u201d\n\nLopilato\u2019s sister, Daniela, told the Argentinian magazine Gente later that month that Noah had begun chemotherapy and the family had \u201ca lot of faith\u201d in her nephew, whom she called a \u201cwarrior.\u201d The following February, Bubl\u00e9 said in a statement to Us that Noah was \u201cprogressing well during his treatment and the doctors are very optimistic about the future.\u201d\n\nThe \u201cHaven\u2019t Met You Yet\u201d crooner and the model ended 2017 on a high note. A source told Us exclusively in December that Noah was \u201cdoing well,\u201d and Bubl\u00e9 was \u201cready to think about going back to work.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Michael-Buble-and-Luisana-Lopilato-gives-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1717px%2C970px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Michael-Buble-and-Luisana-Lopilato-gives-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1717px%2C902px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Michael-Buble-and-Luisana-Lopilato-gives-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1717px%2C902px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michael-buble-wife-luisana-lopilato-welcome-baby-no-3/", "title": "Michael Buble and Wife Luisana Lopilato Welcome Baby No. 3", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Michael Buble\u2019s wife, Luisana Lopilato, announced on Thursday, July 26, that she gave birth to their third child \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Michael Buble and Wife Luisana Lopilato Welcome Baby No. 3", "description": "Michael Buble\u2019s wife, Luisana Lopilato, announced on Thursday, July 26, that she gave birth to their third child \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/michael-buble-wife-luisana-lopilato-welcome-baby-no-3/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-10-15T12:42:38+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Michael-Buble-and-Luisana-Lopilato-gives-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1717px%2C902px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Michael-Buble-and-Luisana-Lopilato-gives-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1717px%2C902px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-26T17:47:19+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-10-15T12:42:38+00:00"}, "author": "Nicholas Hautman", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Michael Buble and Wife Luisana Lopilato Welcome Baby No. 3", "description": "Michael Buble\u2019s wife, Luisana Lopilato, announced on Thursday, July 26, that she gave birth to their third child \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/Michael-Buble-and-Luisana-Lopilato-gives-birth.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1717px%2C902px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@nickhautman", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532627239.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
