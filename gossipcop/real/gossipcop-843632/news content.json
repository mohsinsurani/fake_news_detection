The Star Wars: The Last Jedi trailer debuted last night, featuring powerful images of epic battles, teachers and students, and a mother and her son. Here are five highlights that have us talking.\n\n1. \u201cRaw, untamed power\u2026\u201d\n\nSnoke\u2019s opening narration, heard while we get our first glimpses of Kylo Ren and the First Order, is positively chilling. With just a few words, we get a sense of backstory and what\u2019s at stake right now.\n\n2. Luke and Rey.\n\nStar Wars: The Force Awakens ended with Rey reaching out to Luke, his first lightsaber \u2014 and his father\u2019s lightsaber \u2014 in hand. Now we see some of what happens next: Luke\u2019s shock, Rey training with her Jedi weapon, and an awesome display of power. Which leads to number 3\u2026\n\n3. \u201cRaw strength\u2026\u201d\n\nDrawing a thematic parallel to Snoke\u2019s opening narration, Luke says, \u201cI\u2019ve seen this raw strength only once before. It didn\u2019t scare me enough then. It does now.\u201d What his wariness \u2014 reinforced with tragic scenes of a past horror \u2014 means for Rey, we\u2019ll find out.\n\n4. Kylo Ren and Leia.\n\nWe watch Kylo Ren in his TIE silencer speed through battle, closing in on his target \u2014 a Resistance cruiser, seemingly with his mother onboard. \u201cLet the past die. Kill it if you have to.\u201d He hesitates. We\u2019re on the edge of our seats.\n\n5. An outreached hand.\n\nWho expected this? A moment that harkens back to both Rey reaching out to Luke and Kylo Ren\u2019s offer to train Rey in The Force Awakens, it leaves us with a lot of questions. And will make the wait for December 15 feel even longer.\n\nThere are tons of other great moments in the trailer, too: Poe\u2019s fiery speech, Finn versus Phasma, and of course, Chewie and the porg.
