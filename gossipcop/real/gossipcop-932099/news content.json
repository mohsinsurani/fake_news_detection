He added that West and his Yeezy footwear brand are a \u201cvery important part of our brand from a revenue standpoint and how we promote our products,\u201d but emphasized the company\u2019s overall strength.\n\nDuring a conversation on \u201cTMZ Live\u201d with Harvey Levin and Charles Latibeaudiere, West said, \u201cWhen you hear about slavery for 400 years. For 400 years?! That sounds like a choice. You was there for 400 years and it\u2019s all of y\u2019all. It\u2019s like we\u2019re mentally in prison. I like the word \u2018prison\u2019 because \u2018slavery\u2019 goes too direct to the idea of blacks. Slavery is to blacks as the Holocaust is to Jews.
