The sprawling ensemble and multiple storylines mean that some of the cast rarely works together, if at all. More so than with many other series, the OITNB actresses watch the show as fans, too, and as such they have their own favorite storylines and characters.\n\nThe Hollywood Reporter asked for the cast\u2019s favorite stories that don\u2019t directly involve their characters, as well as which of their co-stars they like to watch work.\n\nRuby Rose (Stella)\n\n\u201cAt the very beginning, I was very much into the Piper-Alex scenario. It\u2019s hard not to be. I was very invested in that relationship, just like millions of other people. Then the show went on and you got to understand more of the other characters, and it became more clear it was really an ensemble cast. I got very invested in Poussey and Taystee\u2019s relationship as well. \u2026 And Lorna Morello, played by Yael [Stone], also captured my heart a little bit with her vulnerability.\u201d\n\nSamira Wiley (Poussey)\n\n\u201cAlways Kate Mulgrew. Kate has such an amazing energy on set. She commands this presence that\u2019s so admirable, and it makes you step back. I love seeing her onscreen. The way she handles her scenes \u2026 just walking down the hallway is amazing.\u201d\n\nLea DeLaria (Big Boo)\n\n\u201cI never get to work with Uzo [Aduba], and I\u2019m always happy when she\u2019s onscreen. We did that daggering thing in season one, but that was really the only time I\u2019ve gotten to work with her. \u2026 Really interesting choices she makes with her character \u2014 like when I read it, I\u2019ll think, that\u2019s funny. But then Uzo will take it and turn it on a dime. She\u2019ll take a line that was probably meant for comedy, and she\u2019ll punch you right in the gut with it. And she\u2019s right.\u201d\n\nDanielle Brooks (Taystee)\n\n\u201cI love the relationship that\u2019s developing between Gloria and Sophia. I think Selenis [Levya] is just an amazing actress. It\u2019s so cool to watch her in the kitchen and the struggle with her son. I also really enjoy the backstories this season. You already got the backstories of the main characters, but now you\u2019re getting some of the backstories of the secondary characters, which you realize are not secondary characters. Everyone has an arc here and is really leaving a stamp in the show. It\u2019s really cool to watch the backstories of characters you weren\u2019t expecting to get.\u201d\n\nAdrienne Moore (Black Cindy)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m always eager to see what Taryn Manning is gonna do. She likes to take the odd note. If you know anything about music, you have your chords but then you have those off-chords, and I think she finds those a lot in her character. And she\u2019s a musician, so a lot of her music is in her character. She\u2019s definitely someone who can be in her character and in that moment, and then step away and talk about how she has a DJing job in Florida next week.\u201d\n\nKate Mulgrew (Red)\n\n\u201cAdrienne Moore, Uzo Aduba, Danielle Brooks and Samira Wiley. That\u2019s the tribe, and Red doesn\u2019t have much to do with them. I miss them because they\u2019re wildly talented, and every time I work with them, it\u2019s an unexpected thing. They\u2019re incredibly inventive and I love their energy. I feel that about the Latinas as well, but I have them in the kitchen.\u201d\n\nTaylor Schilling (Piper)\n\n\u201cI love to watch everybody, but I never work with Chang [Lori Tan Chin] ever, so whenever she\u2019s working and she\u2019s before me or after me, I try to watch her because she\u2019s genius. So spicy! She is so unexpected. I never know what she\u2019s gonna do, and I find her to be such a brilliant actress that I never have scenes with.\u201d\n\nLaura Prepon (Alex)\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s so fun about the show. Because the cast is so big, there\u2019s a lot of times where I don\u2019t have any storylines with like half the cast. That\u2019s what\u2019s also fun about watching the show \u2014 I\u2019ve read all the scripts, but then I get to see what the girls do with it, and these women are such great actresses, it\u2019s so fun to watch. It\u2019s hard to pick one character because everyone is so perfect for their character, and it\u2019s so different.\u201d\n\nSeason three of Orange Is the New Black is streaming now on Netflix.\n\n\u2013 Additional reporting by Ashley Lee", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/oitnb_favorite_storylines.jpg?w=2000&h=1126&crop=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/oitnb_favorite_storylines.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/oitnb_favorite_storylines.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rick Porter"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/orange-is-new-black-stars-802597/", "title": "\u2018Orange Is the New Black\u2019 Stars Pick Their Favorite Storylines and Characters", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"It's hard to pick one character because everyone is so perfect for their character, and it's so different,\" Laura Prepon tells THR.", "news_keywords": "Orange is the New Black", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Rick Porter", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 802597, "title": "'Orange Is the New Black' Stars Pick Their Favorite Storylines and Characters", "published_at": "2015-06-15 15:40:30", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/oitnb_favorite_storylines.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Orange is the New Black", "topics": "TV News", "body": "The upside of Orange Is the New Black's large cast \u2014 more than 30 regular or recurring parts among the Litchfield inmates alone \u2014 is that no one actor, not even first-billed Taylor Schilling, has to carry too much of the load.\r\nThe downside?
