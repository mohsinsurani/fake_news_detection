There's been this incredible confluence of events that's really led to women coming together and feeling safe in numbers to come forward and talk about their experiences across all different industries.\"\n\nPaltrow came forward last month alleging that Weinstein had sexually harassed her when was just 22 and working on the film, Emma. Her claims -- and the claims of many others -- helped spark the #MeToo movement on social media and have led to repercussions for several Hollywood heavyweights accused of sexual harassment and assault.\n\nMore women who have accused Harvey Weinstein:\n\n\n\nRELATED: Matt Damon Says He and Ben Affleck Knew About Harvey Weinstein Allegedly Sexually Harassing Gwyneth Paltrow\n\nMore than 60 women have come forward accusing Weinstein of inappropriate sexual conduct in the month since The New York Times' initial piece accusing him of sexual harassment over the last three decades. The producer has \"unequivocally denied\" any and all claims of non-consensual sex.\n\n\"Any allegations of non-consensual sex are unequivocally denied by Mr. Weinstein. Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances,\" his lawyer said in a statement. \"Mr. Weinstein obviously can\u2019t speak to anonymous allegations, but with respect to any women who have made allegations on the record, Mr. Weinstein believes that all of these relationships were consensual. Mr. Weinstein has begun counseling, has listened to the community and is pursuing a better path.\"\n\nSee photos of Gwyneth Paltrow:\n\n\n\nRELATED: Rose McGowan Speaks Publicly for the First Time
