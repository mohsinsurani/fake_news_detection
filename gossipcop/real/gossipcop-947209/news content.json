He said, \u2018Give Donald Trump a chance.\u2019 I sort of disagreed with that, but I still like Harry. That was his politics. I have my politics.\u201d\n\nHe added of Prince Harry potentially being a Trump supporter, \u201cI would hope not, but at the time he might have been.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-thomas-markle.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-thomas-markle.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/06/donald-trump-queen-elizabeth-ii-thomas-markle.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/06/26/thomas-markle-is-mad-that-trump-will-meet-the-queen-before-he-will/", "title": "Thomas Markle is mad that Trump will meet the queen before he will", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
