It seems that way for pals Courteney Cox and Jennifer Aniston, who were spotted recently in sleek, coordinated outfits.\n\nFourteen years after the iconic series aired its last episode, \"Monica\" and \"Rachel\" (respectively) were spotted hanging out in style at a benefit dinner in Malibu, Calif., on Saturday.\n\nTalk about stylish! Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox arrive in a monochromatic look. Presley Ann / Patrick McMullan via Getty Image\n\nCox and Aniston wore chic complementary black-and-white looks to the elegant dinner, which was hosted by Chanel and benefited the National Resources Defense Council.\n\nAniston wore all-black to the affair, pairing her outfit with a fringed Chanel clutch, while Cox sported a silky white shirt and a classic grey tweed Chanel purse. Who says you can't stand out in white and black?\n\nThe only thing that's more classic than their outfits are their smiles!\n\nThe photo brings back memories from the 1990s, when the pair would pose for on-set pictures like this:\n\nThrowback! Courteney Cox as Monica Geller, Jennifer Aniston as Rachel Green on the set of \"Friends.\" NBC via Getty Images\n\nThe recent benefit dinner is not the first time the pair has been spotted making memories recently, however.\n\nBack in February, Aniston celebrated her 49th birthday at an intimate party hosted at Cox\u2019s California home, which included some of the actress\u2019s best friends including \u201cSuddenly Susan\u201d actress Andrea Bendewald.\n\nWhen they're not hanging out, technology allows Aniston and Cox to stay in touch with fellow \"Friends\" star and pal Lisa Kudrow through text message, (the SMS medium being much to Cox's chagrin.)\n\n\u201cLisa, Jennifer and I all have a text chain, but to me, it's too much pressure,\" Cox told Us Weekly. \u201cI'm not into the group text chain. I really don't like it!\u201d\n\nPerhaps good old-fashioned, in-person fun (like wearing matching outfits to dinner) is the way to go.", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201803/tdy_pop_klg_friends_text_180305_1920x1080.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787151/web-discovery-style-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_42/1790748/web-discovery-video-mc-gradient-211019.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/rockcms/2022-10/TODAY-menu-2022-431ed9.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787147/web-discovery-pop-culture-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_22/1343446/jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-today-180603-tease-01.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787138/web-discovery-food-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787172/web-discovery-parents-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2022_11/1853676/saturday2x.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787145/web-discovery-home-mc-211012_copy.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-760x428,f_auto,q_auto:best/MSNBC/Components/Video/201802/1920_friends_tease.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432043/hodaandjenna.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_22/1343449/jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-today-180603-inline-02.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787173/web-discovery-shopping-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-120x180,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2021_41/1787140/web-discovery-health-mc-211012.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_52/2696491/williegeist.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/w_10000,h_74,q_80,c_fit,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_18/1432044/today-3rd-hour.png", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_22/1343447/jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-today-180603-inline-01.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1200x630_center,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2018_22/1343446/jennifer-aniston-courteney-cox-today-180603-tease-01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Ratliff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.today.com/style/friends-pals-monica-rachel-reunite-wearing-coordinated-outfits-t130181", "title": "'Friends' pals 'Rachel' and 'Monica' reunite, wear coordinated outfits!", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/today/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 122384521533, "admins": 100001657893615, "pages": 157687092983}, "og": {"site_name": "TODAY.com", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.today.com/style/friends-pals-monica-rachel-reunite-wearing-coordinated-outfits-t130181", "title": "'Friends' pals \u2018Rachel\u2019 and \u2018Monica\u2019 reunite, wear coordinated outfits!", "description": "Jennifer Aniston and Courteney Cox are still great friends.
