Although I have little memory of that night, something bad obviously took place, which I understand is why production on the show has now been suspended and a producer on the show has filed a complaint against the production,\u201d Olympios, 25, said.\n\n\u201cAs a woman, this is my worst nightmare and it has now become my reality. As I pursue the details and facts surrounding that night and the immediate days after, I have retained a group of professionals to ensure that what happened on June 4 comes to light and I can continue my life, including hiring an attorney to obtain justice and seeking therapy to begin dealing with the physical and emotional trauma stemming from that evening.\u201d\n\nAccording to a source close to Jackson, the BiP star \u201chas been in high spirits\u201d since the investigation and is confident his reputation will soon be cleared.\n\n\u201cHe certainly isn\u2019t the man he\u2019s being portrayed to be,\u201d the source told PEOPLE on Wednesday. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for his loved ones to sit and watch most of the slanderous accusations and comments from individuals who don\u2019t know anything about who he is. I think the truth may tell [a] different story than what\u2019s been reported thus far.\u201d\n\nWhile the ABC show\u2019s fate remains up in the air, a source told PEOPLE BiP will not be resuming this summer. \u201cThere are no authorities involved, no law enforcement but the incident was flagged internally and they take these matter seriously, so they\u2019re looking into it. But Bachelor in Paradise will not be resuming \u2014 this summer at least.\u201d", "images":
