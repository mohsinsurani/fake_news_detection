She also sported her fresh pixie, which she cut summer 2017 for her upcoming role in Sister, which Sia is directing.\n\nHawn, on the other hand, turned to a teal one-shouldered look that\u2019s, for a lack of a better description, super Goldie. On the red carpet, they told E!\u2019s Giuliana Rancic what they\u2019ve learned about each other over the years.\n\nRELATED: All the Glamorous 2018 SAG Awards Red Carpet Looks\n\n\u201cI feel lucky, blessed that I have a role model that I can call my mom, do you know what I mean?\u201d Hudson said. \u201cOne of the things that my mom has taught me is to find compassion in everything that I do, kindness, and that family is everything.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe learn a lot from each other and we just listen,\u201d Hawn said.\n\nTalk about cute.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2018/01/012118-hudson-hawn-lead.jpg?itok=RYxgSKyQ", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/012118-hudson-hawn-lead.jpg?itok=Dgz8dNlw", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2018/01/012118-hudson-hawn-lead.jpg?itok=Dgz8dNlw", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jonathan Borge"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180126210915/http://www.instyle.com/news/2018-sag-awards-kate-hudson-goldie-hawn", "title": "2018 SAG Awards: Kate Hudson and Goldie Hawn Red Carpet", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "News,Celebrity,Red Carpet,Awards & Events,SAG Awards,Kate Hudson,Goldie Hawn", "news_keywords": "2018 sag awards, sag awards, why did kate hudson cut her hair, who are kate hudson's parents, kate hudson and goldie hawn, kate hudson and goldie hawn dress", "description": "The mother-daughter duo hit the red carpet together at the 2018 SAG Awards in coordinating blue and pink looks.
