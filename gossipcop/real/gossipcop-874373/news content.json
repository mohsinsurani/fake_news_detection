News:\n\n\"I\u2019m trying to do a lot of work on myself because I realize now the downfall of our relationship was my fault,\" he explained.\n\n\"When you\u2019re thrust into the spotlight like that, it can affect you. My mistake was taking our relationship for granted.\"\n\nBaier says the high-profile nature of the relationship was part of the problem (which is odd, because he never would have met Amber if she weren\u2019t on TV), but he also accepts responsibility for being a less-than-stellar partner:\n\n\"What I\u2019ve learned from this is you have to do the work,\" he told the outlet.\n\n\"You have to make the person you\u2019re with feel loved every single day. I forgot to do that and now I\u2019m paying the price.\"\n\nPhoto via MTV\n\nMatt says he\u2019s full of regrets over the way his relationship played out, and if given a second chance, he would change everything about the way he behaved.\n\n\"If I got a do-over,\" he said, \"I would do everything differently. I should have listened to her more.\"\n\nThe couple was filming a new season of the We TV reality series Marriage Boot Camp at the time of their split.\n\nMatt left the set ahead of schedule and took off for Vegas \u2013 where he\u2019s apparently been living ever since.\n\n\"I went to Vegas to get my head around the split. Ultimately, my hope was to get a place where Amber could come visit me and we could work on our issues. Obviously, that didn\u2019t happen.\"\n\nBut despite the fact that Amber is in a new relationship, Matt is still hopeful that she\u2019ll find her way back to him:\n\nPhoto via Instagram\n\n\"I\u2019ll hold out hope for a reconciliation. But if nothing else, I hope we can stay friends,\" Baier says.\n\n\"We started off as best friends and that\u2019s what I miss the most from her\u2014her friendship. To not have that is painful. When something happens, my natural instinct still is to call her and tell her everything. She was my family.\"\n\nAs though that\u2019s not depressing enough, Baier concluded the info with some insights into his day-to-day life post-Amber:\n\n\"I\u2019ve been making a living through my [poker] winnings,\" he says.\n\n\"That said, I\u2019m not really enjoying it. This isn\u2019t the life I want to live.\"\n\nYeesh. Matt may not have been the perfect boyfriend, but here\u2019s hoping he\u2019s able to pull himself out of what sounds like a pretty considerable funk.\n\nWatch Teen Mom: OG online to relive Matt and Amber\u2019s tumultuous relationship.", "images": ["https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_asuelupulaa_header-80x80.png", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/matt-baier-reacts-841x1024.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1205206355-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_rhobh_02_kathyhilton-80x80.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1006_tylerbaltierra_header-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%201024%20682'%3E%3Crect%20width='1024'%20height='682'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/amber-portwood-pissed-at-matt-baier-1024x682.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/Featured-Image-36-1-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/08/noah-brown-and-rhain-at-the-zoo-320x240.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20490%20663'%3E%3Crect%20width='490'%20height='663'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20540'%3E%3Crect%20width='720'%20height='540'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "http://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/03/amber-portwood-with-matt-baier-pic.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20841%201024'%3E%3Crect%20width='841'%20height='1024'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-black.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2016/06/pink-at-the-premiere-of-alice-through-the-looking-glass-320x240.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/02/thg-logo.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20320%20240'%3E%3Crect%20width='320'%20height='240'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/matt-baier-reacts.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/matt-baier-reacts-720x540.png", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/image-1-80x80.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%2080%2080'%3E%3Crect%20width='80'%20height='80'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/GettyImages-1300926028-80x80.jpg", "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2022/10/1007_andreicastravel_elizabethpotthast_header-80x80.png", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20500%20500'%3E%3Crect%20width='500'%20height='500'%20style='fill:%23e3e3e3'/%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://cdn.thehollywoodgossip.com/uploads/2017/06/matt-baier-reacts.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.thehollywoodgossip.com/2017/08/matt-baier-on-amber-portwood-breakup-its-all-my-fault/", "title": "Matt Baier on Amber Portwood Breakup: It's All My Fault!", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Matt Baier on Amber Portwood Breakup: It's All My Fault!", "description": "If you're a Teen Mom: OG fan, then by now, you've probably heard the news that Amber Portwood and Matt Baier have broken up.
