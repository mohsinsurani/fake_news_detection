She's really real. She loves to teach people how to not come from a place of insecurity, just, you know, come from a place of love, I guess. She's a big fairy, flower child. [She's] a beautiful soul, a beautiful soul.\" \u2014 Channing, during a Step Up press conference\n\n02 of 11 BOUDOIR VIBES Donato Sardella/Getty \"\u2026I've always been a very sexual person. We definitely have a very happy and healthy [sex life]. Something about being a dancer connects you to your physical body. It's primal, earthy, sexual energy by nature. You feel your body in a certain way. Channing is very much the same way. He's very in tune with that.\" \u2014 Jenna, to Cosmopolitan\n\n03 of 11 BECAUSE OF YOU Source: Channing Tatum/Twitter \"She keeps us all sane. Jenna puts everything in perspective for me, always. I'll find myself spinning out or angry or whatever, or even happy, and she always somehow ends up righting the ship.\" \u2014 Channing, to reporters at the Foxcatcher New York City premiere\n\n04 of 11 ALWAYS ON MY MIND Jonathan Leibson/Getty \"It was two nights of being weird. We hadn\u2019t even kissed. And then he went out partying with a bunch of dancers. His room was right above mine, and he came down drunk with a sombrero on, banging on my door. He was like, 'I couldn't stop thinking about you. Let's do this. I just want to be with you.' From that point forward, we were together.\" \u2014 Jenna, to Cosmopolitan\n\n05 of 11 GUIDING LIGHT Jay Clendenin/Lara Porzak Photography \"If it wasn't for her I would have never even found the path much less stayed on it and not flown off in flaming truck of dynamite singing devil went down to Georgia. Hahahaha. To my light. I love you.\" \u2014 Channing, on Instagram\n\n06 of 11 GROWING TOGETHER Source: Channing Tatum/Instagram \"I took this just days after Jenna and I (mostly Jenna) brought our little girl into the world. I've taken many like it over the past 3 years but this is one of my favorites. She was so tired. Haha. But she has such deep strength and other worldly grace. Watching her in those first days transform into a mother was life changing. She was every bit the beautiful, sexy, funny, flawed creature I fell in love with. But the prism turned and showed a whole new light that I had no idea existed, the light of a mothers love. Thank you for that baby.\" \u2014 Channing, on Instagram\n\n07 of 11 FIRST & FOREMOST Kevin Mazur/WireImage \"Most actors and actresses are consumed by careers and getting ahead. Channing and I are ambitious, but our relationship comes first. We take everything day by day, saying, OK, how can we make this work together?'\" \u2014 Jenna, to Glamour\n\n08 of 11 FOR MUCH BETTER Jordan Strauss/Invision/AP \"We\u2019re a good support system for each other. We keep pushing each other to grow and be better. I don\u2019t think I could do it any other way [than with her].\" \u2014 Channing, to PEOPLE\n\n09 of 11 FAMILY MAN Courtesy Tatum Family \"He's amazing [as a dad]. He's so sensitive. He's like this really strong, you know, big guy, and then you give him this little baby and he's like, 'Oh my god! Is she going to drop? Am I doing everything OK?' He's like the most amazing diaper changer. It's the one thing he knows he can do, so he's like, 'Let me get in there. Let me change this diaper.' \" \u2014 Jenna, on Ellen\n\n10 of 11 TALK THE TALK Brian To/WENN \"We get down. Me and Jenna have a great sex life. We communicate very well.\" \u2014 Channing, to Cosmopolitan", "images":
