Though using gold in skin care products has become popular only now, it has been used by Romans, Egyptians, and Japanese for ages to manage several skin conditions. Keep reading to know the top 10 benefits of gold in skin care. Scroll down.\n\nBenefits of Gold for Skin Care\n\nColloidal Gold is a suspension of gold nanoparticles in a fluid, usually water. Nanoparticle is a particle with a size ranging from 1 to 100 nanometers. Studies suggest that colloidal gold can penetrate deeper into the skin and act as a carrier for other active ingredients (1). It helps improve the efficacy of skin care products. Due to its soothing and rejuvenating properties, colloidal gold is the ideal skin care ingredient for all skin types, particularly sensitive skin. Medical studies suggest that gold nanoparticles can be used in the treatment of cancers and have been shown to accelerate the wound healing process (2).\n\n1. Wrinkles, Fine Lines, Spots Can Be Reduced\n\nTo have clear skin, free from wrinkles and spots, is every woman\u2019s ultimate desire. Gold nanoparticles, along with ginseng extracts, have been found to have antioxidant properties that reduce wrinkles, fine lines, blemishes, and marks on the skin to make you look younger (3), (4).\n\n2. Stimulates The Skin Cells\n\nThe ions present in gold help in stimulating the cells, nerves, and veins in your body. This leads to improved blood circulation.

This would prevent the skin from premature aging.\n\n4. Gold Can Lighten The Complexion\n\nAs we recollect history, it was rumored that one of the beauty regimes that Cleopatra followed was the use of gold. Cleopatra used a gold mask every night to enhance her complexion and keep her skin youthful, glowing and beautiful (4).\n\n5. Collagen Depletion Is Slowed Down\n\nCollagen is naturally produced in your body which keeps the body flexible. It is responsible for giving smooth skin and shining hair. The collagen level in the body starts depleting from the age of 25 and this is when you notice the changes on your skin. Skin care with gold can slow down the depletion of collagen level in your skin cells (6).\n\n6. Sun Damage Can Be Treated\n\nWe all are very concerned about our skin getting tanned under the sun. The production of melanin or black pigment in the skin is responsible for tanning the skin when exposed to sunlight. The production of melanin in the body can be reduced with the use of gold (2), (7).\n\n7. Allergies Can Be Treated\n\nEgyptians believed that gold has medicinal properties that can help in healing a few diseases. The antioxidant properties present in gold helps in increasing blood circulation which leads to a reduction in acne and other skin allergies (7).\n\n8. Inflammation Can Be Treated:\n\nGold is said to have anti-bacterial and anti-inflammation properties that help oxygen to enter into the skin for renewal of the cells. This helps in treating ulcers and other inflammatory disorders of the skin. It is also known to rejuvenate your skin (8).\n\n9. Elasticity Of The Skin Can Be Increased:\n\nSkin tends to sag when its elasticity decreases or is completely lost. The use of gold can reduce the breakdown of elastin and restore the elasticity of the tissues. This will further prevent the skin from sagging. Gold increases the elasticity of the skin, thus making it firm and toned (9).\n\n10. Glowing Skin:\n\nGold helps in improving blood circulation, hence it helps hydrate and maintains the skin\u2019s moisture level. The small particles of gold get absorbed into the skin imparting a rich glow. This makes the skin healthy, fresh, and radiant (4).\n\nGold not only gives a beautiful, glowing, and youthful skin but is also beneficial in many ways. It slows down collagen depletion, increases skin\u2019s elasticity, lightens the skin\u2019s complexion, stimulates the cells makes the skin firm, improves blood circulation, and prevents premature aging, wrinkles, tanning, etc.\n\nThe benefits of gold in skin care include wrinkle-free skin, no premature aging, high skin elasticity, and bright skin tone.

On the other hand, the richness of gold skin care products remains a drawcard: you feel good about using them and anticipate indulging, which is not a terrible thing.
