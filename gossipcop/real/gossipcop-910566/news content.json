After a slew of male winners and performers at the Sunday, January 28, show, at NYC\u2019s Madison Square Garden. Portnow stated that women need to \u201cstep up\u201d in order to be recognized.\n\nAfter his statement, many female artists, including Katy Perry, Sheryl Crow and Pink, voiced their disappointment. Kelly Clarkson, who was nominated for Best Pop Solo Performance, took to Twitter on Wednesday, January 31, to respond.\n\n\u201cA confused soul said women need to \u2018step up\u2019 their A-game if they wanna start winning and you know what, I\u2019m not even mad at ignorance,\u201d the \u201cLove So Soft\u201d singer tweeted. \u201cI\u2019m just gonna kindly point you in the direction of my A-game album I recently dropped.\u201d\n\nClarkson then added that she \u201cJenna Dewan\u2019d that s\u2014t,\u201d referencing Dewan-Tatum\u2019s hit film, Step Up.\n\nClarkson\u2019s statement echoed that of Pink, who performed at the show.\n\n\u201cWomen in music don\u2019t need to \u2018step up\u2019 \u2014 women have been stepping since the beginning of time,\u201d the singer, 38, tweeted on Monday, January 29. \u201cStepping up, and also stepping aside women OWNED music this year. They\u2019ve been KILLING IT. And every year before this. When we celebrate and honor that talent and accomplishments of women, and how much women STEP UP every year, against all odds, we show the next generation of women and girls and boys and men what it means to be equal, and what it looks like to be fair.\u201d\n\nAlessia Cara was the only female to win during the telecast and Lorde, the only best album nominee \u2014 and only female in the category \u2014 was not asked to perform.\n\nAfter the backlash, Portnow released a new statement, saying his \u201cstep up\u201d comment was taken out of context.\n\n\u201cOur industry must recognize that women who dream of careers in music face barriers that men have never faced,\u201d he told The New York Times on Tuesday, January 30. \u201cWe must actively work to eliminate these barriers and encourage women to live their dreams and express their passion and creativity through music. We must welcome, mentor and empower them. Our community will be richer for it.\n\n\u201cI regret that I wasn\u2019t as articulate as I should have been in conveying this thought,\u201d Portnow added. \u201cI remain committed to doing everything I can to make our music community a better, safer and more representative place for everyone.\u201d", "images": ["https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kelly-clarkson-neil-portnow.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1131px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kelly-clarkson-neil-portnow.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kelly-clarkson-neil-portnow.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Longeretta"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kelly-clarkson-responds-to-grammys-presidents-step-up-comment/", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Responds to Grammys President\u2019s \u2018Step Up\u2019 Comment", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Grammys,Grammys 2018", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kelly Clarkson had no time for Recording Academy president Neil Portnow, who said women need to \u2018step up\u2019 following the #GrammysSoMale controversy \u2014 see her response", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Perfectly Shades Grammys President for \u2018Step Up\u2019 Comment", "description": "Kelly Clarkson had no time for Recording Academy president Neil Portnow, who said women need to \u2018step up\u2019 following the #GrammysSoMale controversy \u2014 see her response", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kelly-clarkson-responds-to-grammys-presidents-step-up-comment/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2019-01-17T19:07:07+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kelly-clarkson-neil-portnow.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kelly-clarkson-neil-portnow.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-31T15:59:14+00:00", "modified_time": "2019-01-17T19:07:07+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Longeretta", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kelly Clarkson Perfectly Shades Grammys President for \u2018Step Up\u2019 Comment", "description": "Kelly Clarkson had no time for Recording Academy president Neil Portnow, who said women need to \u2018step up\u2019 following the #GrammysSoMale controversy \u2014 see her response", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/kelly-clarkson-neil-portnow.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1517414354.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
