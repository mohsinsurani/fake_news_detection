{"url": "https://people.com/music/wade-robson-michael-jackson-lawsuit-dismissed/", "text": "A California judge ruled that Michael Jackson\u2019s estate and the companies it controls are not liable for the King of Pop\u2019s alleged childhood sexual abuse of celebrity choreographer Wade Robson.\n\nRobson first sued in 2013, claiming that Jackson abused him for nearly a decade. He later said in an amended complaint to his 2013 lawsuit that MJJ Productions, the late musician\u2019s entertainment company, and MJJ Ventures were operations \u201cspecifically designed to locate, attract, lure and seduce child sexual abuse victims.\u201d A probate court in 2015 rejected his claim against the estate itself, which left the two business entities as defendants.\n\nJudge Mitchell L. Beckloff ruled on Tuesday that MJJ Productions and MJJ Ventures were not liable for Robson\u2019s exposure to Jackson as \u201cno one other than Michael Jackson had the legal ability or authority to control Michael Jackson.\u201d He did not rule on the credibility of the allegations themselves.\n\n\u201cAs demonstrated by the defendants, Neverland Valley Ranch, where some of the abuse is alleged to have occurred, was owned by Michael Jackson, not either of the corporate defendants,\u201d Beckloff said. \u201cSimilarly, Michael Jackson in his individual capacity owned the apartments where other abuse is alleged to have occurred.\u201d\n\nBeckloff also noted that the complaint wasn\u2019t filed within the statute of limitations.\n\n\u201cThere is no dispute plaintiff brought this action well after his 26th birthday,\u201d said Beckloff. \u201cToday plaintiff is 35 years old, he was 30 years old when he filed this action four years too late, and his action is barred by the statute of limitations.\u201d\n\nAttorney for Jackson\u2019s estate, Howard Weitzman, hailed the ruling in a statement: \u201cThe Estate of Michael Jackson believes the court made the correct decision in dismissing Wade Robson\u2019s claim against it. In my opinion Mr. Robson\u2019s allegations, made 20 plus years after they supposedly occurred and years after Mr. Robson testified twice under oath \u2014 including in front of a jury \u2014 that Michael Jackson had never done anything wrong to him were always about the money rather than a search for the truth.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Choreographer Wade Robson Claims Michael Jackson Ran the \u2018Most Sophisticated Child Sexual Abuse\u2019 Operation in History in New Complaint\n\nRobson said he first met Jackson when he was 5 years old after winning a competition run by MJJ Productions in his native Australia. Two years later, his family was invited to stay at the King of Pop\u2019s Neverland Ranch home in California, where he slept in Jackson\u2019s bed and said he was first sexually abused by him.\n\nThe choreographer claimed the abuse continued for seven years and ended only when he \u201cbegan showing signs of puberty\u201d and Jackson was \u201cno longer as interested in him sexually.\u201d\n\nRobson had previously appeared as a witness for Jackson\u2019s defense during a separate sexual abuse trial in 2005 in which the pop star was acquitted of child molestation charges.\n\nRobson did not immediately return request for comment on the ruling.", "images":
