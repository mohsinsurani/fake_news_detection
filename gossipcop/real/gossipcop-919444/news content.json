When the day arrived, Kylie chose to have just her mom Kris Jenner and sister Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian in the delivery room with her, in addition to Scott. And while the other sisters may have been disappointed to be left out, they were mostly relieved that they wouldn\u2019t be blamed if the secret got out. (Though PEOPLE first confirmed the news of the baby on the way in September 2017, Kylie, 21, didn\u2019t publicly address it until after she gave birth.)\n\n\u201cKylie is about to have her baby and it\u2019s pretty crazy that it really hasn\u2019t been confirmed,\u201d said Kourtney, 39. \u201cSo I don\u2019t want to be the one with the info, or getting blamed for someone finding out the secret.\u201d\n\nKim, 37, marveled that her little sister had some amazing friends for having kept the news under wraps all those months.\n\n\u201cCan you believe that Kylie got out of the hospital with not one report?\u201d she said. \u201cNow Caitlyn [Jenner] can never say we have big mouths and we leak everything. We kept that a secret!\u201d\n\nMomager Kris, 62, admitted keeping a lid on the news wasn\u2019t easy.\n\n\u201cThat was a lot of anxiety for me,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople were saying, \u2018We\u2019re going to post, we\u2019re going to announce,\u2019 and I\u2019m like, \u2018No!\u2019 But she did it perfectly and it was such a positive experience for her.\u201d\n\n\u201cTotally,\u201d Kim said. \u201cEveryone was just like, \u2018Okay, we get it. We get why you kept it private.\u2019 \u2026 Kylie\u2019s always wanted to be a mom, so this is really exciting for her. She just didn\u2019t want anyone changing her happy moment and her happy pregnancy, so I\u2019m really proud of her that she stuck to her guns and was able to tell her story her way.\u201d\n\nVivien Killilea/Getty\n\nAnd Kylie, who said she was \u201creally doing this for myself,\u201d said the experience couldn\u2019t have gone any better.\n\n\u201cI like [pregnancy,]\u201d she said. \u201cI miss it. I had the easiest pregnancy ever. You never feel alone \u2014 I was really sad to not be pregnant anymore.\u201d\n\nAt the end of the day, no one was more proud than Kris, who delivered the baby herself.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s only been a couple of days since Kylie had baby Stormi, and I can already tell that Kylie is going to be the most amazing mom and is so in love with her baby,\u201d she gushed.\n\nBut at the same time, the momager was going through a challenging time with a different daughter.\n\n\u201cMy relationship with Kourtney over the years has been kind of fabulous, but lately there\u2019s definitely a shift,\u201d she said. \u201cI really don\u2019t know where this is coming from and it makes me really, really sad. I just wish she would make an effort to treat me the way I would love to be treated. I love her so much. She\u2019s my firstborn daughter.\u201d\n\nAs it turned out, the tension had started bubbling up after Kourtney\u2019s therapist apparently informed her that she has an \u201cissue with betrayal\u201d because Kris cheated on her father, the late Robert Kardashian Sr., with soccer player Todd Waterman.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Kris Jenner Calls Cheating on Husband Robert Kardashian \u2018One of My Biggest Regrets in Life\u2019\n\n\u201cLately, in therapy, a lot of topics that have been coming up are about childhood issues and how that affects so many of my relationships today,\u201d she said. \u201cIf I had a problem, I wouldn\u2019t go to [Kris], ever. I would go to Dad. She was not my person that I found comforting.\u201d\n\nBut Kris said Kourtney was \u201cdoted on\u201d as a child.\n\n\u201cI think she\u2019s going through a phase in life where she has some anger inside that I don\u2019t quite understand,\u201d she said. \u201cI wish her dad was around to say, \u2018You\u2019ve had the best most magical childhood of any child, ever.\u2019 That\u2019s what we prided ourselves on.\u201d\n\n\u201cShe probably felt like she was always picking a side and it was always my dad\u2019s,\u201d remarked Khlo\u00e9, 34. \u201cIn the divorce, she picked his. In the [O.J. Simpson] trial, she picked his. She wanted to live there over your house. She\u2019s always picked his.\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 said she wished her sister would communicate her feelings more openly with the family.\n\n\u201cI know Kourtney, for some reason, finds more comfort in talking to a stranger about family stuff, rather than talking to the source,\u201d she said. \u201cI would be fine with that if Kourtney took whatever her therapist talked about and then came to the source, but that\u2019s the part we\u2019re missing and that\u2019s what\u2019s frustrating to us all, because we never resolve something or work through something or just even fight about something if we don\u2019t know what\u2019s going on. It\u2019s always us pulling teeth and guessing with her.\u201d\n\nEventually, Kourtney decided she had to talk things through with Kris.\n\n\u201cIf my going to therapy and figuring this all out is making me resentful towards my mom, which is not how I want to feel and it\u2019s not how I want to treat her, then I feel like it is worth having a conversation with her, just to let her know that\u2019s not my intention,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s really about me working on myself.\u201d\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve gone through a phase of being more sensitive to things,\u201d she admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s nothing bad, it\u2019s just understanding and then understanding how that affects our current relationships. Like, if there\u2019s certain behavior that Younes [Bendjima] will do that\u2019s similar to things that my mom would do, just subconsciously, it will just bring up similar issues. There is that uncomfortable place when you are growing, but I think it\u2019s something that I have to just deal with myself.\u201d\n\nSitting down with her mom, Kourtney did her best to explain where she was coming from.\n\n\u201cAs you know, I\u2019ve been gong to therapy lately and my therapist says your intimate relationships bring up childhood issues,\u201d she said. \u201cI just don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair if I\u2019m not communicating it. I don\u2019t want to go back in time \u2026 I feel like it has passed and I\u2019m not feeling that way anymore, but I just wanted to explain that to you so you understand where it\u2019s coming from.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat we usually do as a family is we criticize each other, we\u2019re judgmental and we give each other an attitude and we\u2019re bitchy,\u201d she added. \u201cSo moving forward in life, I\u2019ve made a point with my sisters already to not accept that anymore.\u201d\n\nTearing up, Kris said all she wanted was \u201cthe best, most joyful, peaceful life\u201d for her daughter.\n\n\u201cWhatever it takes for me to be part of that, that\u2019s all I want,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s the joy of my life, is you guys. I have nothing else. I never want you to be disappointed in me, so if there\u2019s something you want to say or something that you need to have me work on, I\u2019m 100 percent ready to work on it because I love you so much. You\u2019re my firstborn and I wouldn\u2019t trade that for anything.\u201d\n\nThe two of them hugged it out, and Kourtney agreed to work on things, too.\n\n\u201cMoving forward, I\u2019m going to tell you if I don\u2019t like something or if something is hurtful, instead of just being a bitch about it,\u201d she promised.\n\n\u201cI think Kourtney and I have gotten through that rough patch and started a healing process,\u201d said Kris. \u201cThat\u2019s a really big step in the right direction, especially for her. She\u2019s always going to hang onto the past a little bit, but what I am hopeful for is that we can look forward to an amazing future together because I love her more than anything.\u201d\n\nKeeping
