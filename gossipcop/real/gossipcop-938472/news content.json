Pete Davidson returned to Instagram on Wednesday, November 28, nearly two months after calling off his engagement to Ariana Grande.\n\n\u201cSee you at sundance muthaf\u2014kas,\u201d Davidson 25, wrote alongside photos of himself with costars in his upcoming film, Big Time Adolescence.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live comedian made headlines in October for wiping his Instagram account clean days after he and Grande, 25, ended their four-month engagement, according to Daily Mail.\n\nDavidson previously deleted his page in July, telling fans via his Story that there wasn\u2019t anything \u201ccryptic\u201d about his decision, he just didn\u2019t \u201cwant to be on Instagram anymore. or on any social media platform.\u201d\n\nHowever, the Set It Up star returned to Instagram two months later with a video of himself filming paparazzi. \u201cHey, how are you? How are you guys doing? You guys look great,\u201d he said in the clip. \u201cOh, welcome home.\u201d\n\nAlthough Davidson hasn\u2019t turned to social media to address his breakup from the \u201cThank U, Next\u201d songstress, he\u2019s been open with fans during recent episodes of SNL. Earlier this month, Davidson praised his ex as \u201ca wonderful, strong person.\u201d\n\nGrande and Davidson\u2019s whirlwind romance hit a rough patch in September following her ex-boyfriend Mac Miller\u2019s death. A source exclusively told Us Weekly in October that Davidson \u201cwas 1000 percent there\u201d for the \u201cNo Tears Left to Cry\u201d crooner, but a second insider noted that Miller\u2019s passing \u201cput a tremendous amount of strain\u201d on the relationship.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pete-Davidson-returns-to-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1574px%2C890px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pete-Davidson-returns-to-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1574px%2C827px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pete-Davidson-returns-to-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1574px%2C827px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emily Marcus"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pete-davidson-returns-to-instagram-after-ariana-grande-split/", "title": "Pete Davidson Returns to Instagram After Ariana Grande Split", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Splits", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Pete Davidson returned to Instagram on Wednesday, November 28, after wiping his page clean in October following his split from Ariana Grande \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Pete Davidson Returns to Instagram Two Months After Ariana Grande Split", "description": "Pete Davidson returned to Instagram on Wednesday, November 28, after wiping his page clean in October following his split from Ariana Grande \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/pete-davidson-returns-to-instagram-after-ariana-grande-split/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T21:56:51+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pete-Davidson-returns-to-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1574px%2C827px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pete-Davidson-returns-to-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1574px%2C827px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-11-28T22:30:01+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T21:56:51+00:00"}, "author": "Emily Marcus", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Pete Davidson Returns to Instagram Two Months After Ariana Grande Split", "description": "Pete Davidson returned to Instagram on Wednesday, November 28, after wiping his page clean in October following his split from Ariana Grande \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Pete-Davidson-returns-to-instagram.jpg?crop=0px%2C12px%2C1574px%2C827px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543444201.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
