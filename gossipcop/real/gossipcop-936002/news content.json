really lucky because not many people get to sing at such a special event,\" he said.\n\n\"I've got a bit of nerves but that's all right because we're confident.\"\n\nThe boys, from St George's School in the grounds of Windsor Castle, sing in up to eight services a week.\n\nThe Choir of St George's Chapel was founded in 1348 and is made up of 23 choristers from St George's School, and 12 lay clerks singing alto, tenor and bass.\n\nLay clerks - adult professional singers - live with their families in the Horseshoe Cloister, just to the west of the Chapel.\n\nThe very youngest choristers are probationers and do not sing at all services and will not be singing at the royal wedding.", "images":
