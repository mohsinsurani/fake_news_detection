It is the show's first season to air on ABC, and after 15 years on Fox, Ryan Seacrest continued his role as the show's host, while Katy Perry, Luke Bryan, and Lionel Richie joined as judges. Maddie Poppe from Clarksville, Iowa won the season on May 21, 2018, while Caleb Lee Hutchinson was the runner-up,[1] and Gabby Barrett finished in third place. Poppe was the first female winner since Candice Glover in season twelve.\n\nBackground [ edit ]\n\nIn early 2017, Variety reported that FremantleMedia was in talks to revive the show for NBC or for its original network, Fox.[2] A dispute between Fremantle and Core Media Group derailed these plans.[3] Then, in May 2017, it was announced that ABC was making a bid to revive the program.[4] Later, ABC announced that it had acquired the rights to the series, and that American Idol would return for the 2017\u201318 television season.[5][6] On November 6, 2017, it was announced that the revival season would premiere on March 11, 2018.[7]\n\nOn July 20, 2017, it was announced on Live with Kelly and Ryan, that Ryan Seacrest would be returning as the host for the revival season.[8] On May 16, 2017, Katy Perry was the first judge to be announced by ABC.[9] On September 24, 2017, Luke Bryan was the second judge to be announced for the revival season.[10] On September 29, 2017, Lionel Richie was the third and final judge to be announced.[11] On February 21, 2018, it was announced that iHeartRadio radio personality Bobby Bones would be the mentor for the Top 24 this season.[12]\n\nOn April 23, 2018, ABC announced that the April 29, May 6, and May 13 live shows of the season would air across all mainland U.S. time zones, a first for American Idol.[13] Radio Disney also broadcast its first season of American Idol Insider.[citation needed]\n\nRegional auditions [ edit ]\n\nIn June 2017, it was announced that American Idol would begin two bus tours in 19 cities, later increased to 22, for audition starting August 17, 2017.[14][15] Those who passed their first audition would go in front of the producers where they would be selected to appear before the judges in different cities. Instead of focusing on a city in each aired episode as in previous seasons, this season each episode showed a compilations of auditions from different cities.[16]\n\nDuring the live broadcast of the 2017 American Music Awards, three contestants who did not pass the audition in front of the judges were given one more chance to allow the public to vote for them.[20] The three candidates were Maris, Britney Holmes and Dominique Smith. The winner of the golden ticket to Hollywood was then revealed the following night on an episode of Dancing with the Stars. Lionel Richie appeared in the show announcing that the public vote was in favor of Britney Holmes, a 28-year-old vocal coach from Texas, who is headed to Hollywood as the first declared semifinalist of the season.[21]\n\nHollywood Week [ edit ]\n\nHollywood Week aired over two episodes on March 26 and April 1. It featured three rounds: Lines of 10, Group Round, and Solo Round. In the first round, each contestant sang individually, and after ten sang, they gathered in a line. Those who impressed the judges and the producers advanced to the next round where the contestants performed in groups of four or five, singing a song together.[22] The remaining auditionees who passed the group rounds performed their final solos to advance in the Showcase Round.\n\nShowcase Round [ edit ]\n\nThe Showcase Round aired on April 2, which featured the top 50 performing for the judges and a live audience at Exchange LA, a nightclub in Los Angeles. The following day, the judges narrowed the number of contestants down from 50 to 24 in the Final Judgement. The top 24 contestants then moved on to perform solos and celebrity duets.[23][24][25]\n\nThe following is a list of the contestants who reached the Top 24 and the song they performed at the Showcase:\n\nColor key:\n\nFemale contestant Male contestant\n\nTop 24 [ edit ]\n\nThe Top 24 contestants were split into two groups of twelve.

On the following day each week, prerecorded performances of each contestant's duet aired, as did the judges' selection of seven contestants from each group to advance to the Top 14. Idol contestants were paired with celebrity singers as their duet partners.
