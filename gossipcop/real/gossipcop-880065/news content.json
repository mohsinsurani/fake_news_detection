Betty & Veronica Mirror Serena & Blair\n\n\n\nBetty (Lili Reinhart) and Veronica (Camila Mendes)\u2019s friendship might not have the same baked-in rivalry, but it nonetheless bears close resemblance to Serena (Blake Lively) and Blair (Leighton Meester)\u2019s yin-yang bond.\n\nBlair and Veronica are both mouthy, well-to-do brunettes with a knack for scheming. Betty and Serena are untethered blondes nursing some darker impulses\u2014Serena with her struggles with drugs and alcohol, and Betty with\u2026 well, whatever is going on with Betty. She might be taking a little longer to fall into a full Serena spiral, but we\u2019ve already begun to see her prudence wane: remember that Serpent striptease?\n\n2. There\u2019s a Distinct Upstairs, Downstairs Culture\n\nThe battle between the Northside and Southside is a good stand-in for the divide between Blair\u2019s Upper East Side kingdom and Dan\u2019s Brooklyn sanctuary.\n\n3. Cheryl Parallels Georgina\n\nIt might initially be tempting to liken Cheryl (Madelaine Petsch) to Blair, but she most closely parallels Georgina (Michelle Trachtenberg). They\u2019re both supporting characters whose main function is to stir the pot. Plus, both serve as foils for the series\u2019 brunette leads (Veronica and Blair, respectively).\n\n4. Dan and Jughead Are Essentially the Same Character\n\nTwo outsiders quietly chronicling the salacious details of their towns? Sure, Jughead (Cole Sprouse)\u2019s novel may not be the spectacle that is Gossip Girl\u2019s blog, but the connection stands.\n\n5. Archie and Nate Are Also Pretty Darn Close\n\n\n\nArchie (K.J. Apa) and Nate (Chace Crawford) are both slightly naive, but they\u2019re still stand-up guys trying to do the right thing while navigating various romantic entanglements. In fact, they\u2019re literally both called \u2018Archibald,\u2019 and end up in love triangles between their series\u2019 main female characters (Veronica and Betty, Serena and Blair).\n\n6. And While We\u2019re at It, so Are Nick and Chuck\n\n\n\nLet\u2019s not forget that Chuck (Ed Westwick) also started off as a pretty deplorable rich dude who tried to take advantage of women at parties\u2014in his case, Jenny Humphrey (Taylor Momsen). In Nick (Graham Phillips)\u2019s case, it was Veronica and Cheryl.\n\n7. And Eric and Kevin\u2026\n\nTwo white, gay men who are just kind of there. Eric (Connor Paolo) is Serena\u2019s brother, and Kevin (Casey Cott) is Betty\u2019s best friend.\n\n8. Plus, There\u2019s an Incest Storyline\n\n\n\nPolly (Tiera Skovbye) and Jason (Trevor Stines) start up a passionate romance on Riverdale, only for Polly to later discover they\u2019re actually third cousins. On Gossip Girl, Dan eventually marries Serena, his one-time step sister with whom he shares a half brother.\n\n9. And Let\u2019s Not Even Get Started on the Parents\n\n\n\nMuch like Nate\u2019s dad, Howard (Sam Robards), Hiram (Mark Consuelos) is a once-successful businessman sent to prison for his criminal dealings. Meanwhile, high school sweethearts Hermione (Marisol Nichols) and Fred (Luke Perry) are fighting some still lingering feelings just as their kids are falling in love. Rufus (Matthew Settle) and Lily (Kelly Rutherford), anyone?\n\nSo, there you have it. Riverdale is basically a suburban Gossip Girl dressed up with some neo-noir mystery. XOXO.\n\nRiverdale, Wednesdays, 8/7c, The CW", "images": ["https://www.tvinsider.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/tvi-white.png", "https://ntvb.tmsimg.com/assets/p185575_b_h10_ad.jpg?w=240&h=135",
