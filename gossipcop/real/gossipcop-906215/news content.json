But it was reported by CNBC that \"Michelle Williams was paid an $80 per diem totaling less than $1,000\" while Wahlberg was paid $1.5 million. Williams never publicly confirmed her fee, but has spoken out about Wahlberg's donation.\n\n\"Today isn\u2019t about me. My fellow actresses stood by me and stood up for me, my activist friends taught me to use my voice, and the most powerful men in charge, they listened and they acted. If we truly envision an equal world, it takes equal effort and sacrifice,\" Williams said in a statement to ELLE.com. \"Today is one of the most indelible days of my life because of Mark Wahlberg, WME and a community of women and men who share in this accomplishment. Anthony Rapp, for all the shoulders you stood on, now we stand on yours.\"\n\nWME, the agency that represents Wahlberg, Williams, and the movie's director Ridley Scott, agreed to pledge an additional $500,000 to Time's Up.\n\nThe Time's Up Legal Defense Fund combats harassment and pay inequities in Hollywood and other industries.", "images":
