We found ourselves saying to each other, 'Can you imagine if the world really knew the stupid things we say?'\"\n\nIt's not too hard to imagine the two A-list actors gabbing about their normal Hollywood lives, especially since they're the only two people who really know what it was like working and growing under the shadow of pop culture juggernaut Titanic. So it also totally makes sense that the two still joke about the film between themselves:\n\n\"I\u2019m not going to tell you what we actually talk about, but yeah, we\u2019re very, very close and sometimes we do quote the odd Titanic line back and forth to each other, because only we can, and we find it really funny.\"\n\n#NoNewFriends, clearly. But if Kate and Leo ever want a third party to listen to their Titanic jokes, there are definitely quite a few people who'd happily step into that role.\n\nFollow Lilian on Twitter.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0123xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0123xh&resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0123xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lilian Min", "I'M The Night Shift At Cosmopolitan.Com", "A Writer", "Reporter Around The Web."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a12100820/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-titanic-quotes/", "title": "Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio Still Quote Titanic Lines To Each Other, NBD", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio Still Quote \"Titanic\" Lines To Each Other, NBD", "description": "Just like in your fanfic.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a12100820/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-titanic-quotes/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0123xh&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2021-11-01T23:23:36Z", "published_time": "2017-08-26T21:20:00Z", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0123xh&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio Still Quote Titanic Lines To Each Other, NBD", "description": "Just like in your fanfic.", "keywords": "Kate Winslet, Leo DiCaprio, Leonardo DiCaprio, Titanic, kate and leo, leo and kate, titanic kate and leo", "auto-publish": "timely", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=0.666xw:1.00xh;0.145xw,0&resize=320:*", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "sailthru.contenttype": "standard-article", "sailthru.tags": "Celebrities & Entertainment,entertainment,celebs,Titanic,Leo DiCaprio,Kate Winslet,Leonardo Dicaprio", "sailthru.date": "2017-08-26T21:20:00Z", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.752xh;0,0.0123xh", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/kate-winslet-leo-dicaprio-1503778136.jpg?crop=0.666xw:1.00xh;0.145xw,0", "sailthru.socialtitle": "Kate Winslet and Leo DiCaprio Still Quote \"Titanic\" Lines To Each Other, NBD", "m1": ".content-hed", "m2": ".content-dek p"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503782400.0, "source": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com", "summary": ""}
