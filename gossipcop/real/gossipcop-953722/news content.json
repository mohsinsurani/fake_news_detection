She is young, but at least mature enough to realize this wasn\u2019t the right relationship or the right time to get married,\u201d an insider says.\n\n\u201c[Her loved ones] always thought the engagement to Pete happened way too quickly. They didn\u2019t want her to get married to Pete. And Ariana never got to the wedding planning stage. It was all way too soon,\u201d the insider shares.\n\nThe Saturday Night Live star, 24, proposed to the pop star, 25, in June just weeks after they began dating following Grande\u2019s May breakup from rapper Mac Miller, who died in September of a suspected overdose.\n\nAmanda Friedman\n\nFor all the details on how Ariana Grande and Pete Davidson are coping after their split, pick up the latest issue of PEOPLE, on newsstands Friday.\n\n\u201cAriana has had several stressful situations in the past couple of years. She really isn\u2019t in a position to make huge life decisions. Her family thinks she should just focus on work and not stress about other stuff,\u201d the insider says.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Mac Miller\u2019s Death Had a \u2018Huge Impact\u2019 on Ariana Grande and \u2018Made Her Rethink Her Life\u2019: Source\n\nIn addition to giving back her 3-carat, $93K engagement ring, Grande is no longer living with Davidson.\n\n\u201cPete\u2019s no longer at the house because why would he be? They broke up. He has no reason to go there,\u201d says another insider. \u201cEveryone on both sides are relieved it\u2019s over.\u201d\n\nPaul Zimmerman/WireImage\n\nAdds the source: \u201cPete has moved out. They are in contact, but not dating. Ariana is doing pretty well. Actually much better than expected.\u201d\n\nDavidson joked about his new living situation when he made his first public appearance since the pair\u2019s split at a comedy benefit on Saturday in West Hollywood, California.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on,\u201d he said, before jokingly alluding to his breakup by asking the crowd, \u201cDoes anybody have any open rooms? Looking for a roommate?\u201d", "images":
