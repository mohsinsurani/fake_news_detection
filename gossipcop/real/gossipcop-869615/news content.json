Nonetheless, several celebrity activists including Caitlyn Jenner, Laverne Cox, George Takei, Ellen DeGeneres and more responded to his plan, calling it \u201churtful, baseless and wrong.\u201d\n\nJimmy Fallon invited transgender comedian Patti Harrison on NBC\u2019s The Tonight Show to share her thoughts.\n\n\u201cAs a trans person, it\u2019s hard to articulate exactly how I feel,\u201d said Harrison. \u201cBut I guess if I had to describe it, I\u2019d say, \u2018Donald, you are so stupid. You are so stupid.'\u201d She added: \u201cI don\u2019t even think Trump knows what transgender means \u2014 he probably thinks transgender people are those cars that turn into robots.\u201d\n\nHer final thoughts: \u201cTrump says transgender people in the military would be a tremendous disruption. And I get it. If you constantly draw attention to yourself, spend all day distracting everyone and cost taxpayers millions of dollars, the perfect job for you isn\u2019t the military, it\u2019s the president of the United States.\u201d\n\nJames Corden turned to music on CBS\u2019 Late Late Show to criticize Trump\u2019s announcement. He sang a parody of the song \u201cL-O-V-E\u201d with the letters \u201cLGBT.\u201d\n\n\u201cB to his dumb knowledge is just a phase in college, T he finds confusing so the Army\u2019s now refusing, trans women who only want to serve, trans men who want rights we all deserve,\u201d sang Corden. He added, \u201cTrump\u2019s got hate for me and you.\u201d\n\n\u201cHow is their disruption worse than Trump\u2019s corruption, why\u2019s it such a crisis, thousands willing to fight ISIS,\u201d Corden continued in his tuxedo and tophat. \u201cLGBT we love all of you,\u201d he sang, waving a rainbow flag.\n\nCorden also spoke about the ban in his monologue saying that usually when Trump \u201cwants to keep someone out of military service he just fakes a doctor\u2019s note saying he has a foot injury.\u201d He added, \u201cWorked fine for him during Vietnam.\u201d\n\nEarlier on CBS, Late Show host Stephen Colbert came to the conclusion that the president is \u201creally off his meds.\u201d\n\n\u201cToday, he went from crazy to cruel,\u201d Colbert said, reading Trump\u2019s tweets announcing a transgender military ban, which ended in \u201cthank you.\u201d\n\n\u201cThank you? Fuck you,\u201d responded Colbert, to loud applause from his audience.\n\nColbert also took the liberty of editing Trump\u2019s tweet to reflect Trump\u2019s true feelings.\n\nSamantha Bee shared a similar (word-for-word) sentiment on TBS\u2019 Full Frontal for Trump\u2019s sign-off in his tweet. \u201cThank you? Fuck you,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cFiring thousands of active-duty service members during the big push against ISIS is Trump\u2019s version of \u2018don\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell.\u2019 He didn\u2019t ask anyone if it was a good idea and didn\u2019t tell anyone he was doing it,\u201d said Bee.\n\nThe Daily Show\u2019s Trevor Noah broke down Trump\u2019s tweets, as well as his history with the LGBTQ community (and his history of forgetting parts of the acronym).\n\n\u201cJust so we\u2019re on the same page,\u201d the Comedy Central late-night host said, \u201cTransgender-related military expenses for the military cost at most $8 million per year \u2026 In contrast, taxpayers will be paying $60 million per year just for Trump to visit his own properties like Mar-a-Lago. And that\u2019s before he orders dessert.\u201d\n\nNoah had two transgender military veterans on his show to speak about the ban. \u201cThe past administration made a lot of strides in order to lift this ban,\u201d said Joey Whimple. He said individuals felt \u201cthat safety net to come out\u201d and now the \u201ccarpet is being completely pulled out from underneath\u201d leaving a question of uncertainty.\n\nOn NBC\u2019s Late Night With Seth Meyers, the host turned it over to four of his female writers for reactions.\n\n\u201cPresident Trump, you just requested a $600 billion military budget,\u201d said writer Amber Ruffin. \u201cYou think you can\u2019t afford health care for trans people? The military spends $41 million a year on Viagra. What are you guys doing, screwing the enemy to death?\u201d\n\nReferencing a recent tweet by Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, in which she wrote she was \u201cproud to support my LGBT friends,\u201d the writers tossed it over to the \u201cdaughter to the president and world-renowned entrepreneur\u201d \u2014 only to show an empty podium at the White House. The gag was repeated later with footage of a tumbleweed crossing a desolate road and a lone wolf howling in a snowy field. \u201cShe\u2019s just stuck in traffic,\u201d noted the writers.\n\nChelsea Handler previewed Friday\u2019s episode of her Netflix show with a message to the transgender community: \u201cI\u2019m sorry a man that has never served in the military a day in his life is denying you the right to serve your country. Thank you for your service and thank you for your bravery. And to the members of the Republican party who continue to choose party over politics, grow a fucking spine!\u201d", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/stephen_colbert_chelsea_handler_trevor_noah_split_0.jpg?w=1024", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/stephen_colbert_chelsea_handler_trevor_noah_split_0.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Konerman Patrick Shanley Lorena O'Neil", "Jennifer Konerman", "Patrick Shanley", "Lorena O'Neil"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/late-night-hosts-slam-trump-plan-transgender-military-ban-donald-you-are-stupid-1024606/", "title": "Late-Night Hosts Slam Trump Over Plan for Transgender Military Ban: \u201cDonald, You Are So Stupid\u201d", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Jimmy Fallon featured transgender comedian Patti Harrison on 'The Tonight Show,' who shared her perspective: \"I don't even think Trump knows what transgender means \u2014 he probably thinks transgender people are those cars that turn into robots.\"", "news_keywords": "Chelsea Handler, donald trump, Full Frontal with Samantha Bee, James Corden, Jimmy Fallon, Late-Night TV, LGBTQ, Samantha Bee, Stephen Colbert, The Daily Show with Trevor Noah", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lorena O'Neil", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1024606, "title": "Late-Night Hosts Slam Trump Over Plan for Transgender Military Ban: \"Donald, You Are So Stupid\"", "published_at": "2017-07-26 18:42:34", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/stephen_colbert_chelsea_handler_trevor_noah_split_0.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Trevor Noah", "topics": "News", "body": "President Donald Trump was criticized on Wednesday for his decision to ban transgender people from serving in the U.S. military.\u00a0\r\nLate-night hosts joined activists, politicians, journalists and military members on Wednesday night in their criticism over Trump's plan, which he announced through a series of tweets\u00a0earlier in the day.\u00a0\r\nTrump tweeted that the U.S. government \"will not accept or allow\" transgender people to serve \"in any capacity\" in the military. \"Our military must be focused on decisive and overwhelming victory,\" he wrote. \"And cannot be burdened with the tremendous medical costs and disruption that transgender in the military would entail.\"\r\nLater during the White House press briefing, Sarah Huckabee Sanders said that Trump's plan was a \"military decision,\" adding that Trump's national security advisers helped him to make the decision.\u00a0\r\nTrump didn't elaborate what would happen under his plan to the transgender people currently serving in the military, nor did he explain how he plans to implement such a ban.
