On Thursday, the eve of fall, the coffee shop introduced a new seasonal drink as counterprogramming: the maple pecan latte. Soon we\u2019ll be calling it the MPL, I guess.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nHere\u2019s how the company describes the drink: \u201cInspired by classic fall flavors and the iconic changing leaves of the season, the Maple Pecan Latte features warming notes of maple syrup, pecan and brown butter, perfectly highlighting the heart and soul of Starbucks beverages \u2014 our signature espresso.\u201d There are also new seasonal cups in fall colors.\n\nMaple is having a moment right now. Earlier this month, Market Watch predicted that it could usurp pumpkin spice to become the predominant flavor of fall. Maple is \u201cup about 85 percent in nonalcoholic beverages between the second quarter of 2016 and the second quarter of 2017, according to the Technomic MenuMonitor, and up 14.6 percent in alcoholic beverages for that period,\u201d wrote Tonya Garcia.\n\nAs with many of Starbucks\u2019 other new menu additions, maple lattes were making the rounds on independent coffee shop menus well before Starbucks picked up the recipe. Locally, it has appeared on Compass Coffee\u2018s menu, as well as at other national chains, like Peet\u2019s. It\u2019s not the first time Starbucks has put maple on its menu, either: There used to be a maple macchiato, but it was phased out nationally in the U.S. in 2012. And one of their biggest competitors is pushing maple this fall, too. Dunkin\u2019 Donuts is serving maple pecan lattes, as well as a maple sugar bacon breakfast sandwich. McDonald\u2019s seems sure to follow: They already debuted a maple caramel latte in \u2014 naturally \u2014 Canada.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThere\u2019s a certain disconnect to maple\u2019s new status as an autumnal beverage, because maple syrup is harvested in the spring \u2014 usually between March and April. Still, it makes sense, because we gravitate toward heavier flavors and foods when it begins to get cold. But is maple the antidote to our pumpkin spice madness? That depends on how many other types of products adopt the flavor \u2014 and whether it triggers a similar backlash. Maple has a head start in breakfast items like oatmeal and, obviously, waffles. But Food Dive points out that it\u2019s beginning to get the pumpkin spice treatment, showing up in items like cheese, vodka and protein bars. Further search revealed maple dog treats and candles and perfume, for anyone who would like their pet\u2019s breath, their home and their body to smell like pancakes. It doesn\u2019t work quite as well on a T-shirt as pumpkin spice does, mostly because it only rhymes with the word \u201cstaple.\u201d\n\nIn a few years, we\u2019ll probably roll our eyes at the thought of another season of maple pecan lattes. For now, though, we welcome any threat to the stranglehold that pumpkin spice has staked on our fall foods. Long live the MPL, until it, too, becomes the choice beverage of the basics.\n\nMore from Food:\n\nGiftOutline Gift Article", "images": ["https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/09/Maple-Pecan-1.jpg&w=1440"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=http://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp-content/uploads/sites/6/2017/09/Maple-Pecan-1.jpg&w=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maura Judkis"], "canonical_link": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/food/wp/2017/09/21/move-aside-pumpkin-spice-latte-the-maple-pecan-latte-is-here-to-steal-the-starbucks-spotlight/", "title": "Move aside, pumpkin spice latte.
