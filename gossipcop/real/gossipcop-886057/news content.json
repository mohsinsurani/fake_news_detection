Mr. Weinstein has further confirmed that there were never any acts of retaliation against any women for refusing his advances. He will not be available for further comments, as he is taking the time to focus on his family, on getting counseling and rebuilding his life.\u201d\n\nEven in an industry in which sexual harassment has long persisted, Mr. Weinstein stands out, according to the actresses and current and former employees of the film companies he ran, Miramax and the Weinstein Company. He had an elaborate system reliant on the cooperation of others: Assistants often booked the meetings, arranged the hotel rooms and sometimes even delivered the talent, then disappeared, the actresses and employees recounted. They described how some of Mr. Weinstein\u2019s executives and assistants then found them agents and jobs or hushed actresses who were upset.\n\nHis alleged behavior became something of a Hollywood open secret: When the comedian Seth MacFarlane announced Oscar nominees in 2013, he joked, \u201cCongratulations, you five ladies no longer have to pretend to be attracted to Harvey Weinstein.\u201d The audience laughed. According to a 2015 memo by a former Weinstein Company executive that The Times previously disclosed, the misconduct continued.\n\nMore established actresses were fearful of speaking out because they had work; less established ones were scared because they did not. \u201cThis is Harvey Weinstein,\u201d Katherine Kendall, who appeared in the film \u201cSwingers\u201d and television roles, remembers telling herself after an encounter in which she said Mr. Weinstein undressed and chased her around a living room. Telling others meant \u201cI\u2019ll never work again and no one is going to care or believe me,\u201d she reasoned at the time, she said in a recent interview.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/11/us/00Actresses1/00Actresses1-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/11/us/00Actresses4/00Actresses4-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jodi Kantor", "Rachel Abrams"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Others Say Weinstein Harassed Them", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "\u201cThis way of treating women ends now,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said as she and other actresses accused the producer of casting-couch abuses.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "type": "article", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Others Say Weinstein Harassed Them (Published 2017)", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "description": "\u201cThis way of treating women ends now,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said as she and other actresses accused the producer of casting-couch abuses."}, "twitter": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "title": "Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie and Others Say Weinstein Harassed Them (Published 2017)", "description": "\u201cThis way of treating women ends now,\u201d Ms. Paltrow said as she and other actresses accused the producer of casting-couch abuses.", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-videoSixteenByNineJumbo1600-v10.jpg?year=2017&h=900&w=1600&s=ec4882dbcdb8e4e08a0fce2ff69e0f8844bff4f1d1945f420113ff3c4f9cbb24&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN&tw=1", "card": "summary_large_image", "app": {"name": {"googleplay": "NYTimes"}, "id": {"googleplay": "com.nytimes.android"}, "url": {"googleplay": "nyt://article/bfb87e8e-14e4-5cef-96b1-ad6966944c78"}}, "site": "@nytimes"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-10-10T17:02:43.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-10-12T17:48:03.000Z", "section": "U.S.", "author": "http://www.nytimes.com/by/rachel-abrams", "tag": "Dunning, Dawn", "opinion": "false", "content_tier": "metered"}, "articleid": 100000005486212, "nyt_uri": "nyt://article/bfb87e8e-14e4-5cef-96b1-ad6966944c78", "pubp_event_id": "pubp://event/c6b45f014a864672a29bf4f2d55b6b99", "image": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/10/10/us/10actress-alpha/10actress-alpha-facebookJumbo-v4.jpg?year=2017&h=700&w=1050&s=aaa40c15fa316ce4c22178c05d78b78e31d739922d0b36721e724f259e7f58fe&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "byl": "By Jodi Kantor and Rachel Abrams", "news_keywords": "Harvey Weinstein,Sexual harassment,Movies,Actor,Gwyneth Paltrow,Angelina Jolie,Tomi-Ann Roberts,Rosanna Arquette,Katherine Kendall,Judith Godr\u00e8che,Dawn Dunning", "pdate": 20171010, "CG": "us", "PT": "article", "PST": "News", "url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "msapplication-starturl": "https://www.nytimes.com", "al": {"android": {"url": "nyt://article/bfb87e8e-14e4-5cef-96b1-ad6966944c78", "package": "com.nytimes.android", "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "iphone": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 284862083, "app_name": "NYTimes"}, "ipad": {"url": "nytimes://www.nytimes.com/2017/10/10/us/gwyneth-paltrow-angelina-jolie-harvey-weinstein.html", "app_store_id": 357066198, "app_name": "NYTimes"}}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "fb": {"app_id": 9869919170}, "slack-app-id": "A0121HXPPTQ"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1507590000.0, "source": "https://www.nytimes.com", "summary": ""}
