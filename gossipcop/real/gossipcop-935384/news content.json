I\u2019d like to address the TWITTER outrage with this video and image to follow. #directedby @ClayneCrawford,\u201d Wayans tweeted.\n\nRepresentatives for Fox, Warner Bros. TV and Crawford did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn the video, something explodes behind Wayans and the actor is seen ducking with his face twisted in pain as he clutches his head. In the hashtag, Wayans included the episode in which he sustained the injury was directed by Crawford.\n\nIn a second tweet, Wayans shows a close-up look at his injury, a cut on the back of his head with blood dripping down his neck.\n\n\u201cHow does the shrapnel from this hit me on the opposite side of the head? #directedby@claynecrawford,\u201d he tweeted.\n\nThe star then shared what appeared to be an explanation he was given for the incident.\n\n\u201cBelow is a rendering seeking to explain yesterday\u2019s incident. It turns out there was a second shooter, to Damon\u2019s left, on the other side of the pillar behind which his character was crouched, which accounts for what he heard from his left side. @claynecrawford #noapology,\u201d Wayans tweeted.\n\nIn more tweets, Wayans alleged Crawford \u201chit another actor in the mouth with a bottle of green tea and busted his mouth open.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe hit another actor in the mouth with a bottle of green tea and busted his mouth open. @lancehenriksen a white man!!! #notanaccident #knowyourfacts!\u201d he tweeted.\n\nA representative for Henriksen did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nDamon Wayans Twitter\n\nWayans then shared a photo of a sticker he said could be seen around the studio lot where the show was filmed which read, \u201cClayne Crawford Is An Emotional Terrorist.\u201d\n\n\u201cSince @warnerbrostv is not defending me at all.. here\u2019s another photo of images other people were posting in and around the lot. Not me! He became UNINSURABLE!\u201d Wayans continued in a different tweet. \u201cRelished in making female cry. And stuck fear in cast and crew. #dontblameme.\u201d\n\nCrawford, 40, apologized for his behavior in two past incidents \u2013 including the one that has now been revealed to have invloved Wayans \u2013 that occurred on set at the end of April.\n\nThe actor, who starred as Martin Riggs, addressed the incidents on Instagram, revealing he had been \u201creprimanded\u201d for them.\n\nWant to keep up on the latest from PEOPLE?

The first reprimand was because I reacted with anger over working conditions that did not feel safe or conducive to good work under the leadership of a guest director and assistant director who, in turn, were angry at my response. I met with Human Resources, I apologized for my part of the conflict, and I completed studio-appointed therapy. I even shared a sizable portion of my paycheck with one of the parties involved per the instruction of the studio,\u201d Crawford began.\n\nFOX via Getty\n\nHe wrote about the second incident that took place on the set of the drama series: \u201cThe second reprimand came during an episode I was directing. An actor on set felt unsafe because a piece of shrapnel from an effect hit him. It was an unfortunate event that happened in spite of all safety precautions and procedures being followed. I take responsibility for the incident because I was in charge of the set.\u201d\n\nJeffrey Mayer/WireImage; Jason LaVeris/FilmMagic\n\nThe actor continued by sharing that he has absolute \u201clove, respect and care for my crew and cast, and would never intentionally jeopardize so many jobs. Moreover, I love the process of making film and television. I appreciate and respect the work of everyone involved. It takes a village. I am incredibly sorry if my passion for doing good work has ever made anyone feel less than comfortable on our set, or feel less than celebrated for their efforts.\u201d\n\n\u201cFurthermore, I apologize to all the crew and cast for any negative attention Lethal Weapon is receiving because of these incidents,\u201d continued Crawford, who said that he takes \u201cgreat pride in treating everyone in life with dignity and kindness.\u201d\n\nLast week, Entertainment Weekly confirmed a report from The Hollywood Reporter that stated Fox and its studio partner Warner Bros. TV were searching for a new actor to play Riggs if the series was renewed for a third season.\n\nCrawford seemingly responded on Twitter Tuesday by first sharing a photo of himself on a boat with his arms up and the caption, \u201cHmmmmmm?\u201d and then tweeting, \u201cWait, wait, wait\u2026\u2026you can\u2019t fire me on my day off!\u201d\n\nSeann William Scott was hired to replace Crawford as Riggs\u2019 brother, according to Variety.", "images":
