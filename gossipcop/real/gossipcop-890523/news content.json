There is a warrant out for my arrest in Virginia. What a load of HORSES--T,\" McGowan wrote.\n\nThe felony charge stems from an investigation of personal belongings left behind on a United flight arriving at Washington Dulles International Airport on Jan. 20, police said, according to The Associated Press.\n\nRelated: Rose McGowan Vows to Keep Fighting Sexual Misconduct in Hollywood\n\nAfter the items allegedly tested positive for narcotics, the Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department obtained a warrant for McGowan's arrest on Feb. 1, the AP reported.\n\nThe Metropolitan Washington Airports Authority Police Department did not immediately respond a request for comment.\n\nIt is unclear when McGowan first learned of the warrant for her arrest.\n\nPolice told the AP they've attempted to contact McGowan so she can appear in a Loudoun County, Virginia, court. The warrant has been entered into a national law enforcement database.\n\nRelated: Companies Scramble to Deal With Growing Harassment Complaints\n\nMcGowan was named in an article by The New York Times as one of the women who settled a sexual harassment suit with now-disgraced media mogul Harvey Weinstein.
