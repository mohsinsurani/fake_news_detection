With her latest album The Weight of These Wings hitting the shelves, fans are rediscovering that raw, beautiful spirit they've known for years. She's an old-school storyteller, just 33-years-old, emerging from the heartbreak of divorce like a fiery phoenix, taking no prisoners as she goes.\n\nShe has been winning over the hearts of country music fans since she first burst onto the scene in the mid 2000s. She's fought her way up the ranks of a male-dominated industry, relating to women with her spitfire persona and all-too-real lyrics. \"I don't know that I am a pioneer,\" she said in an interview with The Guardian about paving the way for more women in country music. \"I hope that I helped keep the door open.\"\n\nShe's the girl-next-door, with that glam Hollywood life. Her feet on the ground, the sun on her face, the fissures of experience only sweetening the rich life she has created. From messy breakup to new love, small town to big league, Goodwill to Givenchy, her fearless confidence and authenticity continues to blaze a trail for women, and for humanity. And according Lambert herself, this time everything's on the table. Here's a look at Miranda Lambert's transformation over the years.", "images": ["https://www.thelist.com/img/uploads/2016/10/mirandalambertstunningfeatured5-780x438_rev1.jpg", "https://www.thelist.com/img/thelist_logo_black_2.svg", "https://www.thelist.com/img/gallery/how-miranda-lambert-transformed-her-body/-1480910830.jpg", "https://www.thelist.com/img/thelist_icon_black.svg", "data:image/png;base64,iVBORw0KGgoAAAANSUhEUgAAAAEAAAABCAQAAAC1HAwCAAAAC0lEQVR42mNkYAAAAAYAAjCB0C8AAAAASUVORK5CYII="], "top_img": "https://www.thelist.com/img/uploads/2016/10/mirandalambertstunningfeatured5-780x438_rev1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Adria Valdes Greenhauff", "Lauren Bair"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thelist.com/27427/miranda-lambert-transformed-body/", "title": "The Stunning Transformation Of Miranda Lambert", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "og": {"image": "https://www.thelist.com/img/uploads/2016/10/mirandalambertstunningfeatured5-780x438_rev1.jpg", "title": "The Stunning Transformation Of Miranda Lambert - The List", "description": "Miranda Lambert is honest about trying to maintain a positive body image, a struggle many women know well.
