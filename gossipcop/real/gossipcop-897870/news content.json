She's called people out for speculating on her weight on a number of occasions, and a recent Snapchat story was no different.\n\nAfter her red carpet appearance for Pitch Perfect 3's Australia premiere, it seems that some people decided to focus on Ruby's appearance rather than her performance. In an Instagram story, she called out reporters who opined on her acne and weight \u2014 and everyone who gossips about other people's appearances, in general.\n\n\"This acne belongs to me, not them,\" she wrote on a photo of her cheek. \"I don't see how it's bothering so many others? But I'm a human. It happens.\" And for the record, she's right: there's nothing wrong with acne \u2014 it's the most common skin condition there is. Judging someone for their skin is never appropriate.\n\nShe then recounted The Daily Mail calling her \"anorexic,\" explaining how this use of the word undermines the experience of eating disorder survivors and spreads the myth that eating disorders are about looks. \"They don't care that they are using a term like anorexia as if it isn't a serious and deadly illness,\" she wrote. \"It is very important to know what an eating disorder is, to know how to speak about it properly when you have such a platform such as a national newspaper. To consider the readers, triggers, and straight up bullying.\"\n\nThe actress added that she has a tilted posterior and \"spinal curvature from a bad car accident,\" which might lend to the appearance that sparked the gossip and speculation. But she shouldn't need to defend the way she looks. Someone's looks and health are entirely their business, and gossiping about them is a form of bullying. To prevent more negativity from starting as a result of her candid discussion, Ruby turned off the comments on her Instagram. \"I can only do what I can to make this a safe place,\" she wrote, \"and I will.\"", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631fa8b88cd4ec2ca4c871a7/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25ca7d9b77c32916329f40/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/IMG_4551.PNG", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25c7cbf32eb93e5abc8a5b/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/IMG_4546.PNG", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631b92ee3badf351556e544b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632de9dc477fefa0a1dab50e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25d07dc619060fb1912ef1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25d0839ee1c817e4f79f79/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-882935702.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/631b50b509e90c916749e6fd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25d07dc619060fb1912ef1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Suzannah Weiss"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ruby-rose-claps-back-at-tabloids-acne-weight", "title": "Ruby Rose Claps Back at Tabloids for Criticizing Her Acne and Weight", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "In an Instagram story, Ruby Rose pointed out the problems with news outlets speculating on her weight and acne.", "id": "5a25c57b92ac98298a550071", "keywords": "ruby rose,acne,body image", "news_keywords": "ruby rose,acne,body image", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a25c57b92ac98298a550071", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"In an Instagram story, Ruby Rose pointed out the problems with news outlets speculating on her weight and acne.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25d0839ee1c817e4f79f79/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-882935702.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25d0839ee1c817e4f79f79/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-882935702.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "This is a must-read.", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25d07dc619060fb1912ef1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg", "site_name": "Teen Vogue", "title": "Ruby Rose Has a Message for People Who Criticize Her Acne", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/ruby-rose-claps-back-at-tabloids-acne-weight"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-12-04T22:48:15.075Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-04T22:48:15.075Z", "author": "Suzannah Weiss"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@TeenVogue", "description": "This is a must-read.", "domain": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "image": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5a25d07dc619060fb1912ef1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/FACEBOOK.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@TeenVogue", "title": "Ruby Rose Has a Message for People Who Criticize Her Acne"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1013284322017473, "pages": 6636341311}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512427695.075, "source": "https://www.teenvogue.com", "summary": ""}
