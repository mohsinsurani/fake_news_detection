Full House is returning as Netflix's Fuller House on Friday, Feb. 26, and the Tanner clan is all grown up! Much like Joey and Jesse came to Danny\u2019s aid after his wife died, Stephanie and Kimmy are stepping up to help D.J. in her time of need to help her raise her kids. The reboot promises to bring back everything we loved about the original series \u2014 the characters, the catchphrases, and the music. No, I don\u2019t mean a Jesse and the Rippers reunion (but that would be cool!). Stephanie Tanner is a musician in her own right in the spinoff. But, can Jodie Sweetin sing in real life?\n\nOn the show, Stephanie seems to pick up where Jesse did on the original show, as an aspiring musician and performer. Which isn\u2019t surprising considering how musical the family was throughout Full House\u2019s initial run and how Stephanie proved herself as a triple threat. Stephanie Tanner was dramatic, a fly dancer, and part of the sitcom band with the greatest name of all time: Girl Talk. Kimmy happened to play keyboard in Girl Talk, so fingers crossed for a reunion.\n\nSince Stephanie is a performer extraordinaire, that means that actor Jodie Sweetin is too. She has been singing and performing her entire life as Stephanie Tanner and other roles. Here are clips of some of Sweetin's most memorable performances over the past 30 years. Watch how Sweetin's talents have evolved and be sure to tune in for more musical moments on Fuller House!\n\nOscar Mayer Commercial\n\nYep, that\u2019s Jodie Sweetin in this pre-Full House, \u201880s-tastic commercial.\n\nSinging With The Beach Boys\n\nShe gained musical street cred at an early age when the Tanner family jammed with The Beach Boys.\n\nBusting A Move On Full House\n\nOn more than one occasion did Stephanie bust out some fly \u201890s moves on the show. Remember this Love Shack routine?\n\nGirl Talk\n\nI so badly want this to be a real girl group.\n\nJodie Jammed With John IRL\n\nJohn Stamos (who portrayed musician Uncle Jesse) recently teamed up with Sweetin for charity.\n\nThe Cast Reunited With A Song\n\nSweetin and the rest of the cast recently sang the Full House theme song on The Tonight Show With Jimmy Fallon, in order to promote the Netflix revival.\n\nThe Girls Have Still Got It\n\nSo, the cast can still sing ... And apparently they can still dance, too!\n\nWe can\u2019t wait to see the family new musical adventures on Fuller House, with Stephanie Tanner at the helm!\n\nImage: Saeed Adyani/Netflix", "images": ["https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/7/5d8f0698-b98b-460f-86bb-87733a815208-164650_6498_rv3.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/10/5/868481de-d85a-4ed6-918b-fd2d705b9aed-intern3.jpeg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/9/27/4f925157-92ef-4dc3-a1e3-23457edc4647-ross-rachel.jpeg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/uploads/image/2022/6/6/970833c6-ac2d-44b1-8808-6f216efbc190-jenna-ortega_gallery-single_0287r2c.jpg?w=159&h=110&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-xPmcrFNGfHkBg.gif", "https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/ef66e7c9-fd35-49f5-9029-c05103d0ad51.jpg?w=800&fit=crop&crop=faces&auto=format%2Ccompress", "https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/ef66e7c9-fd35-49f5-9029-c05103d0ad51.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17519299&cs_ucfr=0&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1636673763227734&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://imgix.bustle.com/rehost/2016/9/13/ef66e7c9-fd35-49f5-9029-c05103d0ad51.jpg?w=1200&h=630&fit=crop&crop=faces&fm=jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/143986-fuller-house-star-jodie-sweetin-can-sing-irl-stephanie-tanner-uses-that-skill-to-her", "title": "'Fuller House' Star Jodie Sweetin Can Sing IRL & Stephanie Tanner Uses That Skill To Her Advantage", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "referrer": "unsafe-url", "twitter": {"site": "@bustle", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@CarolineCeleste"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/bustledotcom"}, "og": {"site_name": "Bustle", "url": "https://www.bustle.com/articles/143986-fuller-house-star-jodie-sweetin-can-sing-irl-stephanie-tanner-uses-that-skill-to-her", "type": "article", "title": "'Fuller House' Star Jodie Sweetin Can Sing IRL & Stephanie Tanner Uses That Skill To Her Advantage", "description": "Time for '90s kids to rejoice!
