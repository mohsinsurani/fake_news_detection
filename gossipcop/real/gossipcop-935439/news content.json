She will be announcing her next project shortly. (Brian Cassella/Chicago Tribune)\n\nThis story has been updated to reflect the correct date for the season premiere of \u201cChicago Fire.\u201d\n\nWhen the long-running NBC drama \u201cChicago Fire\u201d returns for its seventh season Sept. 26, it will mark a major cast shakeup. Last spring Monica Raymund, who played paramedic (and for a time, firefighter) Gabriela Dawson for the show\u2019s entire run, announced she was leaving.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCast and crew have been back at work since July, and this is the first year Raymund hasn\u2019t been part of that routine. \u201cIt does feel surreal,\u201d she told me when we spoke this week.\n\n\u201cI mean, I\u2019ve given six years of my life to that show and created a family there, so it was a bit like a dismemberment, if you will. I miss them terribly, of course. But I have the opportunity to start the next chapter of my life and I\u2019m very much looking forward to that.\u201d\n\nAdvertisement\n\nWe talked about her decision to leave and what she has planned next. The following is an edited transcript.\n\nQ: Walk me through the decision to say goodbye to Gabby and the show.\n\nA: I\u2019m not sure the exact moment when it happened, but I knew that my six-year contract was coming to an end and I felt like I was hungry to explore a different role, a different story. I wanted to explore a different world. I had been in Chicago for five years and just personally where I was in my life, I was ready to create my home and kind of plant some roots in Los Angeles.\n\nIt\u2019s kind of a double-edged sword because on the one hand, it\u2019s wonderful to be employed for that long and to have job security. And to be able to delve into a storyline and to flush it out over that amount of time. To get that opportunity is extremely rare and special. Job security is always the two favorite words an actor can say! But sometimes you have to take a risk to diversify your opportunities.\n\nIt was a rocky end for Matt (Jesse Spencer) and Gabby (Monica Raymund) as Season 6 of \"Chicago Fire\" came to a close. (Elizabeth Morris/NBC)\n\nQ: What did you like most about playing Gabby and what were your biggest frustrations with her as a character?\n\nA: Oh, I loved being able to play a first responder. I don\u2019t have anyone in my family that\u2019s a first responder and I didn\u2019t really know the different trials and tribulations that they face everyday. So that was the greatest part about playing Gabby, that I got to get to know the paramedics, I got to know the firefighters in Chicago, and hopefully to the best of my ability, represent them honorably.\n\nAs for frustrations, I mean \u2026 I\u2019ve gotta say, Wolf Films, the producers were really accommodating to me. I had the idea to see if we could flirt with Gabby Dawson going on the firetruck and they wrote me on the firetruck for two years! I did not know that they were going to take that bait and they did!\n\nQ: As an actor, was there a difference playing a firefighter vs. a paramedic?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: Yes! Yes, yes, yes, for sure. Firefighters, it\u2019s just a way more physical, active role by nature. You\u2019re carrying around 50 pounds of gear, on and off the truck, all day long. It\u2019s just physically exhausting, so in a way I wonder if as an actor, it got me out of my own way because you\u2019re just too tired to fake it or lean into your habits.\n\nTo be honest with you, I actually think that was the most fun I had the six years I was on the show, playing a firefighter. Running into burning buildings and rappeling down buildings from a roof, I mean, that\u2019s extremely fun and thrilling. I got to play an action hero for a while.\n\nThe paramedics are doing all these intricate procedures that actually require true extensive academic knowledge, so I got to learn a lot. I had to learn about anatomy and physiology, so I understood what I was actually doing and I could have an actual authentic response.\n\nHauling 50 pounds of gear is no joke, but the two years she hung up her character's paramedic togs to play a firefighter on the show were Monica Raymund's favorite. (Elizabeth Morris/NBC)\n\nQ: Showrunner Derek Haas has said that when you initially told him you weren\u2019t going to sign a new contract for Season 7, he thought you were just negotiating.\n\nA: Yeah (laughs). I guess he did. I couldn\u2019t have been any more transparent or clear! I was like, \u201cHey, I\u2019m leaving, I\u2019m giving my notice.\u201d And he was like, \u201cNo you\u2019re not!\u201d And I said, \u201cNo Derek, I am.\u201d And he just couldn\u2019t believe it! I mean, I didn\u2019t quite know how to take that except to just \u2026 leave. I thought it was hilarious.\n\nYou could just see this absolute case of extreme denial. I mean, when the season wrapped he called me, like: \u201cSo, you\u2019re not really leaving.\u201d \u2026 And I was like, \u201cDerek, honey. I love you, but I gotta go.\u201d He was just having separation anxiety from me, that\u2019s all.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nQ: I have a memory of you taking a chair and sitting down in front of the Trump building downtown a couple years ago ...\n\nA: Yes, that is correct. I created a performance piece because I didn\u2019t know what else to do! This was shortly after the election and I was so confused and enraged and sad and I had all these feelings and I didn\u2019t have a creative outlet to express it, so created a piece of performance art. I sat outside on Wacker just across the street from Trump Tower asking Trump voters to come sit down across from me and speak and I would listen. I did it for two weeks. Sometimes I was out there for five or six hours at a time. I\u2019d go after I wrapped on set, or I\u2019d go on my days off.\n\nThe whole purpose was to offer the chair. Because the entire argument was that they didn\u2019t feel heard, so I tried to create a safe space for them to be heard. I had a lot of people sit down and I heard a lot of interesting things.\n\nYou know, like when Marina Abramovic sits there and she has an empty chair in front of her (from her 2010 performance piece \u201cThe Artist Is Present\u201d at the Museum of Modern Art) and her eyes are closed until somebody sits down, she doesn\u2019t know who it\u2019s going to be \u2014 that\u2019s the art.\n\nQ: Did you just listen or interact with them?\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: I listened and I asked questions, but I never asserted my opinion \u2014 that was a very important part of the piece. I never imposed my own beliefs on them. The entire objective was that they felt safe so that they could say what they believed and feel heard. That their feelings were validated. That was the social experiment.\n\nThe most memorable takeaway was that there were a few people who were single-issue voters and that was extremely surprising to me. That took priority over everything else, all the other political issues, the behavior of the candidates, that single issue \u2014 they were pro-life \u2014 was the most important to them.\n\nIt was worthwhile for me because I was able to do something artistic. Maybe it wasn\u2019t productive for the world, but it was a way for me to wrap my brain around what was happening and kind of humanize what was going on.\n\nQ: Did you get any blowback professionally, either from your bosses or colleagues?\n\nA: Not at all. In fact, when I went to set a lot of people were like, \u201cHey, I think what you\u2019re doing is really cool.\u201d And I was shocked: \u201cAre you sure?\u201d\n\nQ: It\u2019s rare to see a recognizable actor being so accessible. You were just sitting on a chair, there was no entourage.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nA: Oh, my dad was so pissed. He was like, \u201cWhat if there\u2019s a crazy person? You\u2019re on TV!\u201d And he got so scared that somebody would do something violent or dangerous. And that\u2019s kind of part of the art, I think. I\u2019m actually not done with this. I\u2019m planning on doing a performance piece, maybe in Los Angeles, maybe in New York depending on where I am, but I want to do something that\u2019s a site-specific immersive piece that\u2019s about political activism.\n\nQ: What projects do you have in the works?\n\nA: I can\u2019t quite mention it yet. I have a project that is going to go public soon. It\u2019s a new TV show and it\u2019s very dark and suspenseful. They\u2019ll issue a press release about it probably in the next week or two. It\u2019s an opportunity for me to get really gritty and dirty.\n\nI wanted to be a part of something\u2019s that topical. Something that was extremely meaningful to the current time, something that was relevant \u2014 whether political or social or economic. As a viewer and a consumer of television, I\u2019m very attracted to dark suspenseful storytelling, post-apocalyptic storytelling. I watch things like \u201cThe Handmaid\u2019s Tale\u201d or \u201cOzark,\u201d which I\u2019m actually watching right now. I\u2019m just very attracted to that. There\u2019s a sense of gravity to it and that\u2019s the well I want to dip my feet in.\n\n\"As a viewer and a consumer of television, I\u2019m very attracted to dark suspenseful storytelling, post-apocalyptic storytelling,\" said Monica Raymund, who will be announcing her next project shortly. (Alex Garcia/Tribune)\n\nQ: You\u2019ve started directing, too.\n\nA: Yeah, I was accepted into the Female Forward directing program at NBC and I\u2019ve been shadowing at \u201cLaw & Order: SVU\u201d and I will be directing Episode 8 of this season! So I\u2019m like totally focused on directing right now. I wrap my episode mid-October.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nI\u2019d like to eventually direct features.\n\nQ: Let me close out with a couple quick \u201cChicago Fire\u201d questions: Would you ever go to Lottie\u2019s (the bar known as Molly\u2019s on the show) to hang out on your off time?\n\nA: We did actually, in the first and second season! We would just go; I\u2019ve been there a couple times. But they built the set to look exactly like the interior of Lottie\u2019s so it was like, \u201cI feel like film here all the time, I don\u2019t want to be here when I\u2019m not on the clock!\u201d It was just too much.\n\nQ: Your wardrobe on the show was pretty specific: T-shirt and the department-issue jacket. Did you take either with you as mementos?\n\nA: No! I actually don\u2019t think I\u2019m allowed! They have to keep those until the show wraps. But maybe they\u2019ll send me my jacket when it\u2019s all done. Maybe I\u2019ll put in a special request.\n\nnmetz@chicagotribune.com\n\nAdvertisement\n\nTwitter @Nina_Metz\n\n[ MORE COVERAGE: 'Chicago Fire' showrunner Derek Haas on Season 6 cliffhangers ]\n\n[ Commentary: How committed is CBS to change?
