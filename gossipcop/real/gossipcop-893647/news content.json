She was the best audience. She was the one I was always trying to make laugh and she was such a fan of the show, and everything I did,\" Fallon shared. \"When we were little, my mom would walk us to the store, me and my sister, and we would hold hands and she would squeeze my hand three times to say I love you and I would squeeze I love you too.\"\n\nHe continued, \"Last week, I was in the hospital and I grabbed her hand and I squeezed I love you and I just knew we were in trouble, you know?\"\n\nCelebrity Deaths: 2017's Fallen Stars\n\nE! News confirmed that Gloria died peacefully on Nov. 4, at NYU Langone Medical Center in New York City. Fallon was at his mother's bedside along with other loved ones.\n\n\"I feel so grateful to be able to do this every single night and I'm very appreciative of all the support from all of you that my family received over the past week and we're going to continue to work really hard to bring some light and laughter into the world,\" Fallon shared during Monday's episode. \"Thank you for watching. Thank you for helping me and my family recover from this loss. Mom, I'll never stop trying to make you laugh. I love you.\"\n\nJeff Daniels and Mary J. Blige stopped by, and musical guest Taylor Swift celebrated selling one million copies of her new album \"Reputation\" by performing a song.\n\nFallon's producer Mike DiCenzo tweeted following the broadcast giving viewers some insight into Swift's performance the emotions both Fallon and the cast were dealing with during the show.\n\nA few words (i.e. a thread) about tonight's show.
