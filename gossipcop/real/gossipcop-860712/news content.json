As Elisabeth Moss put that red hood up, she declared herself a woman on a mission: to save her daughter, and do as much damage as she can to Gilead in the process. But there are plenty of questions left up in the air as we march toward next season\u2014not the least of which is how, exactly, she\u2019ll pull that off.\n\nWhile show-runner Bruce Miller wasn\u2019t handing out exact details during his finale postmortem phone calls\u2014a conference call with reporters and, later, a solo chat with V.F.\u2014he did drop plenty of details and a few helpful hints as to what fans can expect next. The short version: June is on a war path; Aunt Lydia is not dead, and she could come back more brutal than ever; and Bradley Whitford\u2019s character, Commander Lawrence, will be back next season, where he and June will meet anew. For a more in-depth preview, read on.\n\nCan June rescue Hannah?\n\nShe\u2019s damn sure going to try. As fans likely guessed from June\u2019s decision to send her baby to Canada with Emily while staying behind in Gilead herself, our heroine has decided she can\u2019t leave her oldest daughter\u2014so she\u2019s on a rescue mission. But as she\u2019s learned before, this is not going to be an easy task. Come Season 3, Miller said we\u2019ll learn just what June\u2019s plan is\u2014and yes, he promises, she does have one: \u201cShe\u2019s sketched out what she thinks she\u2019s capable of doing in this particular moment,\u201d Miller told V.F. \u201cBut she also knows that if it doesn\u2019t work out, she has survived; she\u2019s good at surviving. She\u2019s capable of improvising.\u201d\n\nAt this point, Miller said, June has gained the confidence of someone who has endured enough of Gilead to know exactly what she\u2019s capable of. While Margaret Atwood\u2019s original version of June is a largely passive character, the series has evolved her into a more active heroine. In Season 3, June will get Hannah back or die trying, Miller said, adding, \u201cYou and I are both worried she\u2019s gonna die; she\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nThe writers\u2019 room has adopted a mantra for this next phase of the story: \u201cBlessed be the fight.\u201d And while Seasons 1 and 2 were mostly about June trying to survive, Season 3 will address resistance more overtly.\n\nJune has learned the hard way that escape from Gilead is not as simple as, say, boarding a plane, which she tried at the beginning of Season 2. So as she tries to rescue Hannah, Miller said part of that effort will mean working to weaken Gilead as a whole. But June\u2019s primary, perhaps only, objective is Hannah. \u201cIf she could snap her fingers and get Hannah and leave, she would do it immediately,\u201d Miller said.\n\nWhat the hell is Commander Lawrence up to?\n\nIn a conference call, Miller confirmed that Whitford\u2019s still-mysterious character will be back in Season 3\u2014and we\u2019re about to learn a ton about him.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s our Oppenheimer character,\u201d Miller said during the conference call. \u201cThe man who designed an atomic bomb and then saw what it could do. He\u2019s a designer of Gilead, and now he\u2019s seen what it could do. So he is a mass of contradictions and dangers. You never know what he\u2019s willing to do, what he\u2019s not willing to do.\u201d\n\nAs June embarks on her quest to save Hannah and hobble Gilead, she will run into Commander Lawrence again, Miller said. A lot. Much as he saved Emily, Miller said Lawrence has likely dabbled in helping people before\u2014though likely not to the extent that he helped his former handmaid.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s running a little bit of an island for misfit toys,\u201d Miller told V.F. \u201cI like to call it, he\u2019s running a no-kill shelter. He\u2019s the one who brings in all the people who break rules in other houses and keeps them around until they can move on or whatever.\u201d", "images":
