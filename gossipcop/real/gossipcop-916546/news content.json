The story went wide. As I noted at the time, however, it\u2019s f-cking Star Magazine. They get one thing right all year. And, as it turns out, it\u2019s not this. PEOPLE actually followed up with their own report shortly after with sources refuting the breakup claims, saying that Ewan and Mary were still together, no split.\n\nEwan and Mary were seen holding hands on the set of her new film this week \u2013 Daily Mail has the exclusive photos. Clearly not broken up then. Which most likely means that he and his estranged wife Eve Mavrakis will move ahead with the divorce. When those breakup reports initially surfaced, Eve said that they\u2019re not speaking and that whether or not the breakup rumours were true, she wouldn\u2019t change her mind. We talk about acrimonious divorces a lot on The Social. People keep coming back to \u201cget along for the kids\u2019 sake\u201d. And I get that, I do. That that should be the priority. But it also requires a lot from the person who\u2019s betrayed. Like A LOT. When you \u201cget along for the kids\u201d, often most of the sacrifice comes from one person. Marriages run their course. But bitterness has to run its course too. I\u2019m a bitter ass person. My bitterness would probably run longer than the actual marriage.\n\n", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_ewan-obi-wan-18au17.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_chloe-brooklyn-06apr18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_jay-blue-letterman-06apr18.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_ewan-mcgregor-globes-08jan18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_82x82_ewan-mary-05apr18-02.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://www.laineygossip.com:80/Content/images/articles/ewan-mary-05apr18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://www.laineygossip.com/content/images/mobile-header-amp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/avatars/bio_lainey_40x40.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_82x82_ewan-mary-05apr18-04.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_brad-pitt-neri-06apr18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_ewan-mcgregor-dumped-26feb18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_brad-neri-three-06apr18.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_82x82_ewan-mary-05apr18-03.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_keri-what-else-06apr18.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_ewan-mary-elizabeth-23oct17.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_jennifer-aniston-smug-06apr18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_144x138_channing-jenna-split-03apr18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/defaults/insta-logo-tiles.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_82x82_ewan-mary-05apr18-05.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_173x173_ewan-mary-05apr18-01.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://photos.laineygossip.com/thumbs/tmb_82x82_ewan-mary-05apr18-06.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://www.laineygossip.com:80/Content/images/articles/ewan-mary-05apr18-01.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026/http://www.laineygossip.com/ewan-mcgregor-and-mary-elizabeth-winstead-are-still-together-despite-reports-that-theyve-split/49562", "title": "Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are still together despite reports that they've split", "meta_data": {"Description": "New photos of Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead holding hands prove the two are still together", "Keywords": "Lainey Gossip Celebrity Update New photos of Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead holding hands prove the two are still together", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are still together despite reports that they've split", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026/http://www.laineygossip.com/ewan-mcgregor-and-mary-elizabeth-winstead-are-still-together-despite-reports-that-theyve-split/49562", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://www.laineygossip.com:80/Content/images/articles/ewan-mary-05apr18-01.jpg", "locale": "en_US", "description": "New photos of Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead holding hands prove the two are still together"}, "article": {"published_time": "4/5/2018 1:53:57 PM", "author": "Lainey"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead are still together despite reports that they've split", "description": "New photos of Ewan McGregor and Mary Elizabeth Winstead holding hands prove the two are still together", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180408223026im_/http://www.laineygossip.com:80/Content/images/articles/ewan-mary-05apr18-01.jpg"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1522932837.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
