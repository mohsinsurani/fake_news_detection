They don\u2019t want me to be known as somebody who does a show about Scientology. I\u2019m like, \u2018What am I going to do? Not do it? This is my passion.'\u201d\n\nREAD MORE: 7 shocking things we learned from Leah Remini\u2019s Scientology series\n\n\u201cThe Church of Scientology has been in the news, but more so for fodder and a headline,\u201d she continued. \u201cWhat we are trying to do is show that this is a real thing that\u2019s tearing families apart. People really had no idea. It was like, \u2018Oh, this is that crazy thing where Tom Cruise is jumping on a couch and everybody believes in aliens?\u2019\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\n\u201cI think that worked for a very long time to sell headlines. But we\u2019re showing how a person actually can get there, and that\u2019s what\u2019s resonating. Also, we\u2019re standing up to a bully and, in a culture where people are feeling apathetic, we\u2019re representing a group of courageous people who are saying, \u2018No, I\u2019m going to do something about it.'\u201d\n\nRemini, 46, along with ex-elite Scientologist Mike Rinder, 62, are currently shooting Season 2 of the popular expos\u00e9 show, which seeks to tell the unheard stories of people who\u2019ve managed to leave the religious organization. Along the way, the viewer gets some insight into Rinder\u2019s and Remini\u2019s experiences as well.\n\nBoth of them are now classified by the church as \u201cSuppressive Persons\u201d (SPs) \u2014 people who seek to speak ill of Scientology \u2014 along with any journalist looking to tell a negative story about the religion. The treatment that befalls SPs is meant to be so unbearable, and in some cases so completely life-ruining, that they\u2019ll cease their crusade to bring down Scientology.\n\nREAD MORE: Leah Remini alleges further Scientology abuses for show\u2019s upcoming second season\n\nSo far, nothing seems to be stopping Remini.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s not me, that\u2019s the thing\u2026 I\u2019m telling their stories,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen [the production staff and I] leave, they go back to their regular lives, and they\u2019re the ones the church goes after. When we air a show, I go, \u2018Just know, within minutes your daughter is going to be saying horrific things about you on the church hate website.\u2019 Literally every single person who has done a story about Scientology has a hate website on them.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn fact, both Remini and Rinder have such sites dedicated to them \u2014 a common technique Scientology uses. The church has made a website titled \u201cWho Is Michael Rinder?\u201d (Here is a page \u2014 in the exact same design format as Rinder\u2019s \u2014 dedicated to criticizing Remini\u2019s show.) On the site, Rinder is called \u201ca vicious wife beater,\u201d a \u201cdeadbeat,\u201d and a \u201cfather from hell.\u201d None of those declarations has been proven.\n\nThis isn\u2019t really a shocking new fact, since Scientology\u2019s practices have been well documented, but what\u2019s jarring is how far the religious organization will go, and what methodology it\u2019ll use to bring someone down once they\u2019ve \u201cdisconnected\u201d from the church. Remini, Rinder and several others recounted on Aftermath how private investigators and other agents affiliated with Scientology would follow them endlessly, try to destroy their careers and even threaten their extended family.\n\nREAD MORE: Leah Remini: Tom Cruise could \u2018end\u2019 Scientology if he wanted to\n\nDespite the organization\u2019s tactics, Remini is not afraid of whatever repercussions she might personally face.\n\n\u201cDon\u2019t misunderstand me,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople who know me know that I have a very big mouth, and I have been that way since I was a kid. But I never want to give the organization of Scientology the idea that anybody is scared of them. We are not. And the more they react in the way that they do, it makes me think we\u2019re doing the right thing.\u201d\n\nStory continues below advertisement\n\nIn Season 1 of Aftermath, viewers saw how hostile Scientology members can be when confronted. In many instances, Remini and Rinder were being tailed; when approached, the alleged stalker either denies it or doesn\u2019t say a word before quickly leaving the scene.\n\nWATCH BELOW: The latest on Scientology\n\nThe only thing Remini admits to being scared of is hearing the Scientologists\u2019 stories of abuse and forced separation from family. Every time she gets ready to listen to a story, she says, she\u2019s afraid that it\u2019s going to be worse than she thinks it is \u2014 and it often is.\n\nIn an incredible show of trust, Remini says she gives out her personal cellphone number to all guests on her show in case they need to get in touch.\n\nSeason 2 of Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath is slated for Summer 2017 on A&E.\n\nStory continues below advertisement", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=3005670&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/alert-red.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-morty.svg", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-text.svg", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/leah-remini-mike-rinder.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/chris-jancelewicz-globalnews-e1602604272262.png?w=136&h=136&crop=1", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/morty.svg", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/shield.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/shield-blue.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/leah-remini-mike-rinder.jpg?quality=85&strip=all", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/alert.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/ad-choices.png", "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/themes/shaw-globalnews/assets/dist/images/logo-mobile.svg", "https://d21y75miwcfqoq.cloudfront.net/70c8fc80"], "top_img": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/leah-remini-mike-rinder.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chris Jancelewicz", "Global News"], "canonical_link": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3524066/leah-remini-scientology/", "title": "Leah Remini: Taking down Church of Scientology is \u2018my passion\u2019", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#002F5D", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "title": "Leah Remini: Taking down Church of Scientology is \u2018my passion\u2019  | Globalnews.ca", "description": "\"What we are trying to do is show that this is a real thing that's tearing families apart,\" said Leah Remini about the Church of Scientology.", "keywords": "Leah Remini, leah remini interview, leah remini scientologist, leah remini scientology, leah remini scientology and the aftermath, leah remini scientology tv show, leah remini tv show, Scientology, scientology and the aftermath, scientology leah remini, Entertainment", "news_keywords": "Leah Remini, leah remini interview, leah remini scientologist, leah remini scientology, leah remini scientology and the aftermath, leah remini scientology tv show, leah remini tv show, Scientology, scientology and the aftermath, scientology leah remini, Entertainment", "article": {"tag": "Entertainment"}, "og": {"title": "Leah Remini: Taking down Church of Scientology is \u2018my passion\u2019  | Globalnews.ca", "description": "\"What we are trying to do is show that this is a real thing that's tearing families apart,\" said Leah Remini about the Church of Scientology.", "type": "article", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3524066/leah-remini-scientology/", "site_name": "Global News", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/leah-remini-mike-rinder.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"title": "Leah Remini: Taking down Church of Scientology is \u2018my passion\u2019  | Globalnews.ca", "url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3524066/leah-remini-scientology/", "description": "\"What we are trying to do is show that this is a real thing that's tearing families apart,\" said Leah Remini about the Church of Scientology.", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@globalnews", "image": "https://globalnews.ca/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/leah-remini-mike-rinder.jpg?quality=85&strip=all&w=720&h=379&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 318812448281278, "pages": 91251252807}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Global News", "application-name": "Global News", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "default", "ia": {"markup_url": "https://globalnews.ca/news/3524066/leah-remini-scientology/?ia_markup=1"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://globalnews.ca", "summary": ""}
