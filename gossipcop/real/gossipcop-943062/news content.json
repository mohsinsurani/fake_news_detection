I just know that me being a black man, that\u2019s something I\u2019m totally against,\u201d the rapper told GQ. \u201cI\u2019m just like, \u2018How could you be that comfortable, ever?\u2019 Just for me, there\u2019s no way that\u2019s ever comfortable.\u201d\n\nWhen reminded that Drake said it was to highlight the struggle for black actors to get roles, Pusha responded, \u201cThat\u2019s not an explanation that I would accept.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/p6podcast402x.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2019/09/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/pusha-t-drake-porn-star-sophie-baby.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=618&h=410&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/pusha-t-drake-porn-star-sophie-baby.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2018/05/pusha-t-drake-porn-star-sophie-baby.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["June"], "canonical_link": "https://pagesix.com/2018/06/11/pusha-t-doesnt-accept-drakes-explanation-for-blackface-photo/", "title": "Pusha-T doesn\u2019t accept Drake\u2019s explanation for \u2018blackface\u2019 photo", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
