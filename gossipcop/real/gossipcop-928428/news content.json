Before Blake Shelton fell in love with Gwen Stefani, one of his exes was obsessed with the \u201cHollaback Girl\u201d singer.\n\nThe No Doubt frontwoman, 48, appeared on Jimmy Kimmel Live! on Wednesday, April 18, and was discussing her love for underground bands when she was younger. She added that she was a big fan of the British band Madness, and said that she cried when the group\u2019s singer, Suggs, got married. She also revealed that she wasn\u2019t the only one with an obsession: It turns out that Shelton, 41, once dated a girl who was in love with \u201cThe Sweet Escape\u201d singer.\n\n\u201cHe did tell me that he dated a girl for, like, three months that had my face plastered over her whole bedroom,\u201d she dished. \u201cSo that\u2019s kind of weird, right?\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s really weird,\u201d Kimmel, 50, said. Then he gave the singer an idea for a prank. \u201cYou know what you oughta do? I hope Blake isn\u2019t watching so you can surprise him. Find out what she looks like and plaster her face all over your room.\u201d\n\nShe laughed and said: \u201cOh, my God. That\u2019s so gross!\u201d\n\nThe \u201cRich Girl\u201d songstress also said that she shares a love for yacht rock \u201870s love songs with her country singer beau, and that he was impressed when she revealed one of her favorite groups. \u201cWhen I was like, \u2018Yeah, Bread is one of my favorite groups ever,\u2019 he\u2019d be, like, \u2018What?! I thought you were like a rock/ska girl.\u2019 He didn\u2019t even know what ska is!\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cI did make him a ska-like reggae playlist for Valentine\u2019s a couple years ago. He doesn\u2019t really listen to it that often.\u201d\n\nThe Voice coaches, who began dating in November 2015, often gush about one another and recently revealed that they\u2019ve both thought about marriage.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nup_177966_1434_blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nup_177966_1434_blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Karla Rodriguez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-sheltons-ex-was-obsessed-with-gwen-stefani/", "title": "Blake Shelton\u2019s Ex Was Obsessed With Gwen Stefani", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Blake Shelton used to date a girl who was a huge fan of his current girlfriend, Gwen Stefani \u2014 watch", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Blake Shelton\u2019s Ex Was Obsessed With Gwen Stefani", "description": "Blake Shelton used to date a girl who was a huge fan of his current girlfriend, Gwen Stefani \u2014 watch", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/blake-sheltons-ex-was-obsessed-with-gwen-stefani/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-04-20T13:26:43+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nup_177966_1434_blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nup_177966_1434_blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-04-19T22:45:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-04-20T13:26:43+00:00"}, "author": "Karla Rodriguez", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Blake Shelton\u2019s Ex Was Obsessed With Gwen Stefani", "description": "Blake Shelton used to date a girl who was a huge fan of his current girlfriend, Gwen Stefani \u2014 watch", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/nup_177966_1434_blake-shelton-gwen-stefani-zoom.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1524177900.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
