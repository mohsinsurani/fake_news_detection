Of course, Darcell didn\u2019t get partake.\n\nWe\u2019re told the pregnancy announcement was a huge success. Darcell\u2019s family wasn\u2019t at the show but she immediately texted them a video and they \u201cfreaked out,\u201d naturally.\n\nCongratulations \u2026 looks like someone already has a Godfather!", "images": ["https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/243322101_277684384201471_1660705913209094619_n-e1637781801398.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Simon-Cowell-AGT-Finale-scaled-e1663267897238.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/MEGA834711_001-scaled-e1658838045196.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/mega871278_003-scaled-e1656011196489.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/Britney-Spears-Loses-4-Pounds-During-Holiday-Season-Photos-Skinny-Jeans--scaled-e1640048690374.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/61300398_341671993188134_7669920017703656447_n-2-scaled-e1661759955396.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MEGA897484_057-scaled-e1664997997603.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/mega476124_031-scaled-e1646031288860.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MEGA393845_011-e1643630233829.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MEGA796139_001-scaled-e1641326035331.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://blastcdn.b-cdn.net/adf9e91eb8ee6f407aeb55d38dd9887b.jpg?aspect_ratio=13:6&width=1300&quality=75", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/The-Blast_v06_Temptation-Island-Desktop2-05.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/MEGA876781_015-scaled-e1664956951532.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/theblast-logo.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/118155612_315963603160995_9189865826367714689_n-scaled-e1663743440520.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/MEGA822016_001-scaled-e1643043333853.jpg?aspect_ratio=2:1&width=180", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/temptation-island-logo.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/MEGA233265_008-scaled-e1663182403900.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390", "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/Sydney-Sweeney-Responds-Bikini-Lawsuit-Eurphoria-scaled-e1658166554562.jpg?aspect_ratio=16:9&width=390"], "top_img": "https://assetblast.b-cdn.net/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/social_share.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Theblast Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://theblast.com/c/justin-timberlake-concert-fan-announce-pregnancy/", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Justin Timberlake Stops Concert for Epic Pregnancy Announcement", "description": "Justin Timberlake stopped his concert to help a lucky fan make one of the biggest announcements of her life.
