It injured his wife, Linda, who was driving when the crash happened at an intersection in Palm Beach Gardens.\n\nAn investigation supported by video surveillance showed Williams did not violate the other driver\u2019s right of way, the Palm Beach Gardens Police said in an investigative report obtained by CNN affiliate WPBF.\n\nTennis star Venus Williams has reached a settlement in the wrongful death suit centered around a fatal car accident, according to court documents.\n\nSurveillance video\n\nPalm Beach Gardens Police obtained surveillance video of the June 9 collision from the perspective of a guard gate of a residential community near the intersection.\n\nOn the basis of the video, police said in a statement shortly after the crash that, \u201cthe vehicle driven by Venus Williams lawfully entered the intersection on a circular green traffic signal, and attempted to travel north through the intersection.\u201d\n\nWilliams came to a stop as she traveled north through the intersection \u201cto avoid a collision\u201d when a car going west made a left turn in front of her, according to authorities.\n\nShe then continued north, in accordance with state law, before another car collided with her vehicle, police said.\n\nNegligence lawsuit\n\nTwo weeks after the crash, Jerome Barson died in a hospital. His family filed a wrongful death lawsuit against Williams, citing negligence.\n\nThe lawsuit stated that Barson\u2019s injuries included \u201csevered main arteries, massive internal bleeding, a fractured spine, and massive internal organ damage.\u201d\n\nEarlier this year, Williams\u2019 attorneys filed a protective order, saying they got less than 24 hours\u2019 notice that the Barson family\u2019s counsel was going to download vehicle data from the tennis star\u2019s SUV, CNN affiliate WPEC-TV in West Palm Beach reported.\n\nA judge granted an emergency motion in July that allowed Williams\u2019 SUV to be searched. Both parties were given a chance to download and inspect crash data from the two vehicles involved.\n\nThe tennis star, 37, broke down in tears at Wimbledon in July when reporters questioned her about the wreck.\n\n\u201cThere are really no words to describe, like, how devastating and \u2013 yeah. I\u2019m completely speechless,\u201d Williams said.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170703165649-venus-williams-tease-1.jpg?q=x_4,y_182,h_1974,w_3508,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/150511065206-karimi-faith.jpg?q=x_0,y_3,h_1437,w_2554,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170703165649-venus-williams-tease-1.jpg?q=x_4,y_182,h_1974,w_3508,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Faith Karimi"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/21/us/venus-williams-fatal-accident-no-charges/index.html", "title": "Venus Williams, other driver cleared in fatal crash", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Venus Williams, 2nd driver won't be charged in fatal crash, police say | CNN", "description": "No charges will be filed against tennis star Venus Williams and a second driver over a car crash that left one dead in June, Florida authorities said Wednesday.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170703165649-venus-williams-tease-1.jpg?q=x_4,y_182,h_1974,w_3508,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/12/21/us/venus-williams-fatal-accident-no-charges/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Venus Williams, 2nd driver won't be charged in fatal crash, police say | CNN", "description": "No charges will be filed against tennis star Venus Williams and a second driver over a car crash that left one dead in June, Florida authorities said Wednesday.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170703165649-venus-williams-tease-1.jpg?q=x_4,y_182,h_1974,w_3508,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNN"}, "description": "No charges will be filed against tennis star Venus Williams and a second driver over a car crash that left one dead in June, Florida authorities said Wednesday.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "us", "theme": "us", "article": {"published_time": "2017-12-21T09:27:07Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-21T13:06:11Z", "tag": "accidental fatalities, accidents, accidents, disasters and safety, beaches, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, deaths and fatalities, destinations and attractions, florida, north america, palm beach, roads and traffic, society, southeastern united states, sports and recreation, sports figures, technology, tennis, traffic accidents, traffic signals, transportation and warehousing, transportation infrastructure, transportation technology, united states, venus williams, investigations", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "accidental fatalities, accidents, accidents, disasters and safety, beaches, business and industry sectors, business, economy and trade, deaths and fatalities, destinations and attractions, florida, north america, palm beach, roads and traffic, society, southeastern united states, sports and recreation, sports figures, technology, tennis, traffic accidents, traffic signals, transportation and warehousing, transportation infrastructure, transportation technology, united states, venus williams, investigations", "author": "Faith Karimi", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513814400.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
