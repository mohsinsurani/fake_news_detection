She was sentenced in May to one year and a day in prison after pleading guilty to the charge. She was released early from her sentence at the Federal Correctional Complex in Victorville, California, last week and transferred to a halfway house in Long Beach, California, for the remainder of her sentence.\n\nSplash News\n\nThough she was released early, it wasn't as early as expected due to bureaucratic changes in the federal prison system.\n\n\"It was a pretty upsetting thing for her over the weekend to not be able to talk to anybody and find out what was happening,\" prison consultant and coach Jennifer Myers, who coached Miller before she went to jail, told ET in February. \"It didn\u2019t make any sense. She had her halfway house plan and they just weren\u2019t communicating with her that it wasn\u2019t happening anymore.\"\n\nStill, Miller appears to be making the most of it, despite an apparently very strict atmosphere at the halfway house.\n\nMiller reportedly lost 100 pounds in prison, for starters. And two days after her release, she was spotted out getting a pedicure at Pampered Hands in Los Angeles.", "images": ["https://s.yimg.com/cv/apiv2/default/20190830/aol-logo.svg",
