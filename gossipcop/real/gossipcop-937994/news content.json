We're already reading each other's minds, knowing what were gonna do next.\"\n\n\"Yeah. It's weird,\" Hutchinson, 19, chimed in. \"It's like dueting with yourself, almost.\"\n\nThe pair revealed their season-long relationship during the American Idol finale on May 21, after managing to keep their romance under wraps throughout the competition.\n\nAfter Poppe was named the winner, Hutchinson took to Instagram to share a celebratory message alongside a photo of them hugging on stage during the finale.\n\nHe congratulated her on the big win, writing, \"No one deserved it more than you babe. I am honored to know you and even more honored to call you mine. Don\u2019t forget about me. I love you.\"\n\nHutchinson told ET that he was \"just joking\" when he added the off-handed quip about Poppe forgetting him, but said that a lot of critics took it a little too seriously.\n\n\"There are so many like blogs on the internet that are like, 'Caleb is already showing signs of insecurity. [It's] the downfall of their relationship,'\" Hutchinson shared in a mocking tone, clearly rejecting the very notion.\n\nBack in May, ET caught up with the happy pair just moments after Poppe was declared the season's big winner, and they opened up on how and why they stayed quiet about dating.\n\n\"[We met] the first day of Hollywood Week and we haven\u2019t really spent any time apart since then,\u201d he dished. \u201cIt was one of those things where I didn\u2019t want it to affect anything, and I didn\u2019t want to exploit my feelings for her \u2018cause they\u2019re very, very real. Once voting was over, I was like, \u2018Shoot, I want the world to know.'\"\n\nCheck out the video below to hear more from the cute couple about their burgeoning romance.\n\nThe American Idol Live! 2018 Tour kicks off July 11.\n\nCaleb Lee Hutchinson Is 'So Happy' For Girlfriend Maddie Poppe Winning 'American Idol' (Exclusive) This video is unavailable because we were unable to load a message from our sponsors.\n\n\n\nIf you are using ad-blocking software, please disable it and reload the page.\n\nRELATED CONTENT:\n\n'American Idol' Runner-Up Caleb Lee Hutchinson Shares How He Lost Over 60 Pounds\n\n\u2018American Idol\u2019 Runner-Up Caleb Lee Hutchinson \u2018Didn\u2019t Want to Exploit\u2019 Relationship With Winner Maddie Poppe\n\n'American Idol' Crowns Season 16 Winner\n\nRelated Gallery", "images": ["https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566846.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-04/GettyImages-1391924982.jpg?h=2b1a84fd&itok=RAcaH6JM", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/eto_a11_maddie_caleb_070518.jpg?h=e10a1838&itok=gI-bMJDl", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-568774.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/eto_a11_maddie_caleb_070518.jpg?h=e10a1838&itok=s_rPlvBy", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567192.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566171.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566831.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567063.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566604.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566844.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-569080.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567203.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567230.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567075.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/840x470/public/images/2022-09/GettyImages-1423504537_0.jpg?h=c2e28d05&itok=Szebg7jH", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566503.png", "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/60x60/public/images/2022-10/blundstone.png?h=808323c5&itok=rHo4tHPR", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-567077.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566814.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-568023.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566845.png", "https://media.amlg.io/image-assets/et/et+et_prod-image-566030.png"], "top_img": "https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/max_1280x720/public/images/2018-07/eto_a11_maddie_caleb_070518.jpg?h=e10a1838&itok=gI-bMJDl", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Zach Seemayer"], "canonical_link": "https://www.etonline.com/american-idol-lovebirds-maddie-poppe-and-caleb-lee-hutchinson-share-relationship-update-exclusive", "title": "'American Idol\u2019 Lovebirds Maddie Poppe and Caleb Lee Hutchinson Share Relationship Update (Exclusive)", "meta_data": {"article": {"opinion": "false"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "robots": "index", "description": "The cute couple are still going strong as they rehearse for the upcoming 'American Idol Live!
