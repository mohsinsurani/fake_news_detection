We\u2019ve been enjoying just being new parents and every new thing is so exciting for us. She\u2019s a little treasure.\u201d\n\nWant all the latest pregnancy and birth announcements, plus celebrity mom blogs?

They also took her traveling for the first time in January on a trip to St. Lucia.\n\n\u201cIt was awesome, but in hindsight, we probably should\u2019ve brought my mom or someone to babysit so we could have a little bit of alone time because that was tough,\u201d Tolbert says.\n\nFinding alone time to spend together in general is tough for the two these days, but Tolbert says that luckily his mom moved back to Kansas City, Missouri, and has become their \u201cresident babysitter.\u201d\n\n\u201cIf we do date nights, it\u2019s something easy like a movie where we\u2019re gone for a couple hours and then we always just end up talking about her anyway,\u201d Roper Tolbert says as her husband adds, \u201cThe first date we went on, we went to a movie and Jade started crying.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat was when she was really little,\u201d Roper Tolbert explains. \u201cShe was maybe 4 weeks old and the hormones, they get you. Now it\u2019s nice.\u201d\n\nFor more coverage, follow our babies magazine on Flipboard.\n\nRoper Tolbert\u2019s next trip will include a visit to see her fellow Bachelor in Paradise alum and best friend Carly Waddell at the end of March so she and Emerson can meet Waddell and husband Evan Bass\u2018 new baby girl, Isabella Evelyn, whom they welcomed on Feb. 15.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll get to meet her baby and see if they\u2019re little besties,\u201d she says. \u201cIt has been fun being able to relate to her because not a lot of my friends have babies yet.\u201d\n\nAs to how Roper Tolbert thinks Waddell will be as a mom, she says, \u201cI know she\u2019ll do great,\u201d adding, \u201cEven what I\u2019ve seen so far, you can already tell she has taken on motherhood so gracefully.\u201d\n\nLike Waddell and Bass, the Tolberts tied the knot in a televised ceremony in Mexico in February 2016. One day, they plan on sharing the story of how they met with Emerson.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s the first Paradise baby,\u201d Roper Tolbert says. \u201cShe has her own little Instagram account and so a lot of it has to do with that. I feel like someday she\u2019s going to want to know, \u2018Why are all of these people following me?\u2019 We\u2019ll have to eventually share the story.\u201d\n\nWhether they would let her go on one of The Bachelor franchises like her parents, Tolbert says, \u201cI don\u2019t know if the show will be around that long but if she wanted to, who are we to say no? It\u2019d be pretty hypocritical of us if we told her no.\u201d\n\n\u201cI would like to say, \u2018No, I wouldn\u2019t let her go on the show,\u2019 \u201d Roper Tolbert says. \u201cBut also, if that was something she was really interested in doing, then I would support her.\u201d\n\nDespite their busy new lives as parents, Tolbert is working on getting rid of his \u201cdad bod\u201d with Nutrisystem For Men.\n\n\u201cI didn\u2019t even realize that I had gained some weight during her pregnancy because I never used a scale or anything like that,\u201d he says. \u201cI wear a lot of sweatpants. I started Nutrisystem and lost 16 pounds in six weeks. I\u2019m back to my normal weight and feeling a lot better.\u201d\n\nPlus, their life might get even busier soon, as they both want additional kids. \u201cWe\u2019re definitely going to at least try to have some more,\u201d Tolbert says. \u201cWe\u2019re debating between three and four right now.\u201d\n\nRoper Tolbert agrees. \u201cHe wants that boy so if the next one\u2019s a boy, then we\u2019re probably going to have three.\u201d", "images":
