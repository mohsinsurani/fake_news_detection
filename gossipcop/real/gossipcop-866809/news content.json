Love makes you do f\u2014ed up things. Do you think anyone\u2019s proud of that? No. You don\u2019t f\u2014k with someone\u2019s heart and emotions.\u201d\n\nAs previously reported, the former couple\u2019s custody battle over 14-month-old daughter Dream got ugly when Chyna was granted a temporary restraining order against Rob in July 2017 after he went on an explicit Instagram rant in which he posted nude photos of her. They settled their custody agreement two months later.\n\n\u201cChyna is pleased that Rob has agreed to peacefully coparent Dream with her, as she has been requesting all along,\u201d Chyna\u2019s attorney Lisa Bloom told Us Weekly in a statement at the time, noting that the Arthur George sock designer does not have \u201cmore than 50 percent custody.\u201d\n\nWhile Chyna and Rob may have settled their custody drama, the exes are still tied up in legal drama over their canceled reality series, Rob & Chyna. As previously reported, the mother of two (she shares 5-year-old son King Cairo with ex Tyga) is suing Rob, Kim and their mother, Kris Jenner, claiming they were responsible for the cancellation of the E! series.\n\nKim, Rob and Jenner\u2019s attorney filed a demurrer on December 21, objecting to Chyna\u2019s lawsuit and asking for the lawsuit to be dropped. In the filing, the three Kardashians claimed the Lashed Bar owner\u2019s aforementioned restraining order prevented the filming and second season of Rob & Chyna.\n\nKUWTK airs on E! Sundays at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-kim-kardashian-blac-chyna-rob-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-kim-kardashian-blac-chyna-rob-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kim-and-khloe-kardashian-talk-blac-chyna-and-rob-legal-drama/", "title": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian Talk Blac Chyna and Rob Legal Drama", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-tags": "The Kardashians", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian talk about their brother Rob\u2019s legal drama with Blac Chyna in an upcoming episode of \u2018KUWTK\u2019 \u2014 see what they said", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian: Blac Chyna Is 'Taunting' Rob Amid Legal Drama", "description": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian talk about their brother Rob\u2019s legal drama with Blac Chyna in an upcoming episode of \u2018KUWTK\u2019 \u2014 see what they said", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/kim-and-khloe-kardashian-talk-blac-chyna-and-rob-legal-drama/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:03:55+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-kim-kardashian-blac-chyna-rob-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-kim-kardashian-blac-chyna-rob-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-01-11T21:40:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:03:55+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian: Blac Chyna Is 'Taunting' Rob Amid Legal Drama", "description": "Kim and Khloe Kardashian talk about their brother Rob\u2019s legal drama with Blac Chyna in an upcoming episode of \u2018KUWTK\u2019 \u2014 see what they said", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/khloe-kardashian-kim-kardashian-blac-chyna-rob-kardashian.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1051px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=47&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515706820.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
