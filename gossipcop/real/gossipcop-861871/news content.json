The rapper/producer, who was scheduled for an hour-long set, performed for less than 20 minutes before fans booed him off the stage, chanting for Yellow Claw, the next DJ, to take over.\n\n\u201cDue to technical difficulties beyond DJ Khaled and Insomniac\u2019s control, Khaled was not able to perform at his scheduled time on Sunday night at EDC,\u201d Insomniac CEO Pasquale Rotella said to Rolling Stone. \u201cHe arrived on time and ready to rock the crowd, but equipment issues delayed the performance. Even though there were technical difficulties, he still got onstage and showed his fans love.\u201d\n\nOn Instagram, Khaled reiterated that his EDC set was compromised by technical issues. \u201cThey cut my time short and they had me backstage for a hour and half and the sound kept breaking,\u201d he captioned a video clip. \u201cThen I heard my fans and I said I\u2019m go out even if the sound cuts off and even if they cut my time short \u2026 I\u2019m here for my fans even if the sound man and promoter don\u2019t have there stuff together I forgive them thoe love is the [key.]\u201d\n\n\u201cThey tried to sabotage my sound,\u201d Khaled said in another post. \u201cI still stood on stage wit no sound, and when they got the sound to work they want cut my set short \u2026 I still rep for my people,\u201d he continued. \u201cAnyone else would walk off stage.\u201dThe rapper continued his rant in a second post to Instagram, claiming that he was \u201csabotaged.\u201d\n\nThey?
