Rather, it\u2019s a grain-like seed that\u2019s gluten-free, packed with protein and, according to Lima, can help satisfy cravings for sweets and boost the metabolism. \u201cI\u2019ll mix [buckwheat] with hemp milk and honey, and I\u2019ll eat it hot or cold depending on how I feel,\u201d she says. \u201cEating buckwheat before bedtime actually helps you burn calories while you sleep.\u201d Breakfast: A bowl of oatmeal Midmorning snack: Piece of fruit Lunch: Protein \u2014 typically chicken or fish \u2014 Japanese yams and quinoa Afternoon snack: Raw almonds, raw cashews and dried cranberries Early dinner: Protein \u2014 typically chicken or fish \u2014 Japanese yams and quinoa Late-night snack: Buckwheat shake What she does before the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show: \u201cI actually don\u2019t change my workouts or diets,\u201d says the mother of two, who adheres to a strict regimen year-round and has walked in 15 Victoria\u2019s Secret shows previously. Favorite splurge: \u201cI have to have my cappuccino or latte every day, but I\u2019ll [sweeten it with] honey instead of sugar,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019m Brazilian, so I need that.\u201d The expert says: In theory, Lima\u2019s buckwheat can help boost the metabolism all night long. \u201cBecause it is high-fiber, your body could continue to keep working on [digesting] it when you\u2019re sleeping,\u201d says Amy Shapiro, a registered dietitian and nutritionist based in Manhattan. \u201cBut mostly it\u2019ll help with debloating.\u201d\n\nThe protein princess: Martha Hunt Anthony Behar Food philosophy: Meat and eggs \u2014 not salads \u2014 are the 27-year-old\u2019s go-tos for staying lean and toned. \u201cI have to add a lot more protein to my diet because I work out so much, doing things like weight training at Dogpound [the trendy Tribeca fitness studio], yoga and pilates,\u201d says Hunt, a North Carolina native who now lives in New York. \u201cI try to make sure to get protein in every meal.\u201d Breakfast: Eggs with spinach and avocado or a smoothie with almond butter Lunch: Salmon with a side of pumpkin Snack: Organic food bars \u2014 protein bars made with organic ingredients and sweetened with tapioca syrup \u2014 and almond butter. The latter is one of her favorite foods. \u201cI could eat [it] on everything,\u201d she says. Dinner: Chicken or salmon with a side of vegetables What she does before the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show: \u201cI try to eat less sugar and bread [two weeks] before the show,\u201d she says. Favorite splurge: Pizza. \u201cIf my body is really craving something, I don\u2019t deny it,\u201d says Hunt, a key member of Taylor Swift\u2019s squad. \u201cYou need to eat bad food in moderation. It\u2019s good for peace of mind.\u201d The expert says: \u201cWomen should aim for at least 46 grams of protein per day. If you\u2019re working out and trying to put on muscle, increase that,\u201d says Shapiro. But don\u2019t overdo it. \u201cAmericans are generally not deficient in protein . . . [and] in eating too much of it, you can leach your bones of some calcium [and] tax your kidneys.\u201d\n\nThe vegan vixen: Bridget Malcolm Victoria's Secret model Bridget Malcolm relies on a vegan diet to keep her abs perfectly toned. Kevin Kane/FilmMagic Food philosophy: \u201cI don\u2019t drink alcohol ever, really, and avoid refined sugars year-round,\u201d says Malcolm, who has also has been a vegan since 2009. Healthy tips: \u201cI always leave at least 12 hours between breakfast and dinner, and try to include a handful of almonds a day for vitamin E,\u201d says the 25-year-old Australia native, who lives in New York. \u201cAnd I follow the Japanese principle of \u2018Hara hachi bu,\u2019 which means, \u2018Eat until you are 80 percent full.\u2019 \u201d Secret weapon: She starts the day at 6 a.m. with a cup of black coffee and reishi and cordyceps mushrooms. Breakfast: A shake with Vega brand vegan chocolate protein blended with almond milk, ice, banana, kale and spinach Morning snack: Before working out at Body by Simone in the Flatiron District, she\u2019ll have a soy latte. Lunch: Four ounces grilled tempeh, stir-fried broccoli, peppers, carrots and kale in olive oil, ginger and tamari gluten-free soy sauce Afternoon snack: A pint of cherry tomatoes Dinner: Vegetable chili with sauteed onions, peppers, broccoli, spinach, canned tomatoes, cumin, paprika, turmeric, curry powder and cilantro Before-bed beverage: A glass of unsweetened almond milk with cacao powder and stevia What she does before the Victoria\u2019s Secret Fashion Show: \u201cI ensure my salt intake is low to avoid bloating,\u201d says Malcolm, who wed musician Nathaniel Hoho this past summer. \u201c[Also,] I don\u2019t have starches.\u201d Rule to live by: \u201cIf you don\u2019t recognize the ingredient in a food item, do not eat it.\u201d The expert says: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be vegan, you have to be educated about a vegan diet,\u201d says Shapiro. \u201cIf I work with vegans, they have to take [vitamin] B12 . . . because it\u2019s the only vitamin we can only get from animal products.\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/496621462.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=744", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/gone-wrong1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/chloe-grace-moretz-comp.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/EP.-6-wp-thumb_NEW-1.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/pitbull-mauling-317.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/monopoly.png?w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/77402615.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=744", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/04/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/16392680.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=744", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/77402615.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1024", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/jen-shah-417.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/rc_rachelhilbert_3_088.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=744"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2016/11/77402615.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Jordi Lippe-Mcgraw"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2016/11/29/victorias-secret-angels-reveal-their-diet-secrets/", "title": "Victoria\u2019s Secret Angels reveal their diet secrets", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
