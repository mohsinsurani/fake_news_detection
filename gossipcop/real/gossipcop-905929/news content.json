The former President and first lady were spotted helping her move into her dorm at the end of August 2017.\n\nObama went on to describe that his only task, delegated to him by his daughters, was to set up a desk lamp \u2013 and even that proved to be difficult for the emotional father.\n\n\u201cIt should have taken like five minutes or three minutes,\u201d he joked. \u201cIt had one of those wrenches \u2026 and it only had like four parts or something. I\u2019m sitting there just toiling away at this thing, it\u2019s taking half an hour. Meanwhile, Michelle\u2019s finished scrubbing and she\u2019s organizing closets. I was pretty pathetic.\u201d\n\nStill, he said he held it together until he and the former first lady were driving away from campus.\n\nMy Next Guest Needs No Introduction With David Letterman | Official Trailer [HD] | Netflix\n\n\u201cWhat\u2019s changed I think from when we were kids is technology,\u201d Obama told Letterman. \u201cSo I get home and she (Malia) knows I\u2019m pathetic, so she\u2019s texted me hearts, and, you know, so we are talking on a regular basis. When we were kids, you had to go down to the end of the hall of the dorm (to make a call).\u201d\n\nObama likened the entire move-in experience to \u201copen-heart surgery,\u201d as he previously said in an interview with WDEL radio.\n\nLetterman\u2019s interview with Obama, which was about an hour long, debuts on Netflix Friday. Other scheduled guests on Letterman\u2019s show include George Clooney, Malala Yousafzai, Jay-Z, Tina Fey and Howard Stern.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170926204544-obama-cries-over-malia-ebof-pkg-moos-00000216.jpg?q=x_173,y_71,h_869,w_1544,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180105122542-letterman-obama.jpg?q=x_3,y_188,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "https://i.ytimg.com/vi/ctBVhyZxXYY/hqdefault.jpg", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170628090958-saba-hamedy.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170823193255-malia-obama-starts-harvard-orig-00000000.jpg?q=x_0,y_0,h_1080,w_1919,c_fill/h_144,w_256"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180105122542-letterman-obama.jpg?q=x_3,y_188,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Saba Hamedy"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/12/politics/david-letterman-barack-obama-netflix-interview-malia-college-move-in/index.html", "title": "Obama on Malia's move-in day: 'I was basically useless'", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Obama on Malia's college move-in day: 'I was basically useless' | CNN Politics", "description": "Former President Barack Obama opened up about taking his daughter Malia to college last year, telling host David Letterman he was \"basically useless\" during the entire move-in process.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180105122542-letterman-obama.jpg?q=x_3,y_188,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/01/12/politics/david-letterman-barack-obama-netflix-interview-malia-college-move-in/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Obama on Malia's college move-in day: 'I was basically useless' | CNN Politics", "description": "Former President Barack Obama opened up about taking his daughter Malia to college last year, telling host David Letterman he was \"basically useless\" during the entire move-in process.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180105122542-letterman-obama.jpg?q=x_3,y_188,h_1684,w_2993,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@cnnpolitics"}, "description": "Former President Barack Obama opened up about taking his daughter Malia to college last year, telling host David Letterman he was \"basically useless\" during the entire move-in process.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "politics", "theme": "politics", "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-12T08:06:54Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-12T11:18:47Z", "tag": "barack obama, political figures - us, celebrities, david letterman, education, education systems and institutions, higher education", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "barack obama, political figures - us, celebrities, david letterman, education, education systems and institutions, higher education", "author": "Saba Hamedy", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515715200.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
