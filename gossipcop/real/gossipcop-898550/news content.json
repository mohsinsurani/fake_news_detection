These \u2018things\u2019 \u2014 nothing matters.\u201d\n\nThe Skirball Fire, which started in Los Angeles early Wednesday morning, is threatening multimillion dollar estates in neighborhoods including Bel Air, Brentwood and Mandeville Canyon, and is one of several fires currently plaguing the state. Michele says she plans on going to a friend\u2019s house until the fire is contained.\n\nFor the actress, THR\u2018s annual event, which occurred the same day she was evacuated, is a special time. \u201cI\u2019m so honored to be a woman on television right now, but especially in this era of such powerful and talented women,\u201d she says. \u201cI love this event every year where we can all get together and honor each other and the work that we\u2019re doing. It\u2019s really incredible and I always leave feeling so inspired. I\u2019m so happy to be here yet again, especially this year which has been such a monumental year for women.\u201d\n\nIN the above video, the Mayor star also reveals what she hopes 2018 brings, and what she believes is the most surprising thing to come out of the sexual harassment scandals in Hollywood.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/57bad2dd-ea16-402b-953e-b3d3bba12f41.png?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/57bad2dd-ea16-402b-953e-b3d3bba12f41.png?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lauren Huff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/lea-michele-talks-evacuating-her-house-california-fires-1065217/", "title": "Lea Michele Talks Evacuating From Her House Amid California Fires", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I had two minutes to think of what I can take and I grabbed my cat and that's all,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter at its annual Women in Entertainment breakfast.", "news_keywords": "Lea Michele, Women in Entertainment, Women in Entertainment 2017", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lauren Huff", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1065217, "title": "Lea Michele Talks Evacuating From Her House Amid California Fires", "published_at": "2017-12-06 16:46:37", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/57bad2dd-ea16-402b-953e-b3d3bba12f41.png?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Women in Entertainment 2017", "topics": "TV News", "body": "Lea Michele had \"two minutes\" to think about what she needed to take with her as she evacuated her house Wednesday morning amid the wildfires ravaging Southern California.\r\n\"I had two minutes to think of what I can take and I grabbed my cat and that's all,\" she told The Hollywood Reporter at its annual Women in Entertainment breakfast. \"It really doesn't matter, all you need is to surround yourself with the people that you love.
