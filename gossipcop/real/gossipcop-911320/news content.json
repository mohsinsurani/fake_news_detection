{"url": "https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-sneaker-brands/", "text": "There was a time not so very long ago when attending a special event in a pair of sneakers was a surefire way to flag yourself to your shiny-shoed peers as a sartorial pariah. However, sneakers are now en vogue, with the best sneaker brands constantly innovating new and stylish footwear. Attitudes have shifted in unforeseen ways and what was once the scruffy outlier is now the footwear gold standard.\n\nThe transition from running track to the runway has been a slow and gradual one, but in recent years it has reached a crescendo; a crescendo that looks set to blare on indefinitely. This is thanks in no small part to a number of key designers and best shoe brands who have been pushing footwear to its limits in every conceivable direction.\n\nSome have created white leather kicks that look right at home with tailoring. Others are inventing technology that might as well have come straight out of a lab at Area 51 (or just Back to the Future). Meanwhile, there are those who have elevated the sneaker from its utilitarian roots to the absolute pinnacle of high fashion it is today.\n\nHere we take a look at the most influential sneaker brands in the world right now and what they\u2019re doing to help elevate the world\u2019s favorite footwear.\n\nNike\n\nYeah, in 2016 Nike really did go back to the future and produced Marty McFly\u2019s self-lacing sneakers. But this is just one instance when the brand seemingly reached through a tear in spacetime and brought us something directly from the future, making it the biggest trendsetter in sneakers and a reliable barometer for what\u2019s around the corner.\n\nFounded in 1964 by University of Oregon track-and-field coach Bill Bowerman, the brand has a long track record of world-beating performance footwear as well as technological innovation (Flyknit uppers and NikeID personalization in the last decade). More than that, Nike knows how to create products that live up to their considerable hype. It has more icons in its back catalog than any other sneaker brand. Air Max, Air Force 1, and Air Jordan are all sneaker dynasties in their own right and go back further and you\u2019ll find even more classic retro sneakers like the Cortez and the Blazer.\n\nStill the most recognizable. Still the most wanted. Still, the ones to beat.\n\nAir Max 90 NikeShoe1 NikeShoe2jpg\n\nAdidas\n\nThe ongoing technological arms race between the world\u2019s sneaker brands the big hitters has produced some of the boldest innovations in footwear. Luckily for us, it doesn\u2019t show any sign of letting up.\n\nAsk any sneakerhead on the street who\u2019s in pole position, and they\u2019ll tell you it\u2019s Nike . However, with featherlight materials and mind-bending sole technology, it could be easily argued that good old three-stripes is maneuvering for an overtake. Established in 1949, Adidas has become a global phenomenon led by science.\n\nThere are the beloved classics \u2014 the Superstar, Stan Smith, and Gazelle all come to mind \u2014 and they\u2019re not going away, but in recent years the brand\u2019s R&D lab has become the sneaker world\u2019s Q branch. Forget the Yeezy collab, it was the Ultra Boost that changed the game, and most recently, the German sports giant has been experimenting with 3D printing as a production method for groundbreaking webbed sole units. Don\u2019t take your eyes off them for a second.\n\nAdidasSuperStar Adidas NMD_R1 Primeblue Adidas Ultraboost 22 Cold.Rdy\n\nConverse\n\nIt\u2019s incredible (and slightly terrifying) to think about how much the world has evolved in the last 100 years. Commercial flight, television, mobile phones, and the internet are just a few of the inventions that have revolutionized the way we live.\n\nWith that in mind, it\u2019s a real triumph of design when something introduced a century ago is still being used globally today.\n\nConverse\u2019s famous high-top, the Chuck Taylor All Star, is one such item. Born in 1917, the iconic basketball shoe has remained 99.9 percent unchanged and is now the best-selling shoe in the US, UK, and far beyond. Yes, this sneaker brand has other excellent shoes, like the Run Star Motion and the Chuck 70s, but this is arguably the most iconic sneaker ever made. And what\u2019s more, it\u2019s for everyone.\n\nConverse Chuck Taylor All Star Converse Chuck 70 Converse Future Utility Chuck Taylor All Star CX\n\nCommon Projects\n\nWhen luxury New York sneaker brand Common Projects first introduced its Achilles Low model in 2004, the menswear world went mad for it. But why? Was it innovative? No. Was it next-level comfortable? Hardly. Did it come in at bargain prices? Quite the opposite.\n\nThis shoe was nothing more than a plain, leather sneaker. However, the thing that had the fash pack fawning over this minimalist trainer was that every little detail was meticulously executed to the nth degree. This was a sneaker created like an Oxford shoe handcrafted in Northamptonshire.\n\nButtery Italian leather, exquisite streamlined shapeliness, and timeless wearability made each pair the perfect accompaniment to anything from a suit to shorts. It arguably started today\u2019s thriving luxury sneaker market, and all of this, in a world now dominated by Balenciaga beetle-crushers, is not to be taken for granted.\n\nAchilles Leather Sneakers Common Projects Track Classic Sneakers Achilles Leather High-Top Sneakers\n\nNew Balance As time marches on, there are fewer and fewer brands willing to take a financial bullet in the name of quality craftsmanship and have products manufactured on home turf. When talking about sneaker companies, the numbers are lower still. That\u2019s what makes New Balance one of the best in the game. Not only is the Bostonian firm responsible for some of the comfiest and most iconic running shoes ever made since 1906, but it also produces its premium range half in the US and half in the UK\u2019s Lake District in factories staffed with highly trained craftspeople. It\u2019s because of this approach to manufacturing that New Balance has a glowing reputation among athletes, sneakerheads, and just everyday folks. From their Fresh Foam Beacons to their 608s, the blend of dad style and modern hipster elite is here to stay, thus earning itself a spot in the FashionBeans hall of fame. New Balance 574v2 New Balance 327 NewBalance997H_BestSneaker Puma It may not make as much noise as some of its contemporaries, but while they\u2019re all battling it out trying to come up with the next big thing, Puma has been quietly working away in the background, perfecting the classics, since 1948. And inventing a few new ones, too. A prime example of this is the brand\u2019s take on the chunky sneaker trend. Puma has taken the look, put its own stamp on it, and made it accessible to those whose wallets might not be able to stand up to the strain posed by a luxury pair that cost as much as a month\u2019s rent. Turn to the Thunder Electric model for a bulky-but-athletic shape and bold nineties-esque color pops, or the covetable Tsugi line for a more stripped-back melding of mesh and neoprene atop a thick cushioned midsole. Puma Speedcat LS Motorsport PumaSuede-Classic-XXI-Mens-Sneakers2 PumaRSZ Vans From riding empty pools in suburban LA to jumping around on stage at the Warped Tour, Vans has earned itself a deserved reputation as the shoe brand of choice for alternative lifestyles. Its appeal is due in no small part to the simple styling, timeless appearance, modest pricing, and, of course, plentiful color options offered by its designs. The Old Skool, Classic and Authentic is all instantly recognizable designs that haven\u2019t changed in decades, mainly because they don\u2019t need to. What has changed is how people wear them. Once a shoe for kids and skaters only, it\u2019s now equally comfortable on rock stars and hip-hop icons, with jeans or casual suiting. From the mid-1960s right up to now, Vans has always offered people a way to add a dash of color and charisma to an outfit without breaking the bank. Something, which has seen its products remain relevant throughout the years, regardless of passing sneaker trends. VansOldSkoolLow VansHiTop VansCheckSlipon Reebok Okay, so it\u2019s not exactly shaping the future with its footwear offerings, but when you do the classics (and the Classics) this well, why would you need to? The British-born company, now a subsidiary of Adidas, is one of the oldest UK sneaker brands, having been established in 1958 as a partner company to an English sporting goods company \u2014 something which is evident when you look at its retro silhouettes. Its best sneakers, like the Club, the Classic, and the Workout are nothing short of iconic and all ooze plenty of that throwback charm we all love so much. They may not be made of knitted mesh and be 3D printed, but they look great, are undeniably comfortable, and are never going to go out of style. ReebokClassicWhite Pump Omni Zone II Classic Leather Legacy AZ Air Jordan Can you confidently call yourself a sneakerhead if your wardrobe isn\u2019t filled with Jordans? Perhaps not. Technically a Nike creation, but still a brand in its own right, the story is one of the most successful examples of sports marketing in history. After designing the first Air Jordans exclusively for the basketball legend himself, it wasn\u2019t long before Nike opened up production and brought its new creation to the masses in 1984 \u2014 before Jordan himself took over the brand. People went crazy for it, leading to a wave of crime in the US that led to people being robbed of their sneakers. One of the main draws to the shoes for some is the collectible element, with many special releases and collabs being issued in seriously limited runs. Some recent partnerships have included Supreme, Off-White, Levi\u2019s, and Kaws to name only a handful, making this one instance in which you definitely should believe the hype. Jordan Max Aura 3 Air Jordan 1 Low G Air Jordan 1 Mid\n\nBalenciaga\n\nBalenciaga\u2019s output under the guidance of Georgian fashion maverick Demna Gvasalia may be the sartorial equivalent of Marmite or Bj\u00f6rk, but whatever you think of his work, there\u2019s no denying he\u2019s changing the face of fashion, one broken ankle at a time.\n\nThe sleek, minimalist speed sock was the label\u2019s first standout sneaker with Gvasalia at the helm, which led the way to a few running sneakers from this luxury fashion house. But it was the now-inescapable Triple S that really took things in a new direction.\n\nThis beast of a shoe single-handedly remodeled the fashion footwear landscape and made big, chunky silhouettes the new gold standard. Minimalism is giving way to maximalism, and this Spanish fashion house is at the center of it all.\n\nSPEED LACE-UP SNEAKER Balenciaga Runner Sneaker ALLOVER LOGO TRIPLE S SNEAKER\n\nOliver Cabell\n\nChanging the sneaker game since 2015, Oliver Cabell has revolutionized the way we look at and think about designer kicks. With a plethora of high-end styles to choose from, sans the luxury good price markup, Oliver Cabell is one of the best sneaker brands in the world today as they\u2019ve made designer shoes accessible to the masses.\n\nBut not only are Oliver Cabell \u2018s sneakers impossibly stylish, but they make the perfect building blocks for a put-together outfit, whether you\u2019ll be spending the day out on the town or cooped up in the boardroom.\n\nCrafted with only the finest Italian leather using old-school techniques, it\u2019s safe to say that you\u2019ll never be disappointed with a pair of kicks from this life-changing sneaker brand.\n\nOliver Cabell Low 1 Military OC Low 1 OC GAT\n\nAsics\n\nThe Japanese brand of sneakers, Asics, has a massive and fiercely loyal following among runners and boasts a serious running pedigree \u2014 but just because you\u2019re not a runner, doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t benefit from these kicks. Established as Onisuka in 1949 (before becoming Asics, this company became the birthplace of, surprisingly, Nike . Founder Phil Knight sold Onitsuka running shoes out of a van before the swoosh was just a twinkle in a marketing man\u2019s eye \u2014 which then turned to lawsuits down the line. However, Asics still proves it has what it takes to provide both a functional and fashionable sneaker with their innovative and dependable daily trainer, Asics Gel-Kayano, and other models such as Gel-Odyssey, Gel-Pulse, and the GT-2000s. While you may want to save these shoes for the running trails (because hey, you can make an impression anywhere), these will still complete a casual look. AsicsGEL-VENTURE8_BestSneakerBrand AsicsGel-Kayano_BestSneakerBrands AsicsGEL-MCPLUS_BestSneakerBrands\n\nSalomon\n\nPlaying the French alps since 1947, this family-founded business didn\u2019t get into the sneaker game until much later. Originally a ski and boot company \u2014 and becoming a favorite for the Winter Olympics \u2014 Salomon has ventured out beyond the ski slopes to bring hiking boots, sneakers, and more to the population.\n\nSalomon is meant for the man who likes to be one with nature; a man who needs a sneaker brand that doesn\u2019t actually look like an athletic sneaker but can also handle the great outdoors. From their Cross Hike Gore-tex hiking sneaker to S/Lab Cross 2 trail running sneaker and even Sonic 4 Confidence road running sneaker, there is something for every athletic man out there.\n\nAxel Arigato\n\nA Swedish sneaker brand that\u2019s made a splash in the luxury market, Axel Arigato does not disappoint when it comes to footwear. Their timeless style hits a sweet spot between Swedish and Japanese design that\u2019s strikingly minimalist, but never boring.\n\nAnyone fashion-forward gentleman looking to update his sneaker game will greatly benefit from a pair of these kicks. A smattering of simple designs, a handful of neutral colors, and thoughtful details are what you can expect in the footwear department, ideal for the modern man looking for a new go-to sneaker brand.\n\nTake these shoes from the office to happy hour to an evening out on the town and rack up compliments along the way.\n\nAxelFlatClassic Marathon R-Trail Genesis Vintage Runner\n\nGucci\n\nGucci\u2019s sneaker game has come on leaps and bounds in the past few years, thanks in no small part to a bit of TLC from creative director Alessandro Michele.\n\nIn fact, it could be argued that the Italian house\u2019s offerings have set a new standard for luxury sneakers, with the clean lines and eye-catching embroidery of the Ace making it the new favorite white sneaker of the fashion elite.\n\nAnd it\u2019s not just classic styles that Gucci has been turning its hand to. The brand has also combined two of the moment\u2019s most significant trends with its chunky Rhyton trainer, featuring oversized Gucci branding to the side.\n\nGucci Ace Leather Sneaker GucciBasketSneaker Gucci Sneaker with Web\n\nYeezy\n\nWhether or not you love them or hate them, there is no denying that Kanye West\u2019s brainchild with Adidas has changed the course of sneaker trends over the past few years. Ever since the original Boost 750s dropped onto the market, knockoffs and imitations haven\u2019t stopped, with a whole new generation of sneaker trends desperately trying to tap into the market.\n\nOriginally in partnership with Nike , West decided to switch partners to maintain his control over his brand, with each launch spurring more and more designs. On top of sneakers, West also turned his brand into clothing, sometimes designing articles that could get you mixed up with a homeless person (if that\u2019s your aesthetic of course). But all in all, the shoes have stayed constant, with each new iteration building on the last and outdoing its predecessors with new high-end colorways.\n\nThe latest release was the Yeezy Knit Runner, which takes on the style of the Yeezy Foam Runner, but with mostly knit material. Continuing the trend of browns, beiges, and more, the colorway for these $200 sneakers is \u201cSulfur.\u201d From taking a stroll around town to even popping these bad boys on for an after-work happy hour, you are sure to impress.\n\nSaucony\n\nWith over 120 years of experience under its belt, Saucony knows better than most about what goes into crafting the perfect pair of kicks\n\nThe American brand\u2019s casual footwear really taps into the nostalgia, with bold colors acting as a nod to the \u201880s and \u201890, along with busy detailing and plenty of bright white hits to make any outfit pop. This is especially true for their Shadow 6000 model.\n\nNot really in the mood to go back to your childhood? Saucony has plenty of modern sneaker designs to keep your sneaker game on point, including their Excursion TR15 GTX, Omni Walker 3, and more.\n\nVeja\n\nMade recognizable by the Duchess of Sussex, Meghan Markle, Veja was originally founded in 2003 by two Frenchmen. Supported by a green supply-and-demand chain, these shoes can help you look fresh and keep the planet from its impending climate change doom.\n\nOutside of being an eco-friendly product, Veja also practices pretty radical transparency. Not only did the brand calculate its CO2 emissions, starting with the raw materials, accounting for transportation, the sneaker factories, and transportation for shipping, for the first time in 2019, but they have also released their carbon footprint for 2020.\n\nSustainability should never go out of style, just like how these vintage, yet practical designs haven\u2019t. From keeping with their classic design in models like the Esplar Leather White Marsala to honing in on high-tops, like V15-CWL, there is a sneaker for every occasion.\n\nLanvin\n\nLanvin may not have always been the calling card for modern-day CEOs, but they sure know how to set the bourgeoisie from the proletariats. From their chunky Curb Sneakers to their leather and cotton DBB1 sneakers, this luxury fashion was founded by Parisienne Jeanne Lanvin in 1889 (originally as a hat shop!).\n\nFrom there, the brand exploded into a lifestyle, with the rich and famous making sure everyone knows just who and what they can afford \u2014 and this is still true today. With each pair of sneakers averaging about $500 a pair, you want to make sure these shoes last forever. Luckily, their designs are both unique and dazzling, meaning it would be a worthy investment to have your feet looking this good.\n\nHoka One One\n\nThis niche running shoe brand released its first \u2018maximal\u2019 cushioned shoe in 2009, making their running sneakers some of the most comfortable on the market. The brand, founded by two former Salomon employees, not only appeals to athletes \u2014 it appeals to all people who crave both comfort and style.\n\nWith a range of designs, including the sleek and minimalist Gaviota 3 or something a bit more nostalgic and fun like the Bondi L Suede, Hoka isn\u2019t just for those who run miles each day. Instead, these are the type of comfy sneakers that can get you to the office, the club, the supermarket, and more without the aches and pains.\n\nFAQs About Sneaker Brands\n\nWhich brand makes the best sneakers?\n\nGucci are some of the best sneaker brands in the world.\n\nWhat is the most expensive sneaker?\n\nAccording to Guinness World Records, the most expensive sneakers sold at auction were a pair of Nike Air Jordan 1s worn by Michael Jordan in 1985, the shoes also feature his signature in permanent marker. They were sold on May 17, 2020, at an online Sotheby\u2019s auction bringing in a staggering $560,000 USD.\n\nThese shoes quickly took the title from a pair of 1972 Nike Waffle \u2018Moon Shoe\u2019 Racing Flat which fetched $437,500 USD at an in-person Sotheby\u2019s auction in 2019. The \u2018Moon Shoe\u2019 is one of the last 12 pairs in existence, hand-made by Nike co-founder Bill Bowerman.\n\nHowever, on April 26, 2021, in a private sale, a pair of Nike Air Yeezy Sample shoes sold for a whopping 1.8 million USD. The shoes were previously worn by Kanye West at the Grammy Awards in 2008.\n\nWhat is the most popular sneaker brand?", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-kMpkBqxCNfhNp.gif", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,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", "data:image/svg+xml;base64,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", "https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-deybson-mallony-4914808-500x248.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.fashionbeans.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/pexels-deybson-mallony-4914808-500x248.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Fashionbeans Editors"], "canonical_link": "https://www.fashionbeans.com/article/best-sneaker-brands/", "title": "The 20 Best Sneaker Brands You Can Buy in 2022", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The world's best sneaker brands are locked in a technological arms race and all-out hype warfare, but which ones are winning?
