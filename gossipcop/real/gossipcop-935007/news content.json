Brown) and Beth (Susan Kelechi Watson).\n\nOf course, in typical \u201cThis Is Us\u201d fashion, we now have even more questions than answers about everyone\u2019s favorite NBC family. Luckily, TheWrap was in attendance at the Dan Fogelman-created drama\u2019s third season premiere in Los Angeles Tuesday night, where we were able to get a few concrete teases out of Brown.\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3 Premiere: Showrunners Break Down Jack and Rebecca's Awful First Date\n\nThe star spilled on the mysterious \u201cher\u201d that is concerning Future Tess and Future Randall, gave some intel on an upcoming episode that is all about Beth (and how awkward Randall was when he first met her) and told us his character is going to make yet another career change this year.\n\nSee our interview with Brown below.\n\nTheWrap: OK, Tess and Randall are going to see \u201cher\u201d in the future, but if it\u2019s someone that is important to them, wouldn\u2019t it be someone who is important to Annie and Deja, too? Where are they?\n\nBrown: OK, that\u2019s a good question, that\u2019s a very astute question. That\u2019s the first time that\u2019s been asked. Good for you. [laughs]\n\nThank you!\n\nThere\u2019s a reason why he had to seek out Tess, in particular. Yes, there\u2019s a reason why he had to seek out Tess in particular, because Tess hadn\u2019t seen the \u201cher\u201d for some time. And so there\u2019s a reason why it\u2019s time to go and she\u2019s like, \u2018I can\u2019t.\u2019 There\u2019s a reason. Other people may have been more easily galvanized, but Tess needed a little more coaxing.\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us:' Sterling K Brown Tells Us Why Randall 'Had to Seek Out Tess' to Visit 'Her'\n\nIt also seems like someone who is important to Toby, because Randall called him, right?\n\nYeah, Toby is part of our family now. So anybody who Randall cares about, Tobias would obviously care about as well. That\u2019s my brother. [laughs] I can evade all day!\n\nBeth and Randall have some really cute banter in this episode, and every episode, do you and Susan come up with any of that yourselves?\n\nOprah is written, but we come up with some stuff from time to time. Like if we just want to insert a little bit more Afro-Americaness to it, we have freedom to do it. And they have freedom to cut it if they don\u2019t like it, but we gonna do it anyway! Know what I\u2019m saying? [laughs].\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us' Season 3: Milo Ventimiglia Hints Jack's Little Brother Nicky Has Some Real Issues\n\nIs Randall going to have any changes in his employment this year? He made so many big decisions to quit and buy that building last year.\n\nHe did, in buying the building. And then there is another possible turn that transpires fairly early on in the season as well. Something that he wouldn\u2019t have seen himself doing willingly, but he sort of feels compelled to do it by circumstances. I can\u2019t say too much about it. It\u2019s something that surprised me because I was like, \u2018Ah, I didn\u2019t see this happening for this character!\u2019 But the circumstances that lead him to this possible career shift make sense. And that\u2019s all I can say about that.\n\nWe hear there are three standalone episodes for the significant others this season (Beth, Toby and Miguel). Do you know what we\u2019re going to learn in Beth\u2019s yet?\n\nSo I was in the writers\u2019 room when they were breaking Beth\u2019s story and I actually like texted Sue to be like, \u2018Here come your episode!\u2019 It\u2019s really good and you get a real wonderful sense of ,like, how she came up. Like Beth as a young girl. What her passions were and how they sort of shifted over time. Yeah, it\u2019s great. And it\u2019s long overdo for everybody. For Toby, for Sue, for Miguel.\n\nAlso Read: 'This Is Us': Mandy Moore Hints Season 3 Premiere Reveals More About Randall's 'Her'\n\nThere\u2019s so many talented people on this show. And what I love about Dan is that he doesn\u2019t feel obligated to cram all of us into every episode. But some stories require that each person get their own time to be fully fleshed-out. And so now we\u2019ve all had that as the Pearsons, and now our significants are getting that time as well. And it\u2019s just sort of like enamors you to them even more \u2014 even Miguel.\n\nWe learned tonight Jack and Rebecca did not have a fairy tale first date, can we assume that when Randall first meets Beth it doesn\u2019t go smoothly either?\n\nOh, there is nothing smooth about Randall Pearson in the present day, so definitely nothing smooth about him in the past. He says things like LL Cool K. So Randall trying to actually put the moves on somebody \u2014 like, I think Beth is pretty cool. She\u2019s cool. So it\u2019s not going to be pretty, but you know he made it work, baby! [laughs]\n\nAlso Read: Mandy Moore Aces Fallon's 'This Is Us'-'A Walk to Remember' Quotes Quiz (Video)\n\nSo, yeah, I\u2019m sure it will be comedy. And unfortunately for me and for Sue we won\u2019t get to do it. So I entrust Niles [Fitch, who plays teen Randall] with bringing all of the awkwardness to that initial meet that he can. And I\u2019ll give him some pointers on how to be really strange, because he\u2019s probably cooler than I am. But it\u2019s gonna be fun to see.\n\nYou can read TheWrap\u2018s interview with \u201cThis Is Us\u201d co-showrunners Isaac Aptaker and Elizabeth Berger about the Season 3 premiere here.\n\n\u201cThis Is Us\u201d airs Tuesdays at 9/8c on NBC.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Jennifer-Maas-96x96.jpeg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/This-Is-Us-Jack.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/newsletter-filled.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/account.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/ig_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/gopro.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/search.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/login.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/thewrap-film-slate.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/yt_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/all-white-logo.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NUP_183539_0066.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/newsletter.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0815_TheWrap_Cover_768x922px.jpg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/mobile/mobile-footer-promotion.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/fb_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo_Small.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-black.svg", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/plugins/contextual-links/assets/img/loading.gif", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/wrappro/arw-rt.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/First-Take-Logo-Stacked.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Image-2022-04-26-at-3.00.43-PM-300x81.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/logo-dark.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/thewrap-logo-alt.svg"], "top_img": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NUP_183539_0066.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jennifer Maas"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thewrap.com/this-is-us-season-3-premiere-sterling-k-brown-beth-her-susan-kelechi-watson-tess/", "title": "\u2018This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You\u2019ve Been Waiting for", "meta_data": {"viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=6.0, user-scalable=yes", "msapplication-TileColor": "#f9f9f9", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "parsely-title": "\u2018This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You\u2019ve Been Waiting for", "parsely-link": "https://www.thewrap.com/this-is-us-season-3-premiere-sterling-k-brown-beth-her-susan-kelechi-watson-tess/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-pub-date": "2018-09-25T21:50:54-07:00", "parsely-section": "tv", "parsely-author": "Jennifer Maas", "parsely-tags": "dan_fogelman, nbc, sterling-k-brown, susan-kelechi-watson, this-is-us", "pubexchange": {"image": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NUP_183539_0066-160x105.jpg"}, "description": "NBC drama star also gives TheWrap some intel on \"her\" and Randall's employment prospects in Season 3", "robots": "follow, index, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1, max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'This Is Us': Sterling K Brown Tells Us All About the Beth-Centric Episode You've Been Waiting for", "description": "NBC drama star also gives TheWrap some intel on \"her\" and Randall's employment prospects in Season 3", "url": "https://www.thewrap.com/this-is-us-season-3-premiere-sterling-k-brown-beth-her-susan-kelechi-watson-tess/", "site_name": "TheWrap", "updated_time": "2018-09-25T22:58:11-07:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NUP_183539_0066.jpg", "secure_url": "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/NUP_183539_0066.jpg", "width": 618, "height": 412, "alt": "This is Us -
