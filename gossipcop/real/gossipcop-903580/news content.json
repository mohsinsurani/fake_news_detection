I speak for everyone at NBC, here\u2019s to the Nine-Nine!\u201d\n\nFox also canceled its comedies The Mick and Last Man on Earth before announcing that it would be reviving Tim Allen\u2019s Last Man Standing from the dead (which, to say the least, feels like something of a telling move in our brave new post-Roseanne revival world). But it was Brooklyn Nine Nine\u2019s cancellation that drew the most visible outrage, with fans from Lin Manuel Miranda(!) to Mark Hamill(!!) to Guillermo Del Toro(?!) expressing their love for the show and hope that it could be saved.\n\nRENEW BROOKLYN NINE NINE\n\nI ONLY WATCH LIKE 4 THINGS\n\nTHIS IS ONE OF THE THINGS#RenewB99 \u2014 Lin-Manuel Miranda (@Lin_Manuel) May 10, 2018\n\nOh NOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!! I'm SO not ready to say #ByeBye99. Be forewarned @FOXTV-when networks dump shows I love, I'm known for holding grudges a long, L-O-N-G time. I'm still mad @CBS didn't renew #SquarePegs! #EverythingILikeGetsCancelled https://t.co/NEry6Hrpng \u2014 Mark Hamill (@HamillHimself) May 10, 2018\n\nBrooklyn Nine-Nine has given us fully human characters, beautiful, powerful, flawed, vulnerable, majestic... In whichever form, B99 must return. It will. And I will be there to watch. And, it is my hope that I hope that, this time, a lot more people do too. \u2014 Guillermo del Toro (@RealGDT) May 11, 2018\n\nBut for now, they and all of Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019s fans can rest easy. Here\u2019s to at least 13 more episodes of sharp jokes, loving friendship, and maybe one more Halloween heist directed by devoted fan and Oscar-winner Del Toro (hey, a girl can dream).", "images": ["data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAUEBAAAACwAAAAAAQABAAACAkQBADs", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/B23ox8x26e-eLk_d6suKoj6IlwE=/0x0:1280x720/1200x800/filters:focal(544x122:748x326)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59713605/b99_cast.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71466750/GettyImages_1243654244.0.jpeg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71468545/1243767428.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71467244/VDC_VBD_012_THUMB_SYN.0.jpeg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1mQKYE1QMBOiOz_KYA0y7xoDqs=/0x0:1280x670/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10827015/b99_cast.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71469964/GettyImages_1055017430a.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71466958/GettyImages_1241762727.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/71466194/1241919618.0.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/T1mQKYE1QMBOiOz_KYA0y7xoDqs=/0x0:1280x670/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/10827015/b99_cast.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Caroline Framke", "Rebecca Leber", "Jonathan Guyer", "Christophe Haubursin", "Andrew Prokop", "Umair Irfan", "May"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/culture/2018/5/12/17347612/brooklyn-nine-nine-99-canceled-cancelled-nbc-revived-season-6", "title": "NBC has saved Brooklyn Nine-Nine a day after Fox canceled it", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2018-05-12T09:51:22-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-05-12T09:51:22-04:00"}, "author": "Caroline Framke", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/ff4dfa009ef17ae1c4f5b58aee1eab98/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "It\u2019s official: The beloved comedy will have a new home for season 6.
