Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\nMeghan Markle currently has one of the most enviable wardrobes on the planet, but she\u2019s always had impeccable taste, even before she was a royal. It was once immortalized on her lifestyle site, the Tig (rest in peace), and now it\u2019s immortalized in thousands of photos, Instagrams, and blogs devoted to what the Duchess of Sussex wears on any given day.\n\nAnd of course, everyone wants to shop like Meghan. We\u2019ll be rounding up her best outfits and where to buy the exact pieces so you can build out your Duchess of Sussex wardrobe. All that\u2019s left is the messy bun and royal title.\n\nMeghan in London, England\n\nMeghan will be the royal patron of four lucky charities, according to a recent announcement. She visited one of them, Smart Works, where she styled some women for job interviews. It\u2019s all very exciting, but for a moment let\u2019s focus on her shoes. The duchess, while doing the very royal act of becoming a patron of an organization, wore some very fun but non-royal shoes. Her cow-hide and Lucite heels are by Gianvito Rossi, and they are incredible.\n\nPhoto: Clodagh Kilcoyne/WPA Pool/Getty Images\n\nEven better, she paired them with a relatively inexpensive (for a royal) dress from trendy maternity brand Hatch. It\u2019s still available on Shopbop, FYI. She finished the outfit with a gorgeous Oscar de la Renta coat, which is as beautiful and bouncy as her sister-in-law\u2019s hair. Get the look (or a facsimile) below.\n\nMeghan in Auckland, New Zealand\n\nFinally, Meghan and Harry have welly wanged. Apparently, Meghan and her team of schoolchildren of Auckland defeated Harry and his team. Welly wanging is a sport where you try to throw a rainboot (Wellington boot) as far as possible. The royals frequently participate in Welly Wanging \u2013 Kate Middleton often does it in heels \u2013 and it\u2019s always thoroughly enjoyable. Anyways, to play the game Meghan wore a pair of J. Crew jeans, a simple scoop neck t-shirt and a Karen Walker blazer with a pair of wellington boots. Business on top, serious sportsman on the bottom.\n\nPhoto: Karwai Tang/WireImage/Getty Images\n\n\ud83d\udcfd The Duchess of Sussex\u2019s red team won the welly wanging contest, beating The Duke\u2019s yellow team! #RoyalVisitNZ pic.twitter.com/D5REmCCJfM \u2014 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@KensingtonRoyal) October 30, 2018\n\nMeghan, as per usual, had two other outfit changes that day. She arrived in Auckland in a mono-chromatic beige look. She wore a custom shift dress from American designer Brandon Maxwell, a trench coat by Burberry with Bishop sleeves, and Stuart Weitzman heels. She re-wore the heels later that night to a dinner with New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern along with a navy-blue dress by Antonio Berardi. Sadly, those pieces are sold out, but shop her welly wanging look below.\n\nFrom left: Meghan Markle and Prince Harry at a reception in Auckland.

The second day in Wellington, the two started the day in a caf\u00e9, where they met with young New Zealanders passionate about mental-health initiatives. Meghan, ever down-to-earth, wore a Club Monaco trench coat and turtleneck sweater. It\u2019s an easy fall look to re-create. The trench from Club Monaco is sold out, but there\u2019s a doppleganger on sale.\n\nPhoto: Ian Vogler/Getty Images\n\nThat night, Meghan and Harry went to hang out with some performance artists as part of an event for Courtey Creative. Meghan and Harry did not show up in costume, sadly. Instead, Meghan wore a customized dress by Maggie Marilyn. The dress normally comes with puffed sleeves, which the duchess had removed. Naturally she finished the look with Manolo BB heels.\n\nPhoto: Samir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nMeghan in Tonga, Day 2\n\nAnother day, another three outfits. Meghan started out the day in a dress by Martin Grant, the same designer who made the long striped dress that she wore to the Anti-Bad Vibes circle in Sydney. The fluffy A-line skirt is a usual silhouette for the duchess, but it looked very princess-y. Especially when paired with \u2014 what\u2019s that? \u2014 another pair of Manolo Blahnik BB pumps, this time in olive suede.\n\nThe Duke and Duchess of Sussex held a meeting with the Prime Minister of Tonga, Akilisi Pohiva. #RoyalVisitTonga pic.twitter.com/C0LnBCoWQJ \u2014 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@KensingtonRoyal) October 25, 2018\n\nLater in the day she changed into a Veronica Beard sky blue dress (currently sold out) to finish out her time in Tonga. Upon arrival back in Australia for the Australian Geographic Society awards, she wore an Oscar de la Renta pre-fall 2018 gown decorated with birds. How apt for the nature awards.\n\n\ud83c\uddf9\ud83c\uddf4 M\u0101l\u014d Tonga! Thank you for an unforgettable visit! #RoyalVisitTonga pic.twitter.com/bAhxUvuKf0 \u2014 The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge (@KensingtonRoyal) October 26, 2018\n\nPhoto: James D. Morgan/Getty Images for Australian Geog\n\nMeghan in Tonga\n\nMegs looked very bridal in a custom Theia dress when she and Harry went to a reception for the King of Tonga. (When you\u2019re a princess, you get to wear a wedding dress on a regular Thursday night.) She wore the dress with a pair of Aquazzura bow-tie heels, which are probably her second-favorite shoe after the Manolo BB pumps in navy suede. Finishing the outfit was Princess Diana\u2019s aquamarine ring, which Meghan also wore during the royal wedding 2.0.\n\nPhoto: Pool/Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nPhoto: Rex/Shutterstock/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nEarlier in the day, the Duchess wore red. The red dress by Self Portrait is not yet available (and Meghan had the hem tailored to a custom length), but it is available for pre-order. True Meghan stans will not only get the dress, but also custom-tailor the dress\u2019s hem, just like she did.\n\nPhoto: Samir Hussein/WireImage\n\nMeghan in Suva, Fiji\n\nPhoto: Ian Vogler/WireImage\n\nIt\u2019s hard to decide what\u2019s best about this outfit \u2014 Meghan, her cape, or her little baby bump. It\u2019s all so good. The dress is from Safiyaa, a brand known for its bold colors and sharp tailoring. It\u2019s just form-fitting enough to accentuate her lower torso \u2014 a great choice for a state dinner, in the opinion of someone who has never attended a state dinner.\n\nMeghan in Sydney, Australia\n\nPhoto: Chris Jackson/Getty Images for the Invictus Games Foundation\n\nWhile watching sailing with Prince Harry during the Invictus Games, Meghan wore Vejas \u2014 a favorite sneaker among hypebeasts and sustainable fashion bloggers (who generally have little in common otherwise). The oracle of Meghan Markle\u2019s fashion, Meghan\u2019s Mirror, guessed that the jeans were the pair from Outland Denim that she had worn in the tour, which are ethically made.\n\nPhoto: REX/Shutterstock\n\nIt wasn\u2019t the first time this weekend that Markle embraced sustainable style. To be fair, she\u2019s wearing many Australian designers and many Australian designers are more eco-friendly. But, she also wore an American favorite on a trip to Fraser Island. The Duchess wore a Reformation sundress with a thigh-high slit and messy bun. The dress is currently out of stock.\n\nPhoto: Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\nThe fourth sustainable designer Meghan wore over the weekend (and Monday in Australia) was Stella McCartney, the same designer who made her second wedding dress. Markle paired the navy cape dress with a coat by Gillian Anderson for the opening ceremony of the Invictus Games.\n\nMeghan in Bondi Beach, Sydney\n\nPhoto: Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nLike anyone visiting Sydney, the Sussexes visited the famous Bondi Beach. The two sat with plastic flower leis in a \u201cno bad vibes\u201d circle that concluded in a group hug. That\u2019s how they do it in Australia. Meghan kicked off her wedges for a brief moment and wore a gorgeous dress from Australian designer Martin Grant.\n\nMeghan in Melbourne, Australia\n\nPrince Harry and Meghan Markle. Photo: Karwai Tang/WireImage\n\nOn a trip to Melbourne, Meghan played rugby in stilettos and then smartly changed into flats for the beach, and another shift dress. The dresses look almost identical, but I\u2019m assuming HRH wanted to match the navy dress to the navy shoe and the black dress to the black shoe. Shop the look below.\n\nMeghan in Dubbo, Australia\n\nPhoto: Samir Hussein/Samir Hussein/WireImage/Getty Images\n\nThis is Meghan\u2019s banana bread\u2013making outfit. The jeans are from eco-friendly Australian brand Outland denim and the blazer is from her friend Serena Williams\u2019s collection. The look is very classic, especially with a slicked-back ponytail.\n\nIf you buy something through our links, New York may earn an affiliate commission.", "images":
