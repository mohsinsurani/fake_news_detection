News confirmed that the 28-year-old pop star recently paid $9.75 million for a 3,540-square-foot, second-floor unit in the same Tribeca building as the sprawling, 8,000-square-foot penthouse she purchased for $19 million back in 2014.\n\nSwift also owns the three-story townhouse next door, which, thanks to that property's hefty $18 million price tag, brings the \"End Game\" singer's investment in the single block to a staggering $47.7 million.\n\nDimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images\n\nSo what could she possibly need with all that space? Neighborhood insiders speculate that the songstress, who also owns property in Nashville, Rhode Island, and Beverly Hills, hopes to knock out a wall or two to connect her new apartment to the townhouse next door.\n\nThough approval from the city is bound to prove difficult, Swift likely has her heart set on creating the ultimate squad hangout complete with easy access to the townhouse's paparazzi-proof garage.\n\nAfter all, it's Taylor's world\u2014we're just living in it.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/https://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/684xflex/public/images/2017/11/111017-taylor-swift-lead_0.jpg?itok=9Sc2BE9e", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://www.instyle.com/img/covers/newsletter-signup-bg.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top2_205_thumb.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/images/2017/11/111017-taylor-swift-lead_0.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111017-taylor-swift-lead_0.jpg?itok=Hl4tIsYK", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://subscription-assets.timeinc.com/current/1232_top1_205_thumb.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111017-taylor-swift-lead_0.jpg?itok=Hl4tIsYK", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Meghan Overdeep"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449/http://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-new-nyc-apartment", "title": "Taylor Swift Purchases New Apartment in N.Y.C.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=1, minimum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "keywords": "latest,News,Celebrity,Home & Decorating,Taylor Swift", "news_keywords": "taylor swift, taylor swift tribeca, taylor swift new york city, taylor swift nyc apartment", "description": "Taylor Swift paid\u00a0$9.75 million for a\u00a03,540-square-foot, two-story unit in the same Tribeca building as the sprawling, 8,000-square-foot penthouse.", "og": {"title": "Taylor Swift Expands N.Y.C.\u00a0Real Estate Empire with New $10 Million Apartment", "type": "article", "site_name": "InStyle.com", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449/http://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-new-nyc-apartment", "description": "Welcome to New York, indeed!", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111017-taylor-swift-lead_0.jpg?itok=Hl4tIsYK"}, "pinterest": {"url": "http://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-new-nyc-apartment", "description": "Taylor Swift paid\u00a0$9.75 million for a\u00a03,540-square-foot, two-story unit in the same Tribeca building as the sprawling, 8,000-square-foot penthouse.", "media": "http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111017-taylor-swift-lead_0.jpg?itok=Hl4tIsYK"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://www.instyle.com/news/taylor-swift-new-nyc-apartment", "title": "Taylor Swift Expands N.Y.C.\u00a0Real Estate Empire with New $10 Million Apartment", "description": "Welcome to New York, indeed!", "site": "@InStyle", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180207200449im_/http://cdn-img.instyle.com/sites/default/files/styles/622x350/public/images/2017/11/111017-taylor-swift-lead_0.jpg?itok=Hl4tIsYK"}, "fb": {"app_id": 1846286175658788, "pages": 18938064984}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
