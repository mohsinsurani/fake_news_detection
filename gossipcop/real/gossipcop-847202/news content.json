The clip shows the duo\u2014who married in a romantic ceremony in the English countryside last July\u2014enjoying some sweet together time by the beach, being playful on the swings, and walking hand-in-hand along the ocean. \"You bring us peace,\" Ciara wrote alongside the video.\n\nThe documentary-style clip also shows Wilson taking photographs of his pregnant wife on the sandy shores, one of which Ciara used soon thereafter to announce the birth of their daughter. The shot features Ciara in all white, kneeling and cradling her stomach, and looking out at the ocean waves. \"Dear Sienna Princess Wilson,\" the caption on the photo reads. \"No matter how big the wave, we will always be your calm in the storm. We Love You.\" In addition to that sweet message, Ciara also shared Sienna's birth date and time (April 28 at 7:03 P.M.) and weight (7 pounds 13 ounces) with the stunning photograph.\n\nSienna is Ciara and Wilson's first child together. (Ciara has a son, Future Zahir, with her former fianc\u00e9, rapper Future.) The birth of Sienna caps off a whirlwind two years for the couple, who began dating in April 2015, were engaged in March 2016, got married in July, and then announced they were pregnant in October with a beautiful Instagram shot of Wilson embracing Ciara's growing belly. Sending lots of well wishes their way!\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nRelated:", "images": ["https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.64f3bdc15b1f321829f9f30c7853a1469f469d71.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/59073c6a6a37201b09a57890/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-647697118.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/632b0fd23e2e4433ed2425f0/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631a4745efc57ba7e5040843/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631b36a9051a0fa69a4de64d/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/632b711639c8261bac7b16f8/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6329d5ed4c24a85c9a79651a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631f83ea4576363a4b19dbb4/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631b81f2dcf282d0265a4ebd/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.22fddcfca2f2de42711a84ec66a5157a9995d8ab.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/59073c6d9fa6662ed53beefd/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ciara-baby.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/632cb3fb09ded7ae04e7dd3a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59073c6d9fa6662ed53beefd/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ciara-baby.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Lynsey Eidell"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/ciara-documents-final-days-of-pregnancy-with-instagram-video", "title": "Ciara Celebrated Her Daughter's Birth in the Most Blissful Way", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Ciara shared an Instagram video documenting how she spent the final days of her pregnancy before her daughter, Sienna Princess Wilson, was born.", "id": "59073a5ac0e0263d82eef6b5", "keywords": "ciara,russell wilson,news,pregnancy", "news_keywords": "ciara,russell wilson,news,pregnancy", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59073a5ac0e0263d82eef6b5", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Ciara shared an Instagram video documenting how she spent the final days of her pregnancy before her daughter, Sienna Princess Wilson, was born.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59073c6a6a37201b09a57890/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-647697118.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59073c6a6a37201b09a57890/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-647697118.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The singer gave birth on April 28.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59073c6d9fa6662ed53beefd/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ciara-baby.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Ciara Celebrated Her Daughter's Birth in the Most Blissful Way", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/ciara-documents-final-days-of-pregnancy-with-instagram-video"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-05-01T14:36:14.056Z", "modified_time": "2017-05-01T14:36:14.056Z", "author": "Lynsey Eidell"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "The singer gave birth on April 28.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59073c6d9fa6662ed53beefd/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/ciara-baby.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "Ciara Celebrated Her Daughter's Birth in the Most Blissful Way"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493649374.056, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
