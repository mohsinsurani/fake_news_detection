Therefore, these acts do not have a determined average score.\n\n^2 MiniRequest, Kings Unite & Rhythmatic were the only groups not to have a full performance featured during their time on the show.\n\nQualifiers [ edit ]\n\nIn each round of the Qualifiers, the dance acts will perform a 2-minute routine in front of the judges and a live audience. They will be scored by the judges in 5 categories: Performance, Technique, Choreography, Creativity & Presentation. Each category is worth 20 points with a perfect score of 100. For the dance act to progress forward, they must receive an average score of 80 or higher.\n\nColor key:\n\nContestant was eliminated\n\nPart 1: May 30 [ edit ]\n\nPart 2: June 6 [ edit ]\n\nPart 3: June 13 [ edit ]\n\nThe Duels [ edit ]\n\nIn each round of The Duels, two acts in the same division compete for a spot in the next round. In each division, the acts with the top qualifying scores choose their opponents, then both acts perform back-to-back, receiving feedback from the judges. After each performance, the judges will score them in the 5 categories: Performance, Technique, Creativity, Choreography & Presentation. Unlike the Qualifiers, only the final average for each act is shown. The act with the highest average at the end of the duel moves on to the next round, the other faces immediate elimination.\n\nQualifying Acts Rank Upper Team Junior Name Score Name Score Name Score 1 Les Twins 95.7 Kinjaz 91.0 The Lab 91.3 2 Fik-Shun 91.0 Swing Latino 89.3 Diana Pombo 89.7 3 Pasi\u00f3n 87.7 Chapkis Dance Family 89.0 D'Angelo & Amanda 88.3 4 Nick Daniels 87.0 Super Cr3w 88.0 Eva Igo 88.0 5 Luka & Jenalyn 86.7 Jabbawockeez 86.7 The Mihacevich Sisters 87.0 6 Quick Style 86.7 Ian Eastwood and the Young Lions 83.7 KynTay 85.7 7 DNA 86.0 Royal Flux \u2013 The Posse 84.0 8 Keone & Mari 85.0 Rouge \u2013 Immabeast \u2013 9 Kyle Van Newkirk 80.7 Miami All-Stars 81.0 Boys of Temecula 80.3 10 Kings Unite \u2013 Stroll Grove \u2013 Mini ReQuest \u2013 11 \u2013 \u2013 Rhythmatic \u2013 \u2013 \u2013\n\nSong Not Shown -\n\n\n\n\n\nThe Cut [ edit ]\n\nIn The Cut, the 15 remaining acts compete for two spots in each of their divisions.

For this round, each of the judges became mentors for one of the divisions; Jennifer worked with the Juniors, Derek worked with the Upper acts and Ne-Yo worked with the Teams.
