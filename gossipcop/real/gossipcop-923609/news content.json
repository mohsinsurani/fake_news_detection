The reason for dropping her $5 million dollar lawsuit? She reached a settlement.\n\nClaims of the Lawsuit\n\nLast October, Abraham claimed that she was cut from the show because of her work in the adult entertainment industry. So, in February, she filed a lawsuit against Viacom (MTV's parent company), Teen Mom OG's production companies, and Morgan J. Freeman (one of the show's executive producers) claiming that she was \"sex shamed\" because of her career in adult entertainment. The lawsuit claimed harassment, wrongful termination based upon gender discrimination, and retaliation based upon gender discrimination.\n\nAbraham claimed in her lawsuit that right before she was \"fired\" from the show, Freeman and his production crew \"harassed, humiliated, discriminated against, disrespected, ridiculed, degraded, and sex shamed\" Abraham for \"her recent decision to pursue opportunities in the adult entertainment industry.\" Abraham also claimed that Freeman made threats against her about \"ending her career with MTV, sabotaging future deals Ms. Abraham had in place with MTV, and defaming her.\"\n\nSettling the Lawsuit\n\nAbraham filed papers on Tuesday stating that she was voluntarily dismissing with prejudice all of the claims she had made in her lawsuit after reaching a settlement with the defendants. The terms of the settlement are unknown, as they haven't been made public. While none of the defendants made any comments regarding the settlement, Abraham had this to say:\n\n\"As my MTV executives, crew, cast have all bought my branded products over the years I know my truth of being Farrah Abraham the loving mother and protector of my family and I fight for what is right and creating a better, safer world. I encourage all adults to have a healthy sex life to not be sex shamed and feel sexually liberated.\"\n\nRelated Resources:", "images": ["https://images.findlawresources.com/image/upload/e_blur:500,q_1,f_auto/e_grayscale/v1598384000/resources/flfe/icons/thomsonreuters-logo.png", "https://images.findlawresources.com/image/upload/if_w_gte_1000,w_1000,q_auto:best/if_else,q_auto:best/v1623671161/aemwp-prod/content/dam/blogs/placeholders/Celebrity_Justice2.jpg", "https://blogs.findlaw.com/wp-content/themes/findlaw/assets/img/star-bubble.png"], "top_img": "https://images.findlawresources.com/image/upload/if_w_gte_1000,w_1000,q_auto:best/if_else,q_auto:best/v1623671161/aemwp-prod/content/dam/blogs/placeholders/Celebrity_Justice2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Aleksandr Mashnitski"], "canonical_link": "https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/celebrity-justice/farrah-abraham-drops-5-million-sex-shaming-suit/", "title": "Farrah Abraham Drops $5 Million 'Sex Shaming' Suit", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "keywords": "Farrah Abraham Drops $5 Million 'Sex Shaming' Suit", "og": {"image": "https://images.findlawresources.com/image/upload/if_w_gte_1000,w_1000,q_auto:best/if_else,q_auto:best/v1623671161/aemwp-prod/content/dam/blogs/placeholders/Celebrity_Justice2.jpg", "url": "https://www.findlaw.com/legalblogs/celebrity-justice/farrah-abraham-drops-5-million-sex-shaming-suit/", "locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Farrah Abraham Drops $5 Million 'Sex Shaming' Suit - FindLaw", "description": "Farrah Abraham, one of the stars of the MTV show Teen Mom OG, has dropped her lawsuit against the makers of the show.
