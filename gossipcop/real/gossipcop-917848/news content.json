And you know I proposed to him,\u201d Mama June told her sister Doe Doe.\n\nSpeaking with PEOPLE earlier this year, Shannon said, \u201cHe\u2019s my rock and my best friend,\u201d and added, \u201cWe\u2019re together 24 hours a day.\u201d\n\nAccording to Shannon, Alana and Pumpkin were initially skeptical of their mother\u2019s new romance.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s just been me and the girls for so long, and we\u2019ve been though a lot,\u201d she explained. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to be able to trust somebody, and it was a lot of walls that he had to break down with me and the girls, honestly.\u201d\n\n\u201cHe restored our faith when we thought there were no good men left out there,\u201d said Shannon.\n\nMama June: From Not to Hot airs Fridays (9 p.m. ET) on WE tv.", "images":
