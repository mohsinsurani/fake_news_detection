Details of the complaint have not been made public.\n\n\u201cThey have splashed spurious claims with bombastic titles on their front pages,\u201d the Oscar-winning actor said in a brief press conference in Melbourne.\n\n\u201cThis has created irreparable damage to my reputation,\u201d he added. \u201cThis situation is intolerable and I must now seek vindication of my good name through the courts in Australia.\u201d\n\nThe Daily Telepgrah Editor Chris Dore said in a statement to Reuters that Rupert Murdoch\u2019s News Corp-run newspaper will defend itself.\n\n\u201cThe Daily Telegraph accurately reported the Sydney Theatre Company received a complaint alleging that Mr Geoffrey Rush had engaged in inappropriate behavior. We will defend our position in court,\u201d Dore said.\n\nRush\u2019s lawsuit said he was seeking damages and a restraint on further publication on the matter.\n\nLast week, Rush voluntarily stepped down as president of the Australian Academy of Cinema and Television until the matter is resolved.\n\nAustralian show business identities have come to his defense, including fellow Australian actor Rachel Griffiths.\n\nRush\u2019s film credits include \u201cShine\u201d, \u201cThe King\u2019s Speech\u201d and \u201cPirates of the Caribbean\u201d.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171208&t=2&i=1213019080&r=LYNXMPEDB70CR&w=800"], "top_img": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171208&t=2&i=1213019080&r=LYNXMPEDB70CR&w=800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-rush-lawsuit-idUSKBN1E20K5", "title": "Actor Geoffrey Rush sues Australian newspaper over 'inappropriate behavior' report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Actor Geoffrey Rush sues Australian newspaper over 'inappropriate behavior' report", "description": "Australian actor Geoffrey Rush said on Friday he had filed a defamation lawsuit against Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper after it published a report about a complaint alleging inappropriate conduct.", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171208&t=2&i=1213019080&r=LYNXMPEDB70CR&w=800", "src": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20171208&t=2&i=1213019080&r=LYNXMPEDB70CR&w=800"}}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff8000", "msapplication-config": "none", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Reuters"}, "description": "Australian actor Geoffrey Rush said on Friday he had filed a defamation lawsuit against Sydney's Daily Telegraph newspaper after it published a report about a complaint alleging inappropriate conduct.", "author": "Reuters Staff", "keywords": "US,PEOPLE,RUSH,LAWSUIT,Asia / Pacific,Australia,Corporate Events,Crime / Law / Justice,Company News,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,General News,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,Living / Lifestyle,Newspaper Publishing (TRBC level 5),Personalities / People,Reuters Top News,United States", "news_keywords": "US;PEOPLE;RUSH;LAWSUIT;Asia / Pacific;Australia;Corporate Events;Crime / Law / Justice;Company News;Arts / Culture / Entertainment;General News;Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions;Living / Lifestyle;Newspaper Publishing (TRBC level 5);Personalities / People;Reuters Top News;United States", "REVISION_DATE": "2017-12-08T18:33:37Z", "analyticsAttributes.articleDate": "2017-12-08T18:33:37Z", "analyticsAttributes.author": "Reuters Staff", "analyticsAttributes.canonicalUrl": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-people-rush-lawsuit-idUSKBN1E20K5", "analyticsAttributes.contentTitle": "Actor Geoffrey Rush sues Australian newspaper over 'inappropriate behavior' report", "analyticsAttributes.edition": "us", "analyticsAttributes.keywords": "US,PEOPLE,RUSH,LAWSUIT,Asia / Pacific,Australia,Corporate Events,Crime / Law / Justice,Company News,Arts / Culture / Entertainment,General News,Judicial Process / Court Cases / Court Decisions,Living / Lifestyle,Newspaper Publishing (TRBC level 5),Personalities / People,Reuters Top News,United States", "analyticsAttributes.keywordSlug": "US-PEOPLE-RUSH-LAWSUIT", "analyticsAttributes.inlineType": "Image-Video", "analyticsAttributes.title": "Actor Geoffrey Rush sues Australian newspaper over 'inappropriate behavior' report", "analyticsAttributes.channel": "Article -
