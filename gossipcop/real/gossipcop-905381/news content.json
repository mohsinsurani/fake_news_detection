Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr. was born on September 1, 2017. \u201cWe\u2019re not spending a day apart until she\u2019s 18,\u201d Williams says, only half-joking. Williams wears a Valentino dress and Irene Neuwirth bracelet.\n\nFashion Editor: Tonne Goodman.\n\nOn a moist South Florida morning at the end of a relentless hurricane season, their wedding only a week away, Serena Williams and Alexis Ohanian are seated side by side at their long kitchen table discussing the Marshmallow Test. Some 50 years ago, in a famous experiment, the Stanford University psychologist Walter Mischel invited children to choose between a small immediate reward, such as a marshmallow, or, if they could sit and wait for fifteen minutes, a larger prize. The children who found ways to stave off temptation\u2014by singing songs or pulling pigtails\u2014went on to have higher SAT scores and lower body-mass indexes than their ravenous peers.\n\n\u201cI would have eaten that marshmallow,\u201d says Serena, who, in conspicuous contrast to that image, sips a radioactive-looking broth, which she nudged her chef to prepare after reading online that ginger and turmeric were supposed to aid in breast-milk production. She positions this tincture on a stack of gold lam\u00e9 swatches: Golden Harvest, Gold L\u2019Amour, Golden Daydream, Victorian Gold. One of these will be selected for the tablecloths at the wedding dinner. Thinking better of her coaster choice, she shifts her glass to a stack of photocopied pages from assorted newborn instruction manuals. Serena loves printing and collating and stacking. She loves paper. She is the analog to her husband-to-be\u2019s digital.\n\n\u201cAre you kidding?\u201d Alexis shoots back. \u201cYou would never eat that marshmallow. You would stare down that marshmallow like it was the enemy. It would be Serena versus the marshmallow.\u201d\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re right,\u201d she admits with a squeak of laughter. \u201cBut it would have been fear. I would have been scared to eat it. I would have been like, Am I supposed to eat this? Am I going to get in trouble if I eat this?\u201d\n\nWatch Serena Williams Absolutely Tear Up an Airport Runway:\n\nIt\u2019s no secret that a high capacity to delay gratification\u2014to place discipline and self-sacrifice in the service of a dream that shimmers in the distance like a mirage\u2014is among the distinguishing characteristics of the elite athlete. Serena is a special case, of course, an athlete whose unique gifts fused with years of hard work to produce an avalanche of victories\u2014more, she swears, than she ever dreamed of as a braided nine-year-old captured uncomfortably in the pages of her local newspaper. A more painful vision of reality has also encroached over the years: the drive-by murder of her older sister Yetunde Price, in 2003; a slip on a piece of broken glass at a Munich restaurant that led to pulmonary embolisms, which in turn led to a year on the sidelines (and then, somehow, after age 30, the five most brilliant seasons of her career). One gratification she always knew she\u2019d be keeping on the back burner was motherhood. But on September 1, Alexis Olympia Ohanian Jr. arrived. Serena calls her Olympia. Alexis prefers Junior.", "images": ["https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e047faf3bc4e2b3fab56/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/01-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/633de2e178be746c6de5539b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6329d7e7ba058f95e8d086ca/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/631fc59132b60f6ccb286cd2/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/63248e50993b2add9768fd97/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/633b4df92149b60ea7f6a495/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-header.02dcb2fef16d86c695ce8d290a3fd13c7f6c3182.svg", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo-reverse.f2c4cf0289092a5686b7c6db87806b427e705af9.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e0463ebd0571fa0cd192/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/03-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/63220397c13bf6b030ecd013/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/6320e23f0a8e0a2d00bab485/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vogue.com/verso/static/vogue/assets/logo.00b68c0d9934396a2a234f4f43427e3affd58e9b.svg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/631bcf1d41b50bb782d0eb94/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/609eadba3150cbc8d304e13c/master/h_120%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202021-05-14%2520at%252012.38.43%2520PM.png", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e046fb207660fa92173f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/02-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/632cc30dc13bf6b030ecda35/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Rob Haskell", "Mario Testino"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Serena Williams, Vogue\u2019s February 2018 cover star discusses her difficult delivery for the first time and when she hopes to make her triumphant return to tennis.", "id": "5a54ddd4faf3bc4e2b3fab54", "keywords": "serena williams", "news_keywords": "serena williams", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a54ddd4faf3bc4e2b3fab54", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Serena Williams, Vogue\u2019s February 2018 cover star discusses her difficult delivery for the first time and when she hopes to make her triumphant return to tennis.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e065c5a4191ce869177d/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/07-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e065c5a4191ce869177d/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/07-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg\"}", "og": {"image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg", "site_name": "Vogue", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vogue.com/article/serena-williams-vogue-cover-interview-february-2018"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-01-10T13:00:16.573Z", "modified_time": "2018-01-10T13:00:16.573Z", "author": "Rob Haskell"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@voguemagazine", "domain": "https://www.vogue.com", "image": "https://assets.vogue.com/photos/5a54e04719d517509a5790e4/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/05-serena-williams-vogue-cover-february-2018.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@voguemagazine", "title": "Serena Williams on Motherhood, Marriage, and Making Her Comeback"}, "fb": {"app_id": 812270538813681, "pages": 42933792278}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1515589216.573, "source": "https://www.vogue.com", "summary": ""}
