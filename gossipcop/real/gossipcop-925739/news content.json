Below are just a sampling of the messages she thought were worth some attention:\n\nGood 4 you... they went back to the show cause in the last few years, none of them did anything worthwhile.. best thing u ever did was to move on...heard the show was stupid and their all moving in slow motion now, lol... good luck\ud83d\ude4f pic.twitter.com/LwgL8gjNgS @SWAGDAD80\n\n@SammiSweetheart girllll...why were they so shady\ud83d\ude0e\ud83c\udf33 tonight. Damn they miss you. Lol! I know you got to be so unbothered. Ronnie feeling some type of way I guess. That what happens when you do a good person wrong. #ByeFelicia @PinkLadyBB\n\nThe amount of times they were talking about @SammiSweetheart, she pretty much was on the show \ud83e\udd23 She should get some sort of salary for that #JSFamilyVacation @nikkaayyx\n\nRonnie is literally the last man I would ever associate with on planet earth!!!!!!! @SammiSweetheart is a genius for not getting herself mixed up with that dude again!!! #jsfamilyvacation @suppppmorgan\n\nwhy is everyone on #JerseyShore is mad at @SammiSweetheart for not coming back? no one's original face came back? @meiammartin\n\nLow key (high key) disappointed that @SammiSweetheart isn't on Jersey Shore: Family Vacation \ud83d\ude10\ud83d\ude15 @richellelounder\n\n@SammiSweetheart just finished the jerzday episodes, I'm really sad your not in it. \ud83d\ude41 @yeahhtayler\n\n@DeenaNicoleMTV good for you sticking up for someone who wasn't able to be there to defend herself.Ron is still exactly the same,and no way does @SammiSweetheart new man looking Ron? He's better looking, you to girl get yourself a real man who can take care of you @JSFamVacation @ashpeanut_24\n\n@SammiSweetheart you made the right decision. 100% @akeyachicago\n\nClearly you made the right choice avoiding the reunion. Trashing someone you were once friends with on tv is messed up. Keep doing you and focusing on the positive. \ud83d\udc4c\ud83c\udffb @LowKey_NoPresha\n\nDon't care what anyone says -@MTV took a dump on @SammiSweetheart @KeNt2DaIZO\n\nJerzday! Excited for tonight - but still would rather have Sammi on than Ronni @ItsTheSituation @SammiSweetheart #Jerzday @aprildol\n\nDuring the two-hour global premiere event, Sammi did make an appearance, as a life-size doll that even said her infamous, \"Raaahhhn, staaahhhp\" quote. While Ronnie grossly asked, \"If I have sex with [the doll], is that still cheating?\", Snooki and Deena defended her decision to not return during the episode.\n\nIn an interview with E!, Deena said she told Sammi about the doll before the premiere. Her response: \"She was like, 'That's just weird,'\" Deena explained. \"Me and Sam are super close, so as soon as I got home, I said, 'Listen girl, there's a Sammi doll in the house,'\" she continued. \"She was like, 'I'm not surprised.' She knows how it works and I think she's going to deal with it pretty well.\"", "images": ["https://images.toofab.com/image/3f/3by2/2022/10/05/3ffae1c2aa4b4ae08bba9ca0ffca7702_md.jpg",
