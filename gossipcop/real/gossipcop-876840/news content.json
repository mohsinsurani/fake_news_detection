USA TODAY Sports\n\nJ.J. Watt's fund for Hurricane Harvey victims in Houston raised more than $37 million before it was closed Friday at the request of the NFL star, according to YouCaring, the company that handled the online donations.\n\n\"If there is one thing that I have taken away from these last few weeks, it is the reassurance of how much good is out there in our world,'' wrote Watt, an All-Pro defensive end for the Houston Texans, in a message on his fund's page at YouCaring.com. \"When times are the toughest, humanity stands at its strongest and you have all helped to prove that emphatically.''\n\nWhen the fund closed at 6 p.m. ET Friday, Watt wrote, efforts would shift from fundraising to ensuring the money is put to work for the people in the devastated areas in and around Houston.\n\nMore: J.J.
