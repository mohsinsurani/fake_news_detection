Or are you better from the inside, and we are in the process of determining that. Yeah, but I would look for a senatorial run.\u201d\n\nWhen asked whether Jenner is seriously considering a run and if she would run as a Republican or an independent, her publicist, Alan Nierob, told CNN Monday that there are \u201cno further details to report at this time.\u201d\n\nThis comes after wrestling star and actor Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson said that he would consider running for president in 2020, musician Kid Rock insisting last week that his tweet about running for the Senate is no joke and, in perhaps the most viral moment of celebrities exploring a run for office, Kanye West declaring a 2020 presidential bid during his speech at the 2015 MTV Video Music Awards.\n\nI have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real\u2026 https://t.co/RRVgISDFeq The answer is an absolute YES. pic.twitter.com/uYCUg6mjW1 \u2014 KidRock (@KidRock) July 12, 2017\n\nAfter meeting with then-President-elect Trump in December, West tweeted, \u201c#2024,\u201d causing fans to speculate whether he\u2019s delaying a run for president and whether he is serious about running at all.\n\nJenner also expressed an interest in public service during an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon in April.\n\nJenner voted for Trump in the 2016 general election, but has also expressed disappointment is some of the Trump administration\u2019s policies.\n\nWell @realDonaldTrump, from one Republican to another, this is a disaster. You made a promise to protect the LGBTQ community.
