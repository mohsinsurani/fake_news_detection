Keeping Up with the Kardashians star took to her website and app to honor her brother, revealing all the ways he reminds her of their late father, Robert Kardashian Sr.\n\n\u201cMy brother Rob is like my father in so many ways \u2014 his sense of humor, silly nature, the way he loves and respects family,\u201d she said.\n\nKhlo\u00e9, 33, praised Rob, 31, for his relationship with his 1\u00bd-year-old daughter Dream, whom he shares with ex Blac Chyna.\n\n\u201cMy dad would do anything for his kids and my brother is the same way for Dream,\u201d she gushed. \u201cI\u2019m so proud of him!\u201d\n\nKhlo\u00e9 went on to say that their father would be \u201creally proud that Rob wants to implement his Armenian roots into Dream\u2019s upbringing.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt would mean so much to him that all of his grandchildren are so close,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s family over everything and I love that my brother is the same way.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian Shares New Photo of Daughter True After Date Night with Tristan Thompson\n\nEarlier this month, a source told PEOPLE that Rob, who has battled depression, weight gain and type 2 diabetes in recent years, is still struggling to maintain a healthy lifestyle.\n\n\u201cHe can\u2019t seem to get healthy even though he says he wants to be,\u201d said the insider. \u201cHe\u2019s constantly up and down.\u201d\n\nStill, close friends and family hope the reclusive reality star will turn things around and find as much happiness with himself as he has with Dream.\n\n\u201cHe\u2019s a great dad,\u201d said the source. \u201cHe loves that girl so much.\u201d", "images":
