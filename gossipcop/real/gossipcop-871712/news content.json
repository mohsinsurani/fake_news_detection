Little People, Big World\u2019s Molly Roloff married Joel Silvius on Saturday, August 5, in an intimate wedding at Roloff Farms in Oregon, and their nuptials were nothing short of perfect.\n\nThe bride wore a lace off-the-shoulder dress highlighted by a delicate necklace and her hair was pulled back into a bun, hidden by a mid-length veil. She carried a bouquet of pink and white flowers with sprigs of lavender, which mom Amy Roloff picked herself.\n\nThe groom looked handsome in a gray suit with a blue bowtie. The bridesmaids, including Molly\u2019s sisters-in-law Tori and Audrey Roloff, wore pink gowns while the groomsmen wore white dress shirts with dark suspenders.\n\nThe stage was set.

A post shared by Tori Roloff (@toriroloff) on Aug 6, 2017 at 12:01am PDT\n\nThe outdoor ceremony was held in a spot deep in the woods on the farm and had gorgeous views and loving touches throughout. Guests watched the couple exchange vows while sitting on wooden benches that Matt Roloff had built for his only daughter\u2019s big day, and the bridal entrance arch was a wooden arbor that he refurbished.\n\nThe doting dad shared a photo with his daughter on Facebook, describing her as \u201cthe most gorgeous bride ever\u201d and wrote that the wedding \u201cwent off without a single hitch.\u201d\n\nMatt revealed that guests walked through a patch of wildflowers before the ceremony, which was held \u201cdeep in a grove under several 100-year-old oak trees that Molly played on as a little girl \u2026 it was a magical [fairy-tale] wedding for 2 incredible people that we all love very much.\u201d several 100-year-old oak trees that Molly played on as a little girl \u2026 it was a
