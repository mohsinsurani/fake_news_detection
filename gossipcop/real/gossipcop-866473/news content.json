According to SHZ.de, the website for local newspaper Schleswiger Nachrichten, the band had already finished the performance. Allen issued a statement after the show calling the protest \u201cstupid.\"\n\nIn a Facebook post, Femen took credit for the protest, writing in French that they stormed the stage to condemn alleged perpetrators of sexual violence. Earlier this year, six Femen activists staged a topless stunt on France's election day, wearing Donald Trump and far-right candidate Marine Le Pen masks to protest Le Pen's candidacy.\n\n\"FEMEN\u2019s naked attacks is a naked nerve of the historic woman-system conflict, its most visual and appropriate illustration,\" reads the website for the group, which was founded in Ukraine but now operates out of France. \"(The) activist\u2019s naked body is the undisguised hatred toward the patriarchal order and new aesthetics of women\u2019s revolution.\"\n\nAllen tours with his band playing clarinet, and the ensemble last visited Germany in 2011, according to the concert program.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/a7dc294681e890bc50f473e52fa8c3a92f41f115/c=201-0-3342-2362/local/-/media/2017/07/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636355328838486613-EPA-SPAIN-MUSIC-FESTIVAL-92253301.JPG?width=320&height=240", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c43c372f6874b971744c307fb1f110be369bfd07/c=0-180-3543-2182/local/-/media/2017/07/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636355328838486613-EPA-SPAIN-MUSIC-FESTIVAL-92253301.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c43c372f6874b971744c307fb1f110be369bfd07/c=0-180-3543-2182/local/-/media/2017/07/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636355328838486613-EPA-SPAIN-MUSIC-FESTIVAL-92253301.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maeve Mcdermott"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/07/13/topless-activists-femen-woody-allen-concert-germany/474866001/", "title": "Topless activists crash Woody Allen concert in Germany to protest sexual violence", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/people/2017/07/13/topless-activists-femen-woody-allen-concert-germany/474866001/life/people", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Topless activists crash Woody Allen concert in Germany to protest sexual violence", "description": "Allen was performing with his jazz ensemble when two activists from the radical feminist group Femen interrupted the show.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/c43c372f6874b971744c307fb1f110be369bfd07/c=0-180-3543-2182/local/-/media/2017/07/13/USATODAY/USATODAY/636355328838486613-EPA-SPAIN-MUSIC-FESTIVAL-92253301.JPG?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "description": "Allen was performing with his jazz ensemble when two activists from the radical feminist group Femen interrupted the show.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1499900400.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
