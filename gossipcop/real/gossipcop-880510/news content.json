After all, her look is one of the most iconic moments of 2017 so far. But for those of us unskilled in the special effects makeup department, it might prove difficult to recreate. Taylor gave us a little sneak peek into the making of her undead look in a YouTube video\u2014and it honestly seems a little over-the-top, but hey, it's for a good cause. (We're surprised she didn't change the lyrics to \"I'm sorry, Taylor can't come to the phone right now because she's been in the makeup chair for 12 hours.\")\n\nWe're sure there's simpler ways to achieve the effect for Halloween, but T.Swift's video look involved a ton of moss (all over) to get that freshly-arisen-from-the-grave effect, as well as prosthetics for her face, grayish blue contacts for creepy undead eyes, and that dress from \"Out of the Woods.\"\n\nCheck out the preview of Taylor's transformation for yourself:\n\nContent This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nNow all you need is your own girl squad dressing up as every other version of Taylor, past and present: a quick roll call could definitely include \"Teardrops On My Guitar\" Taylor, Laying-in-a-Tub-Filled-With-Diamonds Taylor, and Snake Queen Taylor. (So many options.)\n\nThere's no telling if we'll see more of scary Taylor in her upcoming videos. If her recent AT&T commercial is any barometer, her cat-loving, cookie-dough-eating self is still very much alive and well. And her latest song, \"Ready For It,\" is definitely less dark than \"LWYMMD.\" That being said, we're pretty sure we'll see some symbolism-filled new looks from the new Taylor, too.\n\nBut it seems like we can work with the Taylors we've got for Halloween, anyway: T. Swift's latest album, Reputation, isn't set to drop until November 10.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n-Taylor Swift and Cardi B Have the Top Spots on the Billboard Hot 100\u2014Here's Why That's Huge-Taylor Swift Just Announced When Her Next Single and Album Are Dropping-Taylor Swift's 'Look What You Made Me Do' Music Video Is Filled With Hidden Moments", "images": ["https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-header.aeb2e510354d524c42a87c5d0a97d0a73c5d7581.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59bd54d07e2bc31bdf1c16bf/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/normal-and-zombie%2520taylor.jpg", "https://www.glamour.com/verso/static/glamour/assets/logo-reverse.b2ce20427c8d415381a18834c479e653848cc926.svg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/631b693d529d6fc8b9d4d930/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/632a1c0b82d2c7a98fa2e85b/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59bd54d07e2bc31bdf1c16bf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/normal-and-zombie%20taylor.jpg", "https://dwgyu36up6iuz.cloudfront.net/heru80fdn/image/upload/c_fill%2Cd_placeholder_thescene.jpg%2Cfl_progressive%2Cg_center%2Ch_350%2Cq_80%2Cw_350/v1402430139/glamour_beauty-recovered-see-makeup-pro-kandee-johnson-transform-into-taylor-swift-in-30-seconds.jpg", "https://media.glamour.com/photos/630c2f5e8e9d0a50459956f1/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59bd54d07e2bc31bdf1c16bf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/normal-and-zombie%20taylor.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Erin Reimel"], "canonical_link": "https://www.glamour.com/story/watch-taylor-swift-transform-into-a-zombie", "title": "Watch Taylor Swift Transform Into a Zombie for Her 'Look What You Made Me Do' Music Video", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Watch a behind the scenes clip of Taylor Swift transforming into a zombie for her 'Look What You Made Me Do' music video", "id": "59bd37ec7e2bc31bdf1c16bd", "keywords": "taylor swift,zombie,look what you made me do,makeup,halloween", "news_keywords": "taylor swift,zombie,look what you made me do,makeup,halloween", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59bd37ec7e2bc31bdf1c16bd", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Watch a behind the scenes clip of Taylor Swift transforming into a zombie for her 'Look What You Made Me Do' music video\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59b05971559513680cdbd87c/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-478350276%20(1).jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.glamour.com/photos/59b05971559513680cdbd87c/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/GettyImages-478350276%20(1).jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Are you ready for it?", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59bd54d07e2bc31bdf1c16bf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/normal-and-zombie%20taylor.jpg", "site_name": "Glamour", "title": "Watch Taylor Swift's Incredible Zombie Transformation for Her 'LWYMMD' Video", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.glamour.com/story/watch-taylor-swift-transform-into-a-zombie"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-16T16:54:47.718Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-16T16:54:47.718Z", "author": "Erin Reimel"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@glamourmag", "description": "Are you ready for it?", "domain": "https://www.glamour.com", "image": "https://media.glamour.com/photos/59bd54d07e2bc31bdf1c16bf/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/normal-and-zombie%20taylor.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@glamourmag", "title": "Watch Taylor Swift's Incredible Zombie Transformation for Her 'LWYMMD' Video"}, "fb": {"app_id": 101358874221, "pages": 26815555478}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505580887.718, "source": "https://www.glamour.com", "summary": ""}
