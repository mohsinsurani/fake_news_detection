USA TODAY\n\nSooner or later, most celebrities learn the rule: Never explain, never complain, especially not to supermarket tabloids.\n\nAriel Winter is young, only 19, so maybe she hasn't read the memo yet \u2014 thus, her Twitter tirade against Star magazine's story that claims the Modern Family star is the \u201cbreadwinner\u201d in her relationship with actor Levi Meaden and that she actually pays him to \"take care of her.\"\n\nShe was outraged, she was incredulous, she was adamant. Not true and \"not cool,\" she said in a tweet that linked to a long rant.\n\n\"Star magazine is obviously a non-reputable source and a trash magazine, but seriously how dare you make up stuff that you have no idea about,\" she wrote.\n\nWinter has a personal assistant to take care of her, she said.\n\n\"I would NEVER pay my boyfriend any sort of allowance nor would he EVER accept it if I offered,\" she huffed. \"I HATE fake news but I guess that's what our world has come to.\"\n\nThe Star story isn't online, or at least not yet, but Gossip Cop, the website that devotes itself to debunking tabloid twaddle, reports that the \"ridiculous\" story by the \"repeatedly discredited\" tabloid quotes an anonymous source explaining that Meaden earns a wage to cook, clean and perform other household chores for Winter.\n\n\u201cSome of Ariel\u2019s friends worry that she\u2019s throwing too much cash his way,\u201d this supposed source says. \u201cWhy would he go on auditions when he can stay home and still collect a paycheck?\u201d\n\nStar, Gossip Cop noted, is the same tabloid that once wrongly reported Winter was getting fired from Modern Family. She wasn't.\n\nWill Winter's scolding teach Star a lesson? Don't count on it.\n\nBut she's not the only celebrity who's gone off on Star recently. Winter's co-star Sof\u00eda Vergara got into a hissing match with the tabloid last month after it ran a cover story shouting that Vergara and husband Joe Manganiello, whose extravagant wedding took place in November 2015, were kaput.\n\nShe posted a scathing message on Instagram concluding with a hashtag: #Starmagazinebullies. \"The editor of this magazine is an idiot,\" she declared.", "images": ["https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "http://videos.usatoday.net/Brightcove3/29906170001/201706/3538/29906170001_5479803337001_5479790937001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5925a869de7d056607a78ce1278809eab94e85d2/c=0-108-3689-2192/local/-/media/2017/06/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636336673500274379-AP-Modern-Family-FYC-Event.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5925a869de7d056607a78ce1278809eab94e85d2/c=0-108-3689-2192/local/-/media/2017/06/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636336673500274379-AP-Modern-Family-FYC-Event.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Maria Puente"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/06/21/ariel-winter-attacks-tabloids-trash-story-her-boyfriend/103086196/", "title": "Ariel Winter attacks tabloid's 'trash' story about her boyfriend", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=504631398, app-argument=https://www.usatoday.com/story/life/tv/2017/06/21/ariel-winter-attacks-tabloids-trash-story-her-boyfriend/103086196/life/tv", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Ariel Winter attacks tabloid's 'trash' story about her boyfriend", "description": "No, Ariel tells 'Star' magazine, she doesn't pay Levi Meaden to take care of her.", "site_name": "USA TODAY", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/5925a869de7d056607a78ce1278809eab94e85d2/c=0-108-3689-2192/local/-/media/2017/06/21/USATODAY/USATODAY/636336673500274379-AP-Modern-Family-FYC-Event.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "fb": {"pages": 13652355666}, "news_keywords": "Celebrity relationships,Ariel Winter,Celebrities,Winter", "description": "No, Ariel tells 'Star' magazine, she doesn't pay Levi Meaden to take care of her.", "twitter": {"site": "@usatoday", "creator": "@usatoday", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1497999600.0, "source": "https://www.usatoday.com", "summary": ""}
