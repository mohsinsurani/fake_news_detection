But, in Belles de Jour, she tells Blair she wanted to go to Columbia because her father studied there.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn the Pilot, Nates haircut notibly changes between scenes, from longish at Blair's party (when Serena returns), to trimmed while jogging with his father, back to longish when eating sushi with Blair.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pilot Chuck takes the bus with Nate and Dan to school, but in every other episode from this point on Chuck rides around in his driven stretch-limousine and Dan walks with Jenny.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pilot, the entire Waldorf apartment is completly different to what it looks like in every episode after.\n\nBlair's bedroom in Pilot is a different color to every other episode.\n\n\n\n\n\nIn Pilot Chuck speaks of his mother as though she is still alive.\n\nIn Pilot the Gossip Girl page looks completely different to every other episode.\n\nExternal Sponsor Links", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb37460/common/skins/common/blank.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb37462/gossipgirl/images/thumb/d/d2/Tumblr_llzselOS3o1qkv4xxo1_500.png/82px-44%2C459%2C0%2C414-Tumblr_llzselOS3o1qkv4xxo1_500.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images.wikia.com/common/__cb37460/skins/common/images/ajax.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb37462/gossipgirl/images/thumb/f/f2/Tumblr_llyq89oPTo1qecdxro1_r1_500.gif/82px-146%2C357%2C0%2C210-Tumblr_llyq89oPTo1qecdxro1_r1_500.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images.wikia.com/gossipgirl/images/b/bc/Wiki.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://a.wikia-beacon.com/__onedot?c=6913&lc=en&lid=75&x=gossipgirl&y=&u=0&a=4239&n=0", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb37462/gossipgirl/images/thumb/a/a1/Dair.jpg/82px-142%2C503%2C0%2C360-Dair.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb37235/common/skins/common/blank.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6177433&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c7=http%3A%2F%2Fgossipgirl.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FGossip_Girl_Mistakes%3Fcomscorekw%3Dwikiacsid_entertainment&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb2/messaging/images/thumb/1/19/Avatar.jpg/50px-Avatar.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20110601123432im_/http://images.wikia.com/gossipgirl/images/b/bc/Wiki.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "", "title": "Gossip Girl Mistakes", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1200", "description": "In Season 4, Blair and Serena are walking through Columbia's campus and Blair is holding different colored folders then it switches to Serena then back to Blair and the folders are in a whole different order.", "generator": "MediaWiki 1.16.5", "keywords": "Gossip Girl Wiki,gossipgirl,Gossip Girl Mistakes,Gossip Girl (TV series),Season 4,Jenny Humphrey,Serena van der Woodsen,Gossip Girl (character),Poison Ivy,Dan,Belles de Jour,Blair,Pilot"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
