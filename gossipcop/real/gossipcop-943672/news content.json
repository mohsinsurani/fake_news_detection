Last night, the rapper-turned-designer debuted a new campaign for his Yeezy 500 Supermoon sneaker campaign on Twitter, and it turned heads to say the least.\n\nThe shots feature a diverse roster of models wearing West\u2019s new footwear, along with other Yeezy pieces like sports bras, leggings, and sweatshirts. But a few models really wore nothing but the shoe. One of them included adult-film actress Lela Star (who has an uncanny resemblance to West's wife, Kim Kardashian).\n\n\n\n\n\nThe campaign was photographed by Eli Linnetz (who shot the 2017 Kardashian Christmas card). He shared another revealing angle from the shoot.\n\nThe Clermont twins also made an appearance, wearing only the Supermoon sneakers, socks, and biker shorts.\n\n\n\n\n\nThere was also this faceless model, who posed topless but sported grey shorts, Calabasas socks, and Yeezy kicks.\n\nNot all models were nude. Some wore Yeezy's signature oversized sweaters and biker shorts (\u00e0 la Kim Kardashian), others even sported jeans.\n\nThe roster also included younger-looking models, including a child.\n\nThis isn't the first time Kanye has launched a new campaign on social media. For his recent collections, Kim has worn his design in public and shared the paparazzi photos online to debut the clothes. He also enlisted other models including Paris Hilton, Amina Blue, and Sami Miro to pose as Kim lookalikes for the shots, resulting in a full-on social media swarm.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/bfa-36233-4992668-1663001631.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.718xh;0,0.0481xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/67055711-c808-4a4d-811a-e7155a2bce10_1603836730.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/6-credit-skims-sandy-kim-1649092537.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/covers-1-246-1644258488.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.822xh;0,0.00393xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2022-07-d-n-amina-muaddi-03-v4-1659917915.jpg?crop=0.755xw:1.00xh;0.0625xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/20220720-tiffany-masonpoole-10-1904-v7-lg-qc-4x5-82-1664803327.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.801xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/2019-elle-wakingupwith-ep22-justineskye-ms-jp-v2-ap-v1-fb-1571953811.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-tiktok-influencers-v3-1643131873.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.363xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/florence-pugh-j-crew-1644525127.jpg?crop=0.299xw:0.599xh;0,0.105xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=0.5xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1663944173.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.669xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/shutterstock-editorial-198544b-1591193753.jpg?crop=0.659xw:1.00xh;0.144xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/1080x1080-nologo8-1643048090.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/chanel-fall-winter-2022-23-ready-to-wear-ad-campaign-by-inez-vinoodh-6-hd-1662487093.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.769xh;0,0&resize=180:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/13244-patti-keys-225-1643745388.jpg?crop=0.668xw:1.00xh;0.167xw,0&resize=180:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/a21343871/kanye-west-yeezy-campaign-nude-models-sneakers/", "title": "Kanye West Debuts a NSFW Yeezy Campaign with Nude Models in Sneakers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Kanye West Debuts a NSFW Yeezy Campaign with Nude Models in Sneakers", "description": "There are some Kim Kardashian lookalikes in the bunch, too.", "keywords": "kanye west, kim kardashian, yeezy, yeezy sneakers, yeezy desert rat", "theme-color": "#000000", "og": {"site_name": "Harper's BAZAAR", "title": "Kanye West Just Debuted a NSFW Yeezy Campaign with Nude Models in Sneakers", "description": "There are some Kim Kardashian lookalikes in the bunch, too.", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}, "url": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/models/a21343871/kanye-west-yeezy-campaign-nude-models-sneakers/", "type": "article"}, "fb": {"app_id": 227018747326504, "pages": 8327967561}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/HarpersBazaar", "section": "Fashion Models", "modified_time": "2021-11-02T00:41:20Z", "published_time": "2018-06-13T14:00:00Z"}, "twitter": {"site": "@harpersbazaarus", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=1.00xw:1.00xh;0,0&resize=640:*", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "google-site-verification": "bNUXKPTEqUVDbaxHrYA-c1kj007Ao4VsMKdoU80EyiU", "thumbnail": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.full": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0&resize=320:*", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-yeezy-campaign-eli-linnetz-1528928121.jpg?crop=0.502xw:1.00xh;0.498xw,0", "auto-publish": "timely", "sailthru.excerpt": "Though he's been busy releasing new music for the past few weeks, Kanye West has been on his design hustle, too.
