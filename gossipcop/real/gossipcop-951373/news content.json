His body was discovered by close friend and fellow chef, \u00c9ric Ripert, with whom he had been traveling for \u201cParts Unknown.\u201d His cause of death was ruled a suicide.\n\nCNN announced the last season of the travel show will premiere on Sept. 23, and will include five episodes of Bourdain\u2019s travels to Kenya, Indonesia, West Texas, Spain and New York City\u2019s Lower East Side, plus two additional episodes to honor the host.\n\nOnly the first episodes will include Bourdain's narration, as the rest had not been completed before his death.\n\n\"He\u2019s really off on a journey to parts unknown,\" Tengalia added in her speech. \u201cWe wish we were there to shoot it with him, and he really would have written the hell out of that episode.\"\n\nRELATED STORIES", "images": ["https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100522_doctor_tamper.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=1223619061322807&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2018-09/091018-anthony-1280x720.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1170&height=658", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100622_rowing_ireland_web.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/img/logo.svg", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100622_campus_horror_web_0.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/bull.jpg?h=c673cd1c?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2018-09/091018-anthony-1280x720.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1280&height=720", "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2022-10/100622_building_jumper_intv_web_0.jpg?h=d1cb525d?crop=16:9&width=314&height=196"], "top_img": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2018-09/091018-anthony-1280x720.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1280&height=720", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.insideedition.com/anthony-bourdain-wins-6-posthumous-emmy-awards-3-months-after-his-death-46653", "title": "Anthony Bourdain Wins 6 Posthumous Emmy Awards, 3 Months After His Death", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "description": "\u201cHe\u2019s really off on a journey to parts unknown,\u201d his producer said as she accepted the trophy on his behalf. \u201cWe wish we were there to shoot it with him.\"", "og": {"description": "\u201cHe\u2019s really off on a journey to parts unknown,\u201d his producer said as she accepted the trophy on his behalf. \u201cWe wish we were there to shoot it with him.\"", "title": "Anthony Bourdain Wins 6 Posthumous Emmy Awards, 3 Months After His Death", "site_name": "Inside Edition", "url": "https://www.insideedition.com/anthony-bourdain-wins-6-posthumous-emmy-awards-3-months-after-his-death-46653", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2018-09/091018-anthony-1280x720.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1280&height=720", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "type": "Articles"}, "twitter": {"description": "\u201cHe\u2019s really off on a journey to parts unknown,\u201d his producer said as she accepted the trophy on his behalf. \u201cWe wish we were there to shoot it with him.\"", "title": "Anthony Bourdain Wins 6 Posthumous Emmy Awards, 3 Months After His Death", "url": "https://www.insideedition.com/anthony-bourdain-wins-6-posthumous-emmy-awards-3-months-after-his-death-46653", "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@insideedition", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.insideedition.com/sites/default/files/styles/video_1920x1080/public/images/2018-09/091018-anthony-1280x720.jpg?h=c673cd1c&width=1280&height=720", "width": 1280, "height": 720}, "site": {"identifier": "@insideedition", "id": 23603092}}, "title": "Anthony Bourdain Wins 6 Posthumous Emmy Awards, 3 Months After His Death", "article": {"published_time": "2018-09-10T08:27:57-0700", "opinion": "false"}, "keywords": "Inside Edition, Entertainment, ,", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "next-head-count": 36, "msapplication-TileImage": "/img/favicons/ms-icon-144x144.png", "fb": {"app_id": 966341826790079, "admins": 3111204, "pages": 71728150722}, "theme-color": "#fd005b", "msapplication-TileColor": "#fd005b"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1536593277.0, "source": "https://www.insideedition.com", "summary": ""}
