Tim was such a humble, kind and beautiful soul. As a dance music icon, he touched the lives of millions around the world, and broke down barriers between genres like dance music and country. He helped our culture make an impact on the mainstream that will never be forgotten. I send my sincere condolences to his family, friends, fans and loved ones, and\u00a0we will forever keep his memory and his music alive and in our hearts. Tim, have an amazing journey. We\u2019ll see you on the other side. We love you. --??--A post shared by  Pasquale Rotella (@pasqualerotella) on Apr 20, 2018 at 3:21pm PDTJust landed on the West Coast and received this very sad news.

Felt so honored to play Mainstage Coachella, but at the same time so sad to hear the news about Avicii.. Probably wouldn\u2019t have been on that stage if it wasn\u2019t for him and his music. The world lost a musical genius.
