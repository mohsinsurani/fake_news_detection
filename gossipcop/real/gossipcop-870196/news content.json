According to a press release, more than 500 family members and friends attended the ceremony, which was led by local KROQ DJ Ted Stryker. Among those in attendance were Bennington's Stone Temple Pilots bandmates Robert and Dean DeLeo, his Kings of Chaos bandmate Matt Sorum as well as Damon Fox and Jimmy Gnecco. That fivesome performed \"Amazing Grace\" at the ceremony. Meanwhile, Dead by Sunrise's Ryan Shuck and Bennington's Linkin Park bandmates Mike Shinoda and Joe Hahn were among those delivering eulogies.\n\nOne fan has started a Google Doc collating all of the memorials worldwide. Music for Relief has launched the One More Light fund in honor of Bennington. Donations may be made here.\n\nClose friends and family members had their chance to say farewell to Linkin Park's Chester Bennington Saturday (July 29) in Palos Verdes, Calif.\n\nAccording to TMZ, the family decided against the option of taking plot next to Chris Cornell at the Hollywood Forever cemetery and instead held a private ceremony for Bennington at the South Coast Botanic Garden. Given that many of Bennington's friends were musicians, there was also a stage set up allowing for musical performances.\n\nAmong those on hand to view the ceremony were members of Chester Bennington's bands, Of Mice & Men singer Austin Carlile who had toured with Linkin Park, and more. Carlile posted on Instagram, \"The service was beautiful today. Thank you Linkin Park, thank you Chester for everything.\" As you can see in the posting below, those in attendance were given laminates and wristbands, much like those that VIP attendees get at a concert.\n\nMembers of Julien-K, who also performed with Bennington in the band Dead by Sunrise, also posted as they prepared to attend the ceremony.\n\nThe official ruling on Bennington's death was suicide. He was found on Thursday, July 20 at his Palos Verdes, Calif. estate. Bennington was 41.\n\nRockers We've Lost in 2017", "images": ["http://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2017/07/Linkin-Park-Chester-Bennington1.jpg?w=630&amp;h=420&amp;zc=1&amp;s=0&amp;a=t&amp;q=89&w=980&q=75", "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2017/07/Linkin-Park-Chester-Bennington1.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2019/03/ldlogo2.png"], "top_img": "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2017/07/Linkin-Park-Chester-Bennington1.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chad Childers"], "canonical_link": "https://loudwire.com/chester-bennington-private-funeral-service-california/", "title": "Chester Bennington Private Funeral Service Takes Place in California", "meta_data": {"instagram_profile": "loudwire", "description": "Linkin Park's Chester Bennington was laid to rest Saturday (July 29) in Palos Verdes, Calif.", "keywords": "linkin park chester bennington funeral, linkin park chester bennington funeral palos verdes california,news,rock", "fb": {"app_id": 222651877772174, "admins": 8802808, "pages": 184923891536218}, "og": {"title": "Chester Bennington Private Funeral Service Takes Place in California", "description": "Linkin Park's Chester Bennington was laid to rest Saturday (July 29) in Palos Verdes, Calif.", "url": "https://loudwire.com/chester-bennington-private-funeral-service-california/", "site_name": "Loudwire", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2017/07/Linkin-Park-Chester-Bennington1.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@Loudwire"}, "sailthru.description": "Linkin Park's Chester Bennington was laid to rest Saturday (July 29) in Palos Verdes, Calif.", "sailthru.date": "2017-07-30 19:22:19", "sailthru.title": "Chester Bennington Private Funeral Service Takes Place in California [Update]", "sailthru.tags": "tsmsite-loudwire, tsmmarket-national, tsmtype-national, chester-bennington, linkin-park, news, rock", "sailthru.author": "chadchilders", "sailthru.image.full": "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2017/07/Linkin-Park-Chester-Bennington1.jpg", "sailthru.image.thumb": "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2017/07/Linkin-Park-Chester-Bennington1.jpg", "google-site-verification": "SroFp4jsHg6CLya_N9uSsTUKjXery9Yc5GJzAV30uXk", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "parsely-title": "Chester Bennington Private Funeral Service Takes Place in California", "parsely-link": "https://loudwire.com/chester-bennington-private-funeral-service-california/", "parsely-type": "post", "parsely-image-url": "https://townsquare.media/site/366/files/2017/07/Linkin-Park-Chester-Bennington1.jpg?w=1200&h=0&zc=1&s=0&a=t&q=89", "parsely-tags": "tsmsite-loudwire,tsmmarket-national,tsmtype-national,chester-bennington,linkin-park,news,rock", "parsely-author": "chadchilders", "parsely-pub-date": "2017-07-30T23:22:19.000Z", "parsely-network-canonical": "https://loudwire.com/chester-bennington-private-funeral-service-california/"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1501438939.0, "source": "http://loudwire.com", "summary": ""}
