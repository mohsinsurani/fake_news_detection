It\u2019s cold!\u201d she admonished him as she quickly put hers on after posing for photos.\n\nHayek was nominated for her role as a holistic medicine practitioner in the comedy/drama that also stars John Lithgow, Connie Britton, Jay Duplass and Chlo\u00eb Sevigny. \u201cI\u2019m not going to win,\u201d Hayek said of her nomination, \u201cbut I already won by being here.\u201d (The award went to Frances McDormand.)\n\nAsked if Hayek thought change is around the corner for women, she said, \u201cI think it\u2019s coming our way, slowly but surely.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s time to grow and better ourselves and learn new things. It\u2019s an emotional moment.\u201d She said the Time\u2019s Up movement will be addressed in some capacity at tomorrow\u2019s Academy Awards ceremony. \u201cNot just words, but [through] actions,\u201d she said, cryptically, in Spanish.\n\nPinault stood proudly by Hayek\u2019s side as she completed interviews and even held a reporter\u2019s recorder for her when she wasn\u2019t within reach of a group interview being conducted with Hayek in the distance.\n\nOthers who braved the unseasonably cold and rainy event included Greta Gerwig (who won for Best Screenplay), Saoirse Ronan, Timothee Chalamet (Best Actor winner), Margot Robbie, Allison Williams, Elizabeth Olsen, and Kerry Washington, with her husband Nnamdi Asomugha, who was nominated for his role in \u201cCrown Heights.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Missoni,\u201d Washington said of her floral dress while putting on a bomber jacket after taking pictures with Amanda Seyfried. Nearly everyone wore coats between photo opps.\n\nBetty Gabriel, who will be attending the Oscars tomorrow for \u201cGet Out,\u201d which ended up winning Best Feature, also wore a stylish jacket over her Tadashi Shoji dress. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t be able to speak right now if this wasn\u2019t keeping me warm,\u201d Gabriel laughed. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Are we in California or are we in Alaska?\u2019\u201d\n\nGabriel said people often forget that the Oscar-nominated film was actually an indie film made with a limited budget. \u201cIt felt very much like a labor of love because we weren\u2019t getting paid that much,\u201d she admitted. \u201cBut what\u2019s crazy and what makes it not feel like an independent is that it looks expensive. Jordan worked his magic, but it was definitely made for very little money.\u201d\n\nGabriel said she\u2019s been having a lot of fun with the awards circuit. \u201cI\u2019m like, \u2018Hey, Gary Oldman for the third time. Hey, Allison Janney. Again. Nice dress. Again.\u2019 I\u2019m just so excited to celebrate Jordan tomorrow and all the other wonderful people I\u2019ve actually gotten to meet this season.\u201d\n\nHaley Lu Richardson, whose film \u201cColumbus\u201d was nominated for Best First Feature, attended in a delicate, but revealing, dress by Zimmerman. \u201cI\u2019m a little exposed,\u201d she laughed, looking down at her dress\u2019s deep neckline. \u201cBut at least it\u2019s long-sleeved. It\u2019s beachy and flowy and breezy. And now I\u2019m getting a breeze.\u201d\n\nBackstage, Best Supporting Actress winner Janney, who \u2014 like McDormand \u2014 has been sweeping the major awards shows, discussed the role costume design played in creating her \u201cI, Tonya\u201d character. \u201cIt helped everything because I look to the costume designer\u2019s vision of who [the character] is,\u201d she said. \u201cSeeing what they bring to the table informs what I do.\u201d\n\nAs for how she thinks Jimmy Kimmel will do as tomorrow\u2019s Academy Awards host and if she thinks he\u2019ll address the Time\u2019s Up movement, Janney said, \u201cI think Jimmy Kimmel has a huge task at hand to host the Oscars and I know he\u2019s going to do a fantastic job. I think that the movement is being ingested in so many other ways that I couldn\u2019t begin to judge whatever he\u2019s doing.
