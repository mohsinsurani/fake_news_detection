Photo: Darren Gerrish/WireImage\n\nAccording to Diane von Furstenberg, Viagra is the \u201cworst thing that has happened to women in the last 15 years.\u201d In a new interview with The Times, the legendary fashion designer said that it used to be that men weren\u2019t really fathering children after 65, but now, \u201cNow, with Viagra \u2026 they just feel\u2026\u201d\n\n\u201cFor men it used to be all about getting it up. \u2018Did I?\u2019 \u2018Can I?\u2019 There was a certain fairness,\u201d she said. \u201cA woman couldn\u2019t have a child after 40, right? Though even that doesn\u2019t exist any more.\u201d\n\nDVF also shared that she and her husband have separate residences in New York, and that in L.A., she often sleeps in the guest bedroom because her husband \u201csleeps with two dogs inside the bed.\u201d\n\nVon Furstenberg\u2019s sentiments about Viagra extend to her approach to aging in general: She just wants us all to stop fighting against time. \u201cAge means you have lived,\u201d she said. \u201cI am 71, but I should be 140 I have lived so fully.\u201d She added that she finds it \u201chumiliating\u201d that women in their 30s try to shy away from embracing their age and dislikes the fact that \u201ceven young girls [are] doing things to their faces.\u201d\n\nHopefully we all can embrace aging as enthusiastically as Diane von Furstenberg.", "images": ["https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dfe/8a0/76bf57e0299babfda3fcca088240db34f4-19-diane-von-furstenberg.rvertical.w330.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/93d/dd4/6993359860ee6cc420bb272619119c2cdf-elon-musk-settlement.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "https://www.thecut.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/fd4/409/28254d99ceca593534b46a52a9e49b452b-RISSI-AND-MIKO-SET-1152022.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dfe/8a0/76bf57e0299babfda3fcca088240db34f4-19-diane-von-furstenberg.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dfe/8a0/76bf57e0299babfda3fcca088240db34f4-19-diane-von-furstenberg.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Opheli Garcia Lawler"], "canonical_link": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/diane-von-furstenberg-hates-viagra.html", "title": "Diane von Furstenberg Thinks Viagra Is \u2018The Worst Thing\u2019", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "culture, fashion, style, diane von furstenberg, viagra, aging, featuretype:news-aggregation", "og": {"title": "Diane von Furstenberg Says Viagra Is \u2018The Worst Thing\u2019", "url": "https://www.thecut.com/2018/07/diane-von-furstenberg-hates-viagra.html", "description": "She is not a fan.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dfe/8a0/76bf57e0299babfda3fcca088240db34f4-19-diane-von-furstenberg.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "The Cut", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "Diane von Furstenberg Says Viagra Is \u2018The Worst Thing\u2019", "description": "She is not a fan.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/dfe/8a0/76bf57e0299babfda3fcca088240db34f4-19-diane-von-furstenberg.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@TheCut"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-07-19T12:56:59.415-04:00", "tag": "culture, fashion, style, diane von furstenberg, viagra, aging", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/cut"}, "description": "In a new interview, Diane von Furstenberg talks embracing age and says that Viagra is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened to women in the last 15 years.\u201d", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "sailthru.tags": "culture, fashion, style, diane von furstenberg, viagra, aging", "author": "Opheli Garcia Lawler", "fb": {"app_id": 343556435754245}, "type": "Article", "vertical": "The Cut", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Cut", "application-name": "The Cut", "msapplication-TileColor": "#ff5656", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://assets.nymag.com/media/sites/thecut/icon.144x144.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1532019419.415, "source": "https://www.thecut.com", "summary": ""}
