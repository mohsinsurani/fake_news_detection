Working with a trainer can actually be a life-changing experience, especially if you\u2019re someone for whom working out is scary or unpleasant. A good trainer can teach you how to actually enjoy exercise and do it in a sustainable way. And rational exercise can certainly have a positive impact on your life. But, just to be clear, physical fitness is not happiness and personal trainers are not therapists.I know it may be confusing given that every weight-loss reality show casts the trainers as demigods or father figures, capable of healing all your psychic wounds by shouting, \u201cGIVE ME TEN MORE!\u201d But yeah, your trainer is not your social worker.Will gets paired with celebrity trainer Gunnar Peterson. Will wanders into his first workout session moaning about Kyle and how he drove him away with his heinous chub. (His goal, by the way, is to go from being a \u201cbear\u201d to a \u201cmuscle cub,\u201d both of which are terms used to describe body types in the gay male community. As a not-male, not-gay person, I\u2019m not going to get preachy over these terms and their use within the context of this show \u2014 but I sure hope someone does.) Losing weight, he is sure, will help get Kyle back \u2014 or else get revenge on him for leaving? It\u2019s unclear. Will lays his sob story at Peterson\u2019s feet, and Peterson at least has the gumption to say, \u201cI don\u2019t care.\u201d But that doesn\u2019t stop Will from continuing to overshare about his breakup and all his totally valid hurt feelings. Core strength is rad, but Will clearly needs someone to talk this out with, and \u2014 say it with me \u2014 your trainer is not your therapist.Nor are they your dietitian, by the way (unless they are an actual registered dietitian, of course, or a PhD in nutrition science \u2014 which most trainers aren\u2019t). Stephanie gets paired with Luke Milton, who seems like a super friendly guy and may even be a good trainer. Sure, I couldn\u2019t find his credentials anywhere, but he is quite ripped, not to mention Australian. So. That\u2019s something. I really wanted to like him because he is literally the only person on this show \u2014 slash, in Stephanie\u2019s life \u2014 who\u2019s being nice to her. But then he prescribes the following nutrition program to her: \u201cIf it\u2019s had a life, it\u2019s good for ya.\u201d By this, he means plants, meat, and fish, which is fine. Really, I wish he\u2019d just left food out of it because he\u2019s not a nutrition professional. But, at the very least, I wish he\u2019d been a little more clear on this point rather than relying on his very poetic generalization. It sort of sounds like a cannibal diet.", "images": ["https://www.refinery29.com/assets/a70678be6c693f8a9915bec2fa49ee49.svg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/c5a8ae3dd50e6ebe17044593c2c7ee0c.svg", "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/fc2/1,0,3810,2000/x,80/1724194/image.jpg", "https://www.refinery29.com/assets/d27ad8510dcf0eef13f6419f4f9a76e6.svg"], "top_img": "https://s3.r29static.com/bin/entry/fc2/1,0,3810,2000/x,80/1724194/image.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Nia Shumake", "Jinnie Lee", "Charlotte Lewis", "Mercedes Viera", "Kourtney Pope", "Virgie Tovar", "Brea Baker", "Erika W.
