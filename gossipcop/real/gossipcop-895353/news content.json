The 2018 Film Independent Spirit Awards nominees have been announced, honoring achievements in the realm of independent movies. These awards are a stepping stone toward the Oscars for films like Get Out and Call Me By Your Name, which earned more nominations than any other films this year. But there's plenty of love for Good Time, Lady Bird, and others as well. Check out the full list of nominees below, and find out what was snubbed along the way.\n\nLuca Guadagnino's sumptuous Italian romance Call Me By Your Name leads the pack with six nominations in categories like Best Feature, Best Director, Best Cinematography, Best Editing, and Best Male Lead (Timothee Chalamet) and Best Supporting Male (Armie Hammer).\n\nElsewhere, Jordan Peele's Get Out and the Safdie Brothers' Good Time tied for the second highest number of nominations with five each, Lady Bird and The Rider earned four each, and I, Tonya, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri, and Columbus pulled in three nods apiece.\n\nYou can read the full list below, but for me, some of the biggest snubs center around The Big Sick. The movie earned two nominations \u2013 one for Best First Screenplay for co-writers Kumail Nanjiani and Emily V. Gordon, and one for Best Supporting Female for Holly Hunter \u2013 but if I were in charge, Nanjiani and co-star Zoe Kazan would have been nominated for their performances and Michael Showalter might have even gotten a shout-out for directing.\n\nAnother big snub: Greta Gerwig didn't get nominated for Best Director for Lady Bird, a film that's connecting with audiences in a major way right now and could very well end up as an Oscar contender in multiple categories. There's no love for I Don't Feel At Home in This World Anymore, a movie that easily could have been recognized for its screenplay, directing, and terrific lead performance by Melanie Lynskey. I haven't seen Raw, The Girl With All The Gifts, or Brigsby Bear yet, but I've heard those are great and I'm a little surprised not to see them pop up in any capacity here.\n\nCheck out the full list of nominees below, and be sure to hit the comments to let us know which ones you think will win.\n\nBEST FEATURE\n\nCall Me By Your Name\n\nThe Florida Project\n\nGet Out\n\nLady Bird\n\nThe Rider\n\nBEST FIRST FEATURE\n\nColumbus\n\nIngrid Goes West\n\nMenashe\n\nOh Lucy!\n\nPatti Cake$\n\nJOHN CASSAVETES AWARD (Given to the best feature made for under $500,000)\n\nDayveon\n\nA Ghost Story\n\nLife and nothing more\n\nMost Beautiful Island\n\nThe Transfiguration\n\nBEST DIRECTOR\n\nSean Baker, The Florida Project\n\nJonas Carpignano, A Ciambra\n\nLuca Guadagnino, Call Me By Your Name\n\nJordan Peele, Get Out\n\nBenny and Josh Safdie, Good Time\n\nChloe Zhao, The Rider\n\nBEST SCREENPLAY\n\nGreta Gerwig, Lady Bird\n\nAzazel Jacobs, The Lovers\n\nMartin McDonagh, Three Billboards Outside Ebbing, Missouri\n\nJordan Peele, Get Out\n\nMike White, Beatriz at Dinner\n\nBEST FIRST SCREENPLAY\n\nKris Avedisian (Story by Kyle Espeleta, Jesse Wakeman), Donald Cried\n\nEmily V.
