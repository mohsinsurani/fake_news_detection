Following the release of her first Christmas album ReJoyce: The Christmas Album (2004), which was certified gold, Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in The Dukes of Hazzard (2005). She also recorded a cover of \"These Boots Are Made for Walkin'\" for the film's soundtrack.

To date, the brand has earned over $1 billion in revenue. She also starred on the reality television series The Price of Beauty in 2010, judged clothing designs on two seasons of Fashion Star between 2012 and 2013, and published a memoir in 2020, Open Book, which reached number one on The New York Times Best Seller list after over 59,000 copies sold in the first week of its release.[4] Simpson is married to Eric Johnson, with whom she has three children.\n\nLife and career [ edit ]\n\n1980\u20131998: Childhood and career beginnings [ edit ]\n\nSimpson was born on July 10, 1980, in Abilene, Texas.[5] She is the first child of Tina Ann Simpson (n\u00e9e Drew), a homemaker,[6] and Joseph Simpson, a psychologist and Baptist youth minister.[citation needed] Simpson's parents married in 1978; they divorced in 2013.[7][8][9][10] Simpson has stated that she grew up in Dallas and Waco, but her parents now live in McGregor, Texas.[11] Simpson has a younger sister, Ashlee.[12] In her preteens she briefly attended Amelia Middle School while her father did outreach in Cincinnati, Ohio. After moving back to Texas 20 months later, she attended J. J. Pearce High School in Richardson during her teenage years, though she had to drop out in 1997 as her career began to take off; a year later she later earned her GED via distance learning through Texas Tech High School.[13][14][15] Simpson was raised in the Christian faith, and was given a purity ring by her father when she was twelve years old.[16] Jessica and her family moved frequently due to her father's job as a minister, though they remained in Texas for the most part; however, they did live in the Midwest for a few years.[17]\n\nShe began singing in the church choir as a child. When she was eleven, she dreamed of success as a singer while at a church retreat.[17] Simpson auditioned for The Mickey Mouse Club at the age of twelve, auditioning with a performance of \"Amazing Grace\" and dancing to \"Ice Ice Baby\" (1990).[17] She advanced through multiple rounds, eventually being a semi-finalist for the show alongside artists such as Britney Spears, Christina Aguilera, and Justin Timberlake.[17] Simpson claimed that she became nervous about her final audition after seeing Aguilera perform, and she was not selected for the show, ultimately.[17] Simpson resumed performing in her church choir, being discovered by the head of a Christian music label eventually.[17] He asked her for an audition initially and signed her immediately after she performed \"I Will Always Love You\" (1973) by Dolly Parton.[17] She began working on her debut album with Proclaim Records and touring to promote the project.[17] Jessica's father later claimed that she had to quit touring as the size of her breasts led to her being deemed too \"sexual\" for the genre.[17]\n\nHer debut album, Jessica, remained unreleased after Proclaim Records went bankrupt; despite this, her grandmother funded a limited pressing of the album personally.[18][19] Shortly after this, Simpson landed several auditions as Jessica was sent to numerous labels and producers.[17] Ultimately, she caught the attention of Tommy Mottola, then married to Mariah Carey and the head of Columbia Records.[17] He went on to sign her to the label, claiming \"She had a great little look and a great attitude, a fresh new face, and something a bit different than Britney and all of them; she could actually sing.\"[17] Simpson began working on her debut album in Orlando, Florida.[17] Mottola hoped to market Simpson as a contrast to Spears and Aguilera, both of whom had launched successful careers focused on dancing and sexuality.[17] While working on her musical debut, Simpson enlisted her father Joe as her manager; her mother became her stylist.[20] While at a Christmas party in 1998, Simpson met 98 Degrees singer Nick Lachey, and the two began dating; Lachey claimed that he left the party and told his mother that he would marry Simpson someday.[17]\n\n1999\u20132001: Breakthrough with early musical releases [ edit ]\n\nSimpson began working on her debut studio album in 1998. Mottola wanted Simpson to embrace an \"anti-sex appeal\" image while promoting the record, in contrast to those of highly successful artists Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera.[21] He believed the image would make Simpson more \"relatable\" to listeners, therefore aiding in sales.[21] Simpson went on to announce her plans to remain abstinent until marriage as a result of Mottola's decision.[22] Her debut single, \"I Wanna Love You Forever\" (1999), was released on September 28.[23][24] The single became a success in numerous territories, most notably reaching number three on the Billboard Hot 100 chart in the United States.[25] The song earned a platinum certification from the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) for sales exceeding one million copies in the country.[26] The album had some success in other territories as well, most notably in several European countries.[27][28]\n\nSimpson's debut studio album, Sweet Kisses (1999), was released on November 23.[29] The album sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number sixty-five on the Billboard 200 chart in the United States.[30] To promote the record, \"Where You Are\" (2000) was released as the second single from the album; Simpson's boyfriend Nick Lachey was featured on the track.[31] \"I Think I'm in Love with You\" (2000) served as the album's third and final single and achieved success in territories such as the United States.[32] With the success of the album's third single, Sweet Kisses rose to a new peak of number twenty-five on the Billboard 200 in August 2000.[32] The album sold over two million copies in the United States, earning a double platinum certification from the RIAA.[33] Simpson embarked on the Heat It Up Tour with her boyfriend's band, 98 Degrees, as their opening act to promote Sweet Kisses throughout 2000.[34]\n\nWork on her second album began in 2000, opting to record more \"radio-friendly\" and upbeat songs for the record.[35] During the recording of the album, Simpson adopted a more mature public image, a decision Simpson and her record label made in hopes to achieve the success of artists such as Spears.[35] While working on the record, Simpson ended her relationship with Lachey to focus on furthering her career; however, the two reconciled romantically that September.[34] In a July 2001 interview with Coventry Newspapers, Simpson explained \"I recorded [Sweet Kisses] when I was seventeen years old and I'm twenty-one [this month] so there is four years of growth involved.\"[36] Simpson released the record's title track, \"Irresistible\" (2001) as the lead single from the project in April.[37] The single received a generally mixed reaction from critics due to its sexual themes,[38] though it became her second top twenty hit on the Billboard Hot 100 chart.[39][40]\n\nSimpson released her second studio album, Irresistible (2001), in May.[41] The album sold 127,000 copies in the United States during its first week of release, debuting at number six on the Billboard 200 chart.[42] Though the album's first week sales nearly doubled those of her previous effort, Irresistible failed to match the success of her debut album; the record earned a gold certification from the RIAA for sales of 500,000 copies.[33] \"A Little Bit\" (2001), the album's second and final single, failed to achieve much success. To promote the record, Simpson embarked as a co-headliner on the Total Request Live Tour (2001) alongside artists such as Destiny's Child and Nelly.[43][44] She later left the tour to launch her own DreamChaser Tour (2001), for which Simpson added choreography and backup dancers to her performances; the tour was canceled following the September 11 attacks.[45]\n\n2002\u20132005: Marriage to Nick Lachey and heightened success [ edit ]\n\nSimpson announced her engagement to Nick Lachey in February 2002,[46] with the two holding their wedding ceremony on October 26 in Austin, Texas.[47] Simpson also began working on her third studio album in 2002. The album's lead single, \"Sweetest Sin\" (2003), dealt with the topic of Simpson losing her virginity to Lachey lyrically.[48] The song failed to achieve commercial success. Simpson's father pitched an idea to MTV about a reality show starring the couple, resulting in the creation of Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica.[49] The series focused on the marriage between Michael Jackson and Lisa Marie Presley initially, but the two backed out, allowing Simpson and Lachey to replace them.[50] The show, which focused on the couple's marriage and the recording of Simpson's third studio album primarily, premiered on August 19, 2003.[51][52] The show became a pop culture phenomenon instantly, with Simpson's perceived \"dumb blonde\" antics on the show helping to make the couple a household name.[53][54] The series was a ratings success for MTV and aired for three seasons until 2005.[54]\n\nSimpson's third studio album, In This Skin (2003), was released the day that Newlyweds: Nick and Jessica premiered, with the show serving as a promotional tool for the record. In This Skin debuted at number ten on the Billboard 200, selling 64,000 copies in its first week of release.[55] The album's opening numbers served as the lowest of Simpson's career at the time. In This Skin quickly declined the chart, and by December 2003 had sold just over 565,000 copies in the United States.[55] Simpson released \"With You\" (2003) as the second single from the album in October.[56] The single became a hit, reaching the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100 and topping the Mainstream Top 40 chart based on radio airplay.[32] Simpson appeared in the halftime show of the Super Bowl XXXVIII. She recorded new material for a re-release of In This Skin, which was released in March 2004.[57][58][59] The re-release aided in album sales dramatically; In This Skin went on to sell three million copies in the United States.[60] Both \"Take My Breath Away\" (2004) and \"Angels\" (2004) were released as singles from the re-release.[61]\n\nSimpson and Lachey starred in the ABC special The Nick and Jessica Variety Hour in April, which featured guest appearances by celebrities such as Jewel and Mr. T, among others.[62] That same month, she launched her Jessica Simpson Desserts by Jessica Simpson cosmetics line along with Randi Shinder; all of the products in the line were edible.[63] Simpson embarked on her Reality Tour (2004) throughout North America beginning in June; the tour was a financial success, and ended in October.[64] During this time, Simpson and her husband began making guest appearances on The Ashlee Simpson Show, chronicling the start of Jessica's sister's music career.[65] Simpson's fourth studio album, a collection of Christmas themed songs titled ReJoyce: The Christmas Album (2004), was released on November 23.[66] The album reached a peak of number fourteen on the Billboard 200, and was certified gold by the RIAA for sales exceeding 500,000 copies.[67] Also in 2004, Simpson filmed a sitcom pilot for ABC, which the network did not pick-up.[68] In February 2005, Simpson and Shinder launched the Dessert Treats edible cosmetics line, similar to their prior line but targeted towards a younger audience. Both lines were canceled following a string of lawsuits.[69]\n\nSimpson performed \"The Star-Spangled Banner\" at the Indy 500 in 2005.[70] Simpson launched The Jessica Simpson Collection in 2005, initially partnering with Tarrant Apparel Group to release the Princy and JS by Jessica Simpson clothing lines.[71] The company has continued to grow throughout the years, and in 2014 was reported to earn $1 billion in annual sales.[72] Simpson made her film debut as Daisy Duke in the film adaption of The Dukes of Hazzard (2005).[73] While the film was met with negative reviews from film critics generally, it grossed over $111 million worldwide.[74] Simpson recorded the song \"These Boots Are Made For Walkin'\" (2005) to promote the film; it both samples and shares the title of a Nancy Sinatra song.[75] The song entered the top twenty of the Billboard Hot 100, becoming one Simpson's most successful singles to date.[76] The music video, which featured Simpson in character as Daisy Duke, was controversial for featuring Simpson in \"revealing\" outfits and washing the General Lee car in her bikini.[77] The controversy resulted in the music video being banned in some countries.[78] In November 2005, Simpson and Lachey announced they were separating.[79] Simpson filed for divorce in December 2005, citing \"irreconcilable differences.\"[80] Their divorce was publicized worldwide and finalized on June 30, 2006.[81] Reportedly, she had to pay Lachey $12 million in their divorce since she had not signed a pre-nuptial agreement before they wed.[82] In a 2015 interview, Simpson called her marriage to Lachey her \"biggest financial mistake\".[82]\n\n2006\u20132009: A Public Affair, movies, and Do You Know [ edit ]\n\nSimpson began working on her fifth studio album in 2005.

Simpson forgot the lyrics to the song and the performance received harsh criticism; she also received a chance to redo the song for the cameras, though her performance was cut from the broadcast ultimately.[90][91] Critics noted the underperformance of both Simpson's fifth studio album and her second film as her sister Ashlee experienced a similar decline in success.[92]\n\nSimpson had an on-again, off-again relationship with singer-songwriter John Mayer from August 2006 to May 2007.[93][94] Long after their breakup, Simpson described her relationship with Mayer in her 2020 memoir, Open Book.[93]\n\nIn November 2007, Simpson began dating Dallas Cowboys quarterback Tony Romo. Cowboys fans considered the relationship controversial, as some blamed Simpson for Romo's poor performance in games after the pair got together. Some fans dubbed Simpson \"Yoko Romo,\" a reference to Yoko Ono, to whom many fans of The Beatles attributed the quartet disbanding in 1970. [95] Even then-president George W. Bush commented on the pair's relationship, blaming Simpson implicitly for Romo's lackluster performances.[96] Reportedly, Simpson and Romo ended their relationship in July 2009.[97] During the relationship, Simpson also appeared alongside Luke Wilson in the film Blonde Ambition (2007); it had a limited release in Texas before being released on home media.[98] Later, she starred in the direct-to-video film Private Valentine: Blonde & Dangerous (2008), portraying an actress who joins the military. The film received a negative reaction overwhelmingly upon its release.[99] Simpson collaborated with Parlux Fragrances to launch her first scent, Fancy, in 2008. The fragrance, unlike Private Valentine, received a positive commercial reaction.[100]\n\nSimpson began working on her sixth studio album in 2007, with her father claiming that she was experimenting with country music for the record.[101] Simpson claimed to have grown up around country music, and wanted to \"give something back.\"[102] She released \"Come On Over\" (2008) as the project's lead single on June 20.[103] The song debuted at number forty-one on the Billboard Hot Country Songs chart, making it the highest debut for an artist's first entry on that chart.[104] Do You Know (2008) was released on September 9.[105] The project sold 65,000 copies in its first week of release, debuting at number four on the Billboard 200 chart.[106] The album has sold just over 200,000 copies in the United States as of 2012.[107] Simpson opened for country music group Rascal Flatts on their Bob That Head Tour (2009) from January to March 2009.[108] Simpson's attempt to transition into country music received a negative reaction.

How was I supposed to live a real, healthy life filtered through the lens of a reality show?
