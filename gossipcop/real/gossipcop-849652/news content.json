(And we can now be clear that Ronald Reagan wasn\u2019t just some fluke.)\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAnd so, Dwayne \u201cthe Rock\u201d Johnson\u2014the black-Samoan former pro wrestler of the Fast and the Furious franchise, Jumanji: Welcome to the Jungle and Moana movie fame, as well as \u201cTyrese beefs\u201d and Ballers (the last two should preclude him from showing his face outside, much less running for the land\u2019s highest office)\u2014said in an interview published in Variety on Thursday that he would \u201c100 percent consider\u201d running for president, but it would most likely be in 2024 (not 2020 as first reported), because he has to make that Hollywood skrilla first.\n\n\u201cRealistically, as we go into 2018, when you look at my slate as we\u2019re developing and shooting into 2019 and 2020, the slate goes deep into 2021, so it feels like the realistic consideration would be 2024,\u201d he said.\n\nJohnson said that it was the people who really made him consider the move. On Saturday Night Live in May, he first touted the possibility of a run:\n\nAdvertisement\n\n\u201cIt was never something that I trumpeted and beat my chest and ever said publicly, \u2018This is what I\u2019m going to do,\u2019 but as that story picked up, Americans picked it up and there was this sentiment of, \u2018We\u2019re not joking, and we would really love the idea if you would run,\u2019\u201d he said.\n\nIn the interview, the Rock also spoke his mind on the current administration.\n\n\u201cI continue to watch our leaders in government, and like all Americans, I continue to be hopeful that our leaders exhibit poise, perspective and the ability to bring our country together during these tough times\u2014which I don\u2019t feel our presidency is currently doing\u2014so that\u2019s where I\u2019m at,\u201d Johnson added.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nAs for his party affiliation, Johnson has attended both Republican and Democratic national conventions in the past and says he is a registered independent.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png",
