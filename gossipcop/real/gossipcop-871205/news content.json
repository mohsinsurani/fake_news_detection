She keeps her purses spotless and cleans them out every single night. The model is lactose intolerant so she avoids dairy - but she craves \u201cmac and cheese, every single day of my life.\u201d Although she is a style icon in her own right, Graham considers Kim Kardashian West her fashion icon. If she had to choose one product to never live without, she would choose rose water. Graham\u2019s modelling icon is supermodel Cindy Crawford, whose Revlon campaigns she had taped to her wall when she was younger Of all the countries, Graham would most like to visit India. Her and her husband Justin Ervin met at a New York City church in 2009, where Graham was volunteering. Graham considers panty lines her biggest pet peeve. When asked what item every woman should have in her closet, Graham told Vogue a \u201cbra, duh.\u201d The best fashion advice she\u2019s ever been given is \u201cbeauty comes in all shapes and sizes, rock your confidence.\u201d The supermodel is into conspiracy theories revolving around the existence of mermaids and aliens - and loves watching YouTube videos about them Although she has walked in many runway shows, Graham thinks the hardest part is \u201cstaying focused and not looking at the audience\u201d - a struggle when the audience is full of impressive people. Graham is confident and believes she can pull of anything - in response to a question about one look she cannot pull off, she said: \u201cCurvy girls can pull off any look, it is what we do.\u201d If she had to choose a spirit animal, she would pick a bird. Her advice for young women is to \u201clove the skin you are in and be your own role model.\u201d Although her career keeps her extremely busy, the model made time to binge-watch the Netflix series Stranger Things. If she could choose one show to get a reboot, it would be Sister, Sister. Her husband of eight years calls her \u201cbutt,\u201d - a nickname she doesn\u2019t think it is necessary for her to explain. Graham\u2019s favourite lipstick is a nude colour from Charlotte Tilbury called Pillowtalk. She prefers SUVs over sedans, a preference she made clear as she got into a chauffeured car to New York Fashion Week. Finally, the one question she wishes people would stop asking her is \u201cWhat do you think of the term plus-size?\u201d Instead of the term plus-size, the body-positivity advocate prefers to use \u201ccurvy.\u201d\n\nSince becoming a supermodel in 2016, Graham has defied odds and carved a name for herself in the fashion industry.\n\nGraham shared 73 things about herself in an interview (Vogue)\n\nOverall, Graham\u2019s illustrious career in modelling has made her a role model and an inspiration.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/06/18/gettyimages-488345266.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/06/18/gettyimages-488345266.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/06/18/gettyimages-488345266.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Chelsea Ritschel", "In New York"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/ashley-graham-clothes-instagram-worth-husband-supermodel-designer-author-a8480231.html", "title": "21 things you may not know about Ashley Graham", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The plus-size supermodel has written two books", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Lifestyle", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/life-style", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2018-08-06T18:18:55.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "21 things you may not know about Ashley Graham", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/life-style/ashley-graham-clothes-instagram-worth-husband-supermodel-designer-author-a8480231.html", "type": "article", "description": "The plus-size supermodel has written two books", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/06/18/gettyimages-488345266.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/06/18/gettyimages-488345266.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-08-06T18:18:55.000Z", "modified_time": "2018-08-06T18:18:55.000Z", "section": "Lifestyle", "author_name": "Chelsea Ritschel", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 188, "image_count": 2, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 0, "internal_link_count": 1, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2018-08-06T18:18:55.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "21 things you may not know about Ashley Graham", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The plus-size supermodel has written two books", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2018/08/06/18/gettyimages-488345266.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Ashley Graham,plus-size,Model,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1533579535.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
