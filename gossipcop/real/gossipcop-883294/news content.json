Co-created by and starring Pamela Adlon, a veteran actor and longtime creative partner to co-creator Louis C.K., this FX comedy-drama plunges into the specificity of its harried heroine\u2019s day-to-day reality, unearthing touching life lessons that are never trite thanks to the series\u2019 wary tone. The network just gave the show a second-season order, along with Donald Glover\u2018s hip-hop comedy \u201cAtlanta.\u201d\n\nComparisons to \u201cLouie\u201d will be inevitable when it comes to \u201cBetter Things.\u201d Adlon produced, wrote and appeared on that acclaimed show, earning four Emmy nominations in the process. Plus, Louis C.K. has a hand in the writing early episodes of \u201cBetter Things,\u201d even directing the pilot. There\u2019s no question the two performers share a candid, downbeat sensibility, but \u201cBetter Things\u201d is far more than just \u201cLouie 2.\u201d Drawing from aspects of her own life, Adlon understands the show\u2019s milieu intimately, and that lived-in quality makes this series feel particularly close to the heart, adding pathos to the somber moments and an extra sting to the jokes.\n\nAdlon plays Sam, who had much success as a young actress but now finds herself as the middle-aged mother to three daughters. Auditioning for roles and trying to stave off Hollywood perceptions that she\u2019s too old to be bankable, Sam has no love life outside of an occasional (and unseen) hookup buddy, her most intense relationship being with her girls. Each daughter is complicated in an un-stereotypical way: Teenage Max (Mikey Madison) likes pushing her independence and sexiness; anxious middle-child Frankie (Hannah Alligood) flaunts her political activism, perhaps in part to counter potential personal problems; while grade-schooler Duke (Olivia Edward) simply adores her mother, giving Sam the fewest headaches.\n\nAlso Read: FX Renews 'Atlanta,' 'Better Things' for Second Seasons\n\n\u201cBetter Things\u201d quickly establishes Sam\u2019s messy life \u2014 between work, family and friends, she\u2019s stretched in myriad directions and perpetually exhausted \u2014 but Adlon (who also co-writes) fights against the scenario\u2019s inherent sentimentality. Neither perfect angels nor sitcom-generic brats, Sam\u2019s kids demand a lot from her, and as the series rolls along we see how she has to be a different mother to each of them, sometimes finding the right answer and other times flailing badly. Adlon (who herself has three daughters) views each character in Sam\u2019s family \u2014 including her outspoken mother (Celia Imrie), who lives across the street \u2014 as a woman on her own journey, each trying to negotiate the specific chapter of life in which she finds herself.\n\nWorking with modest plots, the typical \u201cBetter Things\u201d episode stumbles into a simple truth in an offhand way. In one, Sam brings a director (played by a charming Lenny Kravitz) over to her house for dinner with her family, the story morphing from a commentary on race relations to the perils of falling for a guy who\u2019s kinda-sorta still married. In another, Sam\u2019s concerns about connecting with the prickly Frankie dovetail with a parallel narrative in which she might land a coveted role on a new TV show \u2014 except she doesn\u2019t know that, only the audience aware of the show\u2019s possible existence. The latter episode is particularly insightful in showing how our small daily struggles blind us to other developments happening on the periphery that might change our life, entirely outside of our control or knowledge.\n\nBecause the show is set in Los Angeles, it\u2019s not surprising that Adlon takes shots at plastic surgery and diva-ish Hollywood stars. (Her \u201cCalifornication\u201d co-star David Duchovny has a blast playing a checked-out version of himself in one episode.) But those admittedly easy jokes are outnumbered by shrewd observations about the realities of being a working actress. Shuffling between voiceover work \u2014 Adlon won an Emmy for \u201cKing of the Hill\u201d \u2014 and one-off parts on TV shows, Sam has a comfortable life and a nice house, but \u201cBetter Things\u201d recognizes that those achievements don\u2019t immunize her from the same insecurities that bedevil other artists \u2014 nor does it make her job as a single mom any easier.\n\nAlso Read: 'Better Things' Review: Pamela Adlon Delivers One of Fall's Best TV Shows\n\nAdlon plays Sam with no-nonsense wit, the character constantly oscillating between a nervous breakdown and a sarcastic barb. And the three daughters are all strong, with Madison and Alligood particularly good at suggesting the impossibly temperamental demeanor of young people. \u201cBetter Things\u201d isn\u2019t particularly innovative, but that\u2019s apt for characters who are just fighting to keep their head above water. Adlon\u2019s show doesn\u2019t romanticize that struggle or attempt to make it cutesy \u2014 which is probably why it will speak to a lot of very tired, overworked people trying to carve out some free time to watch at home.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png", "https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/popup/logo-signup2.png",
