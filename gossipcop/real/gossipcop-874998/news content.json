By that time, the Hawkins kids will be ready for college. Matt added, \"We just have to keep adjusting the story. Though I don't know if we can justify something bad happening to them once a year.\"\n\n\"They\u2019re going to have to get the f*ck out of this town! It\u2019s ridiculous!\" Ross joked. The pair also teased the second season's bigger scope, a chance to \"push things a bit\".\n\n\"I told Matt, 'I don\u2019t want to call it season two, I just want it to feel like a movie sequel.' If you have a successful movie, No. 2 is always a little bit bigger,\" Ross explained.\n\nNetflix hasn't been shy about Eleven (Millie Bobby Brown)'s return to the series after her sacrifice at the end of last season, though the show's Comic-Con trailer seemed to hint at the exact nature of her return: an escape through a tear in the Upside Down, and back into the real world.\n\nThe new season also sees the return of Winona Ryder, Gaten Matarazzo, Finn Wolfhard, Natalia Dyer, Charlie Heaton, and Joe Keery. We even got a first glimpse at Goonies star Sean Astin, who joins the cast and adds just that little extra sprinkle of '80s nostalgia.\n\nStranger Things season 2 arrives on Netflix 27 October.", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/11/11/stranger-things-s2.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://www.independent.co.uk/img/pixels-player-logo.svg", "https://www.independent.co.uk/img/logo-white-out.svg"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/11/11/stranger-things-s2.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Clarisse Loughrey"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/stranger-things-season-2-3-4-confirmed-release-date-trailer-the-duffer-brothers-eleven-a7906116.html", "title": "Stranger Things season 3 confirmed, season 4 likely", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "The second season of Netflix's hit sci-fi series will arrive just in time for Halloween", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/arts-entertainment/tv/news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-08-22T09:38:19.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Stranger Things season 3 is officially happening", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/tv/news/stranger-things-season-2-3-4-confirmed-release-date-trailer-the-duffer-brothers-eleven-a7906116.html", "type": "article", "description": "The second season of Netflix's hit sci-fi series will arrive just in time for Halloween", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/11/11/stranger-things-s2.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/11/11/stranger-things-s2.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-22T09:38:19.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-22T09:38:19.000Z", "section": "Culture", "subsection": "TV & Radio", "author_name": "Clarisse Loughrey", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 352, "image_count": 1, "embed_count": 1, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 2, "external_link_count": 1}, "date": "2017-08-22T09:38:19.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "vf": {"owner": "viafoura-id:11000176832122"}, "twitter": {"title": "Stranger Things season 3 is officially happening", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "The second season of Netflix's hit sci-fi series will arrive just in time for Halloween", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/05/11/11/stranger-things-s2.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "Stranger Things,Stranger Things season 2,Netflix,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503394699.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
