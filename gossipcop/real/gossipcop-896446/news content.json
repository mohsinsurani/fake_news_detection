More info\n\nAcne is common during pregnancy but after announcing she is expecting her first child, the former Suits actress\u2019 skin appeared more gorgeous than ever. Doctor Ross Perry, skin care expert and owner of skin clinics chain Cosmedics, told Express.co.uk that in order to get Meghan\u2019s constant glowing complexion there are several hacks you can follow. Mr Perry said: \u201cDo regular steams at home, exfoliate a couple of times a week, drink vast amounts of water to keep skin hydrated and wear a sun protection factor at all times. \u201cThis will help avoid pigmentation on the face.\n\n\u201cStick to a healthy diet of leafy greens packed full of antioxidants, fruit and veg.\u201d However, the skin expert pointed out that in order to sport an utterly flawless skin like Meghan did on her wedding day, \u201cseveral months of perfecting are involved\u201d. Mr Perry explained: \u201cMeghan would have started a skin regime months ahead, specifically designed to improve the skin\u2019s health from within, such as laser, microdermabrasion or skin peels. \u201cWe also know she had regular bespoke facials.\n\nMeghan Markle manages to keep her skin radiant and glowing at all times\n\nAfter announcing she is pregnant, the former Suits actress\u2019 skin appered more gorgeous than ever\n\n\u201cSkin peels can promote collagen production and stimulate cell renewal, tightening the skin and promoting a more even skin tone with a natural glow.\u201d The doctor also believes Princess Eugenie was as dedicated to her skin routine as her new cousin-in-law, estimating she followed \u201ca seven step programme for at least six months\u201d. The skin care expert suggested Eugenie sported what is called a \u201cglass skin\u201d on her wedding day, which is \u201cthe Korean beauty technique that involves creating a gleaming, porcelain-like effect on the skin\u201d. But Mr Perry warned: \u201cUnfortunately It's not something you get overnight \u2013 it's consistent skincare over a number of months which gives you that refined texture and involves double cleansing and the seven skin method.\n\nMeghan sported an utterly perfect skin at her wedding, but months of \"perfecting were involved\"\n\nEugenie sported what is called a \u201cglass skin\u201d on her
