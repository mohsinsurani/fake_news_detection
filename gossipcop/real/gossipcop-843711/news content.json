I try to better myself everyday for you two.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: JWoww Says It\u2019s \u2018Karma\u2019 That Jersey Shore Castmate Ronnie Is Having a Baby Girl\n\nContinued Farley, \u201cIn the end when nothing else matters, I just want to look back and know I gave you guys unconditional love, endless happy memories, sense of security and personality traits that will allow you to grow and prosper as 2 beautiful humans inside and out \u2026 to always choose kindness over hate \u2026 stand up for what\u2019s right and always keep it [100], like mommy and daddy. #happymothersday.\u201d\n\nRELATED GALLERY: Gym, Tan, Baby! Can You Match the Jersey Shore Cast Members to Their Mini Meatballs?\n\nSpeaking to PEOPLE recently, Farley opened up about how she coped with being away from her kids while filming Jersey Shore Family Vacation in Miami earlier this year.\n\n\u201cI really think Bad Moms, as funny of a comedy it was, really paved the way for people like Nicole [\u2018Snooki\u2019 Polizzi] and I to say it\u2019s okay to have fun as a mom,\u201d she said. \u201cI feel like there\u2019s a huge stigma \u2014 the moment you have kids, you\u2019re not allowed to drink, you\u2019re not allowed to put makeup on, how dare you take time to work out!\u201d\n\nAdded Farley, \u201cThere\u2019s just this stereotype that Nicole and I love to shut down and prove that you can be a phenomenal mother, but at the same time you can find time for yourself and it\u2019s okay.\u201d\n\nJersey Shore Family Vacation airs Thursdays at 8 p.m. ET on MTV.", "images":
