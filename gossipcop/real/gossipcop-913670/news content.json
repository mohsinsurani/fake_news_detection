My ovary has settled in on the muscles around the sacral nerves in my back that allow us to walk. Let\u2019s please not even talk about my uterine lining. The only beautiful detail is that the organ\u2014which is meant to be shaped like a light bulb\u2014was shaped like a heart.\u201d\n\nLena says her decision to undergo the elective surgery was a tough one, following \u201cyears of complex surgeries measuring in the double digits\u201d and even alternative treatments like \u201cpelvic floor therapy, massage therapy, pain therapy, color therapy, acupuncture,\u201d and yoga.\n\nLena has been hospitalized at least three times in less than a year for endometriosis. Last April, she underwent surgery to free her ovaries from her rectal wall. Afterward, Lena declared she was endometriosis-free. But, sadly, on May 1, during her appearance at the Met Gala in NYC, she was rushed to a local hospital for complications. Days later, Lena canceled her nationwide \u201cLenny IRL\u201d tour, telling fans that she was, \u201cin the greatest amount of physical pain that I have ever experienced\" after doctors discovered more endometriosis during subsequent surgery.\n\nWith her hysterectomy now behind her, hopefully, the worst is over for Lena. The former Girls star recently announced that she'd return to HBO with a new series, Camping. But perhaps she'll soon share even happier news: Lena reveals she\u2019s determined to have children and is already exploring her options.\n\n\u201cI may have felt choiceless before, but I know I have choices now,\u201d she writes. \u201cSoon I\u2019ll start exploring whether my ovaries, which remain someplace inside me in that vast cavern of organs and scar tissue, have eggs. Adoption is a thrilling truth I\u2019ll pursue with all my might.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/376x160/object_files/endofound.org/2018/02/14/hysterectomy2.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/object_files/endofound.org/settings/logo.png", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/200x200/object_files/endofound.org/2022/08/10/upendo.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/200x200/object_files/endofound.org/2022/07/21/warriors-summer-event.png", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/200x200/object_files/endofound.org/2022/09/22/amy-schumer.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/object_files/endofound.org/2018/02/13/voque.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/200x200/object_files/endofound.org/2022/07/21/InfertilityArticleEndoFound.png", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/loader.gif", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/376x160/object_files/endofound.org/2018/01/29/naomi-Elhadad.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/themes/frontend/2018/resource/images/2021/founders_thumb.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/200x200/object_files/endofound.org/2022/07/28/TCS2022MeetTheEndoTeam.png", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/940x/object_files/endofound.org/2018/02/11/lena-dunham2.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/40x/member_images/sheena-foster2.jpg", "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/940x/object_files/endofound.org/2018/02/13/lena-dunham.jpg"], "top_img": "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/940x/object_files/endofound.org/2018/02/11/lena-dunham2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.endofound.org/breaking-lena-dunham-reveals-her-latest-endometriosis-battle-i-had-a-total-hysterectomy", "title": "Lena Discusses Her Most Painful Choice", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Actress Lena Dunham says that in recent months she underwent a total hysterectomy in an attempt to finally end her years-long battle with chronic pain stemming from endometriosis.", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lena Discusses Her Most Painful Choice", "description": "Actress Lena Dunham says that in recent months she underwent a total hysterectomy in an attempt to finally end her years-long battle with chronic pain stemming from endometriosis.", "url": "https://www.endofound.org/breaking-lena-dunham-reveals-her-latest-endometriosis-battle-i-had-a-total-hysterectomy", "site_name": "Endometriosis : Causes - Symptoms - Diagnosis - and Treatment", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/940x/object_files/endofound.org/2018/02/11/lena-dunham2.jpg", "width": 400, "height": 400}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/endofound", "tag": "Lena Discusses Her Most Painful Choice", "section": "News", "published_time": "2018-02-15T22:46:29-05:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "Actress Lena Dunham says that in recent months she underwent a total hysterectomy in an attempt to finally end her years-long battle with chronic pain stemming from endometriosis.", "title": "Lena Discusses Her Most Painful Choice", "site": "@endofound", "image": "https://www.endofound.org/member_files/size/940x/object_files/endofound.org/2018/02/11/lena-dunham2.jpg", "creator": "@endofound"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1518752789.0, "source": "https://www.endofound.org", "summary": ""}
