Spurlock also admitted to being \u201cunfaithful to every wife and girlfriend I have ever had\u201d.\n\n\u201cAs I sit around watching hero after hero, man after man, fall at the realisation of their past indiscretions, I don\u2019t sit by and wonder \u2018who will be next?\u2019 I wonder, \u2018when will they come for me?\u2019\u201d Spurlock wrote.\n\nThe director said that the allegation of rape occurred while he was at college. While no charges or investigations were brought against him, the claimant named Spurlock in an essay on the incident that was read aloud in class.\n\n\u201cIn my mind, we\u2019d been drinking all night and went back to my room,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe began fooling around, she pushed me off, then we laid in the bed and talked and laughed some more, and then began fooling around again. We took off our clothes. She said she didn\u2019t want to have sex, so we laid together, and talked, and kissed, and laughed, and then we started having sex.\u201d\n\nWhen the woman then started to cry Spurlock said that he \u201cdidn\u2019t know what to do. We stopped having sex and I rolled beside her. I tried to comfort her. To make her feel better. I thought I was doing ok, I believed she was feeling better. She believed she was raped.\u201d\n\nI am Part of the Problem\n\n\n\nRead: https://t.co/MfRAtm3fcv \u2014 Morgan Spurlock (@MorganSpurlock) December 14, 2017\n\nSpurlock said the allegation of harassment was made by an office assistant in 2009, and that he had paid a sum to settle it.\n\n\u201cI would call my female assistant \u2018hot pants\u2019 or \u2018sex pants\u2019 when I was yelling to her from the other side of the office. Something I thought was funny at the time, but then realized I had completely demeaned and belittled her to a place of non-existence.\n\n\u201cSo, when she decided to quit, she came to me and said if I didn\u2019t pay her a settlement, she would tell everyone. Being who I was, it was the last thing I wanted, so of course, I paid. I paid for peace of mind. I paid for her silence and cooperation. Most of all, I paid so I could remain who I was,\u201d he said.\n\nThe director said that he had been the victim of sexual abuse as a child, and had a drinking problem. He concluded the letter by promising to \u201cdo better. The only individual I have control over is me. So starting today, I\u2019m going to be more honest with you and myself. I\u2019m going to lay it all out in the open. Maybe that will be a start. Who knows. But I do know I\u2019ve talked enough in my life. I\u2019m finally ready to listen.\u201d\n\nThe admission by Spurlock follows a number of sexual abuse allegations made against men in the entertainment industry, including James Toback, Kevin Spacey and Harvey Weinstein. In an essay published by the New York Times on Wednesday, actor Salma Hayek joined more than 90 women in accusing Weinstein of sexual assault. The producer denies any claims of non-consensual sex made against him.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6595d7e4bb9ab6a21fe2958b3804551b45a3f62d/598_139_2357_1414/master/2357.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=136e72e029b0d571a5013e0fad78b676", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Morgan+Spurlock%2CFilm%2CCulture%2CSexual+harassment", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6595d7e4bb9ab6a21fe2958b3804551b45a3f62d/598_139_2357_1414/master/2357.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6595d7e4bb9ab6a21fe2958b3804551b45a3f62d/598_139_2357_1414/master/2357.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=136e72e029b0d571a5013e0fad78b676", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Gwilym Mumford"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/14/super-size-me-morgan-spurlock-sexual-misconduct-twitter", "title": "Super Size Me's Morgan Spurlock admits sexual misconduct in open letter", "meta_data": {"description": "The director says he was accused of rape at college, has settled a harassment claim and has been unfaithful to \u2018every wife and girlfriend\u2019 he has had", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/14/super-size-me-morgan-spurlock-sexual-misconduct-twitter", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6595d7e4bb9ab6a21fe2958b3804551b45a3f62d/598_139_2357_1414/master/2357.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&enable=upscale&s=136e72e029b0d571a5013e0fad78b676", "height": 720}, "title": "Super Size Me's Morgan Spurlock admits sexual misconduct in open letter", "description": "The director says he was accused of rape at college, has settled a harassment claim and has been unfaithful to \u2018every wife and girlfriend\u2019 he has had", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/gwilym-mumford", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2017-12-14T14:02:06.000Z", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2017-12-14T12:55:02.000Z", "tag": "Morgan Spurlock,Film,Culture,Sexual harassment"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2017/dec/14/super-size-me-morgan-spurlock-sexual-misconduct-twitter?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2017/dec/14/super-size-me-morgan-spurlock-sexual-misconduct-twitter", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2017/dec/14/super-size-me-morgan-spurlock-sexual-misconduct-twitter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2017/dec/14/super-size-me-morgan-spurlock-sexual-misconduct-twitter?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/6595d7e4bb9ab6a21fe2958b3804551b45a3f62d/598_139_2357_1414/master/2357.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTcucG5n&s=e05fad88e0e38d21b6b5a6f4b270d5de", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513209600.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
