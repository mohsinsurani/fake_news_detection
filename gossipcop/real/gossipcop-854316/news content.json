That legacy is getting the career-retrospective treatment with a new collection titled simply and fittingly Chris Cornell. The compilation will come in two forms \u2014 a 17-track album and a massive 64-track limited deluxe box set \u2014 and covers all the aforementioned projects, including previously unreleased material (11 tracks worth, on the box-set edition) such as the newly unveiled song \"When Bad Does Good,\" which you stream above. Chris Cornell is due November 16th (you can be pre-order it here) and marks the first release under the singer's name since the his death in May 2017.\n\n\"When Bad Does Good\" was produced, recorded and mixed by Cornell and was unearthed from his personal recordings archive after his friend Josh Brolin reminded his wife Vicky of the unreleased song. It was reportedly a favorite of Cornell's.\n\n\"Since Chris' sudden passing I have put all my efforts and energy into sharing his music and legacy with his fans from all over the world,\" says Vicky, who worked extensively with Chris' bandmates and friends to compile the self-titled collection. \"I felt we needed to create a special collection to represent all of him \u2014 the friend, husband and father, the risk taker and innovator, the poet and artist. His soaring vocals found their way into the hearts and souls of so many. His voice was his vision and his words were his peace. This album is for his fans.\"\n\nSee the full track listing below.\n\nChris Cornell Single Disc Track List\n\n1. \"Loud Love\" (Soundgarden)\n\n2. \"Outshined\" (Soundgarden)\n\n3. \"Hunger Strike\"
