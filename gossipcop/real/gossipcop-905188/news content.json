William previously revealed that the couple's two children, particularly George, are good at arts and crafts - so Kate might well be opening something handmade on her birthday.\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge turns 36 on Tuesday\n\nKate was a proud parent on Monday as she waved her little girl off for her first day at nursery. Kensington Palace released two photographs of the young Princess captured by the Duchess, which were taken shortly before she left for her first day at the Willcocks Nursery School. The little girl was dressed for the occasion by her stylish mum, and was wrapped up warm in a burgundy double-breasted wool coat by Amaia Kids, teamed the coat with grey cable knit tights and a pink cashmere cable knit scarf by royal designer Marie-Chantal. A pair of Mary Jane shoes from Spanish designer Dona Carmen, a red hair tie \u2013 also by Amaia Kids \u2013 and a Cath Kidston rucksack completed her look.\n\nKate is set to spend her birthday with her family\n\nThis will be Kate's final birthday as a mother-of-two, with the pregnant Duchess due to give birth to her third baby in April \u2013 a little brother or sister for George and Charlotte.
