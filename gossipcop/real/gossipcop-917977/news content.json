There were rousing musical performances, including a stirring In Memoriam tribute. There was even a star-studded field trip! Here are 7 Memorable Moments you are sure to want to talk about with your best Oscar friends.\n\nIn his opening monologue, returning Oscars host Jimmy Kimmel wasted no time promising there would be no sequel to the 2017 Best Picture mishap. With one caveat: \"This year, when you hear your name called, don't get up right away.\n\nAmong this year's Oscar nominees for Music (Original Song) which featured performances by Common, Gael Garc\u00eda Bernal, Andra Day and more, nominee Mary J. Blige gave an astounding performance of \"Mighty River,\" from her film, MUDBOUND.\n\nAs the ultimate \"thank you\" to movie-goers around the world, host Jimmy Kimmel took a group of stars across the street from the Oscars ceremony to a movie theater, where they surprised the audience with snacks and stars!\n\nJordan Peele took a triumphant walk up to the podium to accept his Oscar award for Writing (Original Screenplay) for his film, GET OUT.\n\nDuring her acceptance speech for Actress in a Leading Role for THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING, MISSOURI, Frances McDormand wanted to pay homage and celebrate female filmmakers everywhere, and asked all of the nominated women in the audience to stand up.\n\nIn his opening monologue, Jimmy Kimmel promised the Oscar winner with the shortest acceptance speech, a prize of a jet ski! That honor went to costume designer, Mark Bridges, who won for his work on PHANTOM THREAD. And as Jimmy wrapped up the show, a happy Mark Bridges rode out on his new jet ski!\n\nIn what looked like a repeat of the 2017 Oscars, Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway returned to present the award for Best Picture. Making sure not to repeat the incorrect winner, they triumphantly announced the winner as THE SHAPE OF WATER.\n\nDon't miss a minute as Jimmy Kimmel hosts Hollywood's biggest night!
