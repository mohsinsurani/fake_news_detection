In the video, the Reputation songstress joins Jennifer Nettles and Kristian Bush, along with Legends of Tomorrow star Brandon Routh in a retro drama that features Swift as a fiery redhead, who seems to be the other woman in Nettles and Routh's marriage.\n\nThe full video, which drops June 9, looks to be a Mad Men-style melodrama, complete with bright throwback fashions, martini dinners and tense moments in the office.\n\n\"It's your favorite summer movie you haven't seen yet,\" Bush told ET's Nancy O'Dell ahead of the clip's debut. \"It's red-headed Taylor. Which I think is... it could be a giveaway if you're a Mad Men fan, but maybe not.\"\n\n\"It's cinematic,\" Nettles agreed, adding that Swift actually wrote the treatment for the video and helped shape the look. \"It's a period piece, if you will.\"\n\nSwift originally wrote \"Babe\" with Train singer Patrick Monahan for her 2012 album, Red.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s very confessional in what she does with her songwriting,\" Nettles teased to O\u2019Dell at the 2018 Academy of Country Music Awards in Las Vegas, Nevada, back in April. \"She lives her life out there through it, and you will see.\u201d\n\nBush shared that the collaboration came about after Swift, who is a longtime Sugarland fan, called up the duo wanting to work with them.\n\n\u201cShe was gracious enough to reach out to us when she heard we were coming back together and doing a record,\u201d Bush said. \u201cShe said, 'I have a song, would you like to do it?' And we said, \u2018Uh, yeah!\u2019 I was a little anxious. I didn't want to mess it up!\u201d\n\n\u201cBut she loved it and wanted [us] to be a part of it, which is exciting,\u201d Nettles added. \u201cShe said, \u2018I have a song,\u2019 and we said, \u2018OK. Send it over.\u2019\u201d\n\nNettles pointed out that while it\u2019s \u201cso sweet\u201d that Swift is a fan, the two acts have been on similar paths with their careers, so it\u2019s only fitting that a collaboration came about.\n\n\u201cWhen she started out, we were just starting out,\u201d Nettles explained. \u201cLike, she has our EP that we did before we were even signed. This little EP that we signed for her. It's a nice full circle, for sure. She's a fantastic songwriter. One of the best.\u201d\n\nSee more in the video below!", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/a5241a51-83d7-4859-acbd-d0b19d2e7c58/a5241a51-83d7-4859-acbd-d0b19d2e7c58_16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/images/header/arrow.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/wx-65_8x8.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/icons/close-menu.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/dist_rss/public/images/2018-06/screen_shot_2018-06-06_at_7.25.17_pm.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/weather-icons/wx-65_32x32.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/3c480f46-9b3b-4c26-b55b-c2c58dd46e8b/3c480f46-9b3b-4c26-b55b-c2c58dd46e8b_16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/logos/ktvb.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/e32576d6-84b1-4e73-8616-6182c9800b1b/e32576d6-84b1-4e73-8616-6182c9800b1b_16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/icons/twitter.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/3c480f46-9b3b-4c26-b55b-c2c58dd46e8b/3c480f46-9b3b-4c26-b55b-c2c58dd46e8b_1920x1080.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://media.ktvb.com/assets/KTVB/images/46e9f30d-ed97-4162-9919-c76775621f99/46e9f30d-ed97-4162-9919-c76775621f99_16x9.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/akam/13/pixel_4caef274?a=dD03MWViM2JiYzhjYmZiMzhjMDRmZTU3OTM5ZTZlY2NhN2U4MGQ2ZmZjJmpzPW9mZg==", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/icons/facebook.svg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/taylor-swift-is-a-fiery-retro-vixen-in-sugarlands-babe-video-trailer/603-a2a7a8bf-1970-4775-89d8-de2e218916ea", "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.ktvb.com/assets/shared-images/backgrounds/blank.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/dist_rss/public/images/2018-06/screen_shot_2018-06-06_at_7.25.17_pm.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914/https://www.etonline.com/taylor-swift-is-a-fiery-retro-vixen-in-sugarlands-babe-video-trailer-103705", "title": "Taylor Swift Is a Fiery Retro Vixen in Sugarland's 'Babe' Video Trailer", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#d81f32", "category": "entertainment", "og": {"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914/https://www.ktvb.com/article/entertainment/entertainment-tonight/taylor-swift-is-a-fiery-retro-vixen-in-sugarlands-babe-video-trailer/603-a2a7a8bf-1970-4775-89d8-de2e218916ea", "title": "Taylor Swift Is a Fiery Retro Vixen in Sugarland's 'Babe' Video Trailer", "description": "Taylor Swift Is a Fiery Retro Vixen in Sugarland's 'Babe' Video Trailer", "type": "article", "image": {"identifier": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/dist_rss/public/images/2018-06/screen_shot_2018-06-06_at_7.25.17_pm.png", "width": 1140, "height": 641}, "article": {"published_time": "8:30 PM MDT June 6, 2018"}, "site_name": "ktvb.com", "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "section": "ktvb,entertainment,entertainment-tonight"}, "twitter": {"title": "Taylor Swift Is a Fiery Retro Vixen in Sugarland's 'Babe' Video Trailer", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220831232914im_/https://www.etonline.com/sites/default/files/styles/dist_rss/public/images/2018-06/screen_shot_2018-06-06_at_7.25.17_pm.png", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "KTVB", "description": "Taylor Swift Is a Fiery Retro Vixen in Sugarland's 'Babe' Video Trailer", "domain": "www.ktvb.com/"}, "viewport": "width=1170", "site": "ktvb.com", "description": "Taylor Swift Is a Fiery Retro Vixen in Sugarland's 'Babe' Video Trailer", "fb": {"app_id": 192179838029342}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1528313400.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
