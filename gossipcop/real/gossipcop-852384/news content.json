He says it was a wild ride.\n\n\u201cI\u2019ve had shows cancelled before, and they don\u2019t get un-cancelled \u2026 that just doesn\u2019t happen,\u201d says Ryan, 52. \u201cTo have that happen twice, [\u2018Timeless\u2019] does begin to feel like the show that doesn\u2019t die.\u201d\n\n\u201cTimeless\u201d premiered on NBC in October 2016 and was axed after its freshman season with its audience hovering between 2 and 4 million viewers each week.\n\nThen, just three days later, NBC un-cancelled \u201cTimeless\u201d and ordered a second season. \u201cWe all know it\u2019s a competitive tough environment to get on the air and stay on the air,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cAnd the overall numbers were never big enough to make us feel safe. It was a little bit of shock when I first heard [it was un-cancelled] \u2014 like, \u2018Is this really happening? Is it a prank?\u2019 What a mean prank this would be!\u201d\n\nNot only was it not a prank, it happened again, when during its second season, NBC axed \u201cTimeless\u201d again. There was no third season, but the network did order the two-hour series finale airing Thursday night \u2014 which Ryan says is designed for both fans and newcomers alike.\n\n\u201cWe really did treat this like a two-hour event that you can enjoy whether you\u2019re a big fan of the show, a casual fan, or you\u2019ve never experienced it,\u201d he says. \u201cWe want people to not feel intimidated like, \u2018Oh there are 26 prior episodes I don\u2019t have time to watch in the next few days, this isn\u2019t for me.\u2019 \u201d\n\n\u2018It was the fans that really wouldn\u2019t let this show die, who protested and hired helicopters to fly banners.\u2019\n\n\u201cTimeless\u201d stars Abigal Spencer (\u201cSuits\u201d) and Matt Lanter (\u201c90210\u201d) as members of a group who use a time machine to travel to different eras to protect American history from a thief planning to rewrite that history.\n\n\u201cIt was the fans that really wouldn\u2019t let this show die, who protested and hired helicopters to fly banners,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cI think their voices are part of what made NBC decide to do the two-hour movie.\u201d\n\nRyan was thrilled the show was un-cancelled, he says, but it was also a big job to wrangle the cast and crew again \u2014 since many of them had moved on after the cancellation.\n\n\u201cIt was difficult in a lot of ways, but we were all so determined and feeling fortunate that we were given a second chance,\u201d he says. \u201cHere\u2019s the dirty little secret of Hollywood types. When your shows get cancelled, you\u2019re 95 percent devastated and 5 percent like, \u2018Thank God I don\u2019t have to do that work anymore!\u2019 This is easily the most difficult show I\u2019ve ever worked on.\u201d\n\nOf course, since it\u2019s already come back to life multiple times, is this two-hour finale really the end?\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s certainly the ending of the NBC version of the show, and we want to make sure we honor that and give a really satisfying conclusion,\u201d says Ryan. \u201cHaving said that, it\u2019s a world that could be explored in different ways down the line. Whether its \u2018Brooklyn Nine-Nine\u2019 ending at Fox but going to NBC, or \u2018Last Man Standing\u2019 ending at ABC and going to Fox, you\u2019re seeing that just because a show don\u2019t make sense at a particular outlet, that doesn\u2019t mean there\u2019s not a place for it.\n\n\u201cIt used to be extraordinarily rare for that to happen,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not normally something I\u2019d spend time thinking about, but when your show has been declared dead twice and then revived, well \u2026\u201d", "images": ["https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2020/10/apple-podcast-badge402x.png", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6&comscorekw=entertainment", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/NATHAN-FIELDER-METS.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/brandy-comp.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/TV-Timeless-1a.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/chloe-grace-moretz-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/pitbull-mauling-317.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/TV-Timeless-1a.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/12/TV-Timeless-1a.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Lauren Sarner", "Contact The Author"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2018/12/19/timeless-creator-credits-fans-with-resurrecting-it-twice/", "title": "\u2018Timeless\u2019 creator credits fans with resurrecting it \u2014 twice", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
