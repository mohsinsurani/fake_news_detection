They are already parents to daughter Sailor Grace.\n\n\u201cHer birth was a breeze, we had the best doctor/nurses imaginable, and Dakota did amazing!! He held my hand, took care \u2013 and encouraged me the entire time, I could not have a more supportive husband. This pregnancy has strengthen our bond and made our relationship stand even firmer on the foundation that we have proudly built up for our little family,\u201d she wrote.\n\nRELATED: Prince William visits with child patients as he helps out at Europe\u2019s largest cancer treatment center\n\nShe also shared more big news about their family adding that they have moved to Texas.\n\n\u201cWhen Dakota and I got married, we both agreed that we would \u201cmeet in the middle\u201d and move somewhere to dig our roots in a mutual, new, place. We decided on Texas, and I couldn\u2019t be happier! The kids love it too. The new house is just in time for Dakota and me to celebrate our wedding anniversary,\u201d she wrote.\n\n\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BUFTKo-hY_0/?taken-by=bsmp2\n\n\u201cAs you might imagine, welcoming our third baby has changed the whole dynamic of our family,\u201d Palin Meyer wrote. \u201cOur \u2018baby girl\u2019 (Sailor) is not a baby anymore!!!! I feel like it was just overnight \u2013 she went from our baby girl \u2013 to a toddler!!! It is so sad how fast life goes by, but so fun to see her growing up at the same time.\u201d\n\nPalin Meyer is also mom to son, Tripp, 8, whom she shares with ex Levi Johnson.\n\n\u201cI am so thankful for the babies God chose me to mother. It has been the best title I could\u2019ve ever been given,\u201d she finished.\n\n", "images": ["https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/gender-reveal-e1663594236141.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/02/RARE-32.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-35.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/avatar_user_33_1655400475-40x40.png", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/RARE-36.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/gettyimages-kylie-jenner.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/11/gettyimages-joe-simpson.jpg?w=150", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Loretta-Lynn-e1664721624312.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/06/wwii-vet.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-50.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/instagram_brisol-palin-family.jpg?w=662", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-KpNhwJ0RxTQPU.gif", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/tank-drift.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/rare-logo-white-highres.png", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-30-1.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-31.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/Haunted-School.png?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/ap_17136605141140.jpg?w=150", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/veteran_reunion.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=351158200285883&ev=PageView&noscript=1&eid=351158200285883&cd%5Btags%5D=bristol+palin%2C+celebrity+babies%2C+entertainment%2C+Motherhood%2C+Sarah+Palin&cd%5Bpost_category%5D=All+News%2C+Rare+People&cd%5Bpage_title%5D=Bristol+Palin+Meyer+shared+a+few+updates+on+her+life+as+a+wife+and+mom+of+three+in+a+new+post+to+fans&cd%5Bpost_type%5D=post&cd%5Bpost_id%5D=578787&cd%5Bplugin%5D=PixelYourSite&cd%5Bevent_url%5D=rare.us%2Fpeople%2Fbristol-palin-meyer-shared-a-few-updates-on-her-life-as-a-wife-and-mom-of-three-in-a-new-post-to-fans%2F&cd%5Buser_role%5D=guest", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/RARE-63.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-33.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1", "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/RARE-34.jpg?w=364&h=205&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/instagram_brisol-palin-family.jpg?w=662", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rare News Desk"], "canonical_link": "https://rare.us/people/bristol-palin-meyer-shared-a-few-updates-on-her-life-as-a-wife-and-mom-of-three-in-a-new-post-to-fans/", "title": "Bristol Palin Meyer shared a few updates on her life as a wife and mom of three in a new post to fans", "meta_data": {"robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "viewport": "initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0, height=device-height, width=device-width", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Bristol Palin Meyer shared a few updates on her life as a wife and mom of three in a new post to fans", "description": "\"I am so thankful for the babies God chose me to mother.\" More", "url": "https://rare.us/people/bristol-palin-meyer-shared-a-few-updates-on-her-life-as-a-wife-and-mom-of-three-in-a-new-post-to-fans/", "site_name": "Rare", "image": {"identifier": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/instagram_brisol-palin-family.jpg?w=662", "width": 1200, "height": 627, "type": "image/jpeg"}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/RareUSA", "published_time": "2017-05-17T11:33:48+00:00"}, "author": "Rare News Desk", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Rare News Desk", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "facebook-domain-verification": "8wfvb713aorpq5rhvte8xil2221k7i", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://rare.us/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-cropped-mock-siteicon.png?w=270"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1495020828.0, "source": "https://rare.us", "summary": ""}
