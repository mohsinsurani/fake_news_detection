Sometimes it\u2019s good to be proven wrong, because I do like to like things. What began as a deep-fried Twinkie of a guilty pleasure show grew in leaps and bounds over its 13 episodes, eventually settling into a chocolate bar of a guilty pleasure, to continue the metaphor. Perhaps fully suspending any sense of fidelity to the original comics allowed my opinion on the show to change. Perhaps it was the tangled plot lines and the lush visuals finally driving themselves into my brain.\n\nOr, perhaps, the show slowly developed a rhythm and charm all its own, for the most part successfully transporting some version of the classic characters into a Shakespearean tragedy crossed with a Gothic horror novel, infused with a massive dose of typical CW-soapiness. Brothers killing brothers out of greed, decades-old dynastic blood feuds, one quasi-incestuous secret romance, a town divided between the haves and the have-nots, and a fabulously ornate mansion literally called \u201cThornhill\u201d, where terrible truths trap its inhabitants as surely as the mansion\u2019s gates; there\u2019s something for nearly everyone with a taste for campy drama.\n\nIndeed, once I\u2019d accepted that this Riverdale wasn\u2019t the Riverdale I knew by any stretch of the imagination, it was all the more enjoyable to see the little bits and pieces of the comics did make it into what\u2019s basically high-budget mystery/alternate-universe fan fiction. Namely, the performances of KJ Apa (Archie Andrews), Camilla Mendes (Veronica Lodge), and Lili Reinhart (Betty Cooper) manage to elevate the material when it flags, thoughtfully maintaining a good bit of this classic trio even as their friendships and relationships diverge so wildly from the usual love triangle.\n\nOnce the unfortunate Miss Grundy (Sarah Habel) storyline was properly disposed of, Apa\u2019s iteration of Archie, while certainly sexier than ever before, also makes use of Archie\u2019s most important qualities as he became integrated further into the central murder narrative. Even as the plot thickens, twists, and veers in all directions, Apa maintains Archie\u2019s naivet\u00e9, his goodheartedness, his loyalty to his friends, and his tendency towards skirt-chasing, while actually making a case for him as a viable romantic lead (or at least, object of desire). Unfortunately, the show glosses over the emotional repercussions of him having been preyed upon by Miss Grundy; once Miss Grundy is gone, that plot thread goes out of nearly everyone\u2019s minds as they move on to bigger and better things.\n\nMendes, whom I praised in my original review, continues to shine as Veronica Lodge, the former Blair Waldorf-esque bully turned altruistic, generous friend and confidante. Smart, savvy, and impeccably dressed, Mendes\u2019 Veronica manages to feel like she\u2019d been friends with the Riverdale gang from the very beginning, even as so much of her screen time is consumed with her confronting the truth about her parents and why she and her mother had to leave New York in the first place. Reinhart\u2019s Betty takes on a sleuthing role that suits the character well as she, too, learns terrible truths about her family, truths that would devastate any family, regardless of how strong it is. The humble Coopers, it turns out, are secretly estranged cousins of the wealthy Blossoms, making Polly Cooper\u2019s relationship with the late Jason Blossom (resulting in her getting pregnant) fairly squicky. Reinhart portrays Betty\u2019s desire for knowledge and justice \u2014 for her mistreated sister, for Jason \u2014 as mingled with an unsettling undercurrent of vengeance.\n\nThe greatest surprise, though, is Madeleine Petsch\u2019s performance as Cheryl Blossom, Jason\u2019s twin and heir to the Blossom family empire. I never liked Cheryl Blossom in the original comics; she always seemed to show up to flirt with Archie when the Betty-Archie-Veronica triangle got boring, her dimwitted, often sexist, brother Jason in tow. In the comics, she\u2019s basically Veronica without Veronica\u2019s good qualities. Riverdale, however, transforms her into an occasionally tragic figure, despite her commitment to being the nasty queen bee of Riverdale High, and always compelling. By establishing her love for Jason as more than a little creepy, Petsch\u2019s Cheryl becomes a mystery unto herself.\n\nFurther, as more is revealed about her family\u2019s shady doings (and the Blossoms; terrible parenting habits), it becomes clear that Cheryl\u2019s a victim in more ways than one. As I watched the last few episodes, I wanted to scream at Cheryl to get out of that house (the aforementioned \u201cThornhill\u201d estate), because it sure seemed like she was at risk of getting murdered on some ornate staircase or balcony. Cheryl\u2019s arc in Riverdale season one basically goes where you\u2019d expect: in the season finale, she gives away several notable possessions, intending to drown herself in the town\u2019s river where Jason\u2019s body was dredged up. Thankfully for those of us looking forward to season two, she manages to stick around.\n\nThe weak link in the main cast is Cole Sprouse\u2019s Jughead Jones, though that\u2019s probably more the fault of the writing. The main problem is that in order to shift the tone of Riverdale into the appropriate minor key, nearly every character has become tonally darker and more troubled in some way. Unfortunately, Jughead gets turned from prank-loving glutton into a Holden Caulfield wannabe, if Holden Caulfield had decided to write a \u201cphony\u201d detective novel. His relationship with his father (Skeet Ulrich), a gang member from the wrong side of the tracks implicated in Jason\u2019s murder, creates genuine moments of pathos, and there are at times the potential for some keen commentary about class divides in Riverdale.\n\nUnfortunately, Sprouse\u2019s performance remains incredibly one-note: he\u2019s just sour and misanthropic. His relationship with Betty is unsatisfying and painful to watch, if only because it isn\u2019t clear what he brings to the table aside from siphoning her emotional labor and endless acceptance. There\u2019s also absolutely no chemistry there, and I hope that the \u201cBughead\u201d pairing is quickly scrapped in season two. If Riverdale had therapists, perhaps more could have been made of Jughead\u2019s feelings of abandonment and isolation. Right now, his problems feel more like they\u2019re added for quirky character reasons, and not because the show\u2019s interested in exploring these issues.\n\nIn order to make the murder investigation feel urgent, and for the town itself to feel like a sinister character, Riverdale has made the decision to turn nearly every spare character into a jerk. Chuck Clayton (Jordan Calloway) fares pretty badly in this regard. In the comics, he\u2019s actually one of the sweetest characters: a creative artist whose main flaw was spending too much time drawing and not enough time with his girlfriend. In Riverdale, he\u2019s reduced to a menacing misogynistic bully with no redeeming qualities. Dilton Doiley (Major Curda), the comics\u2019 resident nerdy genius, is here just an unpleasant hardcore survivalist who only shows up two or three times.\n\nThe worst reinterpretation, however, has to be that of the Cooper parents \u2014 Alice (M\u00e4dchen Amick) and Hal (Lochlyn Munroe) \u2014 who display basically no scruples, honesty, or kindness for the vast majority of their screen time. Sending away their pregnant daughter because the father was a member of the Blossom family (and then lying about it to Betty, refusing to let them get in contact) is pretty much irredeemable, although Amick chews the scenery in her every scene with relish and dedication, at least making her cartoonish villainy entertaining. Munroe\u2019s performance isn\u2019t quite on the same level, making Hal both impossibly cruel and rather boring.\n\nThe shunting aside of the Josie and the Pussycats is also a weak point of the show. The pilot set up so many different narrative threads that once the \u201cArchie wants to be a musician\u201d story lost its intensity (due to Miss Grundy leaving), the Pussycats were left adrift. They seem to be the only people in all of Riverdale completely removed from Jason\u2019s murder investigation, which meant that we didn\u2019t see them interacting with most of the other characters. Josie (Ashleigh Murray) appears here and there as the daughter of the calculating Mayor McCoy (Robin Givens), but aside from a mention of a friendship with Cheryl, she\u2019s really only there to play music with Archie and validate his efforts, even relegating the Pussycats to Archie\u2019s backup.\n\nValerie Brown (Hayley Law) at least has the benefit of briefly being in a mutually supportive relationship with Archie for a few episodes, but also fades into the backdrop once she breaks up with him for being a bad boyfriend. I don\u2019t actually remember any times that Melody Valentine (Asha Bromfield) has lines, so it\u2019s pretty evident that the show only touts Josie and the Pussycats to commend itself on being diverse, even as they don\u2019t add much to the central narrative or get any development.\n\nThe first season ends on a cliffhanger \u2014 yet another violent act has been committed by mysterious forces \u2014 and so season two will likely be devoted to finding out who shot Fred Andrews (Luke Perry) and why. Of course, there are snippets of ideas that season two will probably explore: the search for Betty and Polly\u2019s secret older brother (given up for adoption); Jughead becoming more involved with his father\u2019s gang; and Cheryl trying to rebuild her life after the destruction of her world. The Riverdale of Riverdale is basically Batman\u2019s Gotham: at this point, it seems like such an awful place to live that you\u2019d think people with the means to leave would have done so already. Yet when the show returns, I know I\u2019ll probably be there alongside the Riverdale gang as they fall in love and sip milkshakes at Pop Tate\u2019s.", "images": ["data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20720%20380'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/PCSS-BenAnderson-by-JB-720x380.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%202662%20397'%3E%3C/svg%3E", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/hip-hop-matters-september-2022-720x380.jpg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Janet-Jackson-The-Velvet-Rope-SP-720x380.jpg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/AFC93FCB-109D-438E-8023-0BECC8309AB5-720x380.jpeg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/02/myke-simon-atsUqIm3wxo-unsplash-720x380.jpg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/pauline-oliveros-anthology-text-scores-2013-featured-image-720x380.jpg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/lemmey-miller-bad-gays-2022-featured-image-720x380.jpg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/img-22460.jpg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/cropped-logo.png", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/Image-by-Comfreak-from-Pixabay--720x380.jpg", "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/img-22459.jpg", "data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%20650%20400'%3E%3C/svg%3E"], "top_img": "https://r7k2t3x9.rocketcdn.me/wp-content/uploads/2021/01/img-22459.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Deborah Krieger", "Peter Piatkowski", "Greg M.
