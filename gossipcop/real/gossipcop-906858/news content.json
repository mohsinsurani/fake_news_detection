Nominated for an Oscar for the first time, the veteran took the award ahead of Laurie Metcalf of Lady Bird, who was considered Janney\u2019s closest competition in the category.\n\nIn her acceptance speech, Janney joked \u201cI did it all myself!\u201d before going on to thank her collaborators on the film, as well as veteran actor Joanne Woodward, with whom she appeared in the 1993 TV movie Blind Spot.\n\nIn the blackly comic Tonya Harding biopic directed by Craig Gillespie, Janney plays the figure-skating prodigy\u2019s chain-smoking, domineering mother. Janney was previously best known for playing White House press secretary CJ Cregg in The West Wing.\n\nI, Tonya tells the story of Harding, the disgraced American figure skater who was banned from the sport after an investigation into her involvement in an attack on rival Olympian Nancy Kerrigan. At the Oscars, 58-year-old Janney added another trophy to her collection after sweeping the Golden Globes, Baftas, Critics\u2019 Choice, and Screen Actors Guild awards.\n\nAs well as Metcalf, Janney also beat out Lesley Manville (Phantom Thread), Octavia Spencer (The Shape of Water), and Mary J Blige (Mudbound).", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Allison+Janney%2COscars+2018%2CFilm%2CI%2C+Tonya%2CCulture%2COscars%2CBiopics%2CAwards+and+prizes%2CThe+West+Wing%2CDrama%2CTelevision%2CUS+television%2CTelevision+%26+radio%2CFigure+skating%2CSport+films", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b940fedbb229d2f7ea864caad634b7aa86ca81fd/300_0_2677_1606/master/2677.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b940fedbb229d2f7ea864caad634b7aa86ca81fd/300_0_2677_1606/master/2677.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=117f30512b5e6eb74abe2874c84a4904"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b940fedbb229d2f7ea864caad634b7aa86ca81fd/300_0_2677_1606/master/2677.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=117f30512b5e6eb74abe2874c84a4904", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jake Nevins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018", "title": "Allison Janney wins best supporting actress for I, Tonya at Oscars 2018", "meta_data": {"description": "Janney wins her first Academy award, against competition from Laurie Metcalf and Lesley Manville, for her dark turn as Tonya Harding\u2019s mother", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b940fedbb229d2f7ea864caad634b7aa86ca81fd/300_0_2677_1606/master/2677.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=117f30512b5e6eb74abe2874c84a4904", "height": 720}, "title": "Allison Janney wins best supporting actress for I, Tonya at Oscars 2018", "description": "Janney wins her first Academy award, against competition from Laurie Metcalf and Lesley Manville, for her dark turn as Tonya Harding\u2019s mother", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jake-nevins", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2019-09-20T14:55:14.000Z", "section": "Culture", "published_time": "2018-03-05T02:29:26.000Z", "tag": "Allison Janney,Oscars 2018,Film,I, Tonya,Culture,Oscars,Biopics,Awards and prizes,The West Wing,Drama,Television,US television,Television & radio,Figure skating,Sport films"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2018/mar/05/allison-janney-wins-best-supporting-actress-for-i-tonya-at-oscars-2018?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jhnevins", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/b940fedbb229d2f7ea864caad634b7aa86ca81fd/300_0_2677_1606/master/2677.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=56fbf75b44966f5621b5e3af2f274675", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1520208000.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
