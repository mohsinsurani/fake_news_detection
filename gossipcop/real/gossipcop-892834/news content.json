But the original interaction left her deeply dispirited, she said, and was one of the things that discouraged her from pursuing comedy.\n\nIn 2015, a few months before the now-defunct website Defamer circulated rumors of Louis C.K.\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct, Ms. Corry also received an email from Louis C.K., which was obtained by The Times, saying he owed her a \u201cvery very very late apology.\u201d When he phoned her, he said he was sorry for shoving her in a bathroom. Ms. Corry replied that he had never done that, but had instead asked to masturbate in front of her. Responding in a shaky voice, he acknowledged it and said, \u201cI used to misread people back then,\u201d she recalled.\n\nThe call confounded her, Ms. Corry said: not only had he misremembered the incident, which made her think there were other moments of misconduct, he also implied she had done something to invite his behavior. \u201cIt is unfair he\u2019s put me or anyone else in this position,\u201d Ms. Corry said.", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/arts/10comedyinquiry3/merlin_129128096_c37d7bde-6a49-425c-b4e1-4ab1ab157c6d-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/10comedy-alpha/10comedy-alpha-videoSixteenByNine3000-v2.jpg", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/10comedy-alpha2/10comedy-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a1f4b902c8cc0971d438a63cb8244954b66003bd0894095a7ad9fedad1a2b0ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2017/11/10/us/10comedy-alpha2/10comedy-alpha-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2017&h=550&w=1050&s=a1f4b902c8cc0971d438a63cb8244954b66003bd0894095a7ad9fedad1a2b0ce&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melena Ryzik", "Cara Buckley", "Jodi Kantor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2017/11/09/arts/television/louis-ck-sexual-misconduct.html", "title": "Louis C.K.
