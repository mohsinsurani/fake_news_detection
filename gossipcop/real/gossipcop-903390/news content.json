{"url": "https://nypost.com/2017/01/11/khloe-helped-me-lose-50-pounds-to-get-revenge-on-my-ex/", "text": "A year into his three-year relationship with his boyfriend Kyle, Will Ontiveros, 27, became what he calls \u201chappy fat\u201d \u2014 packing on pounds through a combination of nights out and vacations together, as well as a comfort level with his partner that left him feeling like he didn\u2019t have to watch his weight.\n\nThe TV and film producer added about 40 pounds onto his stocky, 5-foot-11 frame, but his boyfriend, who is 6-foot-5, didn\u2019t. When Kyle ended their relationship in December 2015, he cited Ontiveros\u2019 bigger figure as one of the reasons, saying he was no longer attracted to him.\n\n\u201cHe had mentioned the weight gain a year before he broke up with me, and I wasn\u2019t able to do anything about it or didn\u2019t have motivation,\u201d Ontiveros tells The Post. \u201c[The criticism] was sporadic . . . It would come up when we were frustrated with each other.\u201d\n\nOntiveros, who moved from New Mexico to LA to be with Kyle, decided to win back his ex by signing up for the new E! weight-loss reality TV show \u201cRevenge Body With Khlo\u00e9 Kardashian.\u201d In 12 weeks, he lost 30 pounds from a starting weight of 255 pounds.\n\nIn the eight-episode series, which premieres Thursday at 8 p.m., LA-based participants spend three months working out with a personal trainer to lose weight, motivated by a desire to prove themselves to someone in their life, such as an ex or a parent. Boldface trainers include Gunnar Peterson, Harley Pasternak, Simone De La Rue and others.\n\nAlong the way, participants receive encouragement and tough love from Khlo\u00e9, who has struggled with her weight since being dubbed the \u201cfat sister\u201d of the famous Kardashian clan.\n\nContestant Ranella Ferrer, a 5-foot-4 vocalist, turned to food to deal with a breakup and a mother who wasn\u2019t supportive of her music ambitions. The 28-year-old\u2019s 70-pound weight gain affected her career, as she began to bail on singing gigs because she was too ashamed to perform onstage at 207 pounds. Her mother became even more critical of her weight, career and lack of a boyfriend.\n\n\u201cI wanted to get revenge on my mom. And I wanted to make her proud, because I feel like out of every one of the [five] children, I was the one that was the outcast,\u201d she says. \u201cEveryone\u2019s a professional or college student . . . and here I am, a struggling artist who\u2019s overweight and single with no kids.\u201d\n\nTrainers worked with each participant on an individualized diet and exercise plan. Ferrer had to change her Thai food-heavy diet by limiting rice in meals, ordering more salads and drinking a gallon of water a day. Ontiveros started hitting the gym up to six times a week with Peterson, lifting weights and doing total-body resistance workouts, as well as an hour of cardio every night.\n\nDue to its title, \u201cRevenge Body\u201d has stirred up some pre-premiere controversy from health experts and viewers who worry it will promote quick-fix workouts and the body-shaming idea that you have to be thin and toned to be happy. Trainer Peterson says that while revenge can be an effective motivator, weight-loss success depends on much more than that, which the participants discover on the show.\n\n\u201cLike many of the flawed fitness programs out there, if revenge is what it takes you to get up and get going, I\u2019m all for it,\u201d says Peterson, who has trained Khlo\u00e9, along with her mom, Kris, and sister Kim. \u201cI would say \u2014 and I think this happened on Will\u2019s journey \u2014 he grew so much past that.\n\nWhen you\u2019re doing this for you, it\u2019s way more efficient. [Now] he goes home to visit his mom and he\u2019s going to the gym on his own every day. That\u2019s a big move for somebody who wasn\u2019t going [at all].\u201d\n\nIf revenge is what it takes you to get up and get going, I\u2019m all for it.\n\nThe show is also a culmination of Khlo\u00e9\u2019s own weight-loss journey, which began in 2013. The 32-year-old reality TV star has since lost 40 pounds, with some worrying she\u2019s gone too far. Peterson attributes Khlo\u00e9\u2019s success to her work ethic.\n\n\u201cWhen Khlo\u00e9 trains with me, she shows up early, she knocks out cardio, she stretches and she\u2019s ready to go when I finish whoever preceded her. That\u2019s not common, believe me,\u201d says Peterson.\n\nOntiveros has continued training with Peterson four to five times a week, and has now lost a total of 52 pounds. His revenge worked: Kyle reached out to Will in August and they briefly rekindled their romance, until Ontiveros thought better of the unhealthy reconciliation and ended it two weeks later.\n\nIn a particularly vengeful twist, he\u2019s now dating one of Kyle\u2019s ex-boyfriends.\n\n\u201cOf course it felt rewarding in the beginning. This is what I wanted and here it was, and how funny that what I got isn\u2019t actually what I wanted,\u201d he says. \u201cThat was my \u2018aha\u2019 moment. It wasn\u2019t even about revenge . . . It was a self-realization of, \u2018Wow, I don\u2019t need him.\u2019 \u201d", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6390601&cj=1&cv=3.6", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/170112-khloe-kardashian-helped-me-feature.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=744", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/mu-plugins/vip-helpers/images/vip-powered-dark-small.png?ver=20220317", "https://googleads.g.doubleclick.net/pagead/viewthroughconversion/988380111/?value=0&guid=ON&script=0", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/EP.-6-wp-thumb_NEW-1.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/170112-khloe-kardashian-helped-me-feature.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "https://pagesix.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2022/10/tom-brady-bundchen.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=213&crop=1", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/revenge_before1a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=240", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/09/chloe-grace-moretz-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/megyn-kelly-doug-brunt-brady-gisele-comp.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/pitbull-mauling-317.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=260", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/monopoly.png?w=260", "https://decider.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Ron-DeSantis-Ana-Navarro.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=322&h=215&crop=1", "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2022/10/wwe-sara-lee.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&1665186647&w=260", "https://vip.nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/revenge_khloe1a.jpg?quality=90&strip=all&w=231"], "top_img": "https://nypost.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/01/170112-khloe-kardashian-helped-me-feature.jpg?quality=75&strip=all&w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Social Links For Andrea Morabito"], "canonical_link": "https://nypost.com/2017/01/11/khloe-helped-me-lose-50-pounds-to-get-revenge-on-my-ex/", "title": "Khlo\u00e9 helped me lose 50 pounds to get revenge on my ex", "meta_data": {"copyright": "Copyright 2022 NYP Holdings.
