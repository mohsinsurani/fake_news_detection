{"url": "https://people.com/music/nick-carter-rape-accuser-melissa-schuman-files-police-report/", "text": "Melissa Schuman, the former teen pop singer who accused Nick Carter of rape, has filed a police report.\n\nThe Santa Monica Police Department confirms to PEOPLE that a complaint against Carter about an early 2003 incident was filed on Wednesday. An investigation is being conducted.\n\nThough authorities could not disclose the name of the individual who submitted the report, Schuman shared a tweet that same day that read: \u201cI\u2019m finally doing what I thought I could no longer do. I\u2019m filing a police report #timesup #bebrave #bethechange #metoo thank you @RAINN [the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network] for empowering me to take this step.\u201d\n\nA rep for Carter did not immediately respond to PEOPLE\u2019s request for comment.\n\nIn November, Schuman, now 33, detailed the alleged incident on her personal blog, claiming that Carter had raped her in the early 2000s when she was 18 and he was 22.\n\nAlberto E. Rodriguez/Getty; Matthew Simmons/Getty\n\nCarter, now 38, responded to the allegations in November with an exclusive statement to PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cI am shocked and saddened by Ms. Schuman\u2019s accusations. Melissa never expressed to me while we were together or at any time since that anything we did was not consensual. We went on to record a song and perform together, and I was always respectful and supportive of Melissa both personally and professionally,\u201d the Backstreet Boys band member said.\n\n\u201cThis is the first that I am hearing about these accusations, nearly two decades later. It is contrary to my nature and everything I hold dear to intentionally cause someone discomfort or harm.\u201d\n\nThat same month, Schuman told PEOPLE in a statement that she felt she needed to come forward with her story.\n\n\u201cI was empowered to share my story because of the brave women who shared their stories before me,\u201d she said. \u201cMy hope is that my experience further highlights the urgent need for open dialogue and education about consent and sexual assault. To those who have shared their stories with me, I see you. I believe you. I stand with you.\u201d\n\nREALTED VIDEO: Nick Carter Accused of Rape by Former Pop Singer Melissa Schuman; Backstreet Boy \u2018Shocked and Saddened\u2019 by Allegations\n\nIn her blog post, Schuman alleged that Carter had invited her over to his house and took her into the bathroom where they started kissing. It was then, she wrote, that Carter allegedly began to unbutton her pants and ignored her objections before allegedly performing oral sex on her. Schuman claimed he then demanded she perform oral sex on him.\n\nDespite allegedly telling Carter that she was a virgin and waiting until marriage to have sex, Carter allegedly led her to his bedroom where she claims that he raped her.\n\nDuring an appearance on Dr. Oz, that aired Dec. 1, Schuman revealed why she didn\u2019t move forward with pressing charges 15 years ago after the alleged incident first occurred.\n\n\u201cI\u2019d actually confided in my manager at that time about pressing charges. And I was told that [Carter] had the most powerful litigator in the country and that I didn\u2019t have the money to pay for an attorney to essentially defend me, if he were to come after me,\u201d she said.\n\n\u201cMy manager told me, \u2018You know you\u2019re trying to build a name for yourself right now, everyone\u2019s going to call you fame hungry, that you\u2019re trying to use this to better yourself or get your name out there and at this point there\u2019s nothing we can do,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cI remember telling him, \u2018Oh, so that\u2019s it\u2026 he just gets away with it?!\u2019\u201d", "images":
