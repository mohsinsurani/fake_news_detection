That film is The Spy Who Dumped Me (a play on the classic James Bond title The Spy Who Loved Me), which stars Kunish and McKinnon as a pair of LA gals who wind up in a spy caper, and Lionsgate has debuted the first trailer for the action comedy.\n\nThe Spy Who Dumped Me follows Audrey (Kunis) and Morgan (McKinnon), two best friends from L.A. who get tangled up in a high-stakes web of espionage and international conspiracy when Audrey\u2019s ex-boyfriend turns up at their place with a team of deadly assassins on his trail. From there, the fish-out-of-water duo has to swing into action, winding up on the run in Europe on a mission to save the world.\n\nDirected and co-written by Susanna Fogel, The Spy Who Dumped Me has a supporting cast to match its fantastic leads, co-starring Justin Theroux, Sam Heughan, Hasan Minhaj, and Gillian Anderson. The film arrives in theaters on August 3, 2018. Watch the first trailer below.\n\nHere\u2019s the official synopsis for The Spy Who Dumped Me:", "images":
