Two Virginia state troopers who were monitoring the protests were also killed in a helicopter crash.\n\nIn a joint statement issued Monday via the SPLC, the couple said they were \u201cproud\u201d to support the organization \u201cin its efforts to prevent violent extremism in the United States.\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat happened in Charlottesville, and what is happening in communities across our country, demands our collective engagement to stand up to hate,\u201d they said.\n\nIn the aftermath of the event, President Donald Trump was criticized for his unwillingness to condemn white supremacists and Neo-Nazis in a press conference given days after the unrest.\n\n\u201cI think there is blame on both sides,\u201d Trump said during a news conference August 15.\n\nGeorge Clooney appeared to reference the President\u2019s comment in an additional statement, provided to CNN by a representative.\n\n\u201cAmal and I wanted to add our voice (and financial assistance) to the ongoing fight for equality. There are no two sides to bigotry and hate,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Clooney Foundation for Justice was formed in 2016 to \u201cadvance justice in courtrooms, classrooms and communities around the world,\u201d according to a mission statement on its website.\n\nGeorge and Amal Clooney, who recently welcomed twins, serve as the foundation\u2019s presidents.\n\n\u201cLike George and Amal Clooney, we were shocked by the size, ugliness, and ferocity of the white supremacist gathering in Charlottesville,\u201d said SPLC President Richard Cohen in a statement. \u201cIt was a reflection of just how much Trump\u2019s incendiary campaign and presidency has energized the radical right. We are deeply grateful to the Clooney Foundation for standing with us at this critical moment in our country\u2019s fight against hate.\u201d\n\nThe SPLC said it tracks more than 1,600 extremist groups operating in the U.S.\n\nFurther details about the joint initiative are expected to be announced at a later date, the organization said.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170221151242-george-amal-clooney.jpg?q=x_217,y_181,h_1381,w_2455,c_crop/h_270,w_480", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170619101431-sandra-gonzalez.jpg?c=16x9&q=h_270,w_480,c_fill/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170221151242-george-amal-clooney.jpg?q=x_217,y_181,h_1381,w_2455,c_crop/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170221151242-george-amal-clooney.jpg?q=x_217,y_181,h_1381,w_2455,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sandra Gonzalez"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/22/entertainment/george-clooney-donation-combat-hate-groups/index.html", "title": "Clooneys make $1 million donation to fight hate groups", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Clooneys make $1 million donation to fight hate groups | CNN", "description": "George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170221151242-george-amal-clooney.jpg?q=x_217,y_181,h_1381,w_2455,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/08/22/entertainment/george-clooney-donation-combat-hate-groups/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Clooneys make $1 million donation to fight hate groups | CNN", "description": "George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170221151242-george-amal-clooney.jpg?q=x_217,y_181,h_1381,w_2455,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "George and Amal Clooney have joined the fight against hate groups in the United States.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2017-08-22T20:56:51Z", "modified_time": "2017-08-22T21:54:22Z", "tag": "2017 charlottesville white nationalist rally, amal clooney, celebrities, charities and charitable giving, charlottesville, civil unrest, discrimination, donald trump, george clooney, north america, political figures - us, protests and demonstrations, racism and racial discrimination, right-wing extremism, societal issues, society, southeastern united states, southern poverty law center, united states, unrest, conflicts and war, virginia, white supremacy and neo-nazism", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "2017 charlottesville white nationalist rally, amal clooney, celebrities, charities and charitable giving, charlottesville, civil unrest, discrimination, donald trump, george clooney, north america, political figures - us, protests and demonstrations, racism and racial discrimination, right-wing extremism, societal issues, society, southeastern united states, southern poverty law center, united states, unrest, conflicts and war, virginia, white supremacy and neo-nazism", "author": "Sandra Gonzalez", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1503356400.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
