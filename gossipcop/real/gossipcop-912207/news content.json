There won\u2019t be a day when I\u2019m like, 'Here I am in a pretty dress\u2014I won!' I think it\u2019s a battle I\u2019m gonna have to face for the rest of my life, and I\u2019m OK with that because I know that I\u2019m choosing myself over anything else.\" I'm starting my year off with that thought. I want to make sure I'm healthy. If that's good, everything else will fall into place.\"\n\nThe former Disney star realizing, and accepting, that there most likely isn't a beautiful, nicely wrapped final destination when it comes to mental-health battles is a positive mindset to have and shows her fighting the long fight when it comes to her wellness. As long as she's working towards being healthier, which it clearly seems she is, she's winning. Some people battle illness all their life and that does not bar mental health.", "images": ["https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/twitter.1650102.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=34756675&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/SXswBJ9A-720.jpg", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/instagram.c50a4f4.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/logo.8fcb0e1.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/youtube.4e8a45f.png", "https://ds.reson8.com/insights.gif?rand=[cache_buster]&evkey=101137925", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/facebook.a3f142a.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/SXswBJ9A-720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fuse.tv/2018/02/selena-gomez-interview-anxiety-depression-lifelong-struggle-harpers-bazaar", "title": "Selena Gomez Accepting Anxiety & Depression as Lifelong Struggles Is a Comforting Insight", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Fuse,", "fb": {"pages": 10262075277, "app_id": 1272603569472546}, "theme-color": "#FF5C1E", "og": {"site_name": "Fuse", "url": "/2018/02/selena-gomez-interview-anxiety-depression-lifelong-struggle-harpers-bazaar", "title": "Selena Gomez Accepting Anxiety & Depression as Lifelong Struggles Is a Comforting Insight", "description": "Selena Gomez tells 'Harper's Bazaar' that her battle with anxiety and depression is \"not something I feel I\u2019ll ever overcome\" in an interview that gives practical, comforting advice to those struggling with mental health.", "type": "video.other", "image": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/SXswBJ9A-720.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@fusetv", "description": "Selena Gomez tells 'Harper's Bazaar' that her battle with anxiety and depression is \"not something I feel I\u2019ll ever overcome\" in an interview that gives practical, comforting advice to those struggling with mental health."}, "twitter.title": "Fuse TV - Selena Gomez Accepting Anxiety & Depression as Lifelong Struggles Is a Comforting Insight", "description": "Selena Gomez tells 'Harper's Bazaar' that her battle with anxiety and depression is \"not something I feel I\u2019ll ever overcome\" in an interview that gives practical, comforting advice to those struggling with mental health."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.fuse.tv", "summary": ""}
