{"url": "https://people.com/crime/chris-soules-911-call/", "text": "Chris Soules called police before allegedly leaving the scene of a fatal car crash Monday night, newly released audio reveals.\n\nThe recording obtained by PEOPLE was apparently lodged to local police before 911 first responders were called in. Soules is breathing heavily, apparently emotional and seemingly on the edge of tears as he tells the dispatcher what happened in the collision between his truck and the tractor of fellow Iowan Kenneth E. Mosher that would ultimately take Mosher\u2019s life.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s no address,\u201d Soules, 35, tells the operator at the start of the recording. He reveals the tractor has plunged into ditch and Mosher was thrown into the ditch. At the time of the call, Soules reveals Mosher, 66, was not conscious and didn\u2019t appear to be breathing.\n\nOn the call, which was first released by TMZ, Soules asks another, unidentified person at the scene to perform CPR on Mosher since he doesn\u2019t know how, and they check Mosher\u2019s pulse before hanging up on the operator and saying they\u2019ll call back.\n\nThe Buchanan County Sheriff\u2019s Office confirmed to PEOPLE on Tuesday that Soules was arrested at 1:16 a.m. on Tuesday and charged with leaving the scene of a fatal car accident. The former star of The Bachelor made his first court appearance hours later. At the hearing, Iowa State Patrol claimed Soules left the scene after rear-ending his pickup truck into a tractor near Aurora, Iowa, at around 8 p.m. on Monday. (The area is reportedly about 15 miles south of Soules\u2019 farm in Arlington.)\n\nWATCH: Victim\u2019s Relative Defends Former Bachelor Chris Soules After Deadly Car Crash: \u2018It Was a Freak Accident\u2019\n\nThey also allege that Soules and his vehicle were later found at a house that Soules allegedly refused to leave until officers obtained a search warrant several hours later.\n\nRobert Roepke, whose daughter is married to the victim\u2019s son, exclusively told PEOPLE on Tuesday that the collision was a \u201cvery tragic, sad accident that took the life of a guy that was just coming home from work.\u201d\n\nSoules\u2019 lawyers have not yet commented on the charges against their client, but a rep for the reality star told PEOPLE yesterday that Soules \u201cwas devastated to learn that Kenneth Mosher, the other person in the accident, passed away. His thoughts and prayers are with Mr. Mosher\u2019s family.\u201d", "images": ["https://people.com/thmb/7dFD5Y9WqbC2ixNGPbye-LMjqeE=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/chris-soules-b0bd6c68687149ff8aaf39228618f3e1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Lje7sGaj3HgeS-yLg9z5JSNPfrU=/300x150/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/people_magazine_sub-e6689738996d40f38f154099e1751481.png", "https://people.com/thmb/NwpdWDfqHmPBOcNG6fBqIoITe8o=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(428x0:430x2)/chris_soules_858-1-bde3841969fa4a3db6b838c4ac100283.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/3zF-QEeb-h5k4yKhfccNHiA3mYg=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(622x734:624x736)/dale-spidle-9d520e4670934efcb55801963972c82f.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/jUOg1m0zngerFuqSwt8wvljpGoc=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(868x0:870x2)/kenny-mosher-2000-15816187713344b1b09f06da533f1c2d.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/Taw3zZq5vpuu5IV8QrrurTEVQSw=/75x75/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/blue-200ca6f36f3c4069a2930144e39a5035.jpeg", "https://people.com/thmb/x6WmgkwKvzBnOHjluzZvz1uJOsQ=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(624x0:626x2)/val-chris-1-976af55543054f508f87670c1c57572b.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/vzVrFNDPDwxcvTvWlgFQvGSNAR4=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(689x0:691x2)/chris-soules-main-ee34b3b411ed4aa8b1a642af1a634828.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/MiDe9WKYEbxI1-1ihXK0PcNYIpw=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(999x0:1001x2)/andi-dorfman-1-85450b1e957d48b6b26df6f5ca602a75.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/rb2rj0G0dcJ_TAZA5IbYF8i1j38=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(539x357:541x359)/Dangerous-Street-Corner-5c76b06e4750473d849a0eb8bc99718e.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/_hGQvWxuMTZDu6vuSmMMYaEjg4E=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/chris-soules-b0bd6c68687149ff8aaf39228618f3e1.jpg", "https://people.com/thmb/mIsF4Y9OO_TXqKZabwyayN2juHI=/282x188/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc():focal(749x0:751x2)/chris-soules-113ec11b9f6344588f68d28c37f05f81.jpg"], "top_img": "https://people.com/thmb/_hGQvWxuMTZDu6vuSmMMYaEjg4E=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/chris-soules-b0bd6c68687149ff8aaf39228618f3e1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lanford Beard", "People Editorial Guidelines"], "canonical_link": "https://people.com/crime/chris-soules-911-call/", "title": "Chris Soules Car Crash: 911 Call Released", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large, NOODP, NOYDIR", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Bachelor star Chris Soules was arrested early Tuesday morning after allegedly leaving the scene of a fatal crash", "emailcontenttype": "STRUCTUREDCONTENT", "emailvertical": "PEOPLE", "sailthru.author": "Lanford Beard", "article": {"section": "People", "opinion": "false", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/peoplemag"}, "fb": {"app_id": 610948219662029, "pages": 95926963131}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Peoplemag", "url": "https://people.com/crime/chris-soules-911-call/", "title": "Chris Soules Car Crash: 911 Call Released", "description": "Bachelor star Chris Soules was arrested early Tuesday morning after allegedly leaving the scene of a fatal crash", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/_hGQvWxuMTZDu6vuSmMMYaEjg4E=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/chris-soules-b0bd6c68687149ff8aaf39228618f3e1.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@people", "title": "Chris Soules Car Crash: 911 Call Released", "description": "Bachelor star Chris Soules was arrested early Tuesday morning after allegedly leaving the scene of a fatal crash", "image": "https://people.com/thmb/_hGQvWxuMTZDu6vuSmMMYaEjg4E=/2000x1333/filters:fill(auto,1)/chris-soules-b0bd6c68687149ff8aaf39228618f3e1.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#F4F4F4", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-70x70.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-150x150.png", "msapplication-square310x310logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x310.png", "msapplication-wide310x150logo": "/static/1.19.0/icons/favicons/mstile-310x150.png"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://people.com", "summary": ""}
