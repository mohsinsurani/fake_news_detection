The song \u2014 subtitled \u201cWhere Do You Think You\u2019re Goin\u2019?\u201d \u2014 is more somber than the original, pairing Gaga\u2019s soaring vocals with just a piano. In the accompanying video, we follow Gaga as she strolls through a garden, shoots pool, and howls the emotional lyrics at the sky. It ends with her running into the woods, singing, \u201cXOXO, Joanne.\u201d\n\nIf you watched the singer's Netflix documentary, Gaga: Five Foot Two, you probably remember the scene in which she plays a version of the song for her grandmother, telling her that they can stop listening if it\u2019s too sad. Her grandmother assures her it\u2019s beautiful, and she\u2019s absolutely right.", "images": ["https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c93bd911-dfb7-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:79ad7f25-c2ed-4cf9-a1ba-6e57be5286f5?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c45b759e-5caf-44a0-a5f1-07d21156312b?quality=0.7", "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:af26ecc9-8660-466d-954d-47a5d29bbd2d?quality=0.7"], "top_img": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c93bd911-dfb7-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.mtv.com/news/5uvrku/lady-gaga-joanne-video", "title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s New Version Of \u2018Joanne\u2019 Is Even More Emotional Than The Original", "meta_data": {"app_version": "d8d613330-2688-2022-10-07", "robots": "noydir,noodp", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=1, maximum-scale=2", "theme-color": "#87b6c0", "msapplication-config": "/browserconfig.xml", "description": "Lady Gaga's new video for \"Joanne\" is a radiant ode to her late aunt.", "original-source": "https://www.mtv.com/news/5uvrku/lady-gaga-joanne-video", "search": {"title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s New Version Of \u2018Joanne\u2019 Is Even More Emotional Than The Original", "description": "She takes to the woods in the song's radiant video", "imageUrl": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c93bd911-dfb7-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7", "imageHeight": 784, "imageWidth": 1440, "url": "/news/5uvrku/lady-gaga-joanne-video", "contentType": "Article", "bucketName": "Article", "labelName": "News", "contentDate": "2018-01-26T19:17:31.000Z"}, "news_keywords": "Pop Music", "og": {"site_name": "MTV", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c93bd911-dfb7-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7&width=1440", "description": "She takes to the woods in the song's radiant video", "title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s New Version Of \u2018Joanne\u2019 Is Even More Emotional Than The Original", "url": "https://www.mtv.com/news/5uvrku/lady-gaga-joanne-video", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "description": "She takes to the woods in the song's radiant video", "title": "Lady Gaga\u2019s New Version Of \u2018Joanne\u2019 Is Even More Emotional Than The Original", "image": "https://images.paramount.tech/uri/mgid:arc:imageassetref:mtv.com:c93bd911-dfb7-11ec-a53e-164563049251?quality=0.7"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://www.mtv.com", "summary": ""}
