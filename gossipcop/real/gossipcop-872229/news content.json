However, she didn't get to keep it. What viewers didn't know is how much her dress weighed or how much her engagement ring cost.\n\n30-pound dress\n\nViewers probably heard Rachel exclaim that the dress was heavy when Bryan Abasolo picked her up after he proposed to her. He quickly put her down before they made their way downhill from the castle. Rachel did not exaggerate. The designer admitted the dress did weigh 30 pounds because of the beads.\n\nThe gown Rachel wore appears in Randi Rahm's Spring 2018 Bridal Collection, according to Glamour. When Rahm sent dresses to Rachel for the season, this one was reserved for the finale. The silver beaded maxi-length dress showed a left thigh-high slit. The one-of-a-kind couture dress had a high neckline and a short train.\n\nLindsay favors designs by Randi Rahm, and she wore them on seven other occasions throughout the season. Rahm even made the star's premiere outfit that she wore on the first night when she met all the suitors. That particular white gown was custom made for the \"Bachelorette\" star, but she didn't get to keep that one either. The bright white beads that were hand sewn onto the nude overlay and the Swarovski crystals made the dress weigh about 30 pounds.\n\nIn the finale, Rachel kept her jewelry simple so her dress could be in the spotlight. The only jewelry she wore was a small pair of dangling earrings until an engagement ring was put on her finger.\n\nRachel's stylist, Cary Fetman, gave her the perfect look for her proposal that took place on a windy day on top of the hill at a castle in Rioja, Spain.\n\nEven though Rachel's premiere and proposal dresses were heavy, she could still move around quite comfortably in both of them.\n\n3-carat ring\n\nRachel didn't get to keep the elegant dress, but she did get to keep the diamond ring that cost $100,000.\n\nViewers saw jewelry designer Neil Lane show seven diamond rings to Bryan. The very last one that the jeweler finished designing is the one Bryan chose. In fact, his eyes lit up when he spotted the engagement ring with the large 3-carat pear-shaped diamond surrounded by 80 smaller diamonds.\n\nRachel had told Bryan she wanted a pear-shaped ring. The halo of smaller diamonds around the central diamond was Bryan's idea. Rachel loves the finished product, and she shows it off every chance she gets.\n\nEven though Rachel had to return her outfits, she did get to keep the ring and Bryan, her fianc\u00e9.", "images": ["https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/9/660x290/b_502x220x75/bryan-abasolo-proposed-to-rachel-lindsay-with-a-100000-ring-youtube-timesyoutube-screenshot_1499481.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/9/660x290/b_1200x630x75/bryan-abasolo-proposed-to-rachel-lindsay-with-a-100000-ring-youtube-timesyoutube-screenshot_1499481.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/3/328/profile_3328963_1506015307.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/1/4/profile_1004641_1506831217.jpg"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/9/660x290/b_1200x630x75/bryan-abasolo-proposed-to-rachel-lindsay-with-a-100000-ring-youtube-timesyoutube-screenshot_1499481.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Margaret Minnicks", "Joe Jackson", "Patriarch Of The Musical Jackson Family", "Dies At Of Pancreatic Cancer", "'Roseanne' Spinoff To Premiere On Abc Next Fall As 'The Conners' Without Roseanne", "'Big Brother' Returns To Cbs In June For Season", "With A Remodeled House"], "canonical_link": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/08/rachel-lindsays-dress-weighed-30-pounds-and-her-engagement-ring-cost-100000-001919427.html", "title": "Rachel Lindsay's dress weighed 30 pounds and her engagement ring cost $100,000", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, user-scalable=0", "description": "The 3-carat pear-shaped engagement ring Bryan Abasolo proposed to Rachel Lindsay with is one-of-a-kind.", "news_keywords": "Celebrities, rachel lindsay, Bryan Abasolo", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956, "pages": 556225464427184}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Blasting News", "url": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2017/08/rachel-lindsays-dress-weighed-30-pounds-and-her-engagement-ring-cost-100000-001919427.html", "locale": "en_US", "title": "Rachel Lindsay's dress weighed 30 pounds and her engagement ring cost $100,000", "image": {"identifier": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/9/660x290/b_1200x630x75/bryan-abasolo-proposed-to-rachel-lindsay-with-a-100000-ring-youtube-timesyoutube-screenshot_1499481.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "Bryan Abasolo proposed to Rachel Lindsay with a $100,000 ring [Youtube Times/YouTube screenshot]"}, "description": "The 3-carat pear-shaped engagement ring Bryan Abasolo proposed to Rachel Lindsay with is one-of-a-kind.", "determiner": "auto", "rich_attachment": "true"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/BlastingNews/", "section": "Showbiz & Tv", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/margaretminnicks", "published_time": "2017-08-09T15:15:37-04:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Rachel Lindsay's dress weighed 30 pounds and her engagement ring cost $100,000", "image": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2017/8/9/660x290/b_1200x630x75/bryan-abasolo-proposed-to-rachel-lindsay-with-a-100000-ring-youtube-timesyoutube-screenshot_1499481.jpg", "description": "The 3-carat pear-shaped engagement ring Bryan Abasolo proposed to Rachel Lindsay with is one-of-a-kind....", "url": "https://goo.gl/QRYCFB", "site": "@BlastingNews", "creator": "@BlastingNews"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1502306137.0, "source": "https://us.blastingnews.com", "summary": ""}
