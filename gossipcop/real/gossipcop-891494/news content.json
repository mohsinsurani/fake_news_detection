The reality star filed for divorce from the Frasier actor in July 2010. Their divorce was finalized in February 2011, and the 62-year-old actor married Kayte Walsh two weeks later.\n\nCamille and Kelsey share two children together: daughter Mason Olivia, 16, and son Jude Gordon, 13. The actor has five other children from previous relationships.\n\nPEOPLE confirmed this week that Camille is engaged to lawyer David C. Meyer. The pair have dated for more than a year and met in Malibu, where Meyer lives.\n\n\u201cThey\u2019re just in love,\u201d a source close to the couple tells PEOPLE. \u201cThere\u2019s a casualness and easiness to their relationship. They\u2019re a really happy, kind couple. He really loves her for her.\u201d\n\nFormer model Grammer, 48, starred on RHOBH for two seasons and has since appeared as a guest.\n\nShe teased the happy news Sunday on Twitter, sharing a photo snuggled up to Meyer with the caption, \u201cParty night with my love. We have a secret.. guess.\u201d", "images":
