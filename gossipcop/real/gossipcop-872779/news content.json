Hairstylists and colorist all around the world had their salons stocked up with ultra-long extensions and shelves piled high with purple toner to get that blonde shade just right.\n\nBut in 2018, the trends and hairstyles have changed quite a bit \u2014 just ask Pinterest, which has the tea on the top global beauty hair trends of the year. Some of these may come as a shock, while others are super obvious (just scroll through your Instagram to see the same tight-to-the-scalp Dutch braids or cornrows on all your favorite influencers). This week, Pinterest unveiled its 2018 Global Beauty Report, revealing what people all over the world are searching for (and pinning) in the realm of beauty.\n\nWithout further ado, here are the most pinned hairstyles from around the world.\n\nU.S.A.\n\nYou can thank the States' festival season and the fashion world's recent obsession with athleisure for their most coveted (and pinned) hairstyle \u2014 braids. The search for braids in the U.S. was up 445 percent, per Pinterest's data. Braids are extremely versatile, so it's no wonder they came in first place; they can be worn relaxed and wispy or tight and crisp; and they work with any hair length, style, or texture. Still, it is important to note, that for certain segments of the American population, particularly those of African descent, braids are a staple and a cultural tradition, whether or not it's Coachella time.\n\nPinterest content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nGermany\n\nShort hair, don\u2019t care. According to Pinterest, German women are keeping it cropped and ultra chic. Pixie cuts, up 266 percent, have truly taken off in Deutschland. This style works for any hair type \u2014 whether thick or fine, straight, or coiled. \u201cIt\u2019s all in the cutting technique. The right cut will give structure and volume to fine hair and looseness and movement to thick hair, while the point-cutting technique offers enough space to see the texture [of curlier strands],\u201d says hairstylist Nick Arrojo.", "images": ["https://media.allure.com/photos/633d9dc13a56bbe75a4ba3d2/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo.29c935e080443f04891df3392d24b63c95f6474a.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c41b42bebdf1fd177c06e/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/631913447babfd3e0f993ce3/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/6335ae3534fbac242ca9e777/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/633c4a0360c6adbac3e921a3/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/62c5a4473c01251305d24844/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b817ed560b242358149da74/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/braided%20styles.jpg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/631fda5963622c442a148cf9/1:1/w_705%2Ch_705%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5c36526380dc5d2caf4c5af8/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Madisen_Tart_Lip_Paint_OG.JPG", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b805821934dc30def26a6d6/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/2018-08-newsroom-global-beauty-02.jpg", "https://www.allure.com/verso/static/allure/assets/logo-reverse.7c3ec9af78d5f39e36d039cb1f9fef504150550e.svg", "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b817f46d99ebe7e700e14db/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/most%2520popular%2520pinterest%2520hairstyles%25202018.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b817ed560b242358149da74/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/braided%20styles.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Madisen Theobald"], "canonical_link": "https://www.allure.com/story/top-global-hair-trends-pinterest-2018", "title": "The Top Global Hair Trends In 2018, According to Pinterest", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The top hairstyle search on Pinterest varies from country to country, but buns are undeniably popular around the world.", "id": "5b7f13f8d99ebe7e700e14a3", "keywords": "pinterest beauty,pinterest,global beauty,hair trends,hair,short hair,bangs,curtain bangs,pixie cut,bun,messy bun,braid", "news_keywords": "pinterest beauty,pinterest,global beauty,hair trends,hair,short hair,bangs,curtain bangs,pixie cut,bun,messy bun,braid", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5b7f13f8d99ebe7e700e14a3", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The top hairstyle search on Pinterest varies from country to country, but buns are undeniably popular around the world.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5b817f46d99ebe7e700e14db/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/most%20popular%20pinterest%20hairstyles%202018.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.allure.com/photos/5b817f46d99ebe7e700e14db/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/most%20popular%20pinterest%20hairstyles%202018.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Throughout the rest of the world, not so much.", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b817ed560b242358149da74/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/braided%20styles.jpg", "site_name": "Allure", "title": "Braids Are Top Pinned Hairstyle in the U.S., Says Pinterest", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.allure.com/story/top-global-hair-trends-pinterest-2018"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-08-25T16:16:50.895Z", "modified_time": "2018-08-25T16:16:50.895Z", "author": "Madisen Theobald"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@Allure_magazine", "description": "Throughout the rest of the world, not so much.", "domain": "https://www.allure.com", "image": "https://media.allure.com/photos/5b817ed560b242358149da74/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/braided%20styles.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@Allure_magazine", "title": "Braids Are Top Pinned Hairstyle in the U.S., Says Pinterest"}, "fb": {"app_id": 100614276777478, "pages": 24810773606}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1535213810.895, "source": "https://www.allure.com", "summary": ""}
