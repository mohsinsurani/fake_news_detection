(Netflix)\n\nNot too many moons ago, a television story like this would have required smelling salts to revive all the showbiz industry reporters who had passed out from the news:\n\nA creator/performer of Tina Fey\u2019s talent and buzzworthiness announces that she\u2019s moving her finished, warmly anticipated midseason NBC comedy series to a different network, one that viewers can access only through a subscription fee and broadband connection. On top of that, NBC, with which Fey has been happily allied her entire career, has agreed to (and apparently helped arrange) this sudden departure.\n\nHardly anyone blinked.\n\nYou already know why, because you\u2019ve read countless headlines and stories about how television as we once knew it is so completely over.\n\nThat\u2019s precisely what fascinates me about \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt,\u201d the entire first season of which began streaming Friday morning on Netflix: It\u2019s the near-total agreement \u2014 from the highest glass offices at NBCUniversal down to your and my living-room couches \u2014 that \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d doesn\u2019t belong on \u201cregular\u201d TV, that it somehow deserved a classier fate than the prime-time grid.\n\nThe show, which was created by Fey and her \u201c30 Rock\u201d collaborator Robert Carlock and still produced by NBCUniversal, is about a relentlessly sunny woman (Ellie Kemper of \u201cThe Office\u201d and \u201cBridesmaids\u201d) who starts life over in New York after spending 15 years as a sister-wife in a doomsday cult\u2019s bunker in Indiana.\n\nIt was supposed to debut this month on NBC, which touted the show for months as part of its midseason schedule, but at some point late last fall, \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d was judged by its creators and network executives to be too smart, too precious (or too something; we\u2019ll get back to that) to face the usual crapshoot that determines a show\u2019s success, most notably its Nielsen ratings. Even though Nielsen has adjusted its measurements to reflect the way viewers absorb new shows (by DVR, video on demand and time-shifted viewing on other devices, in every way except osmosis), the story is usually tragic: Viewers are hard to pin down, and practically every scripted show this season that\u2019s not called \u201cEmpire\u201d has more or less debuted with its time-bomb clock already counting the final \u201cMacGruber\u201d-like seconds.\n\nAs proof of its commitment to the creative process more than the bottom line, Netflix agreed to pick up \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d for a second season before viewers had seen a single episode. It\u2019s a sweet deal for NBCUniversal, Fey and everyone else.\n\n\n\nProducer and co-writer Robert Carlock, at the Netflix TCA Press Tour in January. He says that discussions with NBC were \u201creally honest and productive\u201d and that \u201cwe just said, \u2018Could we explore other options?\u2019 \u201d (Mark Davis/Getty Images for Netflix)\n\nProducer and co-writer Tina Fey: \u201c[I]t just makes more sense than broadcast, I think, for these kinds of shows.\u201d (Mark Davis/Getty Images for Netflix)\n\nWith help from Fey and Carlock, both NBC and Netflix put a spin on the move that\u2019s as giddy as Kimmy\u2019s discovery (in the first episode) of a Manhattan bulk-candy shop.\n\n\u201cIt was probably the fastest that anything good has ever happened to me in this business,\u201d Carlock told reporters at a news conference with TV critics this year. \u201cBad things happen real quick all the time. We were just having conversations with NBC about scheduling and about where we could go and where they could launch us, and it was just a really honest and productive conversation [about] the larger landscape of comedy right now. And we just said, \u2018Could we explore other options?\u2019 \u201d\n\nBefore Fey and Carlock knew it \u2014 in a matter of days, they said \u2014 they were talking to Netflix. And NBC was fine with that.\n\n\u201cThe show is made by NBC, it\u2019s in NBC\u2019s best interests for the show to [find] its best home,\u201d Fey explained. \u201cAnd rather than trying to stick it on NBC between a multicam [sitcom] and a drama, they agreed that [Netflix] would be the right place for it.\u201d\n\nBy that point, NBC had already let go of \u201cCommunity,\u201d which enjoyed hipster cred but never found a sustainably broad audience. (Yahoo TV picked it up, post-cancellation.) And \u201cParks and Recreation,\u201d after a mountain of positive press and enormous devotion from fans, had also flailed about for most of its broadcast life; in the end, NBC aired \u201cParks and Rec\u2019s\u201d seventh and final season two episodes at a time, concluding in late February. \u201c30 Rock\u201d had similarly struggled as a broadcast show, but, Fey has observed, it seemed to really connect with Netflix viewers.\n\n\u201cI know so many people who just, anecdotally, go to Netflix just to watch \u201830 Rock\u2019 [and other] shows that modern people aren\u2019t always at their TV at 8:30 on Thursday [to watch],\u201d she said. \u201cSo it just makes more sense than broadcast, I think, for these kinds of shows.\u201d\n\nSo if not her new show, what kind of show can work on broadcast television?\n\nLive events, Fey quickly answered. Shows like \u201cThe Voice,\u201d award shows, sports and event specials like \u201cPeter Pan Live!\u201d\n\n\u201cThankfully it\u2019s not my job to figure out what still works on broadcast,\u201d Fey said. \u201cI guess it should have been.\u201d\n\nThough she probably didn\u2019t mean in that moment to forecast the future of the big networks (NBC, ABC, CBS, Fox, the CW), Fey sort of elegantly and bluntly brought it all into focus. She hadn\u2019t lost faith in broadcast television \u2014 she even backtracked later and said she would love to make network shows in the future \u2014 but in her matter-of-fact shrugs and answers, such was admitting something the networks can never admit at such news conferences: She was moving on.\n\n\n\nEllie Kemper stars in Netflix's \"Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\" (Eric Liebowitz/Netflix)\n\nBoth Fey and Carlock described the liberation that came with taking \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d to Netflix. After the deal was announced, they still had several episodes (there are 13 this season) to finish editing. Now they could be less concerned with all the nonsense that comes with a network half-hour \u2014 looking for spots in the story to break to a commercial, for instance, or worrying that a \u201cMysteries of Laura\u201d promo swipe at the bottom of the screen would visually ruin a joke.\n\nThey could also assume that viewers of episode 5 had already watched episodes 1-4, which helps writers get to the good and funny parts faster. The list goes on: An episode could be 25 minutes long if it needed to be, rather than the rigid 22 minutes. Four-letter words (as well as four-letter-word-type situations) are now possible.\n\nLike its heroine, who finds the world fantastically, even bracingly limitless compared with her former life in a dank bunker with other deluded believers, \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d now basks in the freedoms afforded to those who\u2019ve landed on the sunnier (cooler, edgier) side of the TV revolution.\n\nHere, Kimmy will never have to worry about ratings, because at Netflix, there is no such thing as ratings \u2014 at least not in a public sense. The most anyone knows about Netflix is that it has more than 50 million subscribers worldwide. What they watch, and in how many numbers, is carefully guarded information.\n\nAnd if Kimmy doesn\u2019t have to worry about ratings, she also doesn\u2019t have to worry about reviews \u2014 all of which would have been glowing anyhow, right? Because everyone loves Ellie Kemper, because everyone loved \u201c30 Rock,\u201d because Tina Fey is such a genius, etc. In many ways, \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d is a hit by association rather than on its own merits.\n\n\n\nJane Krakowski and Ellie Kemper in \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt.\u201d As in \u201c30 Rock,\u201d Krakowski is Carlock and Fey\u2019s surest and truest muse. In \u201cUnbreakable,\u201d she plays billionaire trophy wife Jacqueline Voorhees. (Eric Liebowitz/Netflix)\n\nAll of which brings me to my review, if those are still relevant.\n\n\u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d certainly might have tanked on NBC, not because broadcast viewers lack the sophistication to appreciate its cheerful absurdity, but because it takes a brilliant and darkly humorous concept (surviving a cult) and finds ways to immediately turn it into a tiresome loop of the same joke over and over and over.\n\nAt its best, \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d is an endearing sendup of the idea that America is the great land of second chances; in its duller moments, the show seems ill-suited to the Netflix ideal, in which a viewer burns through an entire season as fast as possible. After about three episodes, a viewer gets enough.\n\nKimmy is one of five wives of the Rev. Richard Wayne Gary Wayne, who convinced his followers that the world had been destroyed by apocalypse and that they would need to live out their days underground. (The show is sharpest in Kimmy\u2019s occasional flashback scenes to her life in the cult.)\n\nNo sooner are the women rescued by federal agents than a bystander\u2019s observations to the news cameras are Auto-Tuned into a YouTube hit. Kimmy accompanies her sister-wives (now nicknamed \u201cthe Indiana Mole Women\u201d) to New York for their obligatory \u201cToday\u201d show interview, where Matt Lauer plays himself, because NBCUniversal is incapable of avoiding any opportunity for self-reference (a habit perfected on \u201c30 Rock\u201d). After the taping, Kimmy impulsively leaves the group to begin life anew.\n\nIt\u2019s both a plus and a minus that \u201cKimmy Schmidt\u201d comes at us with the same water-pistol delivery style of \u201c30 Rock,\u201d one joke squirted after another, which has a way of making the so-so gags seem just as clever as the sure-fire bits. Fey, Carlock and their writers are totally at home with a tone they perfected in \u201c30 Rock,\u201d and Kemper is an engagingly perfect actor for them to put through the paces. (In fact, Fey and Carlock came up with the show specifically for Kemper.)\n\n\u201cHey, Red,\u201d a leering construction worker calls out to Kimmy. \u201cYou\u2019re making me wish I was those jeans.\u201d\n\n\u201cWell, I wish I was your yellow hat,\u201d Kimmy giddily replies. \u201cIt\u2019s my favorite color!\u201d\n\nShe rents a closet in the basement apartment of Titus (Tituss Burgess), a flamboyantly gay singer and daytime street performer (he wears an Iron Man costume in Times Square) who owes the building\u2019s strange landlady (Carol Kane) too much back rent to refuse a roommate. Both Titus and Kimmy discover a common thread as outsiders/survivors \u2014 he escaped his Mississippi childhood, she escaped the Rev. Richard Wayne Gary Wayne.\n\nAs for employment, Kimmy winds up working as a nanny in the tony townhome of billionaire trophy wife Jacqueline Voorhees, played by \u201c30 Rock\u2019s\u201d Jane Krakowski.\n\n\u201cHow do I look?\u201d Jacqueline asks Kimmy.\n\n\u201cLike a million bucks!\u201d Kimmy replies.\n\n\u201cI know you didn\u2019t mean that to be hurtful,\u201d Jacqueline says, disappointed.\n\nKrakowski remains Fey and Carlock\u2019s truest and surest muse, and they use her to spoof the wealth gap here the same way they once used Jenna Maroney to spoof celebrityhood in \u201c30 Rock\u201d; this may be a show about Kimmy\u2019s misadventures, but it\u2019s never more funny than when Krakowski is on the screen. (After Kimmy decorates for a child\u2019s birthday party, Jacqueline proclaims it to resemble \u201cthe reception for an Appalachian incest wedding.\u201d)\n\nPerhaps \u201cUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt\u201d will eventually find a way to be a show worthy of all this talk and expectation, rather than the B-/C+ attempt at a network show that Fey and Carlock have delivered. There\u2019s not much special about it, so far, except the lucky circumstances of its survival.\n\nBut for proof of its future potential, look no further than the first several episodes of \u201c30 Rock\u201d from the fall of 2006, which are remarkably slower and less entertaining than the fine show that eventually emerged, thanks in no small part to NBC\u2019s patience. They\u2019re on Netflix.\n\nUnbreakable Kimmy Schmidt (13 episodes) is now streaming on Netflix.", "images": ["https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/04/Style/Images/unbre_tca_008_h.jpg?uuid=lFpJNsKiEeSewrQY9XpKmQ", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/25/Style/Images/unbre_s1_005_h.jpg?t=20170517", "https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-apps/imrs.php?src=https://www.washingtonpost.com/pb/resources/img/spacer-gray.png&w=1&h=1", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/03/04/Style/Images/unbre_tca_012_h.jpg?uuid=MckLPMKhEeSewrQY9XpKmQ", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/25/Style/Images/unbre_s1_006_h.jpg?uuid=-qv_ur0oEeSGaE57qEOcpg", "https://img.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_60w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/25/Style/Images/unbre_s1_005_h.jpg?uuid=5sbEdr0oEeSGaE57qEOcpg"], "top_img": "https://www.washingtonpost.com/rf/image_1484w/2010-2019/WashingtonPost/2015/02/25/Style/Images/unbre_s1_005_h.jpg?t=20170517", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Hank Stuever", "Senior Editor For Style", "March", "Hank Stuever Is Senior Editor For The Washington Post'S Style Section", "Working With Writers", "Editors On The Mix Of Culture", "Politics That Has Defined The Daily Feature Section Since Its Debut.
