She started as a janitor on the midnight shift at GM,[10] then worked in fleet management at the GM proving grounds in Milford, Michigan, then hosted hospitality days for all the GM family members, eventually moving into public relations at an ad agency.[9] She went back to GM, becoming the owner of four shops that managed publicity events for magazine journalists. From the age of 14 to 18, Shepard worked for his mother on the road, going from racetrack to racetrack.[3] For about two years, Shepard had a stepfather who was an engineer on the Corvette.[3][9] Shepard's mother has been married four times; Shepard said he's had three stepfathers.[11]\n\nAccording to Shepard, his mother named him for the rich playboy Dax (Diogenes Alejandro Xenos), in Harold Robbins' novel The Adventurers.[12] He has an older brother, David Shepard Jr., who lives in Oregon,[7] and a younger half-sister, Carly Hatter,[3] whom he cast in two films: 2012's Hit and Run[13][14] and 2017's CHiPs. He is also distantly related to George Washington, through marriage, on his mother's side. [15]\n\nShepard has said that he was raised in Milford,[3] although he lived in a lot of places in suburban Detroit, growing up primarily in Walled Lake, Michigan. He graduated from Walled Lake Central High School in 1993[16] before enrolling in The Groundlings school.[17] After attending Santa Monica College and West Los Angeles College, Shepard transferred to UCLA, where he graduated magna cum laude with a B.A. in Anthropology.[18] He had a deal with his mother that if he went to college she would pay his rent.[3]\n\nCareer [ edit ]\n\nAfter a year in Santa Barbara, California, Shepard moved to Los Angeles in 1996.[3] He found out about The Groundlings improv troupe from a friend from Santa Barbara, Kareem Elseify, ended up auditioning (the first time he acted), and took classes while also attending UCLA. After about five years of classes, he got into the Sunday Company of The Groundlings\u2014in a group that included Melissa McCarthy, Fortune Feimster, Tate Taylor and Nat Faxon.[3]\n\nFrom 2003 onwards, Shepard became known from his work in the improv Candid Camera-type show, Punk'd, with Ashton Kutcher. When the show had its 2012 revival, he continued to appear. Shepard said he auditioned for Punk'd and while doing the pilot became friendly with Kutcher, who arranged for him to get an agent.[3] He had auditioned unsuccessfully for 10 years before landing the role in Punk'd, his first.[3]\n\nIn 2004, Shepard starred in the comedy Without a Paddle, alongside Seth Green and Matthew Lillard. Although the film received negative reviews, it was a commercial success that as of 2009 had grossed more than US$65 million worldwide.[19] In 2005, he starred as The Astronaut in Zathura: A Space Adventure, a science fiction adventure fantasy film. In 2006, he appeared with Dane Cook and Jessica Simpson in the comedy Employee of the Month and in Mike Judge's film Idiocracy as the character Frito.\n\nDuring the same time, Shepard began appearing in more films and landed his first main character role in Let's Go to Prison (2006), alongside Will Arnett and Chi McBride. He also had a main role in the 2008 comedy Baby Mama, starring opposite Tina Fey and Amy Poehler. Shepard wrote the script for the Paramount venture Get 'Em Wet, in which he again appeared with Arnett.

The couple announced their engagement in January 2010; however, they decided to delay marriage until the state of California passed legislation legalizing same-sex marriage.[34][35] After section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act was ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court on June 26, 2013, Bell asked Shepard through Twitter to marry her,[36] which he accepted.[37] They were married at the Beverly Hills County Clerk's Office on October 17, 2013.[38] They have two daughters, born in March 2013[39] and December 2014.[40]\n\nSubstance abuse [ edit ]\n\nShepard has said that, except for a year in high school when he used drugs, he did not have a substance abuse problem until he was 18 years old.[3] After many struggles, Shepard achieved sobriety in September 2005.[3] On September 25, 2020, in a special episode of his podcast, Armchair Expert, Shepard revealed he had relapsed while recovering from an accident by buying painkillers to augment a prescription.
