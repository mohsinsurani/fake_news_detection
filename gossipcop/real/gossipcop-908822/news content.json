How many Grammys is SZA nominated for?\n\nShe is the most nominated female at this year's Grammy Awards, with five nominations: Best New Artist, Best R&B Song (\"Supermodel\"), Best Rap/Sung Collabration (\"Love Galore\"), Best R&B Performance (The Weekend), and Best Urban Contemporary Album (Ctrl).\n\n3.

She told Nylon Magazine in a recent interview, \"I love food, so having a lot of food allergies now and just having a really sensitive body, it forces me to be very mindful and conscious and eat when I\u2019m hungry, not just when I\u2019m bored and just really slow down. Everything in moderation.\"\n\nMore entertainment news\n\nCongratulations: Singer Christina Perri and Paul Costabile welcome baby girl\n\nDay trip: At the Grammy Museum at the Prudential Center in Newark, it's always award season\n\nDeals: Get Discounted Tickets To Music Festivals", "images": ["https://media.gannett-cdn.com/29906170001/29906170001_5680202255001_5680176975001-vs.jpg?pubId=29906170001", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-play-alt-white.svg", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/appservices/universal-web/universal/icons/icon-instagram_24.png"], "top_img": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Laura Adams Stiansen"], "canonical_link": "https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/01/28/6-things-know-sza-grammy-nominated-r-b-singer-songwriter-maplewood/1071820001/", "title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1", "HandheldFriendly": "True", "MobileOptimized": 320, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=446490632, app-argument=https://www.northjersey.com/story/entertainment/music/2018/01/28/6-things-know-sza-grammy-nominated-r-b-singer-songwriter-maplewood/1071820001/entertainment/music", "theme-color": "#ffffff", "og": {"title": "SZA: 6 things to know about the Grammy nominated singer from Maplewood", "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native", "site_name": "NorthJersey", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.gannett-cdn.com/-mm-/332724df79ead1434e2864c356f21eab95d49596/c=92-186-1156-787/local/-/media/2018/01/27/Bergen/NorthJersey/636526442422936083-SUB-SZA-Gap-2.jpg?auto=webp&format=pjpg&width=1200", "width": 1200, "height": 675}}, "description": "With the Grammy Awards airing 7:30 p.m. tonight on CBS, it's a good time to get to know nominee SZA, a Maplewood native", "twitter": {"site": "@northjersey", "creator": "@northjersey", "card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube.com/embed/hHXfCOjb3fk?feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1517097600.0, "source": "https://www.northjersey.com", "summary": ""}
