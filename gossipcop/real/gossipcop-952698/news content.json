Today I proudly, happily and healthily stand here as someone who will continue to always lead by example as I tirelessly advocate for the betterment of those in need.\"\n\nShe concluded: \"If you change your mind, you can change your life.\"\n\nIn an interview in October last year, Williams spoke about her experience of suffering from depression while she was in Destiny's Child.\n\n\"For years, I'm in one of the top-selling female groups of all time suffering with depression,\" she said. \"I was at that place where it got so dark and heavy because sometimes you feel like 'I'm the provider, I take care of people, I'm not supposed to be feeling this way - what do I do? I wanted out.\"\n\nResponding to Williams' Instagram post, Missy Elliot wrote on Twitter: \"I want to lift our sis up in prayer because there are so many people battling this and many trying to deal with it alone... Let's keep the ones who are openly dealing with it uplifted & be encouraging to them! Love u @RealMichelW.\"\n\nGreat music documentaries to watch now Show all 6 1 /6 Great music documentaries to watch now Great music documentaries to watch now Glastonbury The Movie (In Flashback) Glastonbury is taking a fallow year but if you\u2019re still craving your Pilton fix, look no further.
