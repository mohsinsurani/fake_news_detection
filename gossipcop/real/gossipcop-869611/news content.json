Scott Dowling of the Beverly Hills Police Department tells PEOPLE the accident occurred outside the Saban Theater at 9:24 p.m. According to Lt. Dowling, the victim, identified as Maurice Lamont, suffered non-life threatening injuries and was transported to Cedars-Sinai Medical Center.\n\nAccording to a source on the scene, Bieber, 23, was trying to drive away from the church but a slew of photographers was at the end of the driveway. \u201cHe tried to scare away the paparazzi but as he neared the group, he accidentally hit one of the photographers who was in his path,\u201d the source tells PEOPLE.\n\nPhotos taken at the scene show Bieber got out of his car to check to see if Lamont was okay.\n\nBACKGRID USA\n\nByrdman/BACKGRID\n\n\u201cJustin was surrounded by paparazzi leaving church services and accidentally grazed or came into contact with one of the paps surrounding his truck. To say he \u2018ran over\u2019 or \u2018hit\u2019 the guy is misleading and an overstatement and implies something much more grave than what happened,\u201d a source close to Bieber tells PEOPLE.\n\n\u201cJustin immediately stopped, called 911 himself, stayed with the guy and the police, fully cooperated and as I understand it, was released from the scene without citation.\u201d\n\nA rep for Bieber had no comment.\n\nAll Access/SPW/Splash\n\nAll Access/SPW/Splash\n\nAlso pictured at the scene: Bieber\u2019s former fling Kourtney Kardashian, who occasionally attends the church as well. The reality star enjoyed dinner at Craig\u2019s before heading over to the theater, and was photographed going to her car after Bieber\u2019s accident.\n\nJuliano/X17online.com\n\nOn Thursday, Lamont gave his version of events via Instagram, straight from his hospital bed.\n\n\u201cHanging in there everybody \u2026 Hour before my birthday hits, I get ran over by Justin Bieber. Isn\u2019t that something? He\u2019s a good kid, though. I think the truck was a little bit too big for him though \u2019cause there\u2019s no way he could see over the front \u2014 the slope it was on.\u201d\n\nHe added, \u201cBut like I said: He got out, he was compassionate, he\u2019s a good kid, accidents happen. Hopefully everything works out here. Getting ready to go into X-ray right now!\u201d\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/p/BXDEvyqlnll/?taken-by=shotgetter\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Justin Bieber Focusing on \u2018Being Spiritual and Attending Church\u2019 After \u2018Disappointing\u2019 Decision to Cancel Tour: Source\n\nEarlier this week, a rep for the singer revealed the singer was canceling the remaining dates of his Purpose World Tour \u201cdue to unforeseen circumstances\u201c; following the announcement, Beliebers around the world unleashed tweets voicing their frustration.\n\nA friend of Bieber\u2019s told PEOPLE why the \u201cSorry\u201d singer needed a break from his grueling schedule on the road.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t feel like he could give the rest of the tour as much energy as his fans deserve,\u201d says the friend of Bieber\u2019s decision to call it quits. \u201cHe is a perfectionist and didn\u2019t want to disappoint fans with some half-ass performance. He thinks his fans deserve and should expect the same performance at the end of the tour as in the beginning. He just didn\u2019t have that passion right now. He is truly exhausted.\u201d\n\nPut your celeb and pop culture knowledge to the test and download PEOPLE and Zynga\u2019s Crosswords with Friends.", "images":
