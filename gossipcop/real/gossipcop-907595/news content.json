Much as Morgan did last season with \u201cMulder and Scully Meet the Were-Monster,\u201d he flips viewer\u2019s expectations, but this time he does so through the filter of the Trump administration and the battle over fake news. How can somebody believe that \u201cthe truth is out there\u201d when no one agrees upon the truth? It\u2019s funny, smart, irreverent, and, in keeping with a theme of this season, it playfully comments on the X-Files fanbase, who probably remember an episode or two differently than they actually played out.\n\n\u201cThe Lost Art of Forehead Sweat\u201d is about gaps in collective memory, a phenomenon known as the \u201cMandela effect.\u201d (Not the \u201cMengele effect,\u201d despite what one of the characters says in the episode, for the record.) The Mandela effect refers to what are essentially shared mistakes in memory. Memory is a pliable, funny thing: People can be convinced they saw movies they didn\u2019t see, such as the Kazaam issue Mulder references in the episode, or that more people attended an inauguration than actually did. It often happens with movie quotes, too: What if I told you Darth Vader never said \u201cLuke, I am your father\u201d or the Queen in Snow White never said, \u201cMirror, mirror on the wall\u201d? This episode applies this fascinating concept to the history of The X-Files.\n\nWe\u2019re introduced to the Mandela effect through the story of Reggie Something, played by Brian Huskey. We meet him in full Deep Throat mode, chewing sunflower seeds in a parking garage, having a clandestine meeting with Mulder. He knows he\u2019s going to seem crazy, so he gives Mulder a very personal example of the Mandela effect, revealing to him that his favorite episode of The Twilight Zone, \u201cThe Lost Martian,\u201d doesn\u2019t really exist. Of course, we know it doesn\u2019t, but Mulder is convinced that he saw it when he was a kid. He rummages through his belongings to find it, leading to the great line when Scully suggests it might be a different series: \u201cConfuse The Twilight Zone with The Outer Limits?! Do you even KNOW ME?!?!\u201d\n\nNow it\u2019s Scully\u2019s time to meet with Reggie and learn what her Mandela Effect is. It\u2019s a Jell-o knock-off called Goop-o ABC, which Reggie hands her before yelling \u201cJust prove that I\u2019m real!\u201d Of course, his fingerprints on the box don\u2019t match anyone\u2019s in the system.\n\nNow Mulder and Scully decide to talk to Reggie together, and we learn his trigger that allowed him to see the falsity of his memory, his \u201cLost Martian\u201d or his Goop-o ABC. When he was moving his mother, he came across a book by Dr. Wuzzle. The only problem? He remembered his favorite childhood author being named Dr. Wussle. Eager to investigate, he found his way to a nostalgia shop and saw a cartoon drawn by, of course, Dr. Wuzzle. He explains to Mulder and Scully that the Mandela effect is being controlled by someone, quoting George Orwell when he says, \u201cHe who controls the past controls the future.\u201d (There\u2019s even a brilliant edit in which Reggie talks about companies controlling their image and it\u2019s meant to appear like a modern brand name got cut out.) There\u2019s a wonderful comedic energy to the scene, as the three characters argue over whether Reggie\u2019s problems are due to government conspiracy (Reggie), faulty memory (Scully), or alternate universes (Mulder). Reggie points out that \u201cthey\u201d want you to think all conspiracies are silly. And Darin Morgan has an answer for just who \u201cthey\u201d is.\n\nMeet Dr. Thaddeus Q. They, the man who figured out who to manipulate collective memory. While working on Operation Soy Bomb, he made astronauts forget home and was fired for making them think they were chimpanzees. He works for \u201cunknown, mysterious clients,\u201d he was in a movie called Ka-Blaam, and he was last seen at the 2017 inauguration. Reggie latches onto the fact that Dr. They worked in Grenada, where Reggie claims he saw alien land almost four decades ago. Reggie remembers seeing the alien being taken away by mysterious men in black. Then he drops the biggest bomb yet: He started The X-Files. In an amazing montage, we see Reggie cut into old episodes of the show from its original run. It\u2019s a meta reference, telling us, the fans, that we remember these classic episodes differently than they actually played out. It\u2019s an episode about manipulating history that manipulates the history of itself. Brilliant.\n\nWhile Mulder tries to figure out an answer without coming back to alternate universes, he gets a call from Dr. They. In another clandestine meeting, the good doctor of \u201cphony fake news\u201d castigates Mulder for not finding him sooner, telling him that his time has passed. We\u2019re in an era in which powerful leaders don\u2019t need to keep secrets anymore because no one believes or cares when they\u2019re revealed. As he says, \u201cWe\u2019re living in a post-cover-up, post-conspiracy age.\u201d The \u201cpoco\u201d age, as he calls it, doesn\u2019t need conspiracies if people can\u2019t tell the difference between real and fake \u2014 if people only believe what they want to believe. This is an episode that\u2019s about the spread of disinformation, and how it\u2019s going to be a defining characteristic of our time when historians write it.\n\nWhen we get our final parking-garage meeting with Reggie, Scully drops the bomb: She found out about his past. He was just a government employee, a guy who rose the ranks from USPS to IRS to SEC to DOJ to CIA to DOD to NSA, and he was committed to a mental institution a year ago. Is Reggie just a disillusioned employee imagining he still fights for truth and justice? He willingly puts on a straitjacket, but Mulder asks about their last case before he goes.\n\nIt turns out that Reggie, Mulder, and Scully did find the truth. The alien from Grenada came back, as he promised he would, and gave them a book called All the Answers, but only after telling them never to come to outer space again. Lest anyone think there wasn\u2019t already Trump commentary in this episode, the alien in this flashback quotes him deliberately, saying that the Earth isn\u2019t sending outer space \u201cyour best people\u201d and that the rest of the universe is going to build a wall to keep humanity out. Mulder throws a tantrum in response. He doesn\u2019t want all the answers. He wants to keep searching.\n\nBack in the present day, Skinner asks where they\u2019re taking Reggie before Scully and Mulder settle in for some TV and snacks. It turns out \u201cThe Lost Martian\u201d was on a show called The Dusky Realm and Goop-o ABC looks gross. And that\u2019s when Scully hits us with a melancholy line: \u201cI want to remember how it all was.\u201d We all do, Sculls.\n\nOther Notes\n\n\u2022 We\u2019ll get to the other Easter eggs and references in a minute, but here\u2019s a huge one that you might have missed. Two weeks ago, in \u201cThis,\u201d as Scully and Mulder were flipping through the electronic X-Files, an ID badge for someone else went by. Guess who? Reggie! Does this mean his story about working with Mulder and Scully is true? Why else would his badge be in the X-Files?\n\nPhoto: Fox\n\n\u2022 I love how Reggie calls them Foxy and Sculls.\n\n\u2022 Just for the record, Scully says \u201cleprechaun taint\u201d in this episode and I\u2019m willing to bet those two words had never before been put together on television.\n\n\u2022 The Mulder flashback with an 8-year-old body and David Duchovny\u2019s head was brilliant.\n\n\u2022 Soy Bomb Conspiracy is a real thing.\n\n\u2022 The Grenada UFO Stamp is also real.\n\n\u2022 Reggie is shown a political cartoon from WWII drawn by Dr. Wuzzle. If you\u2019re wondering, Dr. Seuss drew political cartoons in that era, although I doubt anyone remembers his name as Dr. Seuzz. Maybe they will now.\n\n\u2022 Dr. They is played by TV legend Stuart Margolin, who won two Emmys for The Rockford Files.\n\n\u2022 Two great quotes: \u201cI\u2019m Fox freaking Mulder, you punks!\u201d and \u201cWe\u2019re not alone in the universe, but nobody likes us.\u201d\n\n\u2022 There are several classic episodes in the montage of Reggie being in The X-Files, including \u201cSqueeze,\u201d \u201cClyde Bruckman\u2019s Final Repose,\u201d \u201cHome\u201d (with a shot of last week\u2019s guest star Karin Konoval), and \u201cSmall Potatoes.\u201d", "images": ["http://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/double_chevron.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/e33/6e7/aed044d06bd5c293490430f400dc112e41-2022Cov4x5-AsianAmericaPkg.w240.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/31a/165/7b2cda49d5258316afceb071e56d8d3a8b-women-3.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "http://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/close_x.svg", "http://www.vulture.com/media/components/customer-alert-banner/alert.svg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/43e/8bd/645f0582f1c2e6121d62c03e491251dcbf-24-x-files-reggie.h473.w710.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/5ea/81e/4d3b39a96107c321338c0c9a25557bd47f-zarifa-ghafari.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/c32/3bf/0a393283dc1f3f9257ff8b361ea03216c8-russia-missile.2x.rsquare-zoom.w75.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3f4/36a/99a2463d495b5b70a891acdd460657352b-24-x-files-1104.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3f4/36a/99a2463d495b5b70a891acdd460657352b-24-x-files-1104.rsquare.w700.jpg"], "top_img": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3f4/36a/99a2463d495b5b70a891acdd460657352b-24-x-files-1104.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brian Tallerico"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/the-x-files-recap-season-11-episode-4.html", "title": "The X-Files Recap: All the Answers", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "parsely-tags": "tv, tv recaps, overnights, recaps, the x files, the x files season 11, fox, featuretype:tv recap", "og": {"title": "The X-Files Recap: All the Answers", "url": "https://www.vulture.com/2018/01/the-x-files-recap-season-11-episode-4.html", "description": "\u201cThe Lost Art of Forehead Sweat\u201d is one of the best episodes of The X-Files ever made.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3f4/36a/99a2463d495b5b70a891acdd460657352b-24-x-files-1104.1x.rsocial.w1200.jpg", "site_name": "Vulture", "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"title": "The X-Files Recap: All the Answers", "description": "\u201cThe Lost Art of Forehead Sweat\u201d is one of the best episodes of The X-Files ever made.", "image": "https://pyxis.nymag.com/v1/imgs/3f4/36a/99a2463d495b5b70a891acdd460657352b-24-x-files-1104.2x.rsocial.w600.jpg", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@vulture"}, "article": {"published_time": "2018-01-24T21:00:01.087-05:00", "tag": "tv, tv recaps, overnights, recaps, the x files, the x files season 11, fox", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vulture"}, "description": "\u201cThe Lost Art of Forehead Sweat\u201d is one of the best episodes of \u2018The X-Files\u2019 ever made.
