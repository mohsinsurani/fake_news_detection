The pop star, who grew up in Santa Barbara, performed acoustic versions of her hits like \"A Part of Me\" and \"Firework.\" She dedicated the latter to 14-year-old Lauren Cantin, who was rescued from her home after it was engulfed by the mud and debris. Her father was unfortunately one of the 21 victims who were killed in the natural disaster.", "images": ["https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/nu9hvXSN-720.jpg", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/twitter.1650102.png", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=34756675&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/instagram.c50a4f4.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/logo.8fcb0e1.png", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/youtube.4e8a45f.png", "https://ds.reson8.com/insights.gif?rand=[cache_buster]&evkey=101137925", "https://www.fuse.tv/dev/_nuxt/img/facebook.a3f142a.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/nu9hvXSN-720.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.fuse.tv/2018/02/katy-perry-surprises-thomas-fire-montecito-mudslide-survivors-at-benefit-concert", "title": "Katy Perry Surprising Thomas Fire & Mudslide Survivors at Benefit Concert Was an Awesome Act of Kindness", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "keywords": "Fuse,", "fb": {"pages": 10262075277, "app_id": 1272603569472546}, "theme-color": "#FF5C1E", "og": {"site_name": "Fuse", "url": "/2018/02/katy-perry-surprises-thomas-fire-montecito-mudslide-survivors-at-benefit-concert", "title": "Katy Perry Surprising Thomas Fire & Mudslide Survivors at Benefit Concert Was an Awesome Act of Kindness", "description": "Katy Perry helped the One 805 Kick Ash Bash fundraiser raise almost $2 million during her surprise performance.", "type": "video.other", "image": "https://cdn.jwplayer.com/thumbs/nu9hvXSN-720.jpg"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "site": "@fusetv", "description": "Katy Perry helped the One 805 Kick Ash Bash fundraiser raise almost $2 million during her surprise performance."}, "twitter.title": "Fuse TV - Katy Perry Surprising Thomas Fire & Mudslide Survivors at Benefit Concert Was an Awesome Act of Kindness", "description": "Katy Perry helped the One 805 Kick Ash Bash fundraiser raise almost $2 million during her surprise performance."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.fuse.tv", "summary": ""}
