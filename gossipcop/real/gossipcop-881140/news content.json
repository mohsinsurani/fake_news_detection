Like, really moved on. The This Is Us (opens in new tab) star is currently dating Kelly Egarian\u2014a 31-year-old marketing coordinator\u2014and although it's hard to imagine Ventimiglia, 40, with anybody else other than his current TV wife Rebecca (Mandy Moore) (opens in new tab), that's exactly the goal for the star.\n\n\"I try to minimize myself so people can see the character and can really dive into the work,\u201d Ventimiglia told People (opens in new tab) back in December. Naturally, this makes us wonder *even more* how Ventimiglia spends his time off screen. Here, everything you need to know about Kelly Egarian and the pair's low-key relationship.\n\nThey made their first public appearance together at the 2017 Emmys.\n\nThough they didn't walk the red carpet together (opens in new tab), Egarian joined Ventimiglia at their seats during the award show where Ventimiglia's co-star, Sterling K. Brown, received an Emmy for outstanding lead actor for drama series. The couple were also spotted kissing and dancing at the Emmys after party (opens in new tab).\n\n@MiloVentimiglia and his beautiful girlfriend Kelly Egarian at the EMMYS! #ThisIsUs #emmys pic.twitter.com/NBf8D7P4BnSeptember 19, 2017 See more\n\nShe's a marketing coordinator for Stella McCartney (opens in new tab) .\n\nShe's also considered a professional stylist:\n\nThey've been dating for over a year.\n\nThough Ventimiglia has not officially confirmed (opens in new tab) their relationship, he and Egarian were spotted together for the first time (opens in new tab) in Venice Beach December 2016.\n\nA source reportedly claims (opens in new tab) Egarian dated the former boy band member years ago, though any photographic evidence of this has been wiped clean off the internet. (Egarian has no social media presence either.)\n\nHere's hoping for more sightings of Ventimiglia and Egarian, and an *official* confirmation from the couple.\n\n", "images": ["https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/l0uowirhzd1627591128.svg", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=756449714459937&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://vanilla.futurecdn.net/marieclaireus/missing-image.svg", "https://www.marieclaire.com/media/img/missing-image.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.mos.cms.futurecdn.net/flexiimages/l0uowirhzd1627591128.svg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Rachel Epstein", "Andrea Park", "Jenny Hollander", "Julia Marzovilla", "Mehera Bonner", "The Editors", "Katherine J Igoe", "Bianca Rodriguez", "Neha Prakash", "Window.Slicecomponents"], "canonical_link": "https://www.marieclaire.com/celebrity/a17043950/who-is-milo-ventimiglia-girlfriend-kelly-egarian/", "title": "Who Is Kelly Egarian?
