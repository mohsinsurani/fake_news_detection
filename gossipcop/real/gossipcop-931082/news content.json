However, she will only be able to proceed on defamation and tortious interference claims. A sexual harassment claim has been rejected in the first iteration of the lawsuit.\n\nThe actress alleges in her complaint that she became Weinstein\u2019s victim when the movie mogul made demands on her in a hotel room about 20 years ago. Judd says that she only escaped after relenting to a deal where she would let him touch her if she won an Academy Award. Later, Judd says she was in serious discussions for a big role in Peter Jackson\u2019s Lord of the Rings, but that opportunity was torpedoed after Weinstein or someone at Miramax told the director that she was a \u201cnightmare\u201d to work with.\n\nIn a ruling on Wednesday, one day after hearing oral arguments on Weinstein\u2019s motion to dismiss, U.S. District Court Judge Philip Gutierrez examined whether Judd had brought a timely lawsuit or whether her claims were barred by statute of limitations.\n\nThe actress said she only learned that she was nixed for a role in Lord of the Rings after Jackson recounted what happened in a December 2017 interview. Although Weinstein argued she had a duty to conduct a reasonable investigation, she responded that it was unlikely that a powerful producer and film distributor would reveal something in confidence and disrupt the relationship.\n\nThe judge writes that Judd need only raise a plausible inference at this stage that she would have been unable to learn of Weinstein\u2019s statements about her to Jackson.\n\n\u201cAt this point, no evidence has been presented about whether it is common in the industry for actors to inquire into why they were not cast, and further, no evidence has been presented as to whether Jackson and Walsh would have informed Plaintiff about Defendant\u2019s statements had she asked them why she was not given a role in the Lord of the Rings films,\u201d states the order (read here). \u201cTaking Plaintiff\u2019s allegations as true \u2014 as the Court must at this stage \u2014 the Court concludes that she has raised a plausible inference that she would not have been able to learn about Defendant\u2019s statements during the limitations period, even if she had conducted a diligent investigation.\u201d\n\nThe judge also rules that Judd had adequately pled a defamation claim. Weinstein attempted to argue that if he stated that he had \u201cbad experiences\u201d with Judd, this amounted to a non-actionable opinion.\n\nJudd \u201cargues that she can prove these statements false because Defendant had no previous professional interaction with her and her short two-day experience working on the Miramax film Smoke (where she alleges that she did not interact with Defendant) was uniformly positive,\u201d writes the judge. \u201cThe Court agrees with Plaintiff.\u201d\n\nAs for Judd\u2019s sexual harassment claim, the judge writes that he is skeptical that the statute being invoked (California Civil Code Section 51.9) \u201ccan ever properly be applied to a relationship between a potential employer and a prospective employee.\u201d\n\nHowever, Gutierrez doesn\u2019t make a firm determination on whether a claim of this nature would ever fly. Instead, he looks at Judd\u2019s description of her single meeting with Weinstein to ostensibly discuss potential roles in films and finds this doesn\u2019t fit the type of relationship of someone providing professional services on an ongoing basis \u2014 something that would actually be susceptible to sexual harassment in the workplace.\n\n\u201c[Judd] argues that the statute was intended to cover harassment in \u2018power relationships,\u2019 but the statute does not use that term,\u201d writes the judge, later adding, \u201cA prospective employee usually either gets the job after an interview or series of interviews (and then becomes covered under sexual harassment laws applicable to employment relationships), or does not get the job, in which case the relationship ends. The temporary nature of a prospective employment relationship is qualitatively different than the often-more-permanent relationships common with the categories of individuals explicitly listed in the statute.\u201d\n\nJudd tried to position Weinstein\u2019s behavior as similar to sexual harassment perpetrated by attorneys, physicians, and teachers \u2014 occupations referenced in the code as examples \u2014 but the judge says that she hasn\u2019t alleged the same kind of professional responsibilities on Weinstein\u2019s part.\n\nGutierrez does note that the law isn\u2019t settled on this point. If this issue eventually gets to an appeal, it could become an important and closely watched one in the #MeToo era.\n\nJudd will have an opportunity to file an amended complaint to try again with her sexual harassment claim.\n\nUpdate:\n\nTheodore Boutrous Jr., attorney for Judd, commented: \u201cWe are very pleased that today the District Court held that Ashley Judd can proceed with her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and continue her effort to vindicate the wrongs he committed against her among so many other women. We are also pleased that the court gave us an opportunity to amend our complaint and present additional facts related to one of Ms. Judd\u2019s claims. We will move forward immediately with discovery, including Mr. Weinstein\u2019s deposition, and look forward to proving to a jury at trial that Mr. Weinstein defamed Ms. Judd, interfered with her ability to earn a living, and engaged in unlawful business practices. The law should not tolerate this abuse of power to damage another\u2019s career.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ashhar_.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ashhar_.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/ashhar_.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Eriq Gardner"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/judge-lets-ashley-judd-sue-harvey-weinstein-defamation-not-sexual-harassment-1145409/", "title": "Judge Lets Ashley Judd Sue Harvey Weinstein for Defamation, Not Sexual Harassment", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "A California federal judge on Wednesday decided to let Ashley Judd move forward in her lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein.
