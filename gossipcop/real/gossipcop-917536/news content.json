When Beatty hesitated to announce the winner, visibly confused by the contents on the card, Dunaway read off La La Land as best picture. The mistake was attributed to the accountants at PricewaterhouseCoopers, who mixed up the envelope for best actress, won by La La Land\u2019s Emma Stone, with that of best picture.\n\nFor several minutes the mistake went unaccounted for, as the cast of La La Land gave speeches on the stage. Then, producer Jordan Horowitz corrected the record, telling the the audience there had been a mistake and that Moonlight had won the award.\n\nThis year, the Academy has streamlined its processes to prevent another mistake. But Beatty and Dunaway, evidently, will get a second chance to announce the prestigious award. On Thursday evening, TMZ learned that the two were spotted rehearsing at the Dolby Theatre in Los Angeles, where Dunaway said \u201cpresenting is better the second time around\u201d. Beatty replied: \u201cThe winner is Gone with the Wind.\u201d\n\nOther confirmed presenters during this year\u2019s telecast include Sandra Bullock, Lupita Nyong\u2019o, Emily Blunt, Armie Hammer, Tiffany Haddish, Jodie Foster and Gal Gadot, while the ceremony will again be hosted by Jimmy Kimmel. Guillermo del Toro\u2019s 60s-set romantic fantasy The Shape of Water leads the way with 13 nominations.", "images": ["https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbebb7b9b09b44d36b06a20e7f8dd16078f8d877/0_165_5530_3316/master/5530.jpg?width=465&quality=85&dpr=1&s=none", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035250&cv=2.0&cj=1&cs_ucfr=0&comscorekw=Oscars+2018%2CFilm%2CWarren+Beatty%2CFaye+Dunaway%2CCulture%2CLa+La+Land%2CMoonlight%2CUS+news%2CPwC", "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbebb7b9b09b44d36b06a20e7f8dd16078f8d877/0_165_5530_3316/master/5530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8775f8f0f5df0de853adff22a84955d3"], "top_img": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbebb7b9b09b44d36b06a20e7f8dd16078f8d877/0_165_5530_3316/master/5530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8775f8f0f5df0de853adff22a84955d3", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jake Nevins"], "canonical_link": "https://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again", "title": "Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to present best picture Oscar again", "meta_data": {"description": "Bonnie and Clyde pair get second chance after announcing La La Land instead of Moonlight at the 2017 Academy Awards", "viewport": "width=device-width,minimum-scale=1,initial-scale=1", "theme-color": "#052962", "og": {"url": "http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again", "image": {"identifier": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbebb7b9b09b44d36b06a20e7f8dd16078f8d877/0_165_5530_3316/master/5530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&enable=upscale&s=8775f8f0f5df0de853adff22a84955d3", "height": 720}, "title": "Warren Beatty and Faye Dunaway to present best picture Oscar again", "description": "Bonnie and Clyde pair get second chance after announcing La La Land instead of Moonlight at the 2017 Academy Awards", "type": "article", "site_name": "the Guardian"}, "article": {"author": "https://www.theguardian.com/profile/jake-nevins", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/theguardian", "modified_time": "2018-04-11T15:56:21.000Z", "section": "Film", "published_time": "2018-03-02T20:06:42.000Z", "tag": "Oscars 2018,Film,Warren Beatty,Faye Dunaway,Culture,La La Land,Moonlight,US news,PwC"}, "al": {"ios": {"url": "gnmguardian://film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again?contenttype=Article&source=applinks", "app_store_id": 409128287, "app_name": "The Guardian"}}, "fb": {"app_id": 180444840287}, "twitter": {"dnt": "on", "app": {"id": {"iphone": 409128287, "ipad": 409128287, "googleplay": "com.guardian"}, "name": {"googleplay": "The Guardian", "ipad": "The Guardian", "iphone": "The Guardian"}, "url": {"googleplay": "guardian://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again", "iphone": "gnmguardian://film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again?contenttype=Article&source=twitter", "ipad": "gnmguardian://film/2018/mar/02/warren-beatty-faye-dunaway-present-best-picture-oscar-again?contenttype=Article&source=twitter"}}, "card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@jhnevins", "image": "https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/cbebb7b9b09b44d36b06a20e7f8dd16078f8d877/0_165_5530_3316/master/5530.jpg?width=1200&height=630&quality=85&auto=format&fit=crop&overlay-align=bottom%2Cleft&overlay-width=100p&overlay-base64=L2ltZy9zdGF0aWMvb3ZlcmxheXMvdGctYWdlLTIwMTgucG5n&s=1519ecf3a7ef2ba3dbc804c4a47c8073", "site": "@guardian"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large"}, "movies": ["https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/8KeOxeuiZjs?wmode=opaque&feature=oembed"], "publish_date": 1519948800.0, "source": "https://www.theguardian.com", "summary": ""}
