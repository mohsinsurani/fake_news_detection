Until you see him on the race track, that is.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t heard (or seen on his Insta feed), Dempsey is a full-on racing aficionado these days. And as he climbed into a sleek Formula E car at the New York City E-Prix, one thing became very clear \u2014 the man loves getting behind the wheel. Maybe even more so than getting in front of the camera.\n\n\u201cI've loved racing since I was a kid,\u201d Dempsey tells InStyle of his test drive. \u201cSki racing was my first love, and then I picked up riding the unicycle, which got me involved in the entertainment industry and performing.\u201d\n\nEven after he got his big acting break in \u201880s classics like Can\u2019t Buy Me Love and Loverboy, he still had cars on the brain. \u201cI was about 20 years old when I finished Can\u2019t Buy Me Love, and right afterwards, I spend my entire paycheck on a black Porsche 356,\u201d he recalls. \u201cI saw it on the side of the road with a \u2018For Sale\u2019 sign, so I pulled over and bought it. I still have it today.\u201d\n\nThough Dempsey is more likely to be found on the track than a film set these days (it is rumored that he\u2019ll soon join the cast of the upcoming miniseries Devils), he\u2019s been busy working on other creative projects too, like his capsule clothing collection with Bluesalt and his partnership with the watch brand Tag Heuer.\n\nThat still doesn\u2019t stop hoards of Grey\u2019s Anatomy fans from reminding him how much he\u2019s missed in Shondaland. As Dr. Shepherd, Dempsey helped make the medical drama a must-watch on Thursday nights, and in the process, became a swoon-worthy object of affection for hoards of millennials shipping the #MerDer romance.\n\nDempsey gets it \u2014 he fell for his first celeb crush, Dorothy Hamill, by watching her on TV too (\u201cShe was skating in the Olympics!\u201d he recalls).\n\nImage zoom Credit: Kelsey McNeal/Getty Images\n\nSince Dempsey's character was killed off in 2015, the show has gone on. This fall marks Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019s 15th season, making it ABC\u2019s longest-running primetime scripted series of all-time \u2014 a feat that\u2019s not lost on Dempsey.\n\n\u201cGrey\u2019s Anatomy is still being discovered by people now,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd around the world, people still know me from that. It's changed my life, and I'm very grateful that I've had that experience. I really am.\u201d\n\nThe McDreamy nickname hasn\u2019t gone anywhere either. Dempsey, 52, says that he gets a kick out of it now. \u201cIt\u2019s always hard to live up to that,\u201d he says, grinning. \u201cIt\u2019s fascinating to still have it as a moniker, though. It makes me laugh! But Derek is a character that means a lot to people, so I have respect for it. It\u2019s nice to be known.\u201d", "images":
