But 12 years later, amid death, divorce, and a whole lot of drama, only Alex and Meredith are left from the original friend group. Of the three \"returning\" doctors, only George O'Malley was killed off of Grey's Anatomy. So does that leave any room for Katherine Heigl or Sandra Oh to make a cameo? Unfortunately, Heigl left the show on reportedly bad terms with showrunner Shonda Rhimes. As for Oh, her exit after 10 seasons was far more amicable, and her former TV flame, Kevin McKidd, (Dr. Owen Hunt on the show), isn't ruling out a real-life reunion at some point.\n\n\"Even though I was part of it, Cristina and Owen [were my favorite couple on the show],\" McKidd told Entertainment Tonight.\n\nThe actor revealed that when his character got married to Amelia, Sandra Oh got kind of jealous. McKidd revealed he told his former co-star that she needs to come back to Grey's Anatomy if she wants to change things\u2014and Oh didn't rule it out.\n\n\"I hope she will,\" McKidd added. \" I think it would be so much fun. It would open up so much again in the story and mix everything up.\"\n\nAs for that 300th episode, while Sandra Oh and the other former stars won't actually appear in it, the landmark episode will be a \"poem\" to loyal fans of the show.\n\n\"It's an interesting episode,\" McKidd told ET. \"People come into the hospital that kind of trigger memories for a lot of our doctors. It's really cool the way the stories have been woven together to do that \u2026 There's a lot of surprises and nuggets hidden within the episode.\"\n\nThe 300th episode of Grey's Anatomy airs Thursday, November 9 at 8 p.m. ET on ABC.\n\n[Featured Image by Todd Williamson /Invision/AP Images]", "images": ["https://imgb.srgcdn.com/c2fbdf24-a0a4-40f9-ad23-b0cb57bf8766.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/d258d2ec-e52b-4489-9950-908cc366bacf.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/fe42e24b-1fa1-4cf2-b7ef-0bcd25a6f5c9.png", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/28fd1ecd-acc0-48fc-be3b-21a0f5ef3d90.jpg", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/1740626a-9ecf-4723-b66a-d7ca5e1d678c.jpg", "https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/8881934fec783f32aef96d94ac2f65be?s=800", "https://imgb.srgcdn.com/6977b3f9-ffc5-44c5-866c-e80c13668077.jpg", "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png"], "top_img": "https://www.inquisitr.com/static/inquisitr/images/favicon-32x32.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4607176/greys-anatomy-300th-episode-to-bring-back-original-docs-izzie-george-and-cristina-but-not-how-you-think/", "title": "'Grey's Anatomy' 300th Episode To Bring Back Original Docs Izzie, George, And Cristina\u2014But Not How You Think", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, minimal-ui, user-scalable=no", "msapplication-TileImage": "/static/inquisitr/favicon-128x128.png", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "'Grey's Anatomy' 300th Episode To Bring Back Original Docs Izzie, George, And Cristina\u2014But Not How You Think", "url": "https://www.inquisitr.com/4607176/greys-anatomy-300th-episode-to-bring-back-original-docs-izzie-george-and-cristina-but-not-how-you-think/", "site_name": "The Inquisitr", "description": "'Grey's Anatomy' 300th Episode To Bring Back Original Docs Izzie, George, And Cristina\u2014But Not How You Think", "updated_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z"}, "article": {"modified_time": "2021-08-16 18:13:43Z", "published_time": "2017-11-07 18:31:05Z", "section": "Television"}, "description": "'Grey's Anatomy' 300th Episode To Bring Back Original Docs Izzie, George, And Cristina\u2014But Not How You Think", "keywords": "Television", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1510079465.0, "source": "https://www.inquisitr.com", "summary": ""}
