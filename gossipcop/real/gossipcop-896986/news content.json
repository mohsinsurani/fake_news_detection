{"url": "https://www.washingtonblade.com/2017/11/30/shadowhunters-star-dominic-sherwood-apologizes-using-gay-slur/", "text": "Today, sexy vampires are a staple of pop culture, but it hasn\u2019t always been that way.\n\nUp until the last few decades, vampires have been mostly interpreted as a metaphor for the dangers of an uncontrolled libido, and were accordingly depicted in horror fiction as monsters to be resisted and destroyed, no matter how alluring they might seem.\n\nAnne Rice changed all that.\n\nBefore \u201cTrue Blood\u201d or \u201cTwilight,\u201d or any of the other popular vampire fantasy sagas that have played on the more seductive aspects of the vampire mythos, her 1976 debut novel \u201cInterview with the Vampire\u201d paved the way by forcing readers to identify with its \u201cevil\u201d narrator. Suddenly, the monster was the hero of his own story instead of the villain in someone else\u2019s, allowing us to embrace our vicarious participation in his sensual pleasures and face a fact we all suspect in our hearts to be true: that given the chance, each and every one of us would probably choose to be a vampire.\n\nThat can be a disturbing revelation for some, and Rice\u2019s book wasn\u2019t an instant hit; reviews from critics, who weren\u2019t ready to see the ocean of counter-cultural nuance beneath the shocking and gory details of the plot, were mostly dismissive. Readers, however, were more responsive, and Rice\u2019s fan base grew enough to make the book\u2019s first sequel (1985\u2019s \u201cThe Vampire Lestat\u201d) into a bestseller. The author \u2013 who passed away at 80 last December \u2013 would eventually pen a total of 13 books in a series that became known as \u201cThe Vampire Chronicles,\u201d and her fans have remained loyal \u2013 some might even say obsessive \u2013 to this day.\n\nThat, of course, means that AMC\u2019s new series adaptation of Rice\u2019s seminal book \u2013 which premiered on the cable network with its first two episodes on Oct. 2 \u2013 is guaranteed a sizable built-in audience. It also means that the series must live up to a very high standard if it wants to keep those fans watching.\n\nSo far, despite a few notable divergences from the source material, things look promising.\n\nLike Rice\u2019s novel, the series centers on Louis de Pointe du Lac (Jacob Anderson), a vampire who \u2013 for his own inscrutable reasons \u2013 decides to tell his life story to a young reporter. In the re-imagined scenario constructed by show creator Rolin Jones, however, there have been some updates. Fifty years later, Louis feels he was not ready to be completely honest during that original interview in the 1970s, and he has endeavored to bring the same reporter \u2013 now a seasoned veteran journalist battling Parkinson\u2019s disease (Eric Bogosian) \u2013 to his sumptuous headquarters in Dubai so that he can set the record straight.\n\nThe tale he tells \u2013 beginning with his mortal life as the scion of a wealthy Louisiana family and his transformation by the amoral yet charismatic vampire Lestat (Sam Reid), to whom he then becomes lover and companion \u2013 remains largely the same, in broad swaths. The updated premise, however, allows for some not-so-minor changes in the details\u2013 not the least of which is making its protagonist a person of color, a successful New Orleans businessman of Creole descent instead of a wealthy white plantation owner with slaves, which refreshes its relevance for a 21st century audience while expanding the scope of the themes enfolded within the gothic architecture of its plot.\n\nBesides bringing America\u2019s troubled relationship with race into the forefront of the story, the show\u2019s \u201cfaithful with license to adapt\u201d approach allows it to unequivocally express the queerness that made the book and its sequels a touchstone for countless LGBTQ readers across the years. Though later installments in the chronicle were more directly candid about the nature of Louis\u2019s relationship with Lestat, the original book never quite allowed its conflicted hero to fully own his sexuality. Jones\u2019s show corrects for that, cementing the connection between Rice\u2019s brooding, sexually fluid vampires and the millions of queer fans that have seen themselves reflected in the pages of Rice\u2019s books all along.\n\nSuch bold efforts to reinvent the story for a new era might well raise hackles among Rice\u2019s fans, some of whom may decry the changes as unnecessary capitulations to a modern \u201cwoke\u201d sensibility that seems far away from the unapologetically hedonistic worldview at the core of Rice\u2019s books. Yet even the most hardcore Rice lovers will find themselves hard-pressed to complain about the way the series leans hard into the power of Rice\u2019s literary gifts.\n\nBlessed by its episodic long-form narrative with the ability to take its time, the show gives us lengthy, rapturous sequences in which the author\u2019s lushly romantic, searing and passionate prose \u2013 or language inspired by it \u2013 becomes the main attraction. It\u2019s here where the qualities that made Rice\u2019s vampire books speak so thrillingly to its readers are allowed to work their magic on viewing audiences, too; though the story\u2019s more concrete elements \u2013 the meticulous evocation of its period setting, the lurid abandon of its sexuality, the merciless savagery of its horrors \u2013 all do their part in bringing us to the table, it\u2019s these florid, rapturous stretches of narration accompanying the visuals, spoken with mellifluous and impassioned conviction by Anderson, that allow us to partake of the feast being served there. In the poetry of these passages, we are drawn into the vampire\u2019s world, and we are transformed without even having to be bitten.\n\nThat\u2019s not to say the show\u2019s imagery is not compelling in its own right \u2013 the climactic scene of episode one, a grand Guignol style symphony of gore that culminates in one of the most brazenly erotic moments in recent television memory, is alone enough not only to satisfy those who have come for the horror, but to make all but the most adamant Rice purists jump on board.\n\nLikewise, the acting defies disappointment. Anderson, at once earthier and more deeply sensitive than his role in \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d gave us reason to expect, delivers a Louis that commands our attention, our respect, and our compassion; and though Reid\u2019s shining Lestat remains just as much in his lover\u2019s shadow as required by their roles in the narrative, he leaves no doubt of his ability to project the rock-star flamboyance and \u201crebel angel\u201d fire required of his character in later installments of the chronicle. Rounding out the trio of main players (at least those we\u2019ve seen so far), Bogosian\u2019s world-weary, satchel-faced reporter makes a far more suitable stand-in for a 2022 audience than the naive youth of the book; cynical, mistrustful, yet somehow longing to be impressed, he\u2019s heard this tale before \u2013 but something inside him needs to hear it again.\n\nThat feeling is something with which Anne Rice fans should be well familiar; they\u2019ve been waiting decades for these beloved books to be adapted for the screen in a way that would do them justice. If the first two episodes of AMC\u2019s lavish and loving retelling of them are any indication \u2013 and trust us when we tell you that they are \u2013 they might finally be getting what they want.\n\nWe should all be grateful for that. After all, it\u2019s Halloween season, and sexy vampires are always welcome.", "images":
