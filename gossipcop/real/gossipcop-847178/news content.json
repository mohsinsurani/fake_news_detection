Our deepest apologies\u2026 #fyrefestival \u2014 Ja Rule (@Ruleyork) April 30, 2017\n\nThe Fyre Festival, for which weekend tickets were sold at prices ranging from $1,000-$12,000, was slated to include artists like Blink-182, Migos, and Major Lazer. Created by Ja Rule and entrepreneur Billy McFarland, the festival promised luxury living conditions and cuisine for attendees, with the most expensive ticket packages offering private tours and yacht rides.\n\nAlso Read: 5 More Charitable Ways Fyre Festival Attendees Could Have Spent Their $12,000\n\nInstead, festival goers flooded the internet with pictures and stories of a half-finished festival site with poorly-constructed disaster relief tents, haphazard luggage handling, ham sandwiches served in take-out cartons, and staff that had been left in the dark with no instructions from festival organizers.\n\nShortly after guests arrived, Blink-182 cancelled, citing doubts they could provide \u201cthe quality of performances we always give fans.\u201d\n\nOn Friday, Ja Rule posted a statement on social media saying that the festival was \u201cnot a scam\u201d and that he was \u201cheartbroken\u201d at what had happened in the Bahamas.\n\nAlso Read: 'Heartbroken' Ja Rule Says His Disastrous Fyre Festival 'Not a Scam'\n\n\u201cI truly apologize as this is NOT MY FAULT,\u201d he wrote, \u201cbut I\u2019m taking responsibility. I\u2019m deeply sorry to everyone who was inconvenienced by this.\u201d\n\nIn addition, an apology was issued Sunday from the official Fyre Festival Twitter account. The Bahamas Tourism board also issued a statement of their own on Friday. Both statements can be read below.\n\n#FyreFestival is a dream & vision we poured our hearts & souls into creating, 2017 fell dramatically short of even modest expectations \u2014 Fyre Festival (@fyrefestival) April 30, 2017\n\nWe\u2019re heartbroken that we let down all the guests who put their faith in us (con\u2019t) \u2014 Fyre Festival (@fyrefestival) April 30, 2017\n\nTo our guests and staff\u2013thank you again for your all patience as we navigate our next steps.
