They headed to the restaurant after spending the morning visiting Croke Park and Trinity College, where massive crowds were there to greet them. Lunch, then, was a moment for peace and quiet; the venue was closed to the public so that the royals could enjoy their meal in peace.\n\n\u201cThe booking was made some time ago, and they had pre-ordered their meals,\u201d manager Grace Davis told Vanity Fair. \u201cThey had the smoked salmon starter. Meghan had the hake for her main course; Harry had the lamb. They had planned to have dessert too, but said they were too full by the end of their meal. So they just had what we call our 3fe Dublin roasted coffee. They seemed to love it\u2014it was empty plates all around. They even shared a half-pint of Guinness, and Harry had a Coke.\u201d\n\nMeghan is a self-confessed foodie and loves to eat out. While a quick lunch on the go is usually the order of the day for royal tours, the prince wanted to treat Meghan to an authentic Dublin experience, to mark the end of what has been a very successful\u2014and enjoyable\u2014tour.\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nThe couple were joined by British Ambassador to Ireland Robin Barnett and their team of Palace aides, but ate alone on leather seats in the restaurant\u2019s snug, which is tucked away at the back of the restaurant close to the kitchen.\n\n\u201cThey were very warm and friendly and very happy together,\u201d Davis said.\u201cThis was their only downtime on the tour, and they were chatting the whole time over lunch. They were also very engaging, and both of them popped into the kitchen to see our chef, Dermot Staunton. Harry told him, \u2018I hear it\u2019s the best food in Ireland,\u2019 and Dermot told him it was, but that he is biased.\u201d\n\nAfter lunch, the couple headed to the Famine Memorial and the Epic museum to learn about the stories of the country\u2019s 10 million emigrants. They also visited a co-working space for technology start-ups.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/623a28a1e700ab34afc82b7f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/625d833d330189422634d876/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/VF0522_Royals_Camilla.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62100dc174854b6731411914/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6328d4009abfd8a85cba4488/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62fe7ae3f9f2d6c81700a52c/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/A_Headshots_KatieNicholl_Revise.png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5baa7218b2ab083a47a5bf49/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Markle-Black-Dress.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62b1dbeafa5c67611b2c4679/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/prince-william-40th-birthday.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b45ecc7dd00b90bb2b15968/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/harry-meghan-ireland-day-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bb4d4f4e5ae6a094d0019c5/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Markle-All-Green.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5ba93e3787834306acdc6688/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Meghan-Markle-Blue-Shirt.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6328d4009abfd8a85cba4488/16:9/w_748%2Cc_limit/Oct2022-New-Royals-Opener.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61bb68208185dc60dfd416d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b45ecc8dd00b90bb2b1596a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-harry-meghan-ireland-day-2.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5b45ecc8dd00b90bb2b1596a/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/t-harry-meghan-ireland-day-2.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Katie Nicholl", "September", "April", "June"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2018/07/harry-meghan-secret-romantic-lunch-dublin", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Were \u201cVery Happy Together\u201d at a Secret, Romantic Lunch in Dublin", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "\u201cIt was empty plates all around.
