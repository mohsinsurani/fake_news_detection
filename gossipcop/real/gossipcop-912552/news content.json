Don\u2019t try to recreate them or think that\u2019s what you\u2019ve got to aim for. There\u2019s a lot of fakeness online so don\u2019t worry about that.\u201d\n\nPrince William, the Duke of Cambridge, interacts with students taking part in an assembly on cyberbullying and its effect on young people's mental health.

He acknowledged that teens today face a lot of pressure, from maintaining friendships and their grades to combatting challenges thrown at them on the internet.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s a lot,\u201d he said. \u201cYou must be aware of that, it\u2019s a lot of pressure. There\u2019s so many things going on. You\u2019re going to be bamboozled.\u201d\n\nThe visit, hosted by YouTube influencer Dan Howell, reflected the prince\u2019s longstanding work on mental health with the Heads Together campaign he created with his brother, Prince Harry, and William's wife, Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge.\n\nThe Duke surprised pupils from @ArkBDA and Kensington Aldridge Academy to talk about Stop Speak Support, a digital code that helps young people navigate life online. pic.twitter.com/YI10UqVppH \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) February 8, 2018\n\nPrince William warned students at the school that limiting their time on the internet could provide a big boost to their mental well-being.\n\n\u201cFor your mental health, get outside, come away from the screen,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s important that you balance the time.\u201d\n\nAfter the assembly, The Duke and @professorgreen spoke to pupils who've taken part in workshops focused on the issue of cyberbullying, which use the Stop Speak Support lesson plan developed by @NSPCC, @ABAonline & @DianaAward. pic.twitter.com/lvWfpOUJc5 \u2014 Kensington Palace (@KensingtonRoyal) February 8, 2018\n\nThe prince also encouraged boys to be talk about their feelings whenever possible.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re not very good at talking about our emotions and how we feel,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve really got to work hard on being able to talk to friends, family, and trusted people about how we feel.\u201d\n\nWilliam, the Duke of Cambridge, has been open about how he and his brother failed to talk to each other enough when they were younger about their feelings while coping with the devastating loss of their mother, Princess Diana.\n\nThe duke is the father to both a son, 4-year-old Prince George, and 2-year-old daughter, Princess Charlotte. He is expecting another child in April.", "images":
