She stated in them: \"[I'm] very happy to share with all of you my new single 'Me enamor\u00e9.' This song narrates a moment in my life when I was so in love that I was literally climbing trees\".[6]\n\nComposition [ edit ]\n\n\"Me Enamor\u00e9\" tells the story of when she fell in love with her former partner Gerard Piqu\u00e9, whom she met in 2010 on the set of the music video for \"Waka Waka (This Time For Africa)\", the official song of the 2010 FIFA World Cup.[4]\n\nMusic video [ edit ]\n\nThe \"Me Enamor\u00e9\" official lyric video was released via Shakira's Vevo the day of the release of the song.
