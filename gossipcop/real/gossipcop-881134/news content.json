The Duchess of Cambridge and soon-to-be mother of three provided a brief introduction for a new short children's film on the subject, titled \"Talking Mental Health.\"\n\n\"Mental health is how we feel and think,\" Middleton says in the intro. \"[It's] things that can't really be seen but that affect us every day, and talking about them can feel difficult.\"\n\nThe animated film was created by The Anna Freud National Centre for Children and Families, a U.K.-based mental health charity focused on children's care. \"[The video] helps us all talk about our mental health, what to say, and who to talk to when we have feelings that are too big to manage on our own,\" Middleton says.\n\nIn the film, kids (depicted as doodled thumbprints) introduce the concept of \"small feelings,\" or fleeting positive and negative emotions. Specifically, the kids discuss how they deal with unpleasant ones (reading, taking a bath, or eating KFC are suggested as classic cures). Then the film also delves into \"big feelings,\" and what kids should do if they feel like certain feelings are making it hard to move about their lives, like finding someone they trust to open up to.\n\nThese big feelings are ones that stick around too long\u2014and can affect our mental health and how we see the world, the film explains. Dealing with them usually requires the help of others. In that case, the cute thumb people show kids what to do if someone they care about needs to open up to them about their mental health struggles. It advises them to really give their friend their undivided attention and maybe even help them find a grown-up who has the resources to offer them more guidance.", "images": ["https://media.self.com/photos/6332207c10fa37a398143eef/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.64f3bdc15b1f321829f9f30c7853a1469f469d71.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/633e080b717525ceacc174b7/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/63334b99823d7dd65973d60d/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6317bcab5b1d16f56fbd9335/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631f536e4e301404d3de20d8/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/59c17b836371dc178cdd6bee/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/kate-film.jpg", "https://media.self.com/photos/632b6342a2a2fe159be3322d/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/6329f6d8c7e95cd388ba913f/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/633f23a9e1963cdc0acd737e/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/63407b5238618ec3e4a542ad/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/59c13be2da2b6e71be38f8c5/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/kate%2520middleton.jpg", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.22fddcfca2f2de42711a84ec66a5157a9995d8ab.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/632373ff74314293c0851a1b/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59c17b836371dc178cdd6bee/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/kate-film.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Molly Horan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/kate-middleton-talking-mental-health-film", "title": "Kate Middleton Introduces a Mental Health Film About Paying Attention to 'Small Feelings'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Kate Middleton is featured in the introduction of a new short children's film that explains the concept of mental health to young viewers.", "id": "59c137cb684cd1140df34d9a", "keywords": "kate middleton,mental health,depression,anxiety,news", "news_keywords": "kate middleton,mental health,depression,anxiety,news", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59c137cb684cd1140df34d9a", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Kate Middleton is featured in the introduction of a new short children's film that explains the concept of mental health to young viewers.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59c13be2da2b6e71be38f8c5/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/kate%20middleton.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59c13be2da2b6e71be38f8c5/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/kate%20middleton.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "She's delivering an important message.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59c17b836371dc178cdd6bee/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/kate-film.jpg", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Kate Middleton Introduces a Film About Kids' Mental Health", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/kate-middleton-talking-mental-health-film"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-09-19T16:46:41.023Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-19T16:46:41.023Z", "author": "Molly Horan"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "She's delivering an important message.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59c17b836371dc178cdd6bee/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/kate-film.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "Kate Middleton Introduces a Film About Kids' Mental Health"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505839601.023, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
