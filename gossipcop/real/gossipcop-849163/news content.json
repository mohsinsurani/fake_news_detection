The defendants had filed a motion in January seeking $220,000, which Simmons' lawyers criticized as a \"billing fiesta.\"\n\nSimmons sued the media outlets in May 2017 after they ran articles claiming he is transgender. A June 2016 cover of the National Enquirer, for example, read: \u201cRichard Simmons: He\u2019s Now a Woman.\u201d In his lawsuit, Simmons claimed the outlets published the stories with \u201ccalculated malice.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis case is about a particularly egregious and hurtful campaign of defamations and privacy invasions, falsely asserting that Mr. Simmons is transitioning from a male to a female, including 'shocking sex surgery,' breast implants, hormone treatments and consultations on medical castrations,\u201d Simmons' lawsuit stated.\n\nWhile the National Enquirer stated on its website that its reporting on Simmons was based on \"credible sources,\" Simmons, in his lawsuit, alleged that a former assistant, whom he said has \"blackmailed, extorted and stalked\" him, was responsible for the false claims.\n\nRichard Simmons' defamation suit against Enquirer being thrown out.
