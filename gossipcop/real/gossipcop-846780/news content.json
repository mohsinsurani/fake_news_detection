Yeah, the release date announcement video is less than 20 seconds and just scans an abandoned mess hall in the prison. But we\u2019re willing to overlook the lack of action now that we know when the sixth installment will drop.\n\nIt\u2019s been almost a year since we saw the ladies of Litchfield and, based on the one line of dialogue we get in the clip, we can tell you we\u2019re entering a whole new world with them when they return. Well, at least that\u2019s what Piper (Taylor Schilling) says and based on where we left things last year, its safe to say the times are a changin\u2019.\n\nAlso Read: 'Orange Is the New Black' Star

saw Piper, Alex (Laura Prepon) and Nicky (Natasha Lyonne), holed up in Frieda\u2019s bunker that had just been turned over by CERT officers, while the rest of the penitentiary\u2019s inmates were loaded up on buses and shipped out to new prisons.\n\n\u201cOITNB\u201d is produced by Lionsgate and also stars Laverne Cox, Uzo Aduba, Danielle Brooks and Dascha Palanco.\n\nWatch the teaser
