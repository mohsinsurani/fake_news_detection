While Van Gundy\u2019s fellow analysts were talking about the play, all he could do was marvel that Rihanna had just walked by him.\n\nBut the fun didn\u2019t stop there. Rihanna, a longtime super fan of James, got into the spirit of the game by bowing to King James and then pettily dabbing on a Dubs fan.\n\nIt appears she took her investment in the competition between the Cavs and the Warriors very seriously by taunting the Warriors\u2019 Kevin Durant while he was making free throws. It looks like KD didn\u2019t really appreciate it.\n\nEven though her favorite King James didn\u2019t take home a win that night, one thing is certain: Rihanna is the real MVP.\n\nWrite to Cady Lang at cady.lang@timemagazine.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-history-movies-01.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/nsync-joey-fatone.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rihanna-kevin-durant-nba-finals.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rihanna-kevin-durant-nba-finals.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cady Lang"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4802935/rihanna-nba-finals/", "title": "Rihanna Won the NBA Finals by Dabbing", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Noted basketball enthusiast Rihanna stole the show at the first game of the NBA Finals, where she not only taunted KD but dabbed on a fan.", "og": {"title": "Rihanna Dabs and Heckles at the First Game of the NBA Finals", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4802935/rihanna-nba-finals/", "description": "We all know who the real MVP of this game was", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rihanna-kevin-durant-nba-finals.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4802935/rihanna-nba-finals/", "description": "Noted basketball enthusiast Rihanna stole the show at the first game of the NBA Finals, where she not only taunted KD but dabbed on a fan.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rihanna-kevin-durant-nba-finals.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4802935/rihanna-nba-finals/", "title": "Rihanna Dabs and Heckles at the First Game of the NBA Finals", "description": "We all know who the real MVP of this game was", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/rihanna-kevin-durant-nba-finals.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
