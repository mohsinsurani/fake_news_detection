As a husband, a son, and future father, I do not condone any kind of mistreatment of women.\u201d\n\nThe fallout was swift for Hardwick, who has hosted several aftershows to popular AMC series, including \u201cTalking Dead\u201d (about \u201cThe Walking Dead\u201d), \u201cTalking Bad\u201d (about \u201cBreaking Bad\u201d) and \u201cTalking Saul\u201d (about \u201cBetter Call Saul\u201d).\n\nAMC announced it had suspended his show, \u201cTalking with Chris Hardwick,\u201d while it assesses the accusations against him and said Hardwick would step aside from moderating AMC and BBC America panels at Comic-Con International in San Diego next month.\n\nDykstra said in her statement that going public has opened her eyes and she is hopeful it will help others.\n\n\u201cIt is my hope, and it always was, that women and men on both sides of abuse will make changes to either protect themselves or to stop the cycle of pain their own behavior can cause. These behaviors are insidious and often hard to spot,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWe make excuses for them and, bit by bit, we can lose ourselves entirely.\u201d\n\nCNN has reached out to Hardwick\u2019s representatives for comment on this story.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/140929104601-lisa-france-profile-image.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_898,w_1596,c_crop/h_270,w_480/c_thumb,g_face,w_100,h_100", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180617115804-chris-hardwick-chloe-dykstra.jpg?q=x_3,y_146,h_1841,w_3273,c_crop/w_800"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180617115804-chris-hardwick-chloe-dykstra.jpg?q=x_3,y_146,h_1841,w_3273,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lisa Respers France"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/entertainment/chloe-dykstra-chris-hardwick-statement/index.html", "title": "Chloe Dykstra speaks out after Chris Hardwick denial", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Chloe Dykstra speaks out after Chris Hardwick denial | CNN", "description": "Chloe Dykstra is speaking out after her ex-boyfriend, TV host Chris Hardwick, denied allegations he sexually and emotionally abused her.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180617115804-chris-hardwick-chloe-dykstra.jpg?q=x_3,y_146,h_1841,w_3273,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2018/06/21/entertainment/chloe-dykstra-chris-hardwick-statement/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Chloe Dykstra speaks out after Chris Hardwick denial | CNN", "description": "Chloe Dykstra is speaking out after her ex-boyfriend, TV host Chris Hardwick, denied allegations he sexually and emotionally abused her.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/180617115804-chris-hardwick-chloe-dykstra.jpg?q=x_3,y_146,h_1841,w_3273,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNNent"}, "description": "Chloe Dykstra is speaking out after her ex-boyfriend, TV host Chris Hardwick, denied allegations he sexually and emotionally abused her.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "entertainment", "theme": "entertainment", "article": {"published_time": "2018-06-21T18:16:21Z", "modified_time": "2018-06-21T18:16:21Z", "tag": "crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, sex and gender issues, sex crimes, sexual assault, society", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, sex and gender issues, sex crimes, sexual assault, society", "author": "Lisa Respers France", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1529535600.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
