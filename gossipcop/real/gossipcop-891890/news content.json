When the season begins, its mentioned that he died in his sleep and we see photos of Robin Wright\u2019s Claire Underwood, now president, looking at her dead husband\u2019s casket. But here\u2019s what happened, as far as we know:\n\nAfter Claire declined Frank\u2019s phone call in the Oval Office (when Season 5 ended, she was supposed to pardon him for, well, all that stuff he did over the course of the series), she mentions to the camera it was the last time they spoke. Two months later, Frank storms into the White House, furious at Claire for not giving him the pardon she promises she would. Scared, Claire locked herself in her room and found Frank dead in his bed the next morning. She told the public they were both in that bed. And, privately, she believes he was murdered.\n\nAlso Read: Here's Everything Coming to and Leaving Netflix in November\n\nAn autopsy revealed he died from an overdose from his liver medication, which Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly) claims is something he wouldn\u2019t do by accident.\n\nAnd, of course, it wasn\u2019t an accident, though what exactly happened isn\u2019t revealed until the very last scene of the series. It turned out that Frank was murdered by Doug, who mixed up the medication. Doug says that he killed Frank because Frank was going to murder Claire for not following through on her promise. As Doug explains it, \u201cI had to protect the legacy from the man.\u201d\n\nThe idea here throughout the season is that Doug Stamper is obsessed with protecting Frank\u2019s reputation above all else. While everybody else is scheming nonstop and jockeying for power, Doug is constantly switching sides as he tries to figure out which side will actually prevent Frank\u2019s name from being dragged through the mud.\n\nAlso Read: 'Sabrina': Biggest Differences Between Netflix Series' Premiere and Comics Issue #1\n\nAnd he murdered Frank for exactly that reason. If Frank were to murder Claire there\u2019s almost no way he would have been able to get away with it, and would thus would be remembered almost entirely for having done that. So Doug had to kill him.\n\nSpacey was fired from the Netflix series last December, following multiple accusations of sexual assault. Netflix also dropped Spacey\u2019s film \u201cGore,\u201d on famous writer Gore Vidal, in the wake of the accusations. Though he\u2019s obviously never seen \u2014 even the photos of Clair looking at his casket don\u2019t show his face, and Frank made audio diaries that are mentioned often but never heard \u2014 Frank Underwood\u2019s presence as the show\u2019s lead for the first five seasons is felt throughout the final season.\n\nIn fact, much of what Claire has to deal with as president is weathering the fallout from all the political deals Frank made while president. This is especially apparent with the Shepherds (Greg Kinnear and Diane Lane), who serve as the season\u2019s main antagonists after Claire won\u2019t honor deals they made with Frank.\n\nThe sixth and final season of \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d is now available on Netflix.", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png",
