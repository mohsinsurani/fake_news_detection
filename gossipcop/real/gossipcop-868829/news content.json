There is one specific character meeting that we have been looking forward to, for quite a while now, and in today\u2019s episode, the third episode of Season 7, titled \u201cThe Queen\u2019s Justice\u201c, we finally got it. Jon Snow, and Daenerys Targaryen have finally met, and this meeting has the whole fandom in a frenzy!\n\nNow, as we know, Jon Snow is technically Daenerys Targaryen\u2019s nephew, but neither of them know that yet. Jon Snow travels south to Dragonstone, to meet Daenerys, since she summons him, and because Dragonstone has a large supply of Dragonglass, which is something Jon needs to arm his people against the Army of the Dead. Naturally, the first meeting of the two excited us all. Here are some of the best fan reactions :\n\nCan I say how excited I am for Jon & Daenerys to meet tonight?
