{"url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042/http://theoffice.wikia.com:80/wiki/A.A.R.M.", "text": "\"A.A.R.M.\" is the twenty-second/twenty-third episode of the ninth season of the American television comedy series \"The Office\" and is the show's 198th/199th episode overall. It aired on May 9, 2013.\n\nAs the office readies for the premiere of the documentary that night, Jim convinces Dwight, who is planning to propose to Esther, that he needs an Assistant to the Assistant Regional Manager, and holds tryouts to find the best candidate. Angela brings her baby to work after her daycare turns her away. Meanwhile, Andy attends auditions for \"The Next Great A Cappella Sensation.\"\n\nSynopsis Edit\n\nJim convinces Dwight that he needs to choose someone to act as an Assistant to the Assistant to the Regional Manager (A.A.R.M.); the two subsequently hold tryouts for the position. The tryouts consist of several office oriented challenges and it is found, through Jim's scheming, that Dwight is the most qualified for the newly founded A.A.R.M. position. Angela is forced to bring her kid, Phillip, to work, after her daycare turns her child away. Dwight, who initially wanted to marry his current girlfriend Esther, begins to think that Angela's son is actually his. He confronts her, but she tells him that this is not the case. Dwight then confers with Jim, who tells Dwight that if he truly loves Angela then that's who he should pursue. Dwight makes up his mind and proposes to Angela, who says yes. Angela finally reveals to Dwight that Phillip is indeed his son.\n\nMeanwhile, Darryl returns to Scranton, after quietly quitting a week ago to work full-time at Athlead, the sports marketing company that Jim founded. When the others spot him, they are upset that he left without saying goodbye and demand to spend some time with him in one way or another before he leaves for good. The office ultimately decides on one final dance together.\n\nWhen Darryl runs into Pam, he tells her about the company's success and how Jim is missing out by staying in Scranton. Pam begins to worry that she is making Jim do something that he does not want to do. She later confronts her husband and admits that she thinks she might not be good enough for him; he tries to tell her that she is the most important thing in his life. Later, he decides to get the documentary crew's help; the crew makes a DVD of many of the highlights of Jim and Pam's relationship throughout the series. The final scene is from the second season Christmas episode (Christmas Party) in which Jim gives Pam a teapot as a gift, but takes back his very emotional note that expresses his feelings for Pam before she notices it. After the DVD plays, Jim presents Pam with the actual, unopened note. She reads it, and the two happily embrace.\n\nMeanwhile, Andy auditions for The Next Great A Cappella Sensation. Andy meets an exuberant and like-minded lady. However, before he is able to try-out in front of the judges\u2014who include Aaron Rodgers, Clay Aiken, and Santigold\u2014the auditions close, and Andy makes a fool of himself. Dejected, he journeys to Poor Richard's Pub, where he meets the rest of his former office workers. Altogether, the office watches the official airing of the documentary on PBS' Scranton affiliate station, WVIA-TV. As the office workers stare at the screen, the audience hears the opening dialogue from the series' first episode, \"Pilot\".\n\nCultural references Edit\n\nConnections to previous episodes Edit\n\nErrors Edit\n\nPhillip is seen as a baby two episodes ago yet was acted by a toddler in the episode.\n\nAngela admits she lied about Phillip not being Dwight's baby however Dwight was informed of the opposite by a geneticist in the episode New Guys. (Greg Daniels explained that they shot but cut a scene in which it is explained that Dwight grabbed the wrong diaper.)\n\nAmusing details/Trivia Edit\n\nCast Edit\n\nMain Cast Edit\n\nSupporting Cast Edit\n\nGuest Cast Edit\n\nGallery Edit", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130513003212/theoffice/images/thumb/b/bd/The-Office-AARM_09.jpg/500px-The-Office-AARM_09.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel/p-8bG6eLqkH6Avk.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130513003212/theoffice/images/thumb/b/bd/The-Office-AARM_09.jpg/250px-The-Office-AARM_09.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIABAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAEALAAAAAABAAEAQAICTAEAOw%3D%3D", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://a.wikia-beacon.com/__track/view?c=1573&lc=en&lid=75&x=theoffice&y=c1&u=0&ip=54.205.226.133&a=12196&s=oasis&n=0&nojs=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://images1.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb4/theoffice/images/8/89/Wiki-wordmark.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://b.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6177433&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c7=http%3A%2F%2Ftheoffice.wikia.com%2Fwiki%2FA.A.R.M.%3Fcomscorekw%3Dwikiacsid_entertainment&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://slot1.images.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb62322/common/skins/common/images/magnify-clip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://images3.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20091222015029/theoffice/images/thumb/b/bc/Wiki.png/20px-Wiki.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130513003212/theoffice/images/thumb/b/bd/The-Office-AARM_09.jpg/500px-The-Office-AARM_09.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042/http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/A.A.R.M.", "title": "A.A.R.M.", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=1200", "generator": "MediaWiki 1.19.7", "keywords": "Dunderpedia: The Office Wiki,theoffice,A.A.R.M.,Season 9,Livin' the Dream,Finale,Jim Halpert,Dwight Schrute,Angela Martin,Darryl Philbin,Pam,Christmas Party,Andy Bernard", "description": "A.A.R.M Season Episode 9 22/23 Production Code 9022/9023 Airdate May 9, 2013 Written by Brent...", "google-site-verification": "o5CyVGmHVpO4QI5b53oL4Daza4oP4zlqAV7cDT4G-TA", "fb": {"app_id": 112328095453510}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Dunderpedia: The Office Wiki", "title": "A.A.R.M.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042im_/http://images4.wikia.nocookie.net/__cb20130513003212/theoffice/images/thumb/b/bd/The-Office-AARM_09.jpg/500px-The-Office-AARM_09.jpg", "description": "A.A.R.M Season Episode 9 22/23 Production Code 9022/9023 Airdate May 9, 2013 Written by Brent...", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20131018011042/http://theoffice.wikia.com/wiki/A.A.R.M."}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=623705389"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
