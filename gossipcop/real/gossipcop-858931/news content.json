(Note: spoilers abound below, so proceed with caution if you haven\u2019t yet watched \u201cThe Book of Nora.\u201d)\n\nLindelof had long tempered expectations about the finale, telling The Hollywood Reporter last year when he was writing the final script that The Leftovers is in no way a mystery-solving show. \u201cIf the takeaway from Lost was that there was a disgruntled portion of the fan base that said, \u2018You did not give satisfactory answers to the mysteries,\u2019 then I feel somewhat liberated with The Leftovers because that\u2019s off the table,\u201d he said at the time.\n\nBut in an emotional monologue that concludes the third and final season of the thought-provoking drama, Carrie Coon\u2019s character Nora Durst actually provides one possible answer to what happened to the 2 percent of the population that suddenly departed years ago. Whether or not she\u2019s telling the truth is up for debate.\n\nSeated across from an aged Kevin (Justin Theroux), Nora explains that years earlier she got into a machine that transported her to a parallel earth where the departed now live. It was the closure she\u2019d always longed for \u2014 except that when she found her three children and husband, it was apparent that they were happy and had moved on with their lives. Realizing there was no place for her in their world, she had the creator of the machine send her back home.\n\n\u201cI knew that if I told you what happened that you would never believe me,\u201d Nora tells Kevin as she finishes her poignant tale. \u201cI believe you,\u201d Kevin assures her, tears streaming down his face. \u201cYou do?\u201d she asks incredulously. \u201cWhy wouldn\u2019t I believe you? You\u2019re here,\u201d he responds before reaching out to grab his former wife\u2019s hand. \u201cI\u2019m here,\u201d Nora echoes, her mouth slowing turning upward into a smile.\n\nAnd with that, The Leftovers concluded its story, leaving the credibility of Nora\u2019s account open to interpretation. \u201cI definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don\u2019t believe her story,\u201d says Lindelof, \u201cand then for a lot of people, it won\u2019t even occur to them to disbelieve it.\u201d\n\nAhead of the finale\u2019s debut, THR chatted with Lindelof about why not revealing the fates of certain characters would be a \u201ctravesty,\u201d the questions he doesn\u2019t want to have to answer about the finale and whether or not he personally believes Nora (hint: he really wants to).\n\nNow that people have gotten a chance to watch the finale, what\u2019s the most surprising question you\u2019re getting about it?\n\nI can\u2019t explain why it is surprising to me \u2014 I mean, I could explain it but I\u2019m not going to \u2014 is why didn\u2019t we show the story that Nora is telling as she\u2019s telling it?\n\nWas that ever a consideration in the writers room?\n\nIt was something that was discussed very early on when we first were talking about the ending of the series, but once the storytelling process began and scripts started getting written, we landed on the idea of this season, if not the series, being about people telling stories. And, more important, people telling stories that would either give themselves a degree of comfort or that they believed would give comfort to others. That tradition goes all the way back to season one with Matt at the pulpit, and in season two, with Tom [Chris Zylka] speaking in front of the ex-guilty members like AA meetings, saying that he can give magic hugs. So, there\u2019s always been a tradition on the show of characters delivering monologues that are fantastical or believable or unbelievable stories, with themselves at the center of those stories. They\u2019re told in the first person, and it was sort of like, \u201cOh, yeah, how could we not end the series with Carrie Coon doing that?\u201d\n\nWhen did you know that this is how you wanted to end the show?\n\nVery early on. The holdover writers from season two got together in January, and all we talked about was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the last scene of the finale, and when and where does the finale take place? And what are the things we want to resolve definitively, and what are the things that we\u2019re OK not resolving definitively, etc.\u201d They were both esoteric, enthymematic conversations and then they became much more directed toward the scene we ended up with and we explored different permutations. It was always going to be that Nora tells the story of going through, but there were a couple different permutations of who she was telling that story to \u2014 and then it became very obvious to us that it had to be Kevin. That was locked in before we even started breaking the season premiere.\n\nWho were the others that you considered for her telling the story to?\n\nErika Murphy was a contender, and then a grown-up version of Lily who would be maybe a 19- or 20-year-old young woman at the time that this would be taking place. Those were really the only other two contenders, other than Kevin.\n\nAnd how did you land on it being Kevin?\n\nWell, it isn\u2019t to say that Kevin isn\u2019t an incredibly important character in The Leftovers \u2014 of course he is \u2014 but I think the idea is that the third and final season was just as much about Nora\u2019s journey as it was about Kevin\u2019s. His journey would resolve in the penultimate episode and then her journey would resolve in the finale. And that\u2019s inevitable for us because she just lost so much more. He\u2019s been suffering in this kind of existential way. He feels like he\u2019s a coward and he feels like he wanted to escape his family. There\u2019s a part of him that will not allow himself to be vulnerable enough to form real connections with people. Those are important but more esoteric, emotional and internal issues. Nora lost her kids and her husband. Of course, he was cheating on her, so f\u2014 that guy, but she had a much more tangible thing that she lost. All along we promised that we were never going to resolve where the departed people went, but at the same time, here we are flirting with disaster because this season feels like Nora\u2019s entire story starts with someone coming to her and saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a device you can get to inside that is going to transport you to be with those people again.\u201d It seems to be teasing the audience if we told you that we\u2019re never going to resolve where everybody went, and yet Nora is walking down that path with increasingly and rapidly escalating footsteps. So, how are we going to thread that needle? And now you\u2019ve seen how we\u2019ve tried. Whether or not the thread went through the eye perfectly is anyone\u2019s guess, but I\u2019m really happy and proud. I feel like we did not violate the spirit of The Leftovers by doing what we did.\n\nYou offered a bit more closure in the end than you initially let on that you might, although the question of whether or not Nora is telling the truth is left unanswered. How do you think her story will be received by viewers?\n\nAll I\u2019m really willing to say on the subject of that without being like frustratingly and pretentiously obtuse is that Nora told the story. She told the story. I definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don\u2019t believe her story, and then for a lot of people, it won\u2019t even occur to them to disbelieve it. That\u2019s why the answer to the question, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we show Nora\u2019s journey?\u201d is that because if we showed it, it would be undeniable that it were true. Yet, even in shows like The OA, where the whole basis of the series is the characters telling the tale and we are, in fact, seeing that tale unwind, the show is still asking the question, \u201cIs she making all of this up?\u201d For a show that\u2019s based around the idea of belief and the idea that belief can actually bring a tremendous amount of emotional healing and the lack of belief can bring a lot of emotional pain, what is true and what is authentic and what matters \u2014those are all themes and ideas that were in Tom\u2019s book that we tried to bring to the series. I feel like Nora\u2019s story is the culmination of all those ideas.\n\nDo you believe Nora?\n\nWell, I want to believe her. Let me just put it to you that way. I want to believe her. That\u2019s the most honest answer I can give you.\n\nWere the show\u2019s writers divided on how they felt about Nora\u2019s story?\n\nYeah, I mean, we\u2019re still discussing it. From when we first talked about it at the beginning of the season to when we talked about it again when we were actually writing the finale to the script of the finale being written and then sitting in the editing room. Once I had a cut that I wanted all the writers to see, they came in and all I\u2019ll say is that people changed their minds once they saw Carrie do it. Both ways. And I would ask you another question. Let\u2019s say that I said one thing like, \u201cI don\u2019t believe Nora\u2019s story,\u201d and Carrie Coon says, \u201cI one-thousand percent believe Nora\u2019s story.\u201d Then which is true? Whose intention wins? And what about what [director] Mimi Leder thinks? The reality is that Carrie and Mimi and I never had the conversation that you and I are having now, quite purposefully. We wanted to let Carrie make the choice that felt right to her. I saw her last night and we still haven\u2019t talked about. I haven\u2019t said to her, \u201cCarrie, do you think it\u2019s true?\u201d I don\u2019t want to know what her answer to that question is. You can ask her. But I don\u2019t know. She still hasn\u2019t seen it, by the way.\n\nWhat did she add to the finale as an actor that wasn\u2019t on the page?\n\nThere\u2019s just an incredible amount of intelligence and depth in Carrie as a human being that always translates to Nora in her performance. And while I\u2019m not entirely always sure I can tell what Nora\u2019s thinking, I know that she is thinking \u2014 and she\u2019s thinking about a lot of different things. You can almost feel the subtle, silent moments with her, when the camera\u2019s just holding on her face in terms of what she\u2019s thinking and it\u2019s much more intense than just like, \u201cShe\u2019s in distress,\u201d or, \u201cShe\u2019s confused.\u201d I don\u2019t have a stopwatch but what I think is interesting about this finale is that it\u2019s a 70-minute episode and there may be as much as 20 minutes of the episode where Carrie is onscreen saying absolutely nothing, where she\u2019s not speaking at all. That\u2019s how compelling her performance is. Like, you take a scene of when she goes up the hill to free the goat from the fence, and because Carrie is such an amazing actor, you know exactly why she\u2019s doing that, how she feels about this, why she\u2019s putting the beads around her neck. Maybe you can\u2019t articulate that into words, but it emotionally makes sense just because of Carrie\u2019s performance. And she\u2019s also kind of not afraid to be the butt of the joke. When she\u2019s on the phone with Laurie [Amy Brenneman], and Lori is saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re calling me to tell you that it\u2019s OK to go with Kevin to the dance, that\u2019s fine. You can go.\u201d And she\u2019s just like, \u201cI do not want to go to the f\u2014ing dance!\u201d It\u2019s really funny. Carrie has to know that that\u2019s a comedic reading, but Nora would not want to be laughed at in that instance \u2014 she\u2019s so frustrated. And that\u2019s what I think is really interesting, for someone who is so clearly in control of her own life, she keeps doing these crazy things \u2014 whether it be hiring a prostitute to shoot her in the chest or getting the Wu-Tang tattoo or locking all the doors in her house as if Kevin is going to try to get in a window. She does all these irrational, unreasonable things, yet she seems completely and totally sane and under control when she\u2019s essentially behaving like a crazy person. I don\u2019t know how Carrie does that. I think that if you were to ask most people, \u201cDo you think that Nora Durst is crazy?\u201d They would say, \u201cWhat? No!\u201d But I would like to read you from the list of 10 things that Nora Durst has done and ask you that question again.\n\nWith such a sprawling ensemble cast, what made you move forward with a finale that was so predominantly about Nora and Kevin?\n\nI think that this was a love story. It\u2019s an oversimplification and it could feel a little bit trite, but it is the answer to your question. Obviously, I think from the moment that Kevin looks at Nora when she steps up to the podium and gives her speech in the pilot [it\u2019s there] because the Kevin-Nora romance was such an integral part of Tom\u2019s novel. We knew the final line of Tom\u2019s novel was, \u201cLook what I found,\u201d as Nora\u2019s holding a baby in her arms, and we knew that was going to be the final line of the first season of this show. So, if we\u2019re writing a show where basically the antagonist is not the Guilty Remnant, the antagonist is actually the fear and anxiety of losing the people that you love, and that fear and anxiety basically prevents you from forming new attachments because how could you ever fall in love with somebody and trust somebody not to leave you in a world where the departure could happen again at any moment? That wound would be the most intense and open and seething with Nora Durst, who basically was the statistical anomaly who lost her entire family. Again, it is overly simplistic and almost insulting to say the answer to profound loss is love because clearly that wasn\u2019t enough, right? I mean, she met Kevin, they were in love, they were together for many years, they thought that the problem was Mapleton so they moved to Miracle and, as Jill said, \u201cWherever you go, there you are.\u201d And they were in Miracle for a number of years, but the time has basically passed. It\u2019s seven years later but she\u2019s still getting tattoos with her kids\u2019 names on them. So, when Mark Linn-Baker shows up and tells her something that she\u2019s pretty convinced is a lie and a hoax, she still gets kind of sucked into it. This is a person who isn\u2019t OK. The ending of that journey had to basically say, how can Nora construct a narrative \u2014 whether true or untrue but at least a palatable, believable narrative \u2014 where she actually is reunited with her kids and then decides not to be with them or decides that she doesn\u2019t belong there anymore or that they\u2019ve moved on without her? You basically take that elephant, you get that elephant out of the room very gently, and now she feels so guilty about having gone in pursuit of that that she can\u2019t be with Kevin. And now, in classic rom-com structure, Kevin needs to come after her and pretend to be something he\u2019s not. He needs to create a counter-narrative that allows them to start talking about their lives without starting from the place where the most intense pain is. So, if he knocks on her door and she answers it says, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about what I said in the hotel room,\u201d there\u2019s nowhere to go. But by him saying, \u201cHey, all those things never happened, want to go to a dance?\u201d I think that that throws her back on her heels. But more importantly, it also uses the popular story beats of a rom-com or a romance even though the characters eventually have to confront the idea that we\u2019re not allowed to start over. This made for a very nice conversation at someone else\u2019s wedding, but now that we danced to Otis Redding, things have to get real. And they do.\n\nThis season, you\u2019ve been switching up the song that plays during the opening credits. Why did you decide to return to \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d for this last episode?\n\nWe knew we were going to be changing the theme song every week, and I definitely wanted to play the season one theme song over the season two images, and then I wanted to bring, \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d back one last time. I wasn\u2019t sure which was going to be which, so I thought maybe \u201cLet the Mystery Be,\u201d would be OK over the episode seven title sequence, and then the season-one theme song basically plays over the finale. But \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d didn\u2019t quite feel right for International Assassin 2, so we flipped them. I wanted there to be a little more of a warning label on the finale going in, which is just like, just to remind you for those of you coming to the end of the finale looking for some level of resolution, whatever that means to you, we\u2019re going to answer some things that we care about \u2014 I think it would have been a travesty did we not answer what the fate was of every major character that we cared about on the show. If, for example, we just never addressed what happened to Laurie when she went into the water, that would have been unconscionable. Or did Matt eventually succumb to his leukemia? Yes, he did. What happened to Kevin Sr.? What happened to Jill and Tom? What happened to the Murphys? We owed the answer to all those questions, but then there are going to be other areas [we don\u2019t answer.] One of the questions that keeps popping up is, \u201cI was kind of hoping you would explain why Kevin has the ability to die and come back to life,\u201d and I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed.\u201d Like, I don\u2019t know what else to say in response to that. But I also go, \u201cWhat does that explanation look like?\u201d I mean, it\u2019s almost like explaining why it is that Superman has powers. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s because he\u2019s from the planet Krypton and that\u2019s why he has powers on earth, because of our yellow sun.\u201d What is an explanation for why can Kevin die and come back to life? Who gives that explanation and what does it look like? We weren\u2019t touching that with a 10-foot pole \u2014 or a 20-foot ladder in our case.\n\nThe last words spoken in the show are Nora saying, \u201cI\u2019m here.\u201d What is the significance of that line?\n\nSeason one ended with her saying, \u201cLook what I found,\u201d and obviously those words have a meaning beyond the fact that she\u2019s just holding a baby in her arms. \u201cLook what I found,\u201d would seem to suggest that maybe she\u2019s found some purpose, maybe she\u2019s found a tether back to the world. When someone says, \u201cLook what I found,\u201d it\u2019s not just an object or a person, it\u2019s some kind of fundamental truth. And at the end of season two, Nora also has the last line, which is, \u201cYou are home.\u201d Well, that home is one that they\u2019ve really only occupied for three weeks or so. There isn\u2019t any furniture in it yet. But I think when she says, \u201cYou are home,\u201d she\u2019s like, look at all the people who are in this room. This is your home. But home is obviously an idea more than it is a physical place. We knew that Nora was going to have the last line of dialogue in the final season, and these are always very simple ideas, you know, \u201cLook what I found,\u201d and \u201cYou are home.\u201d So it\u2019s like we just started meditating and remembering that one of the things Kevin said back in the pilot when he was in the bar with the young mother who he doesn\u2019t realize is the woman who lost the baby, and he lifts up his beer and he says, \u201cHey, we\u2019re still here,\u201d and she says, \u201cWe sure are.\u201d And HBO actually put, \u201cWe\u2019re still here,\u201d as one of the taglines on the season one poster. I think \u201cstill here\u201d is actually kind of negative. It\u2019s as if someone was like, \u201cThe party is over,\u201d or, \u201cThe bar is emptied out.\u201d There\u2019s something kind of sad and pathetic, but when you eliminate the word \u201cstill,\u201d there\u2019s something very powerful about it because it\u2019s some indication of, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re here in this kitchen right now, looking in one-another\u2019s eyes, but we\u2019re also here \u2014 we\u2019re present, we\u2019re in the same space.\u201d Here means I\u2019m not longer my psyche, and my emotional being is no longer out there, wondering, searching for things that are there. I am here. That was wildly pretentious, but, again, you started it.\n\nEarly in the episode, we learn that Laurie [Amy Brenneman] is still alive. Was she ever really contemplating suicide?\n\nThe truth of the matter is that there was a real process of discovery for us as writers. I think that when we broke that story in the room, we were all pretty convinced that she had committed suicide. And then Amy Brenneman before she shot the scene was like, \u201cI kind of want to know if I\u2019m killing myself or not,\u201d and I said, \u201cI have to leave some space, but I think I\u2019m about 90 percent sure that she does.\u201d And Amy was like, \u201cOK, I got it. I\u2019m sad, but I got it.\u201d And then we got the dailies of that episode, of her going out there on the boat and playing the scene with Jill and Tom on the phone and then going into the water \u2014 and there was something really noble and heroic about all the choices that Amy was making. I\u2019ve never tried to kill myself and I think suicide is a very intense and complicated thing, but in my brain people who are about to kill themselves don\u2019t look like that. And so that was bothersome. Then we also made a discovery writing-wise. When Laurie\u2019s kids called her, why didn\u2019t she tell them that she was in Australia about to go scuba diving if it was her intention to kill herself? Because that\u2019s the elegance of what Nora pitched her, it\u2019s that people will think it was an accident. But if Tom and Jill were to find out, \u201cWait, we just called mom like half-an-hour before she went into the water and died in a scuba diving accident. Why didn\u2019t she tell us she was in Australia? Why was she going scuba diving on the anniversary of the departure?\u201d It wouldn\u2019t have accomplished what it set out to. So, the more we talked about it, the more we were forced to ask the question, what if Laurie went under the water and maybe it was her intention to potentially kill herself when she went in but when she was under she decided not to? Or maybe she went scuba diving as an affirmation of life \u2014 but, man, it sure feels like it makes more sense to us now both emotionally and narratively that she comes up out of the water. The other thing that happened was I watched that scene when Nora gives the speech about the beach ball, and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to squeeze the air out of the beach ball.\u201d Killing Laurie sort of felt that way. And maybe it\u2019s honest and beautiful and poetic and not everybody\u2019s going to make it, but after everything Laurie went through \u2014 from being in a loveless marriage to the unborn child inside her disappearing and holding that burden of not telling anybody for so long to joining the Guilty Remnant to leaving the Guilty Remnant to trying to write a book and failing miserably to remarrying John Murphy \u2014 should the end result of that be that she kills herself? It just didn\u2019t feel fair to the character. So, she came out of the water and she stayed Nora\u2019s shrink.\n\nWhere did the idea for the goat come from in the wedding scene?\n\nI feel like good finales bookend a series by calling back certain themes and motifs that are introduced in the pilot and are carried through the series. It\u2019s like these are the ingredients, the brief solos that you want to hear before the band leaves the stage. And one of the things The Leftovers is traded very heavily on is animals, and not \u201cspirit animals\u201d but animals as some sort of mystical, magical, interpretive kind of pseudo-religious thing for us to kind of pack all of our belief systems into. In the pilot, it was dogs and the stag, and we used a goat in season two that gets sacrificed. Certainly we used the lion to a very memorable effect in season three, and so we thought, should we return back to the dog idea? It didn\u2019t feel quite right. Kangaroos seem like the obvious way to go in Australia, but maybe that\u2019s too on-the-nose. One of the things that we would do in the writers room this year is that I would assign everybody homework. So [I told] everybody to go home and come back and basically pitch how we should be using animals as symbolic and significant in the finale, and Carly Wray came back and she pitched the idea of the birds as the messages of love idea from the wedding, and then Lila Byock was like, \u201cDo you guys know what a scapegoat is?\u201d And then she basically told that story that Eddie tells in his speech, which is that in ancient times the villagers would all put the sins on the goat and just cast the goat out into the world and then they were relieved of their sins. And I was like, \u201cI like those ideas. Let\u2019s do both those ideas.\u201d That\u2019s what it came from.\n\nPresumably, you had this episode in the can months ago. What\u2019s it been like for you to have to wait this long for everyone to see it?\n\nIt varies from day to day. Last weekend, I was feeling a lot of anxiety, and as we\u2019ve gotten closer to the finale actually airing, I\u2019ve been feeling less anxiety. And it\u2019s not because I\u2019m feeling confidence that everybody\u2019s going to love the finale, it\u2019s just more of the relinquishing of the control that I have over it. And as new agey as it sounds, it\u2019s like, well, what do you think of it? Or if you had a time machine right now and you could get in and go back and you could change anything about the finale \u2014 it hasn\u2019t aired yet \u2014 what changes would you want to make? If my answer to that is that I would make no changes, I\u2019m pretty cool with it exactly the way that it is\u2026and, look, the reality is that The Leftovers is playing in an incredibly emotional territory that\u2019s very personal to people. It\u2019s taking on issues like belief and loss and grief, and so I have to prepare myself for the fact that there will be a wide range of extrapolations and emotional responses to the finale and I just hope that the people who watch the show and have been watching all the episodes, whether they binge it over the course of the last week or whether they watched the pilot when it initially aired, that they basically feel like \u2014 love the finale or hate the finale \u2014 that they\u2019re able to assess the series as a whole, you know? Because I think there are some shows that get so dominated by the conversation around the finale, like The Sopranos or Lost or Seinfeld, where it\u2019s sort of like, but what about the 150 episodes before the finale? The finales that tend to get ad nauseam discussed years later are the ones that have seemed to have taken significant risk or tried to do something different and special and memorable. I don\u2019t know if this is a risky finale. It doesn\u2019t feel like a risky finale to me \u2014 but it doesn\u2019t feel like a safe one either. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not going to get a lot of sleep on Saturday night is the actual answer to your question.\n\nHas your experience with Lost prepared you for a lifetime of having to answer questions about whether everything is the truth or a lie?\n\nYeah, I\u2019m definitely prepared for that. I\u2019ll be honest with you, I don\u2019t think that a lot of people are going to ask me ad nauseam. I think that\u2019s such a concrete question and that I\u2019m doing something this time around that I didn\u2019t do on Lost, which is Carlton [Cuse] and I basically went radio silent for an entire month after the Lost finale aired. We just didn\u2019t do any press, so by the time we got back and we were on the grid again, people\u2019s opinions and misinterpretations had kind of solidified, and that sort of forced us into a defensive posture \u2014 not an apologetic posture, but it was sort of like those feelings had already calcified. I went to Italy for a month and while I was in Italy, the show got nominated for a drama series Emmy and the finale got nominated for a writing Emmy against like four episodes of Mad Men, so I was like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re good!\u201d It worked. [Laughs.] Only over the course of the summer did everyone start telling me how decisive the they-were-dead-the-whole-time thing was, etc. etc. But I don\u2019t think I could have changed people\u2019s opinions of it. Even though Carlton and I wanted to just breathe and have some space without us getting out there to have to explain things, maybe the perception by some is that we were hiding. Maybe the perception by some if that we thought we were above talking about it \u2014 and that created a certain level of resentment. I\u2019m just basically The Leftovers finale a lot, not just now to you guys who have already seen it but over the course of next week. We\u2019re going down to Austin and we\u2019ll get in front of the fan. There\u2019s things that I won\u2019t answer but I\u2019m here, to quote Nora and Kevin.\n\nWhat questions in particular don\u2019t you want to have to answer about the finale?\n\nThe big one is, \u201cHow literally are we supposed to take Nora\u2019s story?\u201d I don\u2019t want to answer that one. \u201cIs the space that Kevin enters into in the \u2018International Assassin\u2019 episode a real space versus a purely psychological space?\u201d Don\u2019t want to answer that one. Those are the two main ones. I\u2019ll pretty much answer anything else.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale_3.jpg?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale_4.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale.jpg?w=1532&h=862&crop=1", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale_2.jpg?w=1024", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale_5_0.jpg?w=1024"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bryn Sandberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/leftovers-series-finale-explained-1010052/", "title": "Damon Lindelof on Balancing Mystery and Closure in \u2018The Leftovers\u2019 Finale", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"It doesn\u2019t feel like a risky finale to me,\" says the showrunner,\u00a0\"but it doesn\u2019t feel like a safe one either.\"", "news_keywords": "Damon Lindelof, The Leftovers", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Bryn Sandberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1010052, "title": "Damon Lindelof on Balancing Mystery and Closure in 'The Leftovers' Finale", "published_at": "2017-06-04 19:15:00", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "The Leftovers", "topics": "TV News", "body": "The Leftovers has closed the book on its final chapter.\r\nThe HBO drama from Damon Lindelof and Tom Perrotta aired its finale Sunday night, and it did so by offering more closure than most viewers had been trained to anticipate \u2014 not only for all the major characters but even for the show's biggest mystery. (Note: spoilers abound below, so proceed with caution if you haven\u2019t yet watched \"The Book of Nora.\")\r\nLindelof had long tempered expectations about the finale, telling The Hollywood Reporter last year when he was writing the final script that\u00a0The Leftovers is in no way a mystery-solving show. \"If the takeaway from Lost was that there was a disgruntled portion of the fan base that said, 'You did not give satisfactory answers to the mysteries,' then I feel somewhat liberated with The Leftovers because that\u2019s off the table,\" he said at the time.\r\nBut in an emotional monologue that concludes the third and final season of the thought-provoking drama, Carrie Coon's character Nora Durst actually provides one possible answer to what happened to the 2 percent of the population that suddenly departed years ago. Whether or not she's telling the truth is up for debate.\r\nSeated across from an aged Kevin (Justin Theroux), Nora explains that years earlier she got into a machine that transported her to a parallel earth where the departed now live. It was the closure she'd always longed for \u2014 except that when she found her three children and husband, it was apparent that they were happy and had moved on with their lives. Realizing there was no place for her in their world, she had the creator of the machine send her back home.\r\n\"I knew that if I told you what happened that you would never believe me,\" Nora tells Kevin as she finishes her poignant tale. \"I believe you,\" Kevin assures her, tears streaming down his face. \"You do?\" she asks incredulously. \"Why wouldn't I believe you? You're here,\" he responds before reaching out to grab his former wife's hand. \"I'm here,\" Nora echoes, her mouth slowing turning upward into a smile.\r\nAnd with that, The Leftovers\u00a0concluded its story, leaving the credibility of Nora's account open to interpretation. \"I definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don\u2019t believe her story,\" says\u00a0Lindelof, \"and then for a lot of people, it won\u2019t even occur to them to disbelieve it.\"\r\nAhead of the finale's debut, THR chatted with Lindelof about why not revealing the fates of certain characters would be a \"travesty,\" the questions he doesn't want to have to answer about the finale and whether or not he personally believes Nora (hint: he really wants to).\r\n\r\nNow that people have gotten a chance to watch the finale, what's the most surprising question you're getting about it?\r\nI can\u2019t explain why it is surprising to me \u2014\u00a0I mean, I could explain it but I\u2019m not going to \u2014 is why didn't we show the story that Nora is telling as she\u2019s telling it?\r\nWas that ever a consideration in the writers room?\r\nIt was something that was discussed very early on when we first were talking about the ending of the series, but once the storytelling process began and scripts started getting written, we landed on the idea of this season, if not the series, being about people telling stories. And, more important, people telling stories that would either give themselves a degree of comfort or that they believed would give comfort to others. That tradition goes all the way back to season one with Matt at the pulpit, and in season two, with Tom [Chris Zylka] speaking in front of the ex-guilty members like AA meetings, saying that he can give magic hugs. So, there\u2019s always been a tradition on the show of characters delivering monologues that are fantastical or believable or unbelievable stories, with themselves at the center of those stories. They\u2019re told in the first person, and it was sort of like, \u201cOh, yeah, how could we not end the series with Carrie Coon doing that?\"\r\nWhen did you know that this is how you wanted to end the show?\r\nVery early on. The holdover writers from season two got together in January, and all we talked about was, \u201cWhat\u2019s the last scene of the finale, and when and where does the finale take place? And what are the things we want to resolve definitively, and what are the things that we\u2019re OK not resolving definitively, etc.\u201d They were both esoteric, enthymematic conversations and then they became much more directed toward the scene we ended up with and we explored different permutations. It was always going to be that Nora tells the story of going through, but there were a couple different permutations of who she was telling that story to \u2014 and then it became very obvious to us that it had to be Kevin. That was locked in before we even started breaking the season premiere.\r\nWho were the others that you considered for her telling the story to?\r\nErika Murphy was a contender, and then a grown-up version of Lily who would be maybe a 19- or 20-year-old young woman at the time that this would be taking place. Those were really the only other two contenders, other than Kevin.\r\n\r\nAnd how did you land on it being Kevin?\r\nWell, it isn\u2019t to say that Kevin isn\u2019t an incredibly important character in The Leftovers\u00a0\u2014 of course he is \u2014 but I think the idea is that the third and final season was just as much about Nora\u2019s journey as it was about Kevin\u2019s. His journey would resolve in the penultimate episode and then her journey would resolve in the finale. And that\u2019s inevitable for us because she just lost so much more. He\u2019s been suffering in this kind of existential way. He feels like he\u2019s a coward and he feels like he wanted to escape his family. There\u2019s a part of him that will not allow himself to be vulnerable enough to form real connections with people. Those are important but more esoteric, emotional and internal issues. Nora lost her kids and her husband. Of course, he was cheating on her, so f\u2014 that guy, but she had a much more tangible thing that she lost. All along we promised that we were never going to resolve where the departed people went, but at the same time, here we are flirting with disaster because this season feels like Nora\u2019s entire story starts with someone coming to her and saying, \u201cThere\u2019s a device you can get to inside that is going to transport you to be with those people again.\u201d It seems to be teasing the audience if we told you that we\u2019re never going to resolve where everybody went, and yet Nora is walking down that path with increasingly and rapidly escalating footsteps. So, how are we going to thread that needle? And now you\u2019ve seen how we\u2019ve tried. Whether or not the thread went through the eye perfectly is anyone\u2019s guess, but I\u2019m really happy and proud. I feel like we did not violate the spirit of The Leftovers by doing what we did.\r\nYou offered a bit more closure in the end than you initially let on that you might, although the question of whether or not Nora is telling the truth is left unanswered. How do you think her story will be received by viewers?\r\nAll I\u2019m really willing to say on the subject of that without being like frustratingly and pretentiously obtuse is that Nora told the story. She told the story. I definitely feel like there are going to be people out there who watch the show who don\u2019t believe her story, and then for a lot of people, it won\u2019t even occur to them to disbelieve it. That\u2019s why the answer to the question, \u201cWhy didn\u2019t we show Nora\u2019s journey?\u201d is that because if we showed it, it would be undeniable that it were true. Yet, even in shows like The OA, where the whole basis of the series is the characters telling the tale and we are, in fact, seeing that tale unwind, the show is still asking the question, \u201cIs she making all of this up?\u201d For a show that\u2019s based around the idea of belief and the idea that belief can actually bring a tremendous amount of emotional healing and the lack of belief can bring a lot of emotional pain, what is true and what is authentic and what matters \u2014those are all themes and ideas that were in Tom\u2019s book that we tried to bring to the series. I feel like Nora\u2019s story is the culmination of all those ideas.\r\n\r\nDo you believe Nora?\r\nWell, I want to believe her. Let me just put it to you that way. I want to believe her. That\u2019s the most honest answer I can give you.\r\nWere the show's writers divided on how they felt about Nora's story?\r\nYeah, I mean, we\u2019re still discussing it. From when we first talked about it at the beginning of the season to when we talked about it again when we were actually writing the finale to the script of the finale being written and then sitting in the editing room. Once I had a cut that I wanted all the writers to see, they came in and all I\u2019ll say is that people changed their minds once they saw Carrie do it. Both ways. And I would ask you another question. Let\u2019s say that I said one thing like, \"I don\u2019t believe Nora\u2019s story,\" and Carrie Coon says, \u201cI one-thousand percent believe Nora\u2019s story.\u201d Then which is true? Whose intention wins? And what about what [director] Mimi Leder thinks? The reality is that Carrie and Mimi and I never had the conversation that you and I are having now, quite purposefully. We wanted to let Carrie make the choice that felt right to her. I saw her last night and we still haven\u2019t talked about. I haven\u2019t said to her, \u201cCarrie, do you think it\u2019s true?\u201d I don\u2019t want to know what her answer to that question is. You can ask her. But I don\u2019t know. She still hasn\u2019t seen it, by the way.\r\nWhat did she add to the finale as an actor that wasn't on the page?\r\nThere's just an incredible amount of intelligence and depth in Carrie as a human being that always translates to Nora in her performance. And while I\u2019m not entirely always sure I can tell what Nora\u2019s thinking, I know that she is thinking \u2014 and she\u2019s thinking about a lot of different things. You can almost feel the subtle, silent moments with her, when the camera\u2019s just holding on her face in terms of what she\u2019s thinking and it\u2019s much more intense than just like, \u201cShe\u2019s in distress,\u201d or, \u201cShe\u2019s confused.\" I don\u2019t have a stopwatch but what I think is interesting about this finale is that it's a 70-minute episode and there may be as much as 20 minutes of the episode where Carrie is onscreen saying absolutely nothing, where she\u2019s not speaking at all. That\u2019s how compelling her performance is. Like, you take a scene of when she goes up the hill to free the goat from the fence, and because Carrie is such an amazing actor, you know exactly why she\u2019s doing that, how she feels about this, why she\u2019s putting the beads around her neck. Maybe you can\u2019t articulate that into words, but it emotionally makes sense just because of Carrie\u2019s performance. And she's also kind of not afraid to be the butt of the joke. When she\u2019s on the phone with Laurie [Amy Brenneman], and Lori is saying, \u201cIf you\u2019re calling me to tell you that it\u2019s OK to go with Kevin to the dance, that\u2019s fine. You can go.\u201d And she\u2019s just like, \u201cI do not want to go to the f\u2014ing dance!\u201d It\u2019s really funny. Carrie has to know that that\u2019s a comedic reading, but Nora would not want to be laughed at in that instance \u2014 she\u2019s so frustrated. And that\u2019s what I think is really interesting, for someone who is so clearly in control of her own life, she keeps doing these crazy things \u2014 whether it be hiring a prostitute to shoot her in the chest or getting the Wu-Tang tattoo or locking all the doors in her house as if Kevin is going to try to get in a window. She does all these irrational, unreasonable things, yet she seems completely and totally sane and under control when she\u2019s essentially behaving like a crazy person. I don\u2019t know how Carrie does that. I think that if you were to ask most people, \u201cDo you think that Nora Durst is crazy?\u201d They would say, \u201cWhat? No!\u201d But I would like to read you from the list of 10 things that Nora Durst has done and ask you that question again.\r\n\r\nWith such a sprawling ensemble cast, what made you move forward with a finale that was so predominantly about Nora and Kevin?\r\nI think that this was a love story. It\u2019s an oversimplification and it could feel a little bit trite, but it is the answer to your question. Obviously, I think from the moment that Kevin looks at Nora when she steps up to the podium and gives her speech in the pilot [it's there] because the Kevin-Nora romance was such an integral part of Tom\u2019s novel. We knew the final line of Tom\u2019s novel was, \u201cLook what I found,\u201d as Nora\u2019s holding a baby in her arms, and we knew that was going to be the final line of the first season of this show. So, if we\u2019re writing a show where basically the antagonist is not the Guilty Remnant, the antagonist is actually the fear and anxiety of losing the people that you love, and that fear and anxiety basically prevents you from forming new attachments because how could you ever fall in love with somebody and trust somebody not to leave you in a world where the departure could happen again at any moment? That wound would be the most intense and open and seething with Nora Durst, who basically was the statistical anomaly who lost her entire family. Again, it is overly simplistic and almost insulting to say the answer to profound loss is love because clearly that wasn\u2019t enough, right? I mean, she met Kevin, they were in love, they were together for many years, they thought that the problem was Mapleton so they moved to Miracle and, as Jill said, \"Wherever you go, there you are.\" And they were in Miracle for a number of years, but the time has basically passed. It\u2019s seven years later but she\u2019s still getting tattoos with her kids\u2019 names on them. So, when Mark Linn-Baker shows up and tells her something that she\u2019s pretty convinced is a lie and a hoax, she still gets kind of sucked into it. This is a person who isn\u2019t OK. The ending of that journey had to basically say, how can Nora construct a narrative \u2014 whether true or untrue but at least a palatable, believable narrative \u2014 where she actually is reunited with her kids and then decides not to be with them or decides that she doesn\u2019t belong there anymore or that they\u2019ve moved on without her? You basically take that elephant, you get that elephant out of the room very gently, and now she feels so guilty about having gone in pursuit of that that she can\u2019t be with Kevin. And now, in classic rom-com structure, Kevin needs to come after her and pretend to be something he\u2019s not. He needs to create a counter-narrative that allows them to start talking about their lives without starting from the place where the most intense pain is. So, if he knocks on her door and she answers it says, \u201cI\u2019m really sorry about what I said in the hotel room,\u201d there\u2019s nowhere to go. But by him saying, \u201cHey, all those things never happened, want to go to a dance?\u201d I think that that throws her back on her heels. But more importantly, it also uses the popular story beats of a rom-com or a romance even though the characters eventually have to confront the idea that we\u2019re not allowed to start over. This made for a very nice conversation at someone else\u2019s wedding, but now that we danced to Otis Redding, things have to get real. And they do.\r\nThis season, you've been switching up the song that plays during the opening credits. Why did you decide to return to \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d for this last episode?\r\nWe knew we were going to be changing the theme song every week, and I definitely wanted to play the season one theme song over the season two images, and then I wanted to bring, \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d back one last time. I wasn\u2019t sure which was going to be which, so I thought maybe \u201cLet the Mystery Be,\u201d would be OK over the episode seven title sequence, and then the season-one theme song basically plays over the finale. But \u201cLet the Mystery Be\u201d didn\u2019t quite feel right for International Assassin 2, so we flipped them. I wanted there to be a little more of a warning label on the finale going in, which is just like, just to remind you for those of you coming to the end of the finale looking for some level of resolution, whatever that means to you, we\u2019re going to answer some things that we care about \u2014 I think it would have been a travesty did we not answer what the fate was of every major character that we cared about on the show. If, for example, we just never addressed what happened to Laurie when she went into the water, that would have been unconscionable. Or did Matt eventually succumb to his leukemia? Yes, he did. What happened to Kevin Sr.? What happened to Jill and Tom? What happened to the Murphys? We owed the answer to all those questions, but then there are going to be other areas [we don't answer.] One of the questions that keeps popping up is, \u201cI was kind of hoping you would explain why Kevin has the ability to die and come back to life,\u201d and I said, \u201cOh, I\u2019m sorry you\u2019re disappointed.\" Like, I don\u2019t know what else to say in response to that. But I also go, \u201cWhat does that explanation look like?\u201d I mean, it\u2019s almost like explaining why it is that Superman has powers. It\u2019s like, \u201cOh, it\u2019s because he\u2019s from the planet Krypton and that\u2019s why he has powers on earth, because of our yellow sun.\" What is an explanation for why can Kevin die and come back to life? Who gives that explanation and what does it look like? We weren\u2019t touching that with a 10-foot pole \u2014 or a 20-foot ladder in our case.\r\n\r\nThe last words spoken in the show are Nora saying, \u201cI\u2019m here.\" What is the significance of that line?\r\nSeason one ended with her saying, \u201cLook what I found,\u201d and obviously those words have a meaning beyond the fact that she\u2019s just holding a baby in her arms. \u201cLook what I found,\u201d would seem to suggest that maybe she\u2019s found some purpose, maybe she\u2019s found a tether back to the world. When someone says, \u201cLook what I found,\u201d it\u2019s not just an object or a person, it\u2019s some kind of fundamental truth. And at the end of season two, Nora also has the last line, which is, \u201cYou are home.\u201d Well, that home is one that they\u2019ve really only occupied for three weeks or so. There isn\u2019t any furniture in it yet. But I think when she says, \u201cYou are home,\u201d she\u2019s like, look at all the people who are in this room. This is your home. But home is obviously an idea more than it is a physical place. We knew that Nora was going to have the last line of dialogue in the final season, and these are always very simple ideas, you know, \"Look what I found,\" and \"You are home.\" So it's like we just started meditating and remembering that one of the things Kevin said back in the pilot when he was in the bar with the young mother who he doesn\u2019t realize is the woman who lost the baby, and he lifts up his beer and he says, \u201cHey, we\u2019re still here,\u201d and she says, \u201cWe sure are.\u201d And HBO actually put, \u201cWe\u2019re still here,\u201d as one of the taglines on the season one poster. I think \u201cstill here\u201d is actually kind of negative. It's as if someone was like, \"The party is over,\" or, \"The bar is emptied out.\" There's something kind of sad and pathetic, but when you eliminate the word \u201cstill,\u201d there\u2019s something very powerful about it because it\u2019s some indication of, \u201cYeah, we\u2019re here in this kitchen right now, looking in one-another\u2019s eyes, but we\u2019re also here \u2014 we\u2019re present, we\u2019re in the same space.\" Here means I\u2019m not longer my psyche, and my emotional being is no longer out there, wondering, searching for things that are there. I am here. That was wildly pretentious, but, again, you started it.\r\n\r\nEarly in the episode, we learn that Laurie [Amy Brenneman] is still alive. Was she ever really contemplating suicide?\r\nThe truth of the matter is that there was a real process of discovery for us as writers. I think that when we broke that story in the room, we were all pretty convinced that she had committed suicide. And then Amy Brenneman before she shot the scene was like, \"I kind of want to know if I\u2019m killing myself or not,\" and I said, \u201cI have to leave some space, but I think I\u2019m about 90 percent sure that she does.\u201d And Amy was like, \u201cOK, I got it. I\u2019m sad, but I got it.\u201d And then we got the dailies of that episode, of her going out there on the boat and playing the scene with Jill and Tom on the phone and then going into the water \u2014 and there was something really noble and heroic about all the choices that Amy was making. I've never tried to kill myself and I think suicide is a very intense and complicated thing, but in my brain people who are about to kill themselves don\u2019t look like that. And so that was bothersome. Then we also made a discovery writing-wise. When Laurie's kids called her, why didn\u2019t she tell them that she was in Australia about to go scuba diving if it was her intention to kill herself? Because that\u2019s the elegance of what Nora pitched her, it\u2019s that people will think it was an accident. But if Tom and Jill were to find out, \u201cWait, we just called mom like half-an-hour before she went into the water and died in a scuba diving accident. Why didn\u2019t she tell us she was in Australia? Why was she going scuba diving on the anniversary of the departure?\u201d It wouldn\u2019t have accomplished what it set out to. So, the more we talked about it, the more we were forced to ask the question, what if Laurie went under the water and maybe it was her intention to potentially kill herself when she went in but when she was under she decided not to? Or maybe she went scuba diving as an affirmation of life \u2014 but, man, it sure feels like it makes more sense to us now both emotionally and narratively that she comes up out of the water. The other thing that happened was I watched that scene when Nora gives the speech about the beach ball, and I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t want to squeeze the air out of the beach ball.\u201d Killing Laurie sort of felt that way. And maybe it\u2019s honest and beautiful and poetic and not everybody\u2019s going to make it, but after everything Laurie went through \u2014 from being in a loveless marriage to the unborn child inside her disappearing and holding that burden of not telling anybody for so long to joining the Guilty Remnant to leaving the Guilty Remnant to trying to write a book and failing miserably to remarrying John Murphy \u2014 should the end result of that be that she kills herself? It just didn\u2019t feel fair to the character. So, she came out of the water and she stayed Nora's shrink.\r\n\r\nWhere did the idea for the goat come from in the wedding scene?\r\nI feel like good finales bookend a series by calling back certain themes and motifs that are introduced in the pilot and are carried through the series. It's like these are the ingredients, the brief solos that you want to hear before the band leaves the stage. And one of the things The Leftovers is traded very heavily on is animals, and not \"spirit animals\" but animals as some sort of mystical, magical, interpretive kind of pseudo-religious thing for us to kind of pack all of our belief systems into. In the pilot, it was dogs and the stag, and we used a goat in season two that gets sacrificed. Certainly we used the lion to a very memorable effect in season three, and so we thought, should we return back to the dog idea? It didn't feel quite right. Kangaroos seem like the obvious way to go in Australia, but maybe that\u2019s too on-the-nose. One of the things that we would do in the writers room this year is that I would assign everybody homework. So [I told] everybody to go home and come back and basically pitch how we should be using animals as symbolic and significant in the finale, and Carly Wray came back and she pitched the idea of the birds as the messages of love idea from the wedding, and then Lila Byock was like, \"Do you guys know what a scapegoat is?\" And then she basically told that story that Eddie tells in his speech, which is that in ancient times the villagers would all put the sins on the goat and just cast the goat out into the world and then they were relieved of their sins. And I was like, \"I like those ideas. Let\u2019s do both those ideas.\" That\u2019s what it came from.\r\nPresumably, you had this episode in the can months ago. What's it been like for you to have to wait this long for everyone to see it?\r\nIt varies from day to day. Last weekend, I was feeling a lot of anxiety, and as we\u2019ve gotten closer to the finale actually airing, I\u2019ve been feeling less anxiety. And it\u2019s not because I\u2019m feeling confidence that everybody\u2019s going to love the finale, it\u2019s just more of the relinquishing of the control that I have over it. And as new agey as it sounds, it\u2019s like, well, what do you think of it? Or if you had a time machine right now and you could get in and go back and you could change anything about the finale \u2014\u00a0it hasn\u2019t aired yet \u2014 what changes would you want to make? If my answer to that is that I would make no changes, I\u2019m pretty cool with it exactly the way that it is\u2026and, look, the reality is that\u00a0The Leftovers is playing in an incredibly emotional territory that\u2019s very personal to people. It\u2019s taking on issues like belief and loss and grief, and so I have to prepare myself for the fact that there will be a wide range of extrapolations and emotional responses to the finale and I just hope that the people who watch the show and have been watching all the episodes, whether they binge it over the course of the last week or whether they watched the pilot when it initially aired, that they basically feel like \u2014 love the finale or hate the finale \u2014 that they\u2019re able to assess the series as a whole, you know? Because I think there are some shows that get so dominated by the conversation around the finale, like The Sopranos or Lost or Seinfeld, where it\u2019s sort of like, but what about the 150 episodes before the finale? The finales that tend to get ad nauseam discussed years later are the ones that have seemed to have taken significant risk or tried to do something different and special and memorable. I don\u2019t know if this is a risky finale. It doesn\u2019t feel like a risky finale to me \u2014\u00a0but it doesn\u2019t feel like a safe one either. I don\u2019t know. I\u2019m not going to get a lot of sleep on Saturday night is the actual answer to your question.\r\n\r\nHas your experience with\u00a0Lost prepared you for a lifetime of having to answer questions about whether everything is the truth or a lie?\r\nYeah, I\u2019m definitely prepared for that. I\u2019ll be honest with you, I don\u2019t think that a lot of people are going to ask me ad nauseam. I think that\u2019s such a concrete question and that I\u2019m doing something this time around that I didn\u2019t do on Lost, which is Carlton [Cuse] and I basically went radio silent for an entire month after the Lost finale aired. We just didn\u2019t do any press, so by the time we got back and we were on the grid again, people\u2019s opinions and misinterpretations had kind of solidified, and that sort of forced us into a defensive posture \u2014\u00a0not an apologetic posture, but it was sort of like those feelings had already calcified. I went to Italy for a month and while I was in Italy, the show got nominated for a drama series Emmy and the finale got nominated for a writing Emmy against like four episodes of Mad Men, so I was like, \u201cOh, we\u2019re good!\u201d It worked. [Laughs.] Only over the course of the summer did everyone start telling me how decisive the they-were-dead-the-whole-time thing was, etc. etc. But I don't think I could have changed people's opinions of it. Even though Carlton and I wanted to just breathe and have some space without us getting out there to have to explain things, maybe the perception by some is that we were hiding. Maybe the perception by some if that we thought we were above talking about it \u2014 and that created a certain level of resentment. I'm just basically The Leftovers finale a lot, not just now to you guys who have already seen it but over the course of next week. We're going down to Austin and we'll get in front of the fan. There's things that I won't answer but I'm here, to quote Nora and Kevin.\r\nWhat questions in particular don't you want to have to answer about the finale?\r\nThe big one is, \"How literally are we supposed to take Nora's story?\" I don't want to answer that one. \"Is the space that Kevin enters into in the 'International Assassin' episode a real space versus a purely psychological space?\" Don't want to answer that one. Those are the two main ones. I'll pretty much answer anything else.", "fb": {"pages": 14425952749}, "fragment": "!", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Damon Lindelof on Balancing Mystery and Closure in \u2018The Leftovers\u2019 Finale", "url": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/leftovers-series-finale-explained-1010052/", "description": "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a risky finale to me,\u201d says the showrunner,\u00a0\u201cbut it doesn\u2019t feel like a safe one either.\u201d", "site_name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "image": {"identifier": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale.jpg?w=1024", "width": 1024, "height": 576}, "locale": "en_US"}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-06-04T19:15:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2017-06-05T04:48:16+00:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@thr", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Damon Lindelof on Balancing Mystery and Closure in \u2018The Leftovers\u2019 Finale", "description": "\u201cIt doesn\u2019t feel like a risky finale to me,\u201d says the showrunner,\u00a0\u201cbut it doesn\u2019t feel like a safe one either.\u201d", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/the_leftovers_finale.jpg?w=1532"}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496603700.0, "source": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com", "summary": ""}
