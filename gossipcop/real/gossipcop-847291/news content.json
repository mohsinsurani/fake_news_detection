{"url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/house-of-cards-final-season-review", "text": "This post contains plot details for the entirety of House of Cards Season 6.\n\nFor a show built on the premise that people will abandon their values at the slightest hint of personal gain, credit must be given to how swiftly House of Cards, offscreen, handled the growing number of accusations of sexual misconduct against its star Kevin Spacey last year. (Spacey has apologized to actor Anthony Rapp, and sought treatment in the wake of further allegations.) Production was suspended, and a few days later, Spacey was fired. Season 6 was announced to be the show\u2019s last. It was convenient that before Spacey\u2019s firing, Season 5 of House of Cards ended with Robin Wright\u2019s character Claire Underwood wresting control from her husband to become president of the United States, herself. \u201cMy turn,\u201d she says directly to the camera, in one of the most successful finale twists the show has pulled off. The flip became a moment of unexpected foreshadowing, both for the direction of the show and for the nationwide conversation on the continued struggle for gender equality. In Season 6, all eight episodes of which debuted today, Claire is the president, and Frank is just a memory\u2014much discussed, but never heard from or spoken to ever again. House of Cards won\u2019t even play his voice, which becomes increasingly obvious as Frank\u2019s old voice memos become a sought-after testament to Claire\u2019s awful character. In the time line, which picks up a couple of months after Claire\u2019s ascension, Frank is dead, but we don\u2019t know how or why.\n\nUnfortunately, though\u2014even with the leg up provided by the Season 5 finale, and the delayed release\u2014the production is unable to wrap up the story. I don\u2019t even mean that House of Cards doesn\u2019t end well, although it doesn\u2019t; I mean, there are multiple story lines that are simply abandoned. Wright is excellent\u2014she\u2019s doing her best work in this season, half-flirting with the audience as she scrambles to consolidate her position. In the sense that House of Cards transports the viewer to a fantasy of absolute, destructive power, Wright offers a window into a female version of it\u2014one that is markedly more elegant, as it is not suffused with Spacey\u2019s over-the-top Southern drawl.\n\nAs the show has reiterated since its debut, the power is still ugly\u2014thrilling, cathartic, and fulfilling a very human desire, yet still ugly. But Wright has inherited an impossible task. The story is trying to wrap up five seasons of action\u2014which includes the death of a half-dozen business-casual flunkies and several layers of Machiavellian manipulation. The story of Season 6 just doesn\u2019t cohere; it barely even tracks well enough to summarize. In a way, the total breakdown is sort of beautiful; it\u2019s like watching the story collapse in upon itself, a deserted building, carefully demolished.\n\nIn exchange for a plot arc, House of Cards relies on what it has always done best: cynical provocation. The most confusing is Claire\u2019s canny exploitation of feminist language for political gain, which in the back half of the season turns into a story about her in-office pregnancy. (It is never made clear how Claire gets pregnant; presumably, it could be her naturally conceived child with Frank, but the careful rollout of her condition suggests a much more calculated method.) Wright puts a lot into the movement of her face, but House of Cards has very little to offer on Claire\u2019s feelings about impending motherhood, or how being pregnant changes the environment of the White House. Midway through the season, Claire announces she\u2019s returning to her maiden name, Hale. She also lectures the Situation Room, during a nuclear crisis, on how no one knows the word for the opposite of misogyny. (Claire, apparently, was not paying much attention to the Internet in, like, 2013.)\n\nIt\u2019s not just Claire\u2019s story that spins out of control. Diane Lane and Greg Kinnear play the billionaire Shepherd siblings who are trying to use Claire to their advantage, and end up becoming her primary opponents; a combination of the Koch brothers and Facebook, their corporate holdings manage to mine data, pollute the environment, steal users\u2019 privacy, and uphold traditional family values. But even though the siblings make for a fascinating if grotesque portrait of power, privilege, and traditional family values, they barely have a story; like so much else in this season, the plot arc merely gestures toward relevance. Lane\u2019s character Annette, a friend of Claire\u2019s since girlhood, provides a striking foil for Claire\u2019s ascent. (In one flashback to the dorms at Andover, the two are shown mirroring each other in elaborate cotillion-style curtsies, while sharing a bitten-off joint. It\u2019s a loaded, arresting moment, but it\u2019s just that: a moment.)\n\nThe Shepherds amass all of the not-yet-dead pawns from the last five seasons of House of Cards on their team\u2014journalists working on hit pieces, operatives-turned-data miners, Russian plants in Claire\u2019s administration, Cabinet secretaries and Supreme Court justices that can be bought for the right price. By the end of the season, in what feels like a desperate attempt to tie up loose ends, nearly all of these characters are killed. (The list includes Patricia Clarkson\u2019s character Jane, Boris McGiver\u2019s Tom Hammerschmidt, and Jayne Atkinson\u2019s Cathy Durant, who technically dies twice.) The Shepherds get behind a Supreme Court ruling that would limit Claire\u2019s power, so to outmaneuver them President Hale dives into a heated conflict between ICO, the show\u2019s version of ISIS, and Russian President Viktor Petrov (Lars Mikkelsen), the show\u2019s version of Vladimir Putin. This brings the nation to the brink of nuclear war. And if this were not enough drama, Annette begins to coolly plan the president\u2019s assassination, with a cabal of co-conspirators that includes the vice president (Campbell Scott). Her man for the job? Doug Stamper (Michael Kelly), Frank Underwood\u2019s long-serving jack-of-all-trades.\n\nWhich leads to the final scene of the entire series. A face-off, between Claire and Doug, in the Oval Office. During which Stamper confesses to murdering Frank, somewhat by accident, by tampering with his medication\u2014and then lunges at Claire with Frank\u2019s letter opener. Claire adroitly turns it back on him, and then, as he bleeds, suffocates him. He does not resist. So Stamper dies, in a pool of blood, inches from the presidential seal on the carpet. And Claire\u2014almost 30 weeks pregnant, with an armed nuclear football awaiting her, and political chaos looming\u2014whispers, \u201cNo more pain,\u201d and then turns to the camera, with an almost crazed look in her eye.\n\nIt\u2019s a great shot. The camera looks up at Claire, almost as if we are lying next to Doug on the ground. Wright\u2019s blonde bob arcs toward the lens in a sweep. But it\u2019s a mysterious, ambiguous ending for a show that has, until now, specialized in rather blunt storytelling. With Stamper dead, is Claire poised to succeed? Doomed to fail? Confident in her purpose? Haunted by guilt? Is this her last murder, or a harbinger of future carnage? What about everything else\u2014the press secretary who knew too much (Kristen Sieh), the fearmongering journalist (Athena Karkanis), the conniving Speaker of the House (Boris Kodjoe)? What about the data mining that exposed the midterms to fraud, or the nuclear conflict in Syria? What about Claire\u2019s as-yet unnamed daughter, and Annette\u2019s thwarted assassination attempt? What about the story Janine (Constance Zimmer) had worked for so long to report? The story of House of Cards took Macbeth and Machiavelli and unleashed it on the White House; at its end, all it can show the audience is a moment of interpersonal bloodlust.", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54fefdaa3d33425a57fc673f/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss08-robin-wright-fashion.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bad3754e5ae6a094d0018cd/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/house-of-cards-trailer.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/620ad531f518ba2b0f8f82d6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62019b3641f168f94e9f9d86/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/628811eb0545d9cf47337047/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bd345e155187a2d9530c8ab/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/HOC_601_Unit_01950rCROP.jpeg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6222a9bb8e2d9f0117a4967f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61a5445dbad4077f9e4d07b6/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bafaa962b57202d9836fe12/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/kevin-spacey-misconduct.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/62ab437671563c90554455bc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5d3d1e975989820008deba1f/1:1/w_90%2Cc_limit/Sonia_Saraiya%2520(1).png", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54fefccc9689cbfa72bf3a64/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss01-robin-wright-fashion.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/master/w_2560%2Cc_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/623a28a1e700ab34afc82b7f/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633d9bec72fe11ef3849c3ef/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/54fefcd81bb97fd46fe01f11/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/ss09-robin-wright-fashion.jpg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/hwd/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Sonia Saraiya"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/house-of-cards-final-season-review", "title": "Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.", "id": "5bdcb58a7d738b4e26033e43", "keywords": "kevin spacey,netflix,robin wright,house of cards", "news_keywords": "kevin spacey,netflix,robin wright,house of cards", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5bdcb58a7d738b4e26033e43", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2018/11/house-of-cards-final-season-review"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2018-11-02T20:43:52.450Z", "modified_time": "2018-11-02T20:43:52.450Z", "author": "Sonia Saraiya"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "Down a star and out of things to say, Season 6 flounders.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5bdcb5d6adbbcc502c0039b1/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/HOC_603_01055r.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "Review: House of Cards Collapses, Finally"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1541191432.45, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
