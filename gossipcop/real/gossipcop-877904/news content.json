At one point, the 39-year-old Dawson\u2019s Creek alum even practiced her back-bend skills, getting a little extra support from the Beat Shazam host, 50.\n\nHolmes kept things casual for their outing, pairing a billowy white shirt with a matching pair of pants, which she accessorized with a pair of round sunglasses. Foxx also dressed down, opting for a blue sweatshirt and a pair of shorts, which he also paired with sunglasses.\n\nThe pair were previously spotted together last month, following a report that the couple had been planning a wedding, and called it off because they had split due to \u201ctrust issues.\u201d\n\nHowever, Holmes\u2019 publicist shot claims of both a wedding and breakup down, calling all the various report \u201c100 percent untrue.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Katie Holmes and Jamie Foxx Celebrate Together in Rare Appearance Ahead of the Grammys\n\nFoxx and Holmes were first seen dancing together in the Hamptons in 2013, one year after the actress split from Tom Cruise following six years of marriage.\n\nThough the pair have never confirmed their relationship, they\u2019ve been stepping out more often since a photographer captured a rare photo of them together, walking hand-in-hand on a Malibu beach last September.\n\nFoxx and Holmes also sat together at Clive Davis\u2019 Pre-Grammy Awards Gala in January, played basketball together on Valentine\u2019s Day, and have been seen dining together multiple times.\n\nShe also made an appearance at his 50th birthday party in Los Angeles in mid-December 2017.\n\nKevin Mazur/Getty Images\n\nHowever, when Foxx was asked during the NBA All-Star Celebrity Game in February about shooting hoops with Homes days earlier, he immediately took off his microphone and walked off of the live interview.\n\n\u201cThey are happy, they just don\u2019t flaunt anything,\u201d a source told PEOPLE at the time. \u201cJamie will always go out of his way to stay discreet. That is his way, and it works for him. If they could stay secret forever, Jamie would be happy.\u201d", "images":
