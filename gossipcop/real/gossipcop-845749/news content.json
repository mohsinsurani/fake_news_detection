I didn\u2019t report it because of many reasons,\u201d she said. \u201cFirst off, I was in complete shock and total denial. I didn\u2019t want to view myself as a victim so I suppressed it and pretended it never happened.\u201d\n\nAs she was in a relationship with the perpetrator, Breslin was unsure if reporting the incident would cause more issues.\n\n\u201cI was in a relationship with my rapist and feared not being believed,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI also feared that if my case didn\u2019t lead anywhere, he would still find out and hurt me even more.\u201d\n\nShe continued, \u201cThird, I knew how hurt my family and friends would be after finding out and I didn\u2019t want to put them thru that.\u201d\n\nBreslin said she was diagnosed with post-traumatic stress disorder following the incident. Despite making progress, the actress revealed she still has nightmares and flashbacks.\n\n\u201cI still jump when somebody touches me unexpectedly, even if it\u2019s my best friend tapping me on the shoulder,\u201d she wrote.\n\nThe Dirty Dancing reboot star said that claims that unreported rapes \u201cdon\u2019t matter\u201d is \u201cunfair, untrue and unhelpful.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like [saying] you got a black eye from being punched in the face, but because you didn\u2019t call the police, you didn\u2019t really get a black eye,\u201d she explained.\n\nShe concluded, \u201cUnreported rapes count. Reported rapes count. End of the story.\u201d\n\nBreslin revealed her story in an Instagram post earlier this month that showed a block of text that reads: \u201cConsent II: You are not obligated to have sex with someone that you\u2019re in a relationship with. Dating is not consent. Marriage is not consent.\u201d\n\nThe Scream Queens actress added a caption, writing: \u201cI knew my assailant. #SexualAssaultAwarenessMonth #breakthesilence.\u201d\n\nThe next day, Breslin had received an outpouring of support and love from fans on social and took to Twitter on Tuesday to thank everyone.\n\n\u201cSo beyond thankful by the immense support regarding my IG post last night,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI am so lucky to have all of you kind souls in my corner.\u201d", "images":
