The dogs\u2014who all donned Mickey Mouse ears for the occasion\u2014spent the day frolicking with their favorite Disney characters, posing in front of Disneyland landmarks and even having a go on some of the rides.\n\nThe Internet, of course, was left swooning over Dog Disney, with many canine enthusiasts taking time to appreciate the delightful photos. \u201cNot to be dramatic but I\u2019m in love with every single dog in this,\u201d wrote one enamored Twitter user. \u201cThey\u2019re such good boys.\u201d\n\nThe dogs are being trained by Canine Companions for Independence, a non-profit that provides assistance dogs free of charge to adults, children, and veterans with disabilities.\n\nSee more photos below.\n\nWrite to Megan McCluskey at megan.mccluskey@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/highway-overpass.jpeg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/service-dogs-disneyland.jpg?quality=85&w=509&h=339&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/donald-trump-joe-biden-election.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C35px%2C2400px%2C1601px&resize=160%2C106&strip"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/service-dogs-disneyland.jpg?quality=85&w=509&h=339&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Megan Mccluskey"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5229421/service-dogs-disneyland/", "title": "Service Dogs Spent the Best Day Ever at Disneyland", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Visiting Disneyland is a magical experience for most people, but no human will ever enjoy Disney as much as these dogs did.", "og": {"title": "These Service Dogs Spent the Best Day Ever at Disneyland", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5229421/service-dogs-disneyland/", "description": "It really is the most magical place on Earth", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/service-dogs-disneyland.jpg?quality=85&w=509&h=339&crop=1", "width": 509, "height": 339}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5229421/service-dogs-disneyland/", "description": "Visiting Disneyland is a magical experience for most people, but no human will ever enjoy Disney as much as these dogs did.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/service-dogs-disneyland.jpg?quality=85&w=509&h=339&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5229421/service-dogs-disneyland/", "title": "These Service Dogs Spent the Best Day Ever at Disneyland", "description": "It really is the most magical place on Earth", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/service-dogs-disneyland.jpg?quality=85&w=509&h=339&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
