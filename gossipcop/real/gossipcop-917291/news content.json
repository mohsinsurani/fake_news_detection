If they\u2019re convicted of a crime, well then you\u2019re sad, and that\u2019s tragic, but they\u2019ve got to go through that process.\u201d\n\nMonica Schipper/WireImage; Rob Kim/Getty; Jimi Celeste/Patrick McMullan/Getty\n\nAllen, 82, has come under fire recently as the Time\u2019s Up movement has gained momentum. He has been repeatedly accused in the past of child molestation by his daughter Dylan Farrow. The allegation, which he denies, first surfaced in 1992, when Dylan was 7, during a bitter custody battle between Allen and his ex-partner Mia Farrow. Allen was not charged, though a Connecticut prosecutor said there was probable cause for a criminal case.\n\nToback, 73, was initially accused of sexual misconduct by 38 women in the Los Angeles Times story. The paper later reported that more than 300 women have come forward with similar allegations. In the wake of the report, numerous famous actresses also spoke out about their alleged interactions with Toback, including Selma Blair, Rachel McAdams, and Julianne Moore.\n\nToback denied the allegations to the L.A. Times, claiming it would be \u201cbiologically impossible\u201d for him to do what he was accused of because he has had diabetes and a heart condition for 22 years.\n\nIn January, Baldwin called criticism of Allen over longstanding sexual abuse allegations \u201cunfair and sad.\u201d The actor also referred to the long list of former collaborators who have since denounced the director and pledged to never work with him again.\n\n\u201cWoody Allen was investigated forensically by two states (NY and CT) and no charges were filed. The renunciation of him and his work, no doubt, has some purpose,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cBut it\u2019s unfair and sad to me. I worked w WA 3 times and it was one of the privileges of my career.\u201d", "images":
