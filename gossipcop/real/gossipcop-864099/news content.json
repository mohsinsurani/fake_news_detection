During an interview with The Edit published on Thursday, June 29, the actress, who suffered an eating disorder herself in the past, said that people\u2019s obsession with being thin is why the disease exists.\n\n\u201cI was leaving my apartment one day and someone I\u2019ve known for a long time, my mom\u2019s age, said to me, \u2018Oh, wow, look at you!'\u201d Collins told the site. \u201cI tried to explain [I lost weight for a role] and she goes, \u2018No! I want to know what you\u2019re doing, you look great!\u2019 I got into the car with my mom and said, \u2018That is why the problem exists.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe role hit home for Collins, who previously revealed that she suffered an eating disorder.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019s a scene where I\u2019m taking my clothes off to be weighed by Carrie Preston, my stepmom in the movie, who takes a photo on her phone and shows it to me. I didn\u2019t think she\u2019d actually take one but she did,\u201d Collins recalled. \u201cI saw myself in the photo and my heart dropped. So when my mom saw the film, she saw Lily\u2019s reaction because she knows me the best.\u201d\n\nThe scene caused her mom to breakdown.\n\n\u201cThe first time she was a bit in shock,\u201d Collins added of her mom\u2019s reaction. \u201cThe second time I looked over at the end and she was sobbing; it really hit her hard.\u201d\n\nThe Love, Rosie actress also told The Edit that she couldn\u2019t book photoshoots in magazines because she was too skinny.\n\n\u201cI told my publicist that if I could snap my fingers and gain 10 pounds right that second, I would,\u201d she concluded of the experience.\n\nTo the Bone hits Netflix on July 14.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ttb-longplay-30_r2_lily-collins-to-the-bone-zoom-89dfd8c9-69fc-47f5-be3c-0aec4e36ceb5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1634px%2C858px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ttb-longplay-30_r2_lily-collins-to-the-bone-zoom-89dfd8c9-69fc-47f5-be3c-0aec4e36ceb5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1634px%2C858px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Sierra Marquina"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-body/news/lily-collins-was-praised-for-losing-weight-to-play-anorexic-character-w490539/", "title": "Lily Collins Was Praised for Losing Weight to Play Anorexic Character", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Body", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Lily Collins said that she was praised for losing weight to play an anorexic character \u2014 read her quotes", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Lily Collins Was Praised for Losing Weight: \u2018That Is Why This Problem Exists\u2019", "description": "Lily Collins said that she was praised for losing weight to play an anorexic character \u2014 read her quotes", "url": "/celebrity-body/news/lily-collins-was-praised-for-losing-weight-to-play-anorexic-character-w490539/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:54:48+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ttb-longplay-30_r2_lily-collins-to-the-bone-zoom-89dfd8c9-69fc-47f5-be3c-0aec4e36ceb5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1634px%2C858px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ttb-longplay-30_r2_lily-collins-to-the-bone-zoom-89dfd8c9-69fc-47f5-be3c-0aec4e36ceb5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1634px%2C858px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-06-29T23:39:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:54:48+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Lily Collins Was Praised for Losing Weight: \u2018That Is Why This Problem Exists\u2019", "description": "Lily Collins said that she was praised for losing weight to play an anorexic character \u2014 read her quotes", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/ttb-longplay-30_r2_lily-collins-to-the-bone-zoom-89dfd8c9-69fc-47f5-be3c-0aec4e36ceb5.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C1634px%2C858px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498779540.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
