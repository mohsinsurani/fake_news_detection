Kelly isn\u2019t the only one denying rumors that he\u2019s been holding young girls hostage in an abusive sex cult at his homes in Atlanta and Chicago. One of the alleged victims of Kelly\u2019s rumored sex cult is speaking out, saying that the disturbing claims against the music legend are totally untrue.\n\nJocelyn Savage, 21, whose family accused R. Kelly of holding their daughter hostage, says that she\u2019s perfectly happy and safe \u2014 although she won\u2019t reveal her whereabouts. She told TMZ, \u201cI\u2019m 21, I\u2019m about to be 22 in a few days and I just mainly want to say that I am in a happy place with my life and I\u2019m not being brainwashed or anything like that. It just came to a point where it definitely has got out of hand. I\u2019m totally fine. I\u2019m happy where I\u2019m at and everything is okay with me.\u201d\n\nSavage said of her parents, \u201cI\u2019m very heartbroken over what\u2019s going on with this situation because it\u2019s getting to a point where it\u2019s getting too much. It\u2019s just not right.\u201d When asked if she was being held involuntarily, she said, \u201cOh no, nothing like that. I\u2019ve never felt like a hostage or anything like that.\u201d However, Jocelyn will not confirm whether or not she\u2019s in a relationship or dating the 50-year-old singer.\n\nHer father Timothy believes she is suffering Stockholm Syndrome, a condition which sees hostages grow to love their captors. According to Buzzfeed reporter Jim Derogatis, who first reported the story, R. Kelly is currently being investigated by the FBI.\n\nWatch: R.
