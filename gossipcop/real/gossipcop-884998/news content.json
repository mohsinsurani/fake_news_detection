The former presidential candidate visited the show on Wednesday, and was treated to a special \u201cThank You Note\u201d section on the show.\n\nThe female writers on the show all came out to pen some personalized thank yous.\n\n\u201cThank you, Hillary Clinton, for handling this difficult transition with more grace than I ever could have imagined,\u201d one writer said. \u201cThat being said, call me day or night and I will be there with a gallon of ice cream and two spoons to tell you, girl you are so much better than him!\u201d\n\n\u201cYou may get the call!\u201d Hillary quipped back.\n\nWATCH: Jimmy Fallon and Miley Cyrus Photobomb Unsuspecting Fans In Adorable 'Tonight Show' Sketch\n\nAnother writer on the show noted, \u201cYou show girls everywhere that politics isn\u2019t a popularity contest, because if it were, you would have won by about three million votes.\u201d\n\nOne took advantage of Hillary\u2019s signature campaign slogan, saying, \u201cThank you, Hillary Clinton. I was with her, I\u2019m still with her, and right now, I literally am with her!\u201d\n\nBut when singer Miley Cyrus came out, she was visibly emotional, breaking down in tears from the first word.\n\n\u201cThank you, Hillary for being a constant beacon of strength, hope, and determination for me and millions of other young women,\u201d Miley said. \u201cYou\u2019ve been a role model and an inspiration and a voice of reason in uncertain times. I could go on and on, but I\u2019d like to get right to the point. Can I give you a hug?\u201d\n\nNaturally, Hillary agreed and let the \u201cMalibu\u201d singer give her a hug on the stage.\n\nHillary then decided to write a thank you note of her own.\n\nWATCH: Miley Cyrus Sings Pop Cover of Cardi B's 'Bodak Yellow,' And It's Kind of Amazing\n\n\u201cThank you, Miley, the Tonight Show writers, and all of the women and young girls out there. You are smart, strong, and deserving of every opportunity,\u201d she wrote. \u201cTogether we\u2019ve made our voices heard, we\u2019ve done great things, and we\u2019ve come a long way. But as Miley would say, \u2018We can\u2019t stop and we won\u2019t stop.\u2019\u201d\n\nWatch the clip now see what the other writers had to say!\n\nFor more from Cyrus, watch the clip below!\n\nMiley
