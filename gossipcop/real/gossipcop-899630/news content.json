What she is not is a prepackaged product put together by the public relations firms that work for the major studios. That\u2019s quite the admirable path to take in today\u2019s 24/7 Twitter-verse where you\u2019re constantly on guard against the leering public. But even Chastain would admit that the choice to be a voice of truth in the entertainment industry did not come easily for her.\n\nIn a recent interview with the New York Times, Chastain admitted to being shocked that she received a Golden Globes nomination for Aaron Sorkin\u2019s Molly\u2019s Game. She thought her career may actually be in peril after speaking out against the deluge of sexual misconduct allegations being flung around Hollywood.\n\n\u201cTo be honest, I\u2019m mainly surprised about my nomination,\u201d she told the outlet. \u201cAs an actor, I have a lot of fear, thinking that if I speak my mind, or something that feels like it deviates from the norm as a woman, am I going to be made to disappear in my industry?\n\n\u201cWhen the article came out about Weinstein, I immediately started tweeting. I\u2019ve got a good group of girlfriends on WhatsApp, and I said, \u2018I\u2019m really terrified I\u2019m destroying my career right now. I wonder if people will still see me as an actress, and want to work with knowing I have these opinions,\u2019\u201d she continued. \u201cIn the way that only good girlfriends can do, they helped me eliminate fear and understand that the only way to change something that\u2019s wrong is to change it, not ignore it. And rather than saying it\u2019s an industrywide issue, it\u2019s more than that. It\u2019s a society-wide issue. We can\u2019t ignore farmworkers or women who have been invisible.\u201d\n\nChastain has never been shy on Twitter about calling others out (or going to bat for Robin Wright to be named the lead on the final season of House of Cards, an idea Netflix eventually greenlit). Shortly after the first two exposes took down Harvey Weinstein, she tweeted: \u201cI was warned from the beginning. The stories were everywhere. To deny that is to creat an environment [sic] for it to happen again.\u201d The two-time Academy Award-nominee also spoke out against Kevin Spacey and Brett Ratner amid their own personal alleged scandals.\n\n\u201cI was tweeting a lot at the time and actually got an email from a well-known actor that said, \u2018Calm down,\u2019\u201d Chastain said during an appearance on \u201cThe Graham Norton Show.\u201d \u201cI found that heartbreaking and can only think he didn\u2019t understand the movement that was happening.\u201d\n\nFollowing her performance in Molly\u2019s Game and the Golden Globe nomination, Chastain is a dark horse contender for a Best Actress nomination at the Oscars (and a potential star of the planned It sequel). If anything, her vocal presence on Hollywood\u2019s sexual harassment issues, as well as the gender wage gap and other divisive topics, have made her even more popular with fans. But if you needed any other convincing of Chastain\u2019s awesomeness, there\u2019s always this scene from Zero Dark Thirty.", "images": ["https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=37161820&cv=3.6.0&cj=1", "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/gettyimages-492294551.jpg?quality=80&w=970&strip", "https://observer-media.go-vip.net/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/gettyimages-492294551.jpg?quality=80&w=970", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=618909876214345&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/gettyimages-492294551.jpg?quality=80&strip", "https://observer.com/wp-content/themes/newyorkobserver-2014/images/observer-logo-2015.png"], "top_img": "https://observer.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2017/12/gettyimages-492294551.jpg?quality=80&strip", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Brandon Katz", "Brandon Katz Is A Pop Culture Junkie", "A Senior Entertainment Reporter Covering Film", "Television.
