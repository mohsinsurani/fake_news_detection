We can figure out her answer even without the tweet's text in the next photo, as Johnson leans down to kiss her brand new fiance.\n\nChmerkovskiy shared his sentiments in another tweet: \"I can't wait to make you my wife.\"\n\nMore: How Olympian Adam Rippon won 'Dancing With the Stars' beating Tonya Harding, Josh Norman\n\nMore: 'DWTS' pro stars Peta Murgatroyd, Maksim Chmerkovskiy wed in New York\n\nI can\u2019t wait to make you my wife \u2665\ufe0f\ud83d\udc51 pic.twitter.com/ry9n2BLYYv \u2014 Valentin (@iamValC) June 14, 2018\n\nIt's the latest happy news for Johnson.
