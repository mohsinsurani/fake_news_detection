Niall Horan responded to Katy Perry saying that the former One Direction hunk is constantly trying to get her number.\n\nEarlier this week, the \u201cSwish Swish\u201d singer, 32, was reminiscing about her time as a guest judge on The X Factor in 2010 when she determined the young singer\u2019s fate on the show. Perry\u2019s deciding vote pushed Horan forward in the competition, where he was later grouped with Harry Styles, Louis Tomlinson, Liam Payne and Zayn Malik to form One Direction.\n\n\u201cNiall\u2019s amazing. I love him, and I think we feel very connected in a way because I, like, have helped him get through The X Factor to join his group,\u201d Perry told Australian radio show Fitzy & Wippa on Wednesday, June 28. \u201cHe\u2019s become a big star and I\u2019m like, \u2018Cool, I guess that means I have taste?\u2019 I don\u2019t know what that means.\u201d\n\nThe pop songstress went on to say that the 23-year-old might be romantically interested in her. \u201cI see him around all the time,\u201d she continued. \u201cHe\u2019s always trying to like, get my number, to like, maybe flirt with me, but I\u2019m like, \u2018I could babysit you. I\u2019m like your mom!\u2019\u201d\n\nHoran responded to Perry\u2019s flirting claims during his appearance on Australian TV show The Project on Thursday, June 28. \u201cKaty, please stop being mean to me,\u201d he joked. \u201cShe\u2019s just finding any excuse now to just patronize me and go around spreading rumors about me. I just want to be your friend!\u201d\n\nHe added that their age difference \u2014 9 years \u2014 isn\u2019t that drastic. \u201cI mean, she is talking like she is about 55 years older than me,\u201d he said. \u201cShe is not that much older than me.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/623562180_niall-horan-katy-perry-zoom-71f8a716-3a7b-4c6f-a771-7df37fd154a8.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/623562180_niall-horan-katy-perry-zoom-71f8a716-3a7b-4c6f-a771-7df37fd154a8.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Megan French"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/niall-horan-responds-to-katy-perrys-flirting-claim-w490471/", "title": "Niall Horan Responds to Katy Perry\u2019s Flirting Claim", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Niall Horan jokingly responded to Katy Perry\u2019s claim that he tried to flirt with her \u2014 find out what he said!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Niall Horan Responds to Katy Perry\u2019s Claim He Flirted With Her", "description": "Niall Horan jokingly responded to Katy Perry\u2019s claim that he tried to flirt with her \u2014 find out what he said!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/niall-horan-responds-to-katy-perrys-flirting-claim-w490471/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:55:05+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/623562180_niall-horan-katy-perry-zoom-71f8a716-3a7b-4c6f-a771-7df37fd154a8.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/623562180_niall-horan-katy-perry-zoom-71f8a716-3a7b-4c6f-a771-7df37fd154a8.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-06-29T19:49:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:55:05+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Niall Horan Responds to Katy Perry\u2019s Claim He Flirted With Her", "description": "Niall Horan jokingly responded to Katy Perry\u2019s claim that he tried to flirt with her \u2014 find out what he said!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/623562180_niall-horan-katy-perry-zoom-71f8a716-3a7b-4c6f-a771-7df37fd154a8.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498765740.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
