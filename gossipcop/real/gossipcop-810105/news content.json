Mr. Dassey, 28, was convicted of participating with his uncle Steven Avery in the 2005 murder of Teresa Halbach, a 25-year-old photographer in Manitowoc, Wis.\n\nThe 10-part Netflix series by the filmmakers Laura Ricciardi and Moira Demos suggested that police investigators unfairly questioned Mr. Dassey when he was 16 without a lawyer or parent present. He appeared scared and unaware of the gravity of his situation on camera, and his lawyers say he had a low IQ in the seventh percentile of children his age, making him susceptible to suggestion.\n\nThe Supreme Court did not offer a reasoning for its decision.\n\nIn a statement, Laura Nirider, a lawyer for Mr. Dassey, said, \u201cWe will continue to fight to free Brendan Dassey.\u201d", "images": ["https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d6904aceac1141af3936e9640e4310ecfe0dbdd7d4eea7886401928392ca3f9b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-articleLarge.jpg?quality=75&auto=webp&disable=upscale"], "top_img": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d6904aceac1141af3936e9640e4310ecfe0dbdd7d4eea7886401928392ca3f9b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Daniel Victor"], "canonical_link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/brendan-dassey-supreme-court.html", "title": "Supreme Court Won\u2019t Hear Appeal of \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Subject Brendan Dassey", "meta_data": {"robots": "noarchive, max-image-preview:large", "description": "Lawyers for Mr. Dassey, whose murder conviction was documented in the 2015 Netflix series, say investigators improperly coerced his confession.", "og": {"url": "https://www.nytimes.com/2018/06/25/us/brendan-dassey-supreme-court.html", "type": "article", "title": "Supreme Court Won\u2019t Hear Appeal of \u2018Making a Murderer\u2019 Subject Brendan Dassey (Published 2018)", "image": {"identifier": "https://static01.nyt.com/images/2018/06/25/us/26xp-dassey/26xp-dassey-facebookJumbo.jpg?year=2018&h=550&w=1050&s=d6904aceac1141af3936e9640e4310ecfe0dbdd7d4eea7886401928392ca3f9b&k=ZQJBKqZ0VN", "alt": "Brendan Dassey in court in 2007.
