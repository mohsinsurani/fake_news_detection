Yandy Smith-Harris (Seasons 2\u201310, cameo appearance in season 1) is an entertainment manager and entrepreneur. She was born in Harlem. In 2004, she graduated from Howard University with a bachelor's degree in business and interned at Violator under the mentorship of Mona Scott-Young. In 2005, Yandy met Jim Jones on a private jet charted by Russell Simmons, and left Violator to manage him full-time. In 2006, Jim approached VH1 executives to make a reality show about him, leading to the filming of an 11-minute presentation tape, Keeping Up with Joneses, produced by Stefan Springman and Toby Barraud of Eastern TV. VH1 were unsure if audiences would be invested in the concept full-time, and Yandy approached Mona to retool the show, and the concept was tweaked to include Jim's girlfriend Chrissy and her circle of friends, becoming what would be later known as Love & Hip Hop. Yandy first appears briefly in an uncredited cameo at Chrissy's proposal party in the first season, before joining the main cast from season two. The season chronicles her struggles while working as Jim's manager and the demise of their professional relationship, culminating in a violent brawl with Chrissy at a Miami nightclub. In July 2012, Yandy gave birth to her first child, Omere Harris. Season three introduces Mendeecees Harris, her child's father and on-again, off-again boyfriend since 2007,[16] and chronicles their engagement and subsequent wedding plans, which are interrupted when Mendeecees is forced to turn himself into custody for multiple drug and trafficking charges. The couple are reunited in season five when Mendeecees is released on bail, and Yandy gives birth to their second child, Skylar Smith Harris, in 2015. On May 25, 2015, Yandy and Mendeecees were married live on VH1 as part of the special Love & Hip Hop Live: The Wedding.[17] While filming the show's sixth season, Mendeecees is sentenced to eight years in jail and turns himself in. Season seven chronicles Yandy's strained relationships with Mendeecees' baby mamas, Samantha and Erika, which explodes into an all-out war, as the women fight for custody for Mendeecees' eldest children, Lil Mendeecees and Aasim. During the season, Yandy admits that her televised wedding was \"symbolic\" and that her marriage to Mendeecees is not legal. Later seasons chronicle Yandy's struggles to repair her broken friendship with Kimbella, having had a falling out behind the scenes in season eight. Their feud intensifies in season nine, when Yandy begins the process of adopting a foster child, Infinity, and Kimbella questions her motivations for doing so, claiming it was all for \"clout\". In season ten, Yandy and Kimbella are once again at each other's throats, after Yandy's nemesis Chrissy returns to New York and reconciles with Kimbella. Later, she prepares for Mendeecees' upcoming release from federal prison. After Mendeecees' release in January 2020, the couple moved to Atlanta and joined the cast of Love & Hip Hop: Atlanta. Yandy also appears in VH1 Family Reunion: Love & Hip Hop Edition, as a guest star in the spin-off show Remy & Papoose: Meet the Mackies and in the specials 40 Greatest Love & Hip Hop Moments, Dirty Little Secrets, The Love Edition, Love & Hip Hop Awards: Most Certified and 40 Greatest Love & Hip Hop Moments: The Reboot.\n\nSeason 3 additions [ edit ]\n\nLove & Hip Hop: New York in season three.
