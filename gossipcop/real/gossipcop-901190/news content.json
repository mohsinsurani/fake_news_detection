Every single thing about our relationship is better,\u201d the 29-year-old Vanderpump Rules star tells Us Weekly exclusively. \u201cI know how much he\u2019s wanting the wedding and how much he\u2019s wanting to marry me, how much effort he\u2019s putting into the wedding, just as much as me. I don\u2019t know, whenever you know somebody as well as I know Jax, you can just tell.\u201d\n\nJax, who popped the question in June, was caught cheating on Brittany with former SURver, Faith Stowers, during season 6. While Brittany, who briefly split from her now fianc\u00e9, tells Us that she is \u201cvery big on forgiveness,\u201d she also admits that it\u2019s difficult to forget what happened.\n\n\u201cIt is hard, trust me, and there are still days, sometimes, when you can\u2019t help but think of horrible things from the past,\u201d Brittany explains. \u201cBut for the most part, we\u2019ve moved mountains in this relationship. I feel like we\u2019re almost starting over, but we\u2019ve grown so much. He does things before I even ask him now. Even just helping around the house. I can just tell in our everyday lives that he\u2019s changed.\u201d\n\nJax, a Florida native, for his part, tells Us that he was \u201cthis person\u201d Brittany is referring to before he moved to Los Angeles.\n\n\u201cI just kind of fell into kind of a deep hole and that happens out here sometimes. You get sucked into this lifestyle,\u201d he says. \u201cYou start hanging out with people you probably shouldn\u2019t, you start doing things you probably shouldn\u2019t and sometimes, you know, you have to fall down to get back up.\u201d\n\nThe former SUR bartender explains that he hit his \u201clowest\u201d point in December 2017 after his father died.\n\n\u201cI hate to use my father as an excuse to pick myself up, [but] I don\u2019t think I would have done it unless something happened, something traumatic needed to happen in my life, and it just so happens it was my father,\u201d Jax tells Us. \u201cHe was kind of that turning point for me to be like, \u2018Enough\u2019s enough.\u2019 I just felt like my dad kind of took my body over and was like, \u2018This is how you\u2019re going to live the rest of your life the way I think you should live it.\u2019 I\u2019m living my everyday \u2014 from now until I die \u2014 how my dad would live his life.\u201d\n\nHe concludes: \u201cMy dad was the best father you can possibly imagine, the best husband you can possibly imagine, and I just want to be just like him. That\u2019s my goal.\u201d\n\nVanderpump Rules returns to Bravo Monday, December 3, at 9 p.m. ET.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-trust.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-trust.jpg?crop=0px%2C10px%2C1800px%2C1017px&resize=1600%2C900&ssl=1&quality=86&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-trust.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/entertainment/news/brittany-cartwright-on-trusting-jax-taylor-after-cheating-scandal/", "title": "Brittany Cartwright on Trusting Jax Taylor After Cheating Scandal", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "article", "post-tags": "Exclusive,Reality TV", "post-cats": "Entertainment", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor opened up exclusively to Us Weekly about moving past his infidelity \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "How Brittany Learned to Trust Jax After Cheating Scandal: \u2018He's Changed'", "description": "Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor opened up exclusively to Us Weekly about moving past his infidelity \u2014 get the details", "url": "/entertainment/news/brittany-cartwright-on-trusting-jax-taylor-after-cheating-scandal/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-27T21:21:33+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-trust.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-trust.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-11-27T21:10:52+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-27T21:21:33+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "How Brittany Learned to Trust Jax After Cheating Scandal: \u2018He's Changed'", "description": "Brittany Cartwright and Jax Taylor opened up exclusively to Us Weekly about moving past his infidelity \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/11/Jax-Taylor-and-Brittany-Cartwright-trust.jpg?crop=0px%2C8px%2C1800px%2C944px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1543353052.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
