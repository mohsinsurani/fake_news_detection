Kate Hudson is making a plea for the go-to workout drink to be\u2026ros\u00e9. On Friday, the 38-year-old actress posted an Instagram video of her demonstrating an innovative arm workout involving two bottles of ros\u00e9. But instead of popping open the bottles to take a mid-workout wine break, Hudson kept them closed and used them as weights for some boozy exercises.\n\nIn the video, a bikini-clad Hudson can be seen standing on a workout mat as her trainer, Nicole Stuart, sipping a glass of ros\u00e9 not too far away, instructs her into arm exercises. Hudson began by lifting the bottles into an overhead press before transitioning to tricep extensions and finishing her workout off with some bicep curls. In the video, Stuart can be seen tweaking Hudson\u2019s form as the actress laughs at their wine-inspired sweat session. \u201cSometimes you gotta to work for it! \ud83c\udf38\u201d Hudson captioned the video.\n\nAnd though Stuart isn\u2019t suggesting that gyms across America replace their dumbbells with wine bottles (a bottle of ros\u00e9 weighs about two pounds, so it\u2019s not exactly the most intense workout), she isn\u2019t saying fitness fans should cut wine out of their diet either. \u201cJust because you\u2019re working out doesn\u2019t mean you can\u2019t have a glass of ros\u00e9\u2014#moderation is the key,\u201d she wrote in the caption of a regram of Hudson\u2019s video.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the first time the Fabletics founder has experimented with unconventional workouts either. The actress has broken a sweat doing everything from pole dancing to using booty belts. And though Hudson kept her bottles of ros\u00e9 closed during her workout (don\u2019t drink and exercise, everyone!), we\u2019re hoping she cracked them open for a celebratory post-workout drink afterward.", "images": ["https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/maybelline-illegal-length-mascara-tiktok.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Mugler-Alien-Goddess-Eau-de-Parfum-Intense.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://trc.taboola.com/1394147/log/3/unip?en=page_view", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Ubeauty.gif?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=146467699155455&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kate-hudson-2017-feat.jpg", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/Marilyn-Monroe.jpg?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/Kylie-Jenner.png?w=120&h=120&crop=1", "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/1-Square.jpg?resize=%2C"], "top_img": "https://stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/kate-hudson-2017-feat.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Jason Pham"], "canonical_link": "https://stylecaster.com/beauty/kate-hudson-arm-workout-rose-wine/", "title": "Kate Hudson\u2019s Killer Arm Workout Involves Two Bottles of Ros\u00e9", "meta_data": {"description": "Kate Hudson blew our minds on Instagram on Saturday when she revealed her killer arm exercise involving two bottles of wine.
