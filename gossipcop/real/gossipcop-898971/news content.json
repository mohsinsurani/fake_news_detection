The towering conifer features gold branches, a variety of gold ball ornaments, countless glowing lights and even a gold-wrapped stand.\n\n\u201cGold is the theme this year,\u201d she captions a video of the tree, with Mariah Carey\u2019s \u201cAll I Want for Christmas Is You\u201d serving as the soundtrack.\n\n\u201cThank you @jeffleatham and team for never failing to make Christmas magic happen,\u201d she adds, calling out the celebrity floral designer and artistic director. Leatham, who split from ex husband Colton Haynes in May, is notably also responsible for the over-the-top holiday decor at Kylie\u2019s mom Kris\u2019s mansion and the glam seasonal installations at Four Seasons hotels around the world.\n\nThis year\u2019s sparkly model at Kylie\u2019s Hidden Hills home replaces last year\u2019s slightly more realistic one, which she called \u201c20 feet of magic\u201d (the gold version appears to be the same size) and featured a faux-snow covering known as flocking.\n\nThe treatment turns up on another of Kylie\u2019s forest of trees for 2018: \u201cI have a neon pink flocked in my bedroom. I literally have trees everywhere this year,\u201d she says in a video documenting a particularly girly one on her Instagram Stories.\n\nThis Christmas will no doubt be extra special for Kylie and boyfriend Travis Scott as they celebrate with their 10-month-old daughter Stormi for the first time. In one video documenting the sparkly tree, the new mom zooms in on a gold ball ornament to capture a selfie in the reflection, with Stormi balanced on her hip.\n\nKylie has always gone big on holiday decor. Last year\u2019s ceiling-scraping flocked tree \u2014 also by Leatham \u2014 was ornamented with massive balls in shades of pink. In 2016, she documented the elaborate process of getting her enormous real tree into her home. It involved a flatbed truck and took several lumberjack-like wranglers to install. That year, she also displayed a massive gingerbread house customized with her name, as well as those of her then-boyfriend, Tyga and his son, King. Her beloved dogs, Bambi, Norman, Ernesto and Penny, were even immortalized in icing.", "images":
