Mindy Kaling has welcomed her first child, a daughter named Katherine Kaling, E! reports.\n\nThe publication reports that Kaling, 38, gave birth on Friday, December 15.\n\nThe Mindy Project creator who has not yet shared the identity of her baby\u2019s father, revealed that she was expecting her first bundle of joy in August while appearing on the Sunday edition of the Today show.\n\nTelling host Willie Geist she was \u201creally excited,\u201d the star added she was ready for a new adventure. \u201cI have a lot of control over a lot of aspects of my life, and this is one where I\u2019m like, \u2018OK, it\u2019s out of my hands,\u2019 which is kind of a fun feeling.\u201d\n\nWhen Geist, 42, asked what type of parent the A Wrinkle in Time actress will be, she responded: \u201cIt\u2019s so easy to criticize parenting until you\u2019re a parent, so one of the nice things about becoming a parent is that I\u2019ll be able to openly criticize other parenting because I will have a child.\u201d\n\nKaling added that her late mother, Swati Roysircar, set a great example. \u201cMy mom was incredibly fierce and so devoted to us, just loved us and really wanted us to be happy no matter what we did,\u201d she said. \u201cMy career choice was not something that she was familiar with and she was just so supportive of that. And if I could give that to my child, just that open-mindedness, I\u2019d be so happy.\u201d\n\nIn October, the Massachusetts native confirmed the sex of her baby while appearing on The Ellen Degeneres Show. \u201cI wanted to know way early. I\u2019m having a girl,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m excited about it.\u201d\n\nAnd just weeks before giving birth, the Inside Out voicer shared the first image of her growing baby bump to Instagram.\n\n\u201cHow I look recording Mindy Lahiri\u2019s lines. \u2018Exsqueeze me, sir?!?!\u2019 #themindyproject #laterbaby,\u201d she captioned cute post in November.\n\nKaling\u2019s pregnancy might not as a surprise to all. The star talked about her desire to have children in an interview with Yahool! Style back in September 2015.\n\n\u201cI think I\u2019ve decided that unlike everything else in my life, I\u2019m going to be fast and loose about kids,\u201d she said at the time.s \u201cI\u2019m going to not actively plan, but if it happens, it would happen. I\u2019m not cavalier about who I would have a kid with. But the thing I ask every parent that I really admire, the one comment they all have is that they wish they had kids earlier.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/846297444_mindy-kaling-zoom.jpg?crop=109px%2C10px%2C1891px%2C993px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/846297444_mindy-kaling-zoom.jpg?crop=109px%2C10px%2C1891px%2C993px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Marc Lupo"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mindy-kaling-gives-birth-to-first-child/", "title": "Mindy Kaling Gives Birth to First Child", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Mindy Kaling has welcomed her first child, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Mindy Kaling Welcomes First Child, a Baby Girl: Details", "description": "Mindy Kaling has welcomed her first child, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/mindy-kaling-gives-birth-to-first-child/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T21:08:50+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/846297444_mindy-kaling-zoom.jpg?crop=109px%2C10px%2C1891px%2C993px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/846297444_mindy-kaling-zoom.jpg?crop=109px%2C10px%2C1891px%2C993px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/marc.lupo.9", "published_time": "2017-12-19T23:50:03+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T21:08:50+00:00"}, "author": "Marc Lupo", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Mindy Kaling Welcomes First Child, a Baby Girl: Details", "description": "Mindy Kaling has welcomed her first child, a baby girl \u2014 get the details!", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/846297444_mindy-kaling-zoom.jpg?crop=109px%2C10px%2C1891px%2C993px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=40&strip=all", "creator": "@Marcandrewlupo", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1513727403.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
