Cardi B gave birth to her first child with husband Offset on Tuesday, July 10.\n\nThe \u201cBodak Yellow\u201d rapper welcomed a girl named Kulture Kiari. She announced the news via Instagram with a nude photo of herself cradling her baby bump.\n\nCardi kept her pregnancy under wraps for months before finally revealing her bump during her stint as a musical guest on an April episode of Saturday Night Live. \u201cI\u2019m finally free!\u201d the 25-year-old remarked as she walked off stage from her performance.\n\nShortly after the happy news was confirmed, Cardi and her sister, Hennessy Carolina, began hinting that the artist was expecting a baby girl. The \u201cBe Careful\u201d rapper confirmed the sex of her little one in a May interview on Howard Stern\u2019s SiriusXM radio show.\n\nIn the months leading up to her daughter\u2019s arrival, the \u201cFinesse\u201d rapper canceled several performances. \u201cShorty keep growing and I be looking like I be moving and everything, but in reality, a bitch barely can breathe,\u201d she told her followers in an April Instagram video.\n\nThe expectant mom didn\u2019t completely quit working, though. \u201cShe\u2019s been taking a ton of meetings with designers for her Fashion Nova Line,\u201d a source told Us Weekly in May. \u201cShe\u2019s stopped doing shows, but she isn\u2019t letting the pregnancy slow her down.\u201d Us also exclusively reported at the time that Cardi was due in July.\n\nThe \u201cI Like It\u201d rapper confirmed in June that she and Offset, 26, secretly married in September 2017. \u201cThere are so many moments that I share with the world and then there are moments that I want to keep for myself! Getting married was one of those moments!\u201d she wrote in a Twitter note at the time. \u201cOur relationship was so new breaking up and making up and we had a lot of growing up to do but we was so in love we didn\u2019t want to lose each other.\u201d\n\nShe continued: \u201cWas one morning in September we woke up and decided to get married. We found someone to marry us, and she did, just the two of us and my cousin. I said I do, with no dress, no makeup and no ring!\u201d\n\nOffset publicly proposed to the artist one month after their top-secret wedding in October 2017 during a Philadelphia concert. Video of what appeared to be the Migos rapper \u2014 who has three children from previous relationships \u2014 in bed with another woman emerged not long after, but Cardi chose to stick with her husband.\n\nFor the latest TV news and interviews, subscribe to our new podcast \u201cWatch With Us\u201d below\n\n", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cardi-b-offset.jpg?crop=260px%2C76px%2C1513px%2C795px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cardi-b-offset.jpg?crop=260px%2C76px%2C1513px%2C795px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Erin Crabtree"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/cardi-b-gives-birth-welcomes-first-child-with-offset/", "title": "Cardi B Gives Birth, Welcomes First Child With Offset", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Cardi B welcomed her first child, a baby girl, with husband Offset \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Cardi B Welcomes First Child With Offset: Find Out the Baby\u2019s Name!", "description": "Cardi B welcomed her first child, a baby girl, with husband Offset \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/cardi-b-gives-birth-welcomes-first-child-with-offset/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-11-29T22:10:13+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cardi-b-offset.jpg?crop=260px%2C76px%2C1513px%2C795px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cardi-b-offset.jpg?crop=260px%2C76px%2C1513px%2C795px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-07-11T14:42:44+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-11-29T22:10:13+00:00"}, "author": "Erin Crabtree", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Cardi B Welcomes First Child With Offset: Find Out the Baby\u2019s Name!", "description": "Cardi B welcomed her first child, a baby girl, with husband Offset \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/cardi-b-offset.jpg?crop=260px%2C76px%2C1513px%2C795px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=55&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531320164.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
