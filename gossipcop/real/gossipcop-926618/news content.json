The women of the show gathered on a special Los Angeles edition of \u201cWatch What Happens Live With Andy Cohen\u201d last night. The stars joined Cohen on stage at the Wiltern Theatre to answer some fan questions and things escalated quickly. The ladies did not hold back on their snarky comments toward not only one another but audience members.\n\nThrowing shade\n\nAccording to E! News, one fan asked the stars what their taglines for each other would be.\n\nCohen said that Lisa Vanderpump had a \u201cvery shady one\u201d for her fellow co-star and fremeny Lisa Rinna. Vanderpump admitted, \"Oh, I just said, \u2018Go back to selling dusters and diapers.\u201d This was an obvious reference to Lisa Rinna\u2019s clothing line on QVC and her once appearing in a Depend commercial.\n\nRinna, who is known on the show for not holding back was quick to reply, \"And guess what, honey? Guess what? Do you know how much I've made on those dusters and diapers? A lot more than your restaurants I'm sure.\" This was once again a very obvious reference to Vanderpump\u2019s many restaurants, which includes the very popular SUR (the home base of hit show \"Vanderpump Rules\").\n\nFans as well as friend and co-star Kyle Richards appeared shocked at the shade although they probably should not have been because Rinna and Vanderpump have a very rocky friendship history.\n\nEven more drama\n\nBut this was just the start of the night\u2019s shady comments. A fan asked Dorit Kemsley, \"which glass goes well with coke?\" This question was about a few incidents involving Kemsley. One being her distaste when she was given Rose wine in a champagne glass and then of course it hinted at the infamous implication that Rinna made inferring Kemsley was doing cocaine during a dinner party.\n\nA claim that Kemsley fiercely denied.\n\nKemsley, who, according to her co-stars and fans, was the \u201cpot stirrer\u201d of the season, had no problem clapping back, saying: \"I wouldn't know, sour patch.\" She then went on to insult the fact that the questioner wanted to set up her son with Cohen, adding, \"I wonder why your son's having trouble getting married.\"\n\nEven Cohen seemed shocked by the shade happening on his late night talk show. This \u201cWatch What Happens Live\u201d seems to be foreshadowing the drama of the upcoming \u201cReal Housewives of beverly hills\u201d reunion.\n\nBe sure to tune in to all the drama every Tuesday at 9PM on Bravo.", "images": ["https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/4/11/660x290/b_1200x630x75/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-stars-on-wwhl-image-instagramkyle-richards_1932021.jpg", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=17805153&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/4/11/660x290/b_502x220x75/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-stars-on-wwhl-image-instagramkyle-richards_1932021.jpg", "https://certify.alexametrics.com/atrk.gif?account=qZVHm1akKd6070", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/0/638/profile_638977_1468627419.jpg", "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/authors/ba_45x45/profile/5/60/profile_5060741_1520274500.jpg"], "top_img": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/4/11/660x290/b_1200x630x75/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-stars-on-wwhl-image-instagramkyle-richards_1932021.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Read More On The Same Topic Stephanie Denning", "Stassi Schroeder", "Her Boyfriend S European Adventure", "Audrina Patridge", "Ryan Cabrera Are Rekindling Their 'Hills' Romance", "Miley Cyrus Retracts Apology For Her Infamous Vanity Fair Cover"], "canonical_link": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2018/04/real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-throw-shade-during-interview-with-andy-cohen-002499203.html", "title": "'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' throw shade during interview with Andy Cohen", "meta_data": {"robots": "follow, max-image-preview:large", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, maximum-scale=5, user-scalable=0", "description": "The claws were out during the most recent episode of Andy Cohen's talk show.", "news_keywords": "Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, beverly hills, Andy Cohen", "fb": {"app_id": 459022437543956, "pages": 556225464427184}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Blasting News", "url": "https://us.blastingnews.com/showbiz-tv/2018/04/real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-throw-shade-during-interview-with-andy-cohen-002499203.html", "locale": "en_US", "title": "'Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' throw shade during interview with Andy Cohen", "image": {"identifier": "https://staticr1.blastingcdn.com/media/photogallery/2018/4/11/660x290/b_1200x630x75/the-real-housewives-of-beverly-hills-stars-on-wwhl-image-instagramkyle-richards_1932021.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630, "alt": "'The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills' stars on 'WWHL.'
