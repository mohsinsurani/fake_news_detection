The 38-year-old actress announced on Friday, April 6, that she is expecting a baby girl with her boyfriend, Danny Fujikawa.\n\n\u201cSURPRISE!!! \ud83e\udd31 If you\u2019ve wondered why I\u2019ve been so absent on my social channels it\u2019s because I have never been more sick! It\u2019s was the most sick first trimester of all my children,\u201d the Almost Famous star captioned a video of her gender reveal on Instagram. \u201cBoomerangs have made me nauseous, Superzoom is an easy way to have my head in the toilet, food instagrams make me queezy and thinking too much about insta stories made me even more exhausted than I already had been. If you\u2019ve seen me out and about smiling and pretending like everything is amazing\u2026I was lying!\u201d\n\n\u201cBUT! I have broken through on the other end of that and rediscovering the joys of insta/snap. We have been trying to keep this pregnancy under the radar for as long as possible but I\u2019m a poppin now!\u201d she continued. \u201cAnd it\u2019s too darn challenging to hide, and frankly hiding is more exhausting then just coming out with it! My kids, Danny, myself and the entire family are crazy excited! A little girl on the way \ud83d\udc95.\u201d\n\nHudson and Fujikawa celebrated their one-year anniversary in December 2017. The couple, who made their red carpet debut in May, first met when the How to Lose a Guy In 10 Days actress was 23.\n\n\u201cThe first time I met Danny I was 23 and enormously pregnant with Ryder. His step sisters are my best friends @sarafoster @erinfoster and so it goes we have been in the same circle for over a decade!\u201d Hudson explained in December via Instagram. \u201cA year ago today Danny took me on a hike and what I thought was just a hike with a family friend turned very quickly into an unexpected first date. No moves were made on this first date. In fact, it took months for him to make a first move! And as a kiss on this bridge would have been nice, the kiss a year later was so much sweeter.\u201d\n\nThe Pretty Happy author shares Ryder, 14, with ex-husband Chris Robinson, whom she was married to from 2000 to 2007. She also shares son Bingham, 6, with her ex-fianc\u00e9 Matthew Bellamy.", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/danny-fujikawa-kate-hudson.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2216px%2C1164px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/danny-fujikawa-kate-hudson.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2216px%2C1164px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Sarah Hearon"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kate-hudson-is-pregnant-expecting-baby-girl-with-danny-fujikawa/", "title": "Kate Hudson Is Pregnant, Expecting Baby Girl With Danny Fujikawa", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity Moms", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Kate Hudson announced she is pregnant and expecting her a baby girl with her boyfriend, Danny Fujikawa \u2014 get the details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Kate Hudson Reveals She\u2019s Pregnant With Baby No. 3: \u2018Surprise!!!\u2019", "description": "Kate Hudson announced she is pregnant and expecting her a baby girl with her boyfriend, Danny Fujikawa \u2014 get the details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-moms/news/kate-hudson-is-pregnant-expecting-baby-girl-with-danny-fujikawa/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2021-09-13T21:46:24+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/danny-fujikawa-kate-hudson.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2216px%2C1164px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/danny-fujikawa-kate-hudson.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2216px%2C1164px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2018-04-06T17:35:00+00:00", "modified_time": "2021-09-13T21:46:24+00:00"}, "author": "Sarah Hearon", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Kate Hudson Reveals She\u2019s Pregnant With Baby No. 3: \u2018Surprise!!!\u2019", "description": "Kate Hudson announced she is pregnant and expecting her a baby girl with her boyfriend, Danny Fujikawa \u2014 get the details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/danny-fujikawa-kate-hudson.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2216px%2C1164px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=70&strip=all", "creator": "@sarahhearon", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1523036100.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
