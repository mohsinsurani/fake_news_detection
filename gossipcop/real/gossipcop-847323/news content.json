He never gets permission, but he always gets forgiven if his reckless behavior gets results. So in \u201cI Surrender\u201d Bryan goes AWOL after Mejia. In a series of quick leaps and bounds, Mejia, Asha, Bryan and the ODNI team end up on Mexico.\n\nWe open with ODNI being briefed on Asha\u2019s kidnapping. They finally know a little about Bryan\u2019s personal life. Then we see Bryan hitching a ride on backroads. The woman who picks him up, imagines herself a contestant on a tv talent show. She mistakes Bryan\u2019s explanation, \u201cSomeone took my girlfriend,\u201d as a melancholy Country/Western theme. (Here is another personality, like Leah, who we are instantly drawn to, but we\u2019ll never see again.)\n\nAs Bryan hitchhikes across country to stay off the grid, we need reminding of what Bryan is after, with an escape attempt by his damsel and a phone call.\n\nBryan then strong arms Mejia\u2019s business contacts to find out where Mejia might seek help. He then manipulates Mejia\u2019s ex-wife to give him information on the tunnels leading to Mexico.\n\nBryan is further delayed when Hart\u2019s team shows up and tries talking him down.\n\nEven though Bryan\u2019s journey would take longer than Mejia \u2013 who had a head start, had people helping him, and knew exactly where he was going \u2013 somehow Bryan ends up in the tunnel at the same time as Mejia.\n\nGranted, Asha\u2019s lackluster attempts at escaping may have eaten up two minutes of screen time, but I don\u2019t think it would make up for the difference in time Bryan would have needed to get in the tunnels at that exact moment.\n\nInside the tunnel Bryan shoots Elena, who falls into a wall. Apparently Elena\u2019s ninety-pound frame falling against the wall is enough to collapse the tunnel. The team then catches up to Bryan in the tunnels. In a speech involving more words than the writers have given Bryan since the pilot, Bryan insists he isn\u2019t coming back to ODNI. (Seriously, I\u2019d almost forgotten how good Clive Standen\u2019s American accent was because we rarely hear anything but, \u201cI\u2019m good.\u201d) The team decides they\u2019ll help Bryan, even though they wanted to bring him in before the last commercial break.\n\nHart still doesn\u2019t completely trust Bryan\u2019s thinking, but Christina respects John\u2019s opinion, so she flip flops again.\n\nThey learn from Agent Salt of an illegal arms operation in Juarez, Mexico set up by the Deputy Director of the FBI. Discovering and procuring guns takes all of thirty seconds. And it takes another five seconds to determine Mejia\u2019s location. (Bryan at least forces his team to think on their toes and cut red tape this season. Didn\u2019t Hart say it took hundreds or thousands of man hours for these operations? This one took 35 seconds.)\n\nThe action is slowed to a crawl, as the team looks around corners, opens doors, and quietly takes out Mejia\u2019s bumbling guards. It may have created a realistic feel, to have us hearing the fiesta music in the background, but it made the scene even less suspenseful.\n\nAsha makes a run for it when Mejia learns of the authorities and shoots his cousin. He tells everyone they all betrayed him. The idea that Mejia would be betrayed, only comes from Mejia\u2019s rantings and a quick mention from Bryan earlier. The writers could have built up the betrayal, and some actual tension, with some spicy cat and mouse conversation over dinner in Mejia\u2019s court, instead of having us watch Asha attempt to simply walk out the front door. (smh)\n\nChaos ensues as the party breaks up. Asha stops in the kitchen when Mejia shoots. Then for some unknown reason, Mejia puts his gun away.\n\nThis allows Asha time to attack Mejia with a knife, instead of RUNNING. And since she has already proven to have none of Bryan\u2019s skills, Mejia wrestles the knife to her throat as Bryan arrives. Bryan watches as Mejia slices her throat telling Bryan, \u201cYou choose. Me or her.\u201d\n\nThis promised to be a great scene. I actually held my breath. Instead, Bryan has the option of leaving Asha in John\u2019s trusting hands. Bryan doesn\u2019t know if she will survive, but John scoops her up to an awaiting medivac, destroying any suspense for me. Bryan bumps into Mejia at the end of the line, both cornered by Mexican forces.\n\nAfter some tense staring, Bryan is triggered by Mejia\u2019s, \u201cI surrender. Goodbye.\u201d Bryan shoots Mejia clean in the head, and is shot himself, in his bullet proof vest. Bryan is taken by the Mexican authorities. The last scene is Bryan raising his head in a prison cell.\n\nThis was the season finale of an action series, yet the only action in this episode, is Bryan slamming into a car\u2019s windshield and hopping out of a ground level window \u2013 hopping \u2013 while being chased by a colleague who is of no threat to him WHATSOEVER. Asha by contrast had four failed escape scenes that lacked any suspense or drama.\n\nWill \u2018Taken\u2019 be renewed? For his sake I hope Bryan doesn\u2019t rot in television purgatory. My take on the season as a whole, is that it was different and exciting, but it lost its rhythm after the first few episodes. When Bryan tells the truck driver he \u201ccan cook,\u201d it underscores that we still know very little about his, or any character on the show. Some episodes were so fast paced that the audience couldn\u2019t breathe or follow the plot jumps. Lulls in action were filled with melodramatic pauses, the development of characters we never see again(at least we saw Salt again this week), or the reiteration of obvious storylines. Do the writers assume the audience is brain dead at 10pm? Granted many did tune in after two hours of a tv talent contest.\n\nIf \u2018Taken\u2019 is renewed, I hope a rewrite and better time slot are \u201ctaken\u201d into consideration.\n\nCatch up on the recaps for all of Season One of \u2018Taken\u2019 HERE!\n\npicture source: https://www.nbc.com", "images":
