And while that looked like it hurt, Shannon\u2019s sniffles were deeper.\n\n\u201cThis ring doesn\u2019t represent David to me,\u201d she explained, holding back tears. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t represent David, it represents that I was a wife and a mother. I have kids. This has just been who I am.\u201d\n\n\u201cTo me it\u2019s a big deal,\u201d she added. \u201cTo not be wearing a wedding ring means that you don\u2019t have your whole family together anymore. And that\u2019s just a devastating reality.\u201d\n\nJerod Harris/WireImage\n\nShannon and David split back in September, and have had a contentious divorce since. Her decision to remove her ring came three months after they separated, as Shannon learned about David\u2019s new girlfriend.\n\n\u201cI feel bad for Shannon,\u201d Judge, 50, explained. \u201cWe talk about what she\u2019s going through in her divorce all the time. But honestly, he\u2019s moved on. It\u2019s time for her to move on. Sign the divorce papers and figure out the next part of your life.\u201d\n\nJudge went on to tell Shannon about David\u2019s new relationship, explaining that David had been commenting on her Instagram posts as soon as October.\n\n\u201cAfter I found out David had a girlfriend, of course I started stalking her,\u201d Judge told viewers. \u201cAnd I saw that they had been communicating as far back as maybe when they were married.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the thing that\u2019s so frustrating to me. You\u2019re married for 17 years and you find out, a little less than three months after that marriage ends that your husband\u2019s with someone?\u201d Judge continued to Shannon. \u201cI don\u2019t know, I think it\u2019s probably one of the hardest things you can hear.\u201d\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Shannon Beador on Single Life After Divorce: \u2018I Am Dating a Little Now!\u2019\n\nAs frustrated as Judge was by that news, Shannon seemed unfazed.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t now\u2026 It\u2019s over. It doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m done. You know what? I\u2019m done. It\u2019s over. Thank God.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe bottom line is, the marriage is over. And I can handle it and I can cope with it,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t want it to ever get back together. I\u2019m never going to go back.\u201d\n\nThe Real Housewives of Orange County airs Mondays at 9 p.m. ET on Bravo.", "images":
