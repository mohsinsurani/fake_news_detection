In an interview with Vanity Fair, she said she learned she was pregnant just before the Australian Open, which she won.\n\n\u201cIf you would have told me last year in October or November that I would have a baby, not be pregnant but have a baby, I would have thought you were the biggest liar in the world,\u201d Williams told Vanity Fair.\n\n\u201cThis is kind of how I am right now. This is happening sooner than later, and it\u2019s going by so fast.\u201d\n\nShe is having the baby with her fiance, the Reddit co-founder Alexis Ohanian. The article accompanying the Vanity Fair photo tells the story of their relationship.\n\nCheck out my Vanity Fair Cover. Question- what do u guys think boy or girl?
