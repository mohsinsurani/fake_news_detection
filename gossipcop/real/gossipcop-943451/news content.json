When the first film premiered in 2004, superhero movies weren't big spectacles \u2014 or at least not as significant as they are today, with Marvel's films alone raking in billions of dollars in the box office. Now, audiences are starved for big-budget, larger-than-life superhero movies, but they're also parched for good stories; those cleverly upend the superhero formula but also take advantage of it in ways that feel novel surprising.\n\nIs 'Incredibles 2' Worth The Wait?\n\nMake no mistake: this is a superhero film. The usual suspects are present: a world is in peril, a villain is causing trouble, many things are at stake, and the Parr family must save the world. But this is also a film with Pixar's stamp of quality, which means the tropes are never just mere embellishments, but part of a larger ploy to tell a story with enormous heart and ingenuity. As such, even with the film industry inundated with superhero stories that have been told many times over, Incredibles 2 feels fresh, smart, and keen. But is it a worthy sequel?\n\nHere's what the critics are saying.\n\nIncredibles 2 Review Roundup\n\nCinemablend: \"Rather than being a disappointment, it is instead a shining example of how to do a follow-up properly \u2014 wonderfully advancing the fantastic established characters and world, playing with smart, modern themes, and featuring beautiful, engaging and fascinatingly-consistent animation.\"\n\nVox: \"Incredibles 2 lacks some of the tight plotting, well-choreographed action, and emotional moments of its predecessor, but it's still a boatload of fun.\"\n\nScreen Rant: \"It's a mostly fun and enjoyable summer family movie \u2014 though, with a nearly two-hour runtime, some children may struggle to stay engaged. Still, considering the strong and forward-thinking films Pixar has produced in recent years, Incredibles 2 is a sequel that arrived a decade too late.\"\n\nChicago Tribune: \"Others will disagree, but to me, Incredibles 2 falls short of the level of Toy Story 2 or Finding Dory. Those Pixar sequels wholly justified their existence in many satisfying ways, while doing their corporate duty and making hundreds of millions.\"\n\nConsequence of Sound: \"It's as bright and visually inventive as its predecessor, and finds cheeky new outlets for [Bard] Bird's unbridled cinematic sensibilities.\"\n\nRogerEbert.com: \"Incredibles 2 understands something that most family sequels, even the Pixar ones, fail to comprehend \u2014 we don't just want to repeat something we loved before. We want to love it all over again. You will with Incredibles 2.\"\n\nVulture: \"Brad Bird's Incredibles 2 is, much like its predecessor, delightful as an animated feature but really, really delightful as a superhero picture. It's proof that someone (not anyone, mainly Bird) can make a Marvel-type movie that's fleet and shapely, with action sequences rich in style rather than tumult.\"\n\nSlate: \"Incredibles 2 is a movie that lavishes attention on the details but loses sight of the whole, where you can't see the forest for the meticulously rendered trees.\"\n\nThe Village Voice: \"Pixar's not-so-secret secret has always been that they understand parenting better than anyone else who makes movies for children. And Incredibles 2 is at its best \u2014 which is to say, it's funniest and most exciting \u2014 when it tackles the internal dynamics of the family itself.\"\n\nVariety: \"The new movie, energized as it is, too often feels like warmed-over sloppy seconds, with a what-do-we-do-now? Riff that turns into an overly on-the-nose plot.\"\n\nIncredibles 2 opens June 15.\n\n\u24d2 2022 TECHTIMES.com All rights reserved.
