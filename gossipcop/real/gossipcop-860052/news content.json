Maybe a few guest spots on some shows that I\u2019m a fan of and maybe another TV show where I\u2019m the star of it, in the future. That\u2019s what I hope.\u201d\n\nThe former Nickelodeon star also said that she\u2019s been sober for three years. In 2014, Bynes was arrested for suspicion of driving under the influence.

And I love it,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019ve learned how to sew, I\u2019ve made patterns, and I want to start a clothing line in the future, so FIDM has been helping me with that. Other than that I hike, I go spinning \u2014 I take spinning classes \u2014 and I feed the homeless. And that\u2019s been really interesting and fun.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.thewrap.com/wp-content/themes/thewrap-canvas/imgs/tw_red.png",
