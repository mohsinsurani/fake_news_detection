Faris, who appeared in the popular early 2000\u2019s \u201cScary Movie\u201d franchise and can currently be seen on the silver screen sleeper hit \u201cOverboard,\u201d a remake of the iconic 1980s comedy, purchased the property in late 2005 for $1.995 million and shared it with her first ex-husband, actor Ben Indra, before she shared it with her now second ex-husband, sit-com actor turned action flick star Chris Pratt. Tucked into a secluded cul-de-sac on two street-to-street parcels that together span nearly an acre of mostly hillside land, the single-story, 1950s ranch-style residence has three bedrooms and 2.5 bathrooms in 2,563-square-feet.\n\nWith a chunky fireplace and lustrous, honey-toned hardwood floors that run throughout the house, the combination living and dining room opens through a wall of wood-trimmed floor-to-ceiling picture windows to a lagoon-style swimming pool and flagstone paved terrace surrounded by tropical plantings. Upgraded with up-to-date appliances and loads of storage, the kitchen includes a breakfast area with glass sliders to a small terrace perfect for a barbecue. Both guest bedrooms open to secluded patios as does the master suite that also offers a wall of closets and what marketing materials described as \u201can indulgent hotel spa-style bath\u201d with steam shower. A railroad tie staircase climbs the steep and planted hillside behind swimming pool and house to a picturesque, partly flag stone paved plateau with fire pit, Bocci ball court and through the trees canyon and city lights view.\n\nThe year after they made a baby in 2012, Faris and Pratt upgraded to a larger, approximately 4,300-square-foot Mediterranean residence almost directly across the street they scooped up in early 2013 for $3.3 million from Live Nation Entertainment president and CEO Michael Rapino.\n\nListing photos: Core Real Estate Group", "images": ["https://www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/annafaris_hhs1.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/annafaris_hhs1.jpg?w=1000", "https://www.dirt.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-dirt-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1"], "top_img": "https://www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/annafaris_hhs1.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Mark David"], "canonical_link": "https://www.dirt.com/entertainers/actors/anna-faris-hollywood-hills-home-overboard-1202907839/", "title": "Anna Faris Sheds Hollywood Hills House", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Anna Faris sold her former home in the Hollywood Hills for almost $2.1 million, just over the not quite $2 million she paid 13 years ago", "news_keywords": "Anna Faris", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Mark David", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "DIRT", "application-name": "DIRT", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202907839, "title": "Anna Faris Sheds Hollywood Hills House", "published_at": "2018-08-16 12:24:21", "image": "https://www.dirt.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/annafaris_hhs1.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 1, "tags": "Anna Faris", "topics": "Entertainers", "body": "\u201cMom\u201d star Anna Faris had to settle for substantially less than its original $2.5 million asking price but she sold her former home in the Nichols Canyon area of Los Angeles, Calif. for $2.09 million.
