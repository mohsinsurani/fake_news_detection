The show originally premiered three years ago, but was revived by Raftery after President Donald Trump rolled back bathroom guidelines for transgender students.\n\nIn an interview with V Magazine, Raftery described Wintour\u2019s decision to donate her sunglasses to the auction, which also includes a $1,000 gift certificate for the men\u2019s clothing store Bergdorf Goodman, as \u201cthrilling.\u201d He added: \u201cI\u2019m very happy that the proceeds\u200b will\u200b benefit this organization so dear to me and\u200b necessary to\u200b thousands of LGBT youth across the country.\u201d\n\n[H/T Refinery29]\n\nWrite to Kate Samuelson at kate.samuelson@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/black-history-movies-01.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gettyimages-507523168.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gettyimages-507523168.jpg?quality=85&w=3000", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/04/kanye-west-jewelry-line.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gettyimages-507523168.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kate Samuelson"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4732927/anna-wintour-auction-sunglasses-trevor-project/", "title": "Why Anna Wintour Is Auctioning Off Her Chanel Sunglasses", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Find out why Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor-in-chief, is auctioning off a pair of her Chanel sunglasses to raise money for The Trevor Project.", "og": {"title": "Why Anna Wintour Is Auctioning Off a Pair of Her Chanel Sunglasses", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4732927/anna-wintour-auction-sunglasses-trevor-project/", "description": "It\u2019s for a very good cause", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gettyimages-507523168.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4732927/anna-wintour-auction-sunglasses-trevor-project/", "description": "Find out why Anna Wintour, Vogue's editor-in-chief, is auctioning off a pair of her Chanel sunglasses to raise money for The Trevor Project.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gettyimages-507523168.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4732927/anna-wintour-auction-sunglasses-trevor-project/", "title": "Why Anna Wintour Is Auctioning Off a Pair of Her Chanel Sunglasses", "description": "It\u2019s for a very good cause", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/gettyimages-507523168.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
