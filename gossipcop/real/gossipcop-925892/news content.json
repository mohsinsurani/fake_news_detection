(sic)\u201d\n\nIt isn\u2019t the first time Daniel has shared an update on the Terminator actor\u2019s condition, as he previously posted a note which described what had happened since the actor went to a hospital.\n\nIt read: \u201cYesterday, Governor Schwarzenegger underwent a planned procedure at Cedars-Sinai to replace a pulmonic valve that was originally replaced due to a congenital heart defect in 1997.\n\n\u201cThat 1997 replacement valve was never meant to be permanent, and has outlived its life expectancy, so he chose to replace it yesterday through a less-invasive catheter valve replacement.\n\n\u201cDuring that procedure, an open-heart surgery team was prepared, as they frequently are in these circumstances, in case the catheter procedure was unable to be performed.\n\n\u201cGovernor Schwarzenegger\u2019s pulmonic valve was successfully replaced and he is currently recovering from the surgery and in a stable condition. We want to thank the entire medical team for their tireless efforts.\u201d\n\nAnd the rep then took to Twitter again a few hours later to let fans know the \u2018Predator\u2019 actor was awake and in \u201cgood spirits\u201d.\n\nHe tweeted: \u201cUpdate: @Schwarzenegger is awake and his first words were actually \u201cI\u2019m back\u201d, so he is in good spirits. (sic)\u201d\n\nEarlier this week, Schwarzenegger shared an update of his own on Twitter when he let fans know he was \u201cthankful\u201d to be awake and in good health.\n\nHe said: \u201cIt\u2019s true: I\u2019m back! I went to sleep expecting to wake up with a small incision and woke up with a big one - but guess what? I woke up, and that\u2019s something to be thankful for. Thank you to the doctors & nurses. And I\u2019m truly filled with gratitude for all of the kind messages.
