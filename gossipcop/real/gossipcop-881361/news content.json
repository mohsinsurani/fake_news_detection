Symptoms of the condition, which affects some women after giving birth, can include extreme sadness and anxiety.\n\n\u201cIt was a very challenging emotional time for me because I felt like I was not living up to my potential as a parent or as an entrepreneur and executive,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI had had such easy pregnancies that in some way, the juxtaposition hit me even harder.\u201d\n\nWhen host Dr. Mehmet Oz asked, why talk about postpartum depression? Trump laughed and said that she hadn\u2019t planned to discuss the topic until he asked.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s incredibly important,\u201d she said. \u201cLook, I consider myself a very hard-charging person. I am ambitious. I\u2019m passionate. I\u2019m driven, but this is something that affects parents all over the country.\u201d\n\nResearch from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention shows that about one in nine women experiences postpartum depression. With the reveal, Trump joins actress Lena Headey, model Chrissy Teigen and singer Adele, who all went public with their postpartum struggles.\n\nMothers who have a personal or family history of depression and those who abuse alcohol are more likely than others to experience postpartum symptoms. Other factors \u2013 including stress, low social support, and pregnancy or birth complications \u2013 also place women at higher risk of postpartum depression.\n\nThe US Preventive Services Task Force recommends cognitive behavioral therapy or counseling for women with the condition.\n\nTrump told Oz that her decisions \u201cweigh much heavier\u201d now that they are \u201cimpacting people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\n\u201cOne thing that I continue to do is meditate,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s been enormously helpful to me.\u201d\n\nShe added that it is difficult to find the time since her children wake early but that an investment of 15 or 20 minutes every morning \u201crecharges\u201d her and is \u201calmost the equivalent\u201d of hours of sleep.\n\n\u2018I don\u2019t view it as my obligation to moderate\u2019\n\nIn January, Ivanka Trump\u2019s family relocated to Washington from New York City so that both Trump and Kushner could accept positions as senior advisers in her father\u2019s administration. Though at first her position was voluntary, as of March 30, she has served as an unpaid employee in the White House, as has Kushner.\n\nTrump has voiced support for women\u2019s rights and a paid family leave program, yet some critics say she has not exerted enough of a positive influence on her father\u2019s agenda, particularly his health care policy.\n\nWhen Oz asked for her response to the expectation that she be a \u201cvoice of moderation\u201d in the White House, Trump said, \u201cwhere I disagree with the agenda, I\u2019ll share it with him quietly, but I don\u2019t view it as my obligation to moderate.\u201d\n\nOne of Trump\u2019s causes: fighting human trafficking. This week, she delivered a speech on the issue at the United Nations General Assembly.\n\nJoin the conversation See the latest news and share your comments with CNN Health on Facebook and Twitter.\n\n\u201cWe cannot stand by in silence,\u201d Trump said, referring to human trafficking as \u201cthe greatest human rights issue of our time.\u201d\n\nTrump, who participated in the UN session as a guest of British Prime Minister Theresa May, has made combating human trafficking in the US and around the world a key aspect of her White House portfolio. She organized a listening session with survivors and advocates alongside her father in late February, and in May held a roundtable discussion on the topic.", "images": ["https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170707125541-lena-headey.jpg?q=x_5,y_161,h_2767,w_4917,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170906171135-trump-ivanka-daddy-north-dakota.jpg?q=x_386,y_77,h_845,w_1502,c_crop/h_144,w_256", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170920132319-ivanka-trump-postpartum-depression-dr-oz.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1072,w_1905,c_crop/w_800", "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/161129183609-newborn-bracelet.jpg?q=x_560,y_316,h_1539,w_2736,c_crop/h_144,w_256"], "top_img": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170920132319-ivanka-trump-postpartum-depression-dr-oz.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1072,w_1905,c_crop/w_800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Susan Scutti"], "canonical_link": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/health/ivanka-trump-postpartum-depression-dr-oz/index.html", "title": "Ivanka Trump reveals struggle with postpartum depression", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,shrink-to-fit=no", "og": {"title": "Ivanka Trump reveals struggle with postpartum depression | CNN", "description": "After the births of each of her three children, Ivanka Trump says during an interview for \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" she struggled with postpartum depression.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170920132319-ivanka-trump-postpartum-depression-dr-oz.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1072,w_1905,c_crop/w_800", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.cnn.com/2017/09/20/health/ivanka-trump-postpartum-depression-dr-oz/index.html", "site_name": "CNN"}, "twitter": {"title": "Ivanka Trump reveals struggle with postpartum depression | CNN", "description": "After the births of each of her three children, Ivanka Trump says during an interview for \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" she struggled with postpartum depression.", "image": "https://media.cnn.com/api/v1/images/stellar/prod/170920132319-ivanka-trump-postpartum-depression-dr-oz.jpg?q=x_2,y_0,h_1072,w_1905,c_crop/w_800", "card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@CNN"}, "description": "After the births of each of her three children, Ivanka Trump says during an interview for \"The Dr. Oz Show,\" she struggled with postpartum depression.", "template_type": "article_leaf", "type": "article", "meta-section": "health", "theme": "health", "article": {"published_time": "2017-09-20T18:09:26Z", "modified_time": "2017-09-21T05:41:46Z", "tag": "business and industry sectors, business figures, business, economy and trade, celebrities, crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, depression, diseases and disorders, donald trump, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, health and medical, health care, health care policy and law, health insurance, human rights, human rights violations, human trafficking, insurance, international relations and national security, ivanka trump, jared kushner, law and legal system, maternal and child health, medical fields and specialties, mehmet oz, mental health, mental illnesses, obstetrics and gynecology, political figures - us, postpartum depression, pregnancy and childbirth, slavery, us federal government, white house, women's health", "publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/CNN"}, "keywords": "business and industry sectors, business figures, business, economy and trade, celebrities, crime, law enforcement and corrections, crimes against persons, criminal offenses, depression, diseases and disorders, donald trump, government and public administration, government bodies and offices, health and medical, health care, health care policy and law, health insurance, human rights, human rights violations, human trafficking, insurance, international relations and national security, ivanka trump, jared kushner, law and legal system, maternal and child health, medical fields and specialties, mehmet oz, mental health, mental illnesses, obstetrics and gynecology, political figures - us, postpartum depression, pregnancy and childbirth, slavery, us federal government, white house, women's health", "author": "Susan Scutti", "fb": {"app_id": 80401312489}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1505862000.0, "source": "https://www.cnn.com", "summary": ""}
