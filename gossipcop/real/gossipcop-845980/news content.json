This book, however, is fine as hell.\u201d\u2014Sophia Amoruso, author of #Girlboss\n\n\n\n\u201cThe funniest cry for help you'll read this year.\u201d\u2014BJ Novak\n\n\n\nWell, well, well. Look at you, ogling my book page....I presume if you\u2019re reading this it means you either need more encouragement to buy it or we used to date and you\u2019re trying to figure out if you should sue me or not.\n\n\n\nHere are all the stories and mistakes I\u2019ve made that were way too embarrassing to tell on stage in front of an actual audience; but thanks to not-so-modern technology, you can read about them here so I don\u2019t have to risk having your judgmental eye contact crush my self-esteem. This book contains some delicious schadenfreude in which I recall such humiliating debacles as breaking my shoulder while trying to impress a guy, coming very close to spending my life in a Guatemalan prison, and having my lacerated ear sewn back on by a deaf guy after losing it in a torrid love affair. In addition to hoarding mortifying situations that\u2019ll make you feel way better about your choices, I\u2019ve also accumulated a lot of knowledge from therapists, psychotherapists, and psychopaths, which can probably help you avoid making the same mistakes I\u2019ve made. Think of this book as everything you\u2019d want from the Internet all in one place, except without the constant distractions of ads, online shopping, and porn.\n\n\n\nI\u2019m not sure what else to say to say, except that you should buy it if you want to laugh and learn how to stop being crazy. And if we used to date, see you in court.", "images": ["https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/91lj93aU1-L._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71PMZmza7OL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/e76ea405-0bd7-4b8c-bdd4-effb048243eb._CR0,0,960,960_SX48_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/Audible/Homestead/logo/audiblelogo._CB482869198_.png", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/B1Eoc0T5TnS._CR0,504,3024,3024_UX175.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/joinClubsImage._CB409113671_.svg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/61gbykPGT7L._CR0,204,1224,1224_UX175.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/9184+m2A10L._AC_UL116_SR116,116_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/714Le3rW0oL._CR0,336,1117,1117_UX175.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/gno/sprites/nav-sprite-global-1x-hm-dsk-reorg._CB405937547_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/81YrkuQ2xJL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51Wxp4wnveL._CR0,2,615,615_UX175.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/grey-pixel.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/816PexvEfOL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/app/QR-store-link-kindle-app._CB626291935_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/4135uNAONwL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/common/transparent-pixel._V192234675_.gif", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/11RNLXhvOXL.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:147-5437970-5750546:GY3YKBA0B3943Y2PHJ4Y$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fnoscript%26id%3DGY3YKBA0B3943Y2PHJ4Y:0", "https://fls-na.amazon.com/1/batch/1/OP/ATVPDKIKX0DER:147-5437970-5750546:GY3YKBA0B3943Y2PHJ4Y$uedata=s:%2Frd%2Fuedata%3Fstaticb%26id%3DGY3YKBA0B3943Y2PHJ4Y:0", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/personalization/ybh/loading-4x-gray._CB485916920_.gif", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71xleAYuNjL._AC_UL116_SR116,116_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/digital/sitb/sticker/sitb-sticker-v3-small._CB485933792_.png", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51r+PQmuzwL._AC_SX60_CR,0,0,60,60_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/scheduleWithEaseImage._CB409113670_.svg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51r+PQmuzwL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/I/71-zoMrJIXL._AC_UL160_SR160,160_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/01Kv-W2ysOL._SY600_.png", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/ABC_logo_primary_beta._CB408510813_.svg", "https://assoc-na.associates-amazon.com/abid/um?s=147-5437970-5750546&m=ATVPDKIKX0DER", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/kindle/app/kindle-app-logo._CB668847749_.png", "https://images-na.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/ecc20c3e-1f61-4bec-ae08-9e0a03ca4615._CR0,43.0,247,247_SX48_.jpg", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/amazonbookclub/chooseBooksImage._CB409113671_.svg", "https://images-eu.ssl-images-amazon.com/images/S/amazon-avatars-global/default._CR0,0,1024,1024_SX48_.png", "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/G/01/x-locale/checkout/truespc/secured-ssl._CB485936932_.png"], "top_img": "https://m.media-amazon.com/images/I/51r+PQmuzwL._SY344_BO1,204,203,200_.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Follow The Author", "Abqa"], "canonical_link": "https://www.amazon.com/Fine-Other-Lies-Whitney-Cummings/dp/0735212600", "title": "I'm Fine...And Other Lies: Cummings, Whitney: 9780735212602: Amazon.com: Books", "meta_data": {"description": "I'm Fine...And Other Lies [Cummings, Whitney] on Amazon.com. *FREE* shipping on qualifying offers.
