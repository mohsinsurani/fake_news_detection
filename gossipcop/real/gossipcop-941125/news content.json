The WWE star opened up about his recent revelation that he wants to have kids in an interview with TMZ on Sunday, June 3.\n\n\u201cI would love to be a dad,\u201d he said. \u201cI realize very much that I have been steadfast in saying that I don\u2019t want children. But I\u2019m a little bit older now, a bit wiser. At age 18, we say things different at age 25, at 35.
