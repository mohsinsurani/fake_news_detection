On Monday night, during a talk moderated by Vanity Fair\u2019s Mike Hogan at 92nd Street Y in New York City with co-star Claire Foy, Smith did not mince words about his feelings on the fate of Prince Harry\u2019s royal-to-be fianc\u00e9e, Meghan Markle.\n\n\u201cI feel sorry for her,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s such a transition in her life, and it\u2019s such a huge thing to take on. Life as she knows it is gone. But hey, she\u2019s marrying the prince of Britain\u2014how exciting for her.\u201d\n\nThough he plays a fictional royal, Smith understands a thing or two about the complex life of Prince Philip, who reluctantly lived in the Queen\u2019s shadow for the better part of his early marriage. Philip, a naval officer in the mid-20th century, had to make several sacrifices that many other husbands at the time did not. As V.F. has noted, Philip was unable to give his children his surname\u2014a request the Queen rejected.\n\n\u201cI am the only man in the country not allowed to give his name to his children,\u201d Philip said on the subject, per a biography by Sally Bedell Smith. \u201cI\u2019m nothing but a bloody amoeba.\u201d\n\nSmith might have been skeptical, but Foy, who plays his other royal half, Queen Elizabeth, has noticed that the times have changed. As The Crown explores in Season 1, Elizabeth herself had to make some hard decisions that especially affected her sister, Princess Margaret. These are challenges that Foy said royals circa 2017 won\u2019t have to face.\n\n\u201cYou realize the fact that Elizabeth forbade her sister from marrying a divorced man; it goes to show how time has changed and how they\u2019ve had to evolve,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd they really have. This would not have been conceivable, this would not have happened 50 years ago. And I think that\u2019s why the monarchy will survive, and thrive, because it\u2019s willing to change and listen to the people and realize that some elements of the institution are outdated and unnecessary.\u201d\n\nAs for Markle? Foy\u2019s a fan of the former Suits actress\u2019s old day job: \u201cAnd she\u2019s an actress, so there\u2019s hope for us all.\u201d", "images": ["https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1c30538ad878289fc1144d/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-ss02.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/6196c41c1bbf90e6dd958483/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1c3053f5e5300fcde10e7c/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-ss01.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a21606460cf3a355ef9d65a/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/meghan-harry-royal-appearance.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1c30531310ef0d93e09746/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement-ss03.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2861d1c907581c4e97c338/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/matt-smith-meghan-markle-cocktail-hour.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a1f13db25e85845faacf666/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/prince-harry-meghan-markle-engagement.jpg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/63370d0bb02ed9e1f657fa60/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/61bb68208185dc60dfd416d3/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633dac5a42c2d8adf3fa7d9c/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-header.ea437ae89b8c3c7aabbb46bb45a04f1a514e5803.svg", "https://www.vanityfair.com/verso/static/vanity-fair/assets/logo-reverse.6ef96ab8686439a35176e2ff8b2c4487e92fbaae.svg", "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/633e045546d7fce1e25ce391/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2861d1c907581c4e97c338/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/matt-smith-meghan-markle-cocktail-hour.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Hilary Weaver"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/the-crowns-matt-smith-says-he-feels-sorry-for-meghan-markle", "title": "The Crown\u2019s Matt Smith Says He Feels \u201cSorry\u201d for Meghan Markle", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "The actor, who plays Prince Philip on the Netflix drama, has some insight into the complex royal life.", "id": "5a269e1360cf3a355ef9d707", "keywords": "matt smith,prince philip,meghan markle,claire foy,netflix", "news_keywords": "matt smith,prince philip,meghan markle,claire foy,netflix", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "5a269e1360cf3a355ef9d707", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"The actor, who plays Prince Philip on the Netflix drama, has some insight into the complex royal life.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2861d1c907581c4e97c338/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/matt-smith-meghan-markle-cocktail-hour.jpg\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2861d1c907581c4e97c338/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/matt-smith-meghan-markle-cocktail-hour.jpg\"}", "og": {"description": "The actor, who plays Prince Philip on the Netflix drama, has some insight into the complex royal life.", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2861d1c907581c4e97c338/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/matt-smith-meghan-markle-cocktail-hour.jpg", "site_name": "Vanity Fair", "title": "The Crown\u2019s Matt Smith Says He Feels \u201cSorry\u201d for Meghan Markle", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.vanityfair.com/style/2017/12/the-crowns-matt-smith-says-he-feels-sorry-for-meghan-markle"}, "article": {"content_tier": "metered", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-12-05T13:33:21.708Z", "modified_time": "2017-12-05T13:33:21.708Z", "author": "Hilary Weaver"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@VanityFair", "description": "The actor, who plays Prince Philip on the Netflix drama, has some insight into the complex royal life.", "domain": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "image": "https://media.vanityfair.com/photos/5a2861d1c907581c4e97c338/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/matt-smith-meghan-markle-cocktail-hour.jpg?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@VanityFair", "title": "The Crown\u2019s Matt Smith Says He Feels \u201cSorry\u201d for Meghan Markle"}, "fb": {"app_id": 256281040558, "pages": 8810407571}, "google-signin-client_id": "1065629119444-svrqo31taikd2j0ji4dgjs9q3vul4133.apps.googleusercontent.com"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1512480801.708, "source": "https://www.vanityfair.com", "summary": ""}
