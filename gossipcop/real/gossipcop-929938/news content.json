Martin said on Wednesday, disappointing \u201cGame of Thrones\u201d fans who have been waiting since 2011 for his next book in the epic saga.\n\nMartin said in a blog posting that his \u201cThe Winds of Winter\u201d novel would not be ready for publication in 2018.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to have to keep waiting for \u2018THE WINDS OF WINTER,\u2019\u201d Martin wrote.\n\nBut Martin, whose \u201cA Song of Ice and Fire\u201d novels were adapted into HBO\u2019s hit medieval fantasy series, said he would be publishing an illustrated 1,000-page history of the kings of Westeros on Nov. 20.\n\n\u201cGame of Thrones\u201d follows warring families in a multi-generational struggle for control of the Iron Throne, which rules over the Seven Kingdoms of Westeros. The last season in 2017 was watched by some 30 million U.S. viewers.\n\nMartin\u2019s fictional history, \u201cFire & Blood,\u201d the first of two planned volumes, will cover all the Targaryen kings from Aegon I to Aegon III, along with their wives, siblings, wars and travels, he said.\n\n\u201cOh, and there are dragons too. Lots of dragons,\u201d he added.\n\nMartin said he was now turning his attention back to \u201cWinds of Winter\u201d but did not say when he hoped to finish it.\n\nThe television series, which returns for a final season in 2019, has already moved beyond the events of Martin\u2019s five published books.\n\nTime Warner Inc\u2019s (TWX.N) HBO network has said it is working on three to five possible \u201cGames of Thrones\u201d spinoffs but Martin was coy on whether material from \u201cFire & Blood\u201d would be used.\n\n\u201cI know I am going to be asked whether those shows are going to be based on material from \u2018FIRE & BLOOD.\u2019 It\u2019s a logical question. The only answer I can give is ... ah, well, no one is sure yet, and anyway, I am not allowed to say,\u201d he wrote.", "images": ["https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180426&t=2&i=1255565493&r=LYNXMPEE3O27A&w=800"], "top_img": "https://static.reuters.com/resources/r/?m=02&d=20180426&t=2&i=1255565493&r=LYNXMPEE3O27A&w=800", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Reuters Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.reuters.com/article/us-books-gameofthrones-idUSKBN1HW30R", "title": "'Winds of Winter' not coming in 2018, 'Thrones' author Martin says", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width", "robots": "index, follow", "twitter": {"site": "@Reuters", "creator": "@Reuters", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "'Winds of Winter' not coming in 2018, 'Thrones' author Martin says", "description": "Winter is not coming, author George R.R.
