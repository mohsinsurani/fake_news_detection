That means that all of our sellers are very responsive, making for quick domain transfers.\n\nA dedicated BrandBucket agent will manage your domain transfer from beginning to end, ensuring a secure and easy transaction. They will manage the receipt of the domain into one of BrandBucket\u2019s secure registrar accounts and then complete the transfer to you.\n\n1. Verification and registrar choice\n\nAfter we receive the payment and verify it, we will reach out via email to confirm which registrar you want the domain transferred to. We also provide a link to our tracking system, where you can communicate with us, check on the status of your transfer, view your invoice, and download your logo files.\n\nIn most cases, if a domain is moved between accounts at a single registrar, the transfer is quick and usually completes within 48 hours. If a domain changes registrars (in other words, you would like to move it away from where it is currently registered), the transfer is slower. The total transfer time can then be anywhere from 48 hours to 7 days.\n\nBrandBucket has vetted and supports the following registrars:\n\n\n\nGoDaddy\n\nNamesilo\n\nUniregistry\n\nNameCheap\n\nGoogle Domains\n\nName.com\n\nAmazon Route 53\n\n123 Reg\n\nGandi\n\nDynadot\n\n2. We request the name from the seller.\n\nOnce we know where you would like the domain transferred, BrandBucket will request the domain from the seller. All of our sellers are very responsive, making for a quick process.\n\n3. Transfer the name into your account\n\nAs soon as we receive the name from the seller, we start the transfer into your account and guide you through the whole process.\n\n4. Verify with the buyer that the transfer is complete\n\nOnce we confirm that you have received the name, we consider the escrow process to be complete. Only then do we release payment to the domain seller.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20220826233334im_/https://www.brandbucket.com/sites/default/files/logo_uploads/419215/stamped_preview_w7.png"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220826233334im_/https://www.brandbucket.com/sites/default/files/logo_uploads/419215/stamped_preview_w7.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220826233334/https://www.brandbucket.com/names/viralpipeline", "title": "Viralpipeline.com is For Sale", "meta_data": {"language": "en", "google": "notranslate", "robots": "noarchive", "googlebot": "noarchive", "HandheldFriendly": "true", "viewport": "width=device-width, user-scalable=yes, minimum-scale=1, maximum-scale=1", "thumbnail": "https://www.brandbucket.com/sites/default/files/logo_uploads/419215/stamped_preview_w7.png", "description": "Buy the domain name Viralpipeline.com and launch your business with a premium domain and a high quality logo.", "og": {"image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220826233334im_/https://www.brandbucket.com/sites/default/files/logo_uploads/419215/stamped_preview_w7.png", "type": "article", "description": "Buy the domain name Viralpipeline.com and launch your business with a premium domain and a high quality logo.", "title": "Viralpipeline.com is For Sale | BrandBucket", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20220826233334/https://www.brandbucket.com/names/viralpipeline"}, "twitter": {"account_id": 30301929, "card": "summary_large_image"}, "article": {"tag": "viral"}, "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "msvalidate.01": "ABE48D7CF71EC311C19499AB849AFEAE"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
