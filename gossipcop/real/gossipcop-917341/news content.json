BBC reports that distribution problems led to the lack of sauce and it has forced many restaurants to serve limited menus.\n\nLovers of the chain have taken to Twitter to voice their grievances after learning the chain\u2019s most popular side dish remains left off the menu.\n\n\u201cThis is worse than the chicken shortage,\u201d one user posted.\n\n\u201cWHAT IS GOING ON,\u201d another tweeted as the news broke.\n\nKFC\u2019s chicken snafu first started when the company moved its food delivery service from Bidvest Group to DHL, Business Insider reported. GMB \u2014 a trade union whose members worked for the Bidvest Group \u2014 told the outlet that DHL is \u201cnot geared up\u201d to deliver chicken around the country with only one distribution depot operating out of Rugby, a town in central England.\n\nRicardo Dearatanha/Los Angeles Times/Getty\n\n\u201cThe chicken crossed the road, just not to our restaurants,\u201d KFC said in a statement on Twitter. \u201cWe won\u2019t compromise on quality, so no deliveries has meant some of our restaurants are closed, and others are operating a limited menu, or shortened hour.\u201d\n\nWant the ultimate dish on the latest celebrity food news, plus exclusive recipes, videos and more? Click here to subscribe to the People Food newsletter.\n\nA spokesperson for KFC\u2019s parent company Yum! Brands has now addressed the gravy shortage in a statement to CNBC.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re working as hard as we can to get this sorted out,\u201d they said. \u201cWe know that our gravy is a big favorite!\u201d", "images":
