In an Instagram post from the reality star, she referred to the claims from women such as Aly Raisman and Simone Biles among others.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nCheryl stated she has been \u201cfollowing what has happened with the US Women\u2019s gymnastics team,\u201d and wanted to commend the women for coming out with their stories.\n\nIt takes extraordinary bravery and mental strength to come out about something as harrowing as abuse, especially sexual abuse.\n\nThe claims resonate with the dance coach, Burke stated she had to \u201csit in a courtroom in front of the man\u201d who abused her and had to share the painful experiences. Cheryl \u2013 who wrote a book called Dancing Lessons \u2013 claimed that it takes \u201ctremendous courage.\u201d\n\n#metoo A post shared by Cheryl Burke (@cherylburke) on Jan 18, 2018 at 3:04pm PST\n\nAs you may know, Larry Nassar was outed as a sexual predator by a plethora of women, who many of which were Olympic gold medalists and contestants.\n\nAt the beginning of the day today, McKayla Maroney\u2019s statement against Larry was read aloud in court. She declared in front of the court and jury that Larry deserves the rest of his life behind bars.\n\nThe ex-doctor is currently looking at 25-40 years of prison for each count of abuse; he is now facing seven counts. Celebrity Insider reported recently that Simone Biles revealed she had been abused by the doctor as well.\n\nNassar will face his day in court and will probably lose, although, a not-guilty verdict is possible.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nUnfortunately for Cheryl, her abuser did not go to jail according to the Dance Mom\u2019s star. Social media was emphatic that Cheryl commemorated the women in the US Gymnastics team. One person wrote, \u201call of these women are so strong for coming out with their stories, including you Cheryl.\u201d", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cheryl-Burke-People.com_-e1516337782633.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cardi-B-Offset-No-Makeup-300x252.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Check-Out-Bernice-Burogs-Daughter-Gorgeous-Ashely-Debuting-Her-Baby-Bump-See-The-Superb-Pic-300x227.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/abby-lee-miller-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Simone-Biles-Teen-Vogue--700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Tameka-Tiny-Harris-Tamika-Scott-300x255.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/David-Chang-Crains-New-York-Business--700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Carrie-Underwood-Wendy-Williams-300x260.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/peter-gunz-amina-buddafly-love-and-hip-hop-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/turpins-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/dance-moms-abby-lee-miller-700x466.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cheryl-Burke-People.com_-e1516337782633.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804/http://celebrityinsider.org/cherly-burke-from-dance-moms-commends-gymnasts-for-speaking-out-against-larry-nassar-106566/", "title": "Cheryl Burke From Dance Moms Commends Gymnasts For Speaking Out Against Larry Nassar", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "cheryl burke, dance moms, Larry Nassar,", "keywords": "celebrity news, cheryl burke, dance moms, Larry Nassar,", "description": "Cheryl Burke from Dance Moms came out in support for the Olympic athletes who recently revealed they allegedly had been victimized by their former", "og": {"type": "article", "title": "Cheryl Burke From Dance Moms Commends Gymnasts For Speaking Out Against Larry Nassar", "description": "Cheryl Burke from Dance Moms came out in support for the Olympic athletes who recently revealed they allegedly had been victimized by their former", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804/http://celebrityinsider.org/cherly-burke-from-dance-moms-commends-gymnasts-for-speaking-out-against-larry-nassar-106566/", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180121062804im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Cheryl-Burke-People.com_-e1516337782633.jpg", "site_name": "Celebrity News, Gossip -
