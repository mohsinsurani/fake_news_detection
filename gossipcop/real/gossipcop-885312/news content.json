And, on Thursday\u2019s Late Show With Stephen Colbert, that\u2019s what they got (those with restored electricity or internet at this point anyway), as Colbert and recent Late Show guest Nick Kroll took turns one-upping each other in a bit concluding their joint #PuberMe fundraising campaign. Kroll, who pitched the campaign for currently rich and beautiful celebrities to reveal their most awkward and cringeworthy teenage pictures on Colbert\u2019s show last week, called in from Argentina (for reasons unexplored on the show), a picture of his own bespectacled young self standing in as he and Colbert comically tried to outdo each other in their generosity arms race. Colbert, noting that his annual Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream charity donation would all go to Puerto Rico this year, explained that his AmeriCone Dream Fund is donating a thousand bucks for every pimply, mullet-sporting, brace-faced celebrity picture, which had raised an initial total of around a quarter-million. Kroll pledged a hundred grand from himself and his Big Mouth castmates, and the race was on, until Colbert\u2019s announcement that CBS was matching their combined total brought the whole thing up to a great-but-unsatisfyingly-jagged $999,000.\n\n\n\nLuckily, Colbert\u2019s lament that they just couldn\u2019t crest that cool million mark sent out the Puerto Rico signal to one Lin-Manuel Miranda, who brought out not a lowly ungainly photo, but an entire, Puerto Rico-themed video of his 13-year-old self crooning his love for his ancestral island. (And how much the young Miranda hated New York.) Look, it\u2019s been a shit time all around for the people of Puerto Rico, and a million bucks isn\u2019t going to come near to solving all the problems that Donald Trump spent his disastrous goodwill visit scolding them about. But there was a palpable feeling of goodwill in the air as the meter ticked up to that million dollar figure, with those spoiled Hollywood elites Trump and Fox News love to sneer at putting some money where their cosmetically straightened pearly whites are. Plus, it gave Miranda the opportunity to steer people toward his newly penned song \u201cAlmost Like Praying,\u201d whose profits will also all go to hurricane relief, and which features, as Manuel put it, \u201cany Latino person you like.\u201d (He mentioned Jennifer Lopez, Marc Anthony, Gloria Estefan, Fat Joe, and presumably himself.)\n\nTo add your own cash to the Puerto Rico pile, Colbert steered everyone to the show\u2019s website colbertlateshow.com, while Miranda did the same for \u201cAlmost Like Praying,\u201d urging people to buy it on iTunes, Spotify, and Tidal. (The song dropped at midnight while The Late Show was airing.) It\u2019s a drop in the bucket, surely, but it\u2019s a pretty big drop, and at least Donald Trump won\u2019t be whipping it at hurricane victims\u2019 heads.", "images": ["https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f5zr3vuc90hrpnmx0nme.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/kqnkjlylkf7tymsqmoqr.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/52a29fe0001de9a08e76ea6d559528e9.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/u0939doeuioaqhspkjyc.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/j59upeyynundqjvbmcwj.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/v4sckews2f3bzf0ztbkf.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/aqhdzcldymb9mkltfhxh.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/rnxqtvv6advgidzfs6am.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/f2b6295902a8e0a7c4d168840e7b3d51.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/eti2h1r4wg0bqxctxenl.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/muaaluj2wznfomol9ero.png", "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png"], "top_img": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_675,pg_1,q_80,w_1200/197xrjaz7466rpng.png", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.avclub.com/stephen-colbert-hits-1-million-in-puerto-rico-donation-1819205241", "title": "Stephen Colbert hits $1 million in Puerto Rico donations thanks to awkward celebrities like Lin-Manuel Miranda", "meta_data": {"google-site-verification": "QDPLbDJXTQNT0n69mvNADCeRmwnbkYyL20OKJAVCKq8", "ir-site-verification-token": "-1270174611", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, minimum-scale=1.0,maximum-scale=10.0", "ROBOTS": "INDEX, FOLLOW", "msapplication-square70x70logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_80,q_80,w_80/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "msapplication-square150x150logo": "https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,g_center,h_200,q_80,w_200/no63bw902mddhwxtjtxh.png", "keywords": "Lin-Manuel Miranda, The Late Show With Stephen Colbert, Stephen Colbert, The A.V.
