The Parks and Rec alum revealed that he once invited Mark Hamill to his childhood birthday party.\n\n\u201cI remember everything around that whole season around when Empire Strikes Back came out,\u201d Scott reminisced, \u201cand so I wrote him a letter inviting him to my birthday party.\u201d\n\nWhen asked if he thought Hamill would really show up, Scott replied with a confident \u201cI did.\u201d\n\n\u201cI thought if he got it and he was able to \u2014 if his schedule was clear, he was probably going to come,\u201d he said.\n\nBut sadly, Hamill was a no-show.\n\n\u201cHe didn\u2019t show up and I remember not being crushed or anything,\u201d said Scott. \u201cIt was fine. I knew he must\u2019ve been incredibly busy.\u201d\n\nBefore he could continue his story, Scott was interrupted by blaring horns as the orchestral theme to Star Wars came over the speaker. And this is where his childhood dreams finally came true.\n\nWielding a bright green lightsaber, Hamill made his way onto the stage.\n\n\u201cNo way,\u201d Scott said while in a state of shock.\n\nHamill greeted the Star Wars superfan with a late birthday gift in the form of a lightsaber and apologized for his absence at Scott\u2019s childhood party.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry I missed your birthday,\u201d Hamill said. \u201cI was checking my diary and that week I had two other birthdays, a Bar Mitzvah, and a supermarket opening!\u201d\n\nStill practically speechless, Scott confirmed that \u201cthis really is one of the moments of my life.\u201d", "images":
