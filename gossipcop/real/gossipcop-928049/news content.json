According to E! News, Kim Kardashian, Kourtney Kardashian and Kendall Jenner all flew into Cleveland on Tuesday to be with Khlo\u00e9 (her mom Kris Jenner was already there). Yesterday, all of them flew back to LA together, and when they left for the airport, they had an extra person with them that E! called a \"mystery person\" that was \"all covered up.\" Seriously, this is not a joke. Please take a second to picture Kris literally smuggling Khlo\u00e9 out of Ohio. The story is unconfirmed, but an amazing mental image nonetheless. Okay, moving on.\n\n\n\nThis content is imported from Instagram. You may be able to find the same content in another format, or you may be able to find more information, at their web site.\n\nKhlo\u00e9 is reportedly loving being a new mom, despite all the cheating allegations that surfaced against her baby's father Tristan Thompson last week, two days before she gave birth. \u201cKhlo\u00e9\u2019s in heaven right now as a new mom,\u201d the insider told People. \u201cDrama with Tristan aside, she\u2019s super happy and really trying to enjoy every moment with her baby.\"\n\nFollow Emma on Instagram.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-kardashian-baby-bump-1521647997.png?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-kardashian-1519230255.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/assets/icons/Instagram.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-kardashian-1519230255.jpg?resize=480:*", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-kardashian-1519230255.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Emma Baty", "Emma Baty Is The Entertainment Editor At Cosmopolitan", "Where She Shapes Tv", "Movie", "Music Coverage", "Writes Celebrity Profiles", "Edits Stories Across Both Print", "Digital", "Generally Obsesses Over All Things Pop Culture."], "canonical_link": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a19850678/khloe-kardashian-returning-to-la/", "title": "This Is the One Thing Keeping Khlo\u00e9 \u200b\u200bKardashian From Going to LA", "meta_data": {"x-ua-compatible": "IE=edge,chrome=1", "viewport": "width=device-width,initial-scale=1,maximum-scale=6", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "theme-color": "#EC008C", "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "Cosmopolitan", "title": "This Is the One Thing Keeping Khlo\u00e9 \u200b\u200bKardashian From Going to LA", "description": "And it's pretty important.", "url": "https://www.cosmopolitan.com/entertainment/celebs/a19850678/khloe-kardashian-returning-to-la/", "image": {"identifier": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-kardashian-1519230255.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=1200:*", "width": 1200, "height": 600}}, "fb": {"app_id": 162305873819997, "pages": 8358247707}, "article": {"publisher": "https://facebook.com/Cosmopolitan", "modified_time": "2021-11-01T23:10:49Z", "published_time": "2018-04-18T14:53:00Z", "section": "Celebs", "opinion": "false"}, "twitter": {"site": "@Cosmopolitan", "card": "summary_large_image", "image": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod.s3.amazonaws.com/images/khloe-kardashian-1519230255.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=640:*"}, "google-site-verification": "9QqScyr6oRc1iBU6yEjb9Ww8aQvv8v-cCm0TKu2J2iw", "title": "Is Khloe Kardashian in LA?
