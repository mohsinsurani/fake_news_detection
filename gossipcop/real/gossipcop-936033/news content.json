Her boyfriend said he swerved to the left in an attempt to avoid him and hit a concrete barrier.\n\n\n\nHe said Samantha hit the windshield and fell to the floor mat. Samantha, who has MS, was unable to lift herself up. He said her foot was twisted backward.\n\n\n\nHe drove Samantha to the emergency room, where doctors are treating her.\n\n\n\nAs TMZ previously reported, Samantha and Meghan's father just got out of surgery to repair his heart after a serious heart attack.\n\n\n\nSamantha's boyfriend Mark said the paparazzo fled the scene after the incident.", "images":
