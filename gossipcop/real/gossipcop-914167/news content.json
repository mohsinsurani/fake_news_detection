To make matters worse, the late Mr. Cavallari\u2019s passing was confirmed after an extensive manhunt was led by the authorities. The Utah State Medical Examiner\u2019s Office later ruled Michael\u2019s death an accident due to hypothermia.\n\nWith the immense amount of tragedy surrounding Michael\u2019s death, we aren\u2019t surprised to learn that his alleged spirit had important messages to share with his family. On the reading with Kristin, Henry noted:\n\n\u201cThe reading itself was really profound because her brother made a very clear connection. And I didn\u2019t realize at the time of the reading, Kristin\u2019s parents were actually watching the reading in the other room. And you\u2019ll have to see but there was this personal reference that came through from her brother about this license plate and a wall of license plates and there was a reference that came through with that and it didn\u2019t make any sense to Kristin but meanwhile her dad was in the other room watching the reading and it was the most personal, chilling validation I think I\u2019ve seen in the show because he knew exactly where that fit. And it was really special to get to see that, not only for her, but for her parents who really needed it.\u201d\n\nWhoa. That\u2019s some really intense stuff.\n\nIn regards to the specific messages Michael had for his loved ones, Tyler continued:\n\n\u201cI think what\u2019s so special about readings is that people can get that clarity and understanding of what their loved ones were going through in their last moments here on earth. And when he came through, he made very clear two references: one that was insight into his mental health at the time and the other was a really validating factor that helped them get a lot more closure I think around the passing. It was really important for those two things to come through.\u201d\n\nWe can only imagine how difficult this reading was for Kristin and her family.
