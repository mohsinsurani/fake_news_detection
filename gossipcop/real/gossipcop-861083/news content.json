It is the first time four-year-old North has appeared on the cover of a major magazine.\n\nKardashian, whose family have roots in Armenia, said: \u201cKanye always has his family around and people who look like my daughter \u2014 that\u2019s important to me.\n\nNormal life: Kim Kardashian and North pose with two dogs / Steven Klein/ Interview magazine\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s obsessed with her curly hair, and if she finds someone who has the same hair, she runs to them and is like, \u2018You have curly hair like me?\u2019 And we get to talk about it.\n\n\u201cWe also talk about it with my niece Penelope, because she and North look really different, but they\u2019re best friends and they\u2019re together all the time.\u201d\n\nMotherly love: Kim Kardashian swapped her usual attire for the shoot (Steven Klein/ Interview magazine ) / Steven Klein/ Interview magazine\n\nThe Keeping Up with the Kardashians star said the family had \u201cstrict rules\u201d about how much of the children\u2019s lives are included in the reality show that made their name.\n\nShe said: \u201cSome seasons they\u2019re on a little bit, just to show a bit of personality, although there are never storylines about them. But then there\u2019s social media, on which I\u2019ve always been really open. When I\u2019m out and people call North\u2019s name, that\u2019s when it\u2019s weird for me. She lives such a normal life, believe it or not, at home.\u201d\n\nCover stars: Kim Kardashian and daughter North grace the front cover (Steven Klein/ Interview magazine ) / Steven Klein/ Interview magazine\n\nShe shared the images on her Instagram page captioning it: \u201cInterview Magazine September cover!!!
