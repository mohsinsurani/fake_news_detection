Additionally, Glover revealed a part of his past that many of us had not heard before.\n\nGlover said, \u201cI know everybody likens themselves to Tupac a lot,\u201d but Glover said he is \u201cthe new Tupac\u201d in a way because he grew up in a similar household.\n\n#AtlantaFX 3.1 A post shared by Childish Gambino News (@childishnews) on Feb 7, 2018 at 1:37pm PST\n\nGlover admitted he \u201cdidn\u2019t have a mother in the Black Panthers,\u201d but his family was very \u201cpro-black.\u201d The actor said he grew up around people who sported Confederate Flags, insinuating that such people are racist.\n\nThe actor/rapper revealed if his fans knew that today, they would be \u201ctriggered,\u201d by his upbringing. However, Glover described himself as someone who is \u201cmore complex,\u201d that can be personified with one particular persona or image.\n\nDonald revealed that, in life, people often try and characterize someone, or put them in a \u201cbox,\u201d so to speak.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nIt becomes necessary to \u201cplay a role,\u201d as he says, so people can easily understand you. As you may know, Donald had a great year in 2017 considering the welcoming of his child and his Grammy recognition.", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Lil-Xan-PigeonsAndPlanes.com_-700x466.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/priyanka-chopra-300x200.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socp.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/tamar-b-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Logan-Herbert-Tamar-Braxton-Vincent-300x246.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Donald-Glover-Hollywood.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Bill-Cosby--300x225.jpeg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/celebrity-insider.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socflip.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/next1.gif", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socg.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/More-Bad-News-For-Khloe-Kardashian-Tristan-Thompson-Reportedly-Arranged-Secret-Hookups-Online-300x197.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soct.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/elizabeth-olsen-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/rss.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Latoya-Jackson-300x210.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soci.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Donald-Glover-Consequence-Of-Sound--e1518074201460.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/gigi-hadid-zayn-malik-300x169.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/soctu.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/03/BridgetHill-60x60.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Lala-Kent-InTouchWeekly.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/socf.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/images/watch-us-on-youtube.png", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Sherri-Shepherd-UPI.com_-700x466.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/https://d5nxst8fruw4z.cloudfront.net/atrk.gif?account=9uhRo1IWhd10kU"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908im_/http://celebrityinsider.org/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/Donald-Glover-Consequence-Of-Sound--e1518074201460.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Bridget Hill", "Helena P.", "Mrs. Brownsugarbaby"], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20180430202908/http://celebrityinsider.org/donald-glover-compares-himself-to-the-modern-day-tupac-113072/", "title": "Donald Glover Compares Himself To The \u201cModern Day Tupac\u201d", "meta_data": {"p": {"domain_verify": "eb3eaa384c05d7c451fa2a546258488f"}, "author": "Bridget Hill", "news_keywords": "Donald Glover, tupac shakur,", "keywords": "celebrity news, Donald Glover, tupac shakur,", "description": "During an interview with Esquire Magazine, Donald Glover made a comparison that some hip-hop fans may think is a little over the top.
