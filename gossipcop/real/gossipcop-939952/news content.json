Now 36 and back on the court after giving birth to daughter Alexis Olympia Ohanian, Jr., Williams told Harper's Bazaar UK that she no longer has that goal.\n\n\"Oh God, I\u2019ll never be a size 4! Why would I want to do that, and be that?\" she told the magazine.\n\nShe then gestured to her bicep and said, \"This is me, and this is my weapon and machine.\"\n\n\"But I love that I said that, because I can understand,\" she added. \"I can show Olympia that I struggled, but now I\u2019m happy with who I am and what I am and what I look like.\"\n\nSerena Williams at the Miami Open tennis tournament, in Key Biscayne, Fla., March 21, 2018. Lynne Sladky/AP, FILE\n\nWilliams said that when her Olympia was born, she noticed that the baby girl had her arms.\n\n\"Instead of being sad and fearful about what people would say about her, I was just so happy,\" she said.\n\nThe 23-time Grand Slam champion admitted it wasn't always so easy to accept her strong physique, especially compared to her older sister Venus Williams, whom she followed on to the tennis court.\n\n\"It was hard for me,\" she told Harper's. \"People would say I was born a guy, all because of my arms, or because I\u2019m strong. I was different to Venus: She was thin and tall and beautiful, and I am strong and muscular -- and beautiful, but, you know, it was just totally different.\"\n\nThere have been other struggles for Williams as well. The tennis star, whose daughter is almost nine months old, told the magazine that she suffered from postpartum depression following Olympia's birth.\n\n\"Honestly, sometimes I still think I have to deal with it,\" she said. \"I think people need to talk about it more because it\u2019s almost like the fourth trimester, it\u2019s part of the pregnancy. I remember one day, I couldn\u2019t find Olympia\u2019s bottle and I got so upset I started crying ... because I wanted to be perfect for her.\"\n\nSerena Williams is the guest Tuesday, May 1, 2018, on ABC's \"The View.\" Paula Lobo/ABC\n\nToday, Williams told the magazine that she constantly strives to be \"the best mom I can be,\" and believes that she's doing a good job. She also wants to empower other women to feel more comfortable being themselves, which is why she recently launched her own clothing line, Serena.\n\n\"The customer is a girl or a woman who believes in herself, or wants to believe in herself; maybe she\u2019s feeling unconfident that day,\" she told Women's Wear Daily ahead of the launch. \"And someone that is unapologetically themselves, and that maybe they stand out; maybe they stand out because they are strong or they\u2019re beautiful or they want to not be the norm. Our woman is someone who looks at fashion as a compass to show who they are, to show what they are.\"", "images": ["https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/iran-protest-nika-shakarami-01-ht-llr-221006_1665097040190_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/International/bridge-gty-ml-221008_1665242585018_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-gty-mt-180530_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-ap-er-180521_hpEmbed_22x15_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/US/john-lynch-points-house-damage-abc-jt-221007_1665185645263_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-gty-mt-180530_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/uvalde-1-gty-er-221007_1665161778549_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Health/Postpartum-gty-hb-180528_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-theview02-abc-hb-180501_hpEmbed_2_11x9_992.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-ap-jef-180529_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/GMA/LUCHINA-FISHER_1x1_96.jpg", "https://s.abcnews.com/assets/dtci/random/svg/gma_logo.svg", "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Politics/trump-white-house-oval-office-gty-jt-221004_1664919462010_hpMain_1x1_144.jpg", "data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAIAAAAAAAP///yH5BAEAAAAALAAAAAABAAEAAAIBRAA7"], "top_img": "https://s.abcnews.com/images/Entertainment/serena-williams-gty-mt-180530_hpMain_16x9_992.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Abc News"], "canonical_link": "https://goodmorningamerica.com/culture/story/serena-williams-explains-longer-size-55559563", "title": "Serena Williams explains why she no longer wants to be a size 4", "meta_data": {"description": "The tennis superstar once wrote that she wanted to slim down to a size 4.", "keywords": "Serena Williams, abcnewscom, gmacom, Alexis, daughter, fashion line, United Kingdom, sports, fashion, tennis, birth, pregnancy", "copyright": "2022 ABC News Internet Ventures.
