That also means the return of the iconic red bathing suit and swim trunks famously worn by Pamela Anderson and David Hasselhoff in the hit \u201890s TV series. But this time, they come with a modern makeover, courtesy of costume designer Dayna Pink, who brought a more athletic spin to the costumes.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a little daunting but so exciting to be able to touch a piece of wardrobe that\u2019s so iconic and to be able to contribute to that history of what that\u2019s going to be,\u201d Pink, whose film credits include Crazy, Stupid, Love and Hot Tub Time Machine, tells The Hollywood Reporter.\n\nThe Seth Gordon-helmed Baywatch sees Dwayne Johnson as devoted lifeguard Mitch Buchannon and Zac Efron as new recruit Matt Brody, who is brought in to join the crew on the beach. Kelly Rohrbach, Alexandra Daddario, Ilfenesh Hadera and Jon Bass join the duo in trying to stop a criminal mastermind\u2019s operation that threatens the bay.\n\nAhead of the comedy\u2019s release, Pink chatted with THR about giving the iconic beachwear a new look.\n\nYou had the big task of re-creating the iconic red bathing suit \u2014 how did you approach it?\n\nI really wanted to change it. I felt it was important to put my mark on it as a statement about what\u2019s happening now in swimwear. So when I met with the director and talked about it, we came up with the idea of changing the color and adding zippers. I looked at all the trends in swimwear and I really liked the idea of zippers, neoprene and athletic things. So that was my inspiration, as well as just making it a love letter to the beach.\n\nWe updated the color as well \u2014 made it more of a ruby. We did a lot of tests on the fabric. You can only imagine what my office looked like with little swatches of red hanging everywhere (laughs). We took a little bit of the orange out and added blue, so the red is really saturated. There\u2019s a little sheen as well. The bathing suits were made from a combination of a few different stretch fabrics that we dyed our new Baywatch red and blue. It was all inspired by neoprene, but ours were not actually that thick.\n\nInstead of having the ladies all wear the same one-piece bathing suit, they each wore a different silhouette.\n\nPart of it was helping tell the story of who these girls were, who these characters are. I liked the idea of not just having one bathing suit anymore. Let\u2019s say you go work at a place \u2014 you get to pick three different things or pick from a selection, which one are you going to pick? Because what we wear obviously tells a story of who we are.\n\nStephanie [played by Hadera] is more buttoned up and more professional; she wears the long sleeve one zipped up pretty high. Then there\u2019s CJ [played by Rohrbach], who\u2019s sexy and fun in a different way. CJ has a bikini. When she wears a one-piece, it\u2019s zipped down a little lower. And Summer [played by Daddario] has the vest, which is very sporty, because her personality is more sporty. Those different silhouettes helped to tell the story.\n\nHow did you decide on this particular red?\n\nWe just started thinking about how to modernize it and what it was going to look like, what trends are in colors. I also thought about the color in the environment \u2014 on the beach, next to the water, next to the sand, on the tanned and oiled skin. I thought of that deep, deep ruby red and a gold zipper, but it\u2019s a matte gold. To me, that combination was amazing. Then we did a camera test, so we tested the different colors and you have to test the fabric when it\u2019s dry, but you also have to see what happens to it when it gets wet. We would stand in front of it with water bottles and spray the fabric to look at it (laughs).\n\nThen there are the guys, of course. How did you modernize their swimwear?\n\nMitch, which is Dwayne\u2019s character, he\u2019s king of the sea, No. 1, so he has his own and nobody wears what he\u2019s wearing. His fabric was a little different as well \u2014 he had stretch. The other guys did not have stretch. The silhouettes are a teeny bit different; the trunks are longer than they were in the original and there\u2019s an athletic vibe as well. We did everything in red and blue, instead of just red. I liked the juxtaposition of those two colors together against the water. It just felt so American to do the red and the blue.\n\nThe words \u201clifeguard\u201d or \u201cBaywatch\u201d were added in white on the suits. What led to that decision?\n\nIt\u2019s the red, white and blue element, kind of like the All-American thing. The original had a patch, so we considered doing a patch as well, but it just didn\u2019t read as well. To me, if you noticed in the back of CJ\u2019s bathing suit, how it said \u201clifeguard\u201d on the back, it\u2019s professional and it looks like a uniform. We chose to do letters as opposed to patches, and I think it was aesthetically a better choice.\n\nThere were a lot of great moments with the accessories, especially with Stephanie\u2019s gold earring cuff and the men\u2019s sunglasses.\n\nAccessories are one of the hardest things to do because when you\u2019re thinking about what people wear \u2014 some people wear things every single day. Accessories are really signature parts of people\u2019s personality. They\u2019re very specific and really important because you do see them in the movie.\n\nStephanie\u2019s accessories, we made those a little badass \u2014 her character is tough as nails, super smart, super buttoned up. To me, there\u2019s a little shield component to that ear cuff you\u2019re talking about. There\u2019s something a little superhero-y about it.\n\nThe glasses for Dwayne were from Sama. I loved those glasses because they also have a superhero element to them in a way. They are very much shields. They also have a yellow mirror aspect to them. The complement of that color next to his skin, next to the beach, next to the red \u2014 I just thought it was a perfect combination. Zac\u2019s sunglasses were Randolph Engineering.\n\nThen there\u2019s Priyanka Chopra, who plays Victoria Leeds, this super-sexy villain. How did you go about creating her look?\n\nShe was very high-end, very fancy. She\u2019s so beautiful and so easy to dress. We wanted to make her kind of badass. She doesn\u2019t see herself as a villain, she sees herself as the hero who\u2019s saving the bay. I like the idea of seeing her in white at first. She\u2019s kind of crisp and innocent and fresh.\n\nIt isn\u2019t until the end when she gets super dark and that ending dress, when she\u2019s on the barge, we made to fit into the action that she was going to have because she was climbing up those stairs so there was a big slit up the leg and she had a gun holster up on her thigh that you could see. When we knew what she was going to be doing, I added that big piece on her shoulder that flowed in the wind, because we knew it was going to be windy. So we built these two long pieces coming from her shoulders. And we used the metallic fabric, so when the wind hit it, it would really kind of pop. I didn\u2019t want to put her in a light color, so we found a way to keep the color dark but to add color and shine to still be able to see it in the dark.\n\nI shopped at Saks, Neiman Marcus and Barneys for Priyanka, as well as designed and made some of her looks. We worked with Christian Louboutin to have him create the silver shoes for the ending scene with her. They were sexy and spiky and shiny, which really worked for the night scene.", "images": ["https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/baywatch_sketch_to_still_priyanka_chopra_-_publicity_-_embed_-_h_2017.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bw-26244_r3_-_embed_2017.jpg?w=619", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bw-02030_r_-_embed_2017.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/baywatch_sketch_to_still_zac_efron_-_publicity_-_embed_-_h_2017.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/bw-03816_r_-_embed_2017.jpg?w=928", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/f12d0013-71d9-4dd5-9613-a802af9047cf.png?w=1024", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/baywatch_sketch_to_still_alexandra_daddrio_-_publicity_-_embed_-_h_2017_0.jpg?w=928", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/baywatch_sketch_to_still_kelly_rohrbach_-_publicity_-_embed_-_h_2017.jpg?w=928"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/f12d0013-71d9-4dd5-9613-a802af9047cf.png?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Stephanie Chan"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/baywatch-costume-designer-modernizing-red-bathing-suit-1006600/", "title": "\u2018Baywatch\u2019 Costume Designer on Giving the Iconic Red Bathing Suit a Modern Makeover", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "\"I really wanted to change it,\" says Dayna Pink. \"I felt it was important to put my mark on it as a statement about what's happening now in swimwear.\"", "news_keywords": "Baywatch, Costume Design", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Stephanie Chan", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1006600, "title": "'Baywatch' Costume Designer on Giving the Iconic Red Bathing Suit a Modern Makeover", "published_at": "2017-05-23 12:02:19", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/f12d0013-71d9-4dd5-9613-a802af9047cf.png?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Costume Design", "topics": "News", "body": "Summer is coming this week \u2014 that is, the\u00a0Baywatch reboot hits theaters on Friday.
