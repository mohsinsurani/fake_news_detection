She is the first person to be cast.\n\nThe new drama, picked up straight to series in May, centers on a group of heroic firefighters from the captain down the ranks in their personal and professional lives. The first episode will air as a planted episode of Grey\u2019s, which is set to return in the fall on ABC for its 14th season.\n\nThe spinoff will feature an entirely new cast, as none of the regulars from Grey\u2019s have been identified as candidates to move over. (This could seem to eliminate a theory that Grey\u2019s star Jason George, whose character Ben went full firefighter mode in May\u2019s season 13 finale, would be a prime candidate to move to the new series.)\n\nDetails about Ortiz\u2019s role are being kept under wraps. She is expected to appear in an upcoming Grey\u2019s Anatomy episode this season.\n\nThe spinoff, which has yet to receive a formal airdate, hails from Grey\u2019s Anatomy creator Shonda Rhimes and her Shondaland partner Betsy Beers. The duo will exec produce alongside Grey\u2019s exec producer/co-showrunner Stacy McKee, who will transition to the new drama full time. Paris Barclay (Pitch) will direct the pilot and exec produce the series as well.\n\nOrtiz\u2019s credits include USA Network\u2019s Shooter, Amazon\u2019s scrapped Chris Carter drama The After and two seasons of Fox\u2019s Rosewood. She potentially joins Ellen Pompeo \u2014 who has starred on Grey\u2019s for all 14 seasons \u2014 Scandal\u2019s Kerry Washington and How to Get Away With Murder\u2018s Viola Davis as a leading lady of Shondaland. She\u2019s repped by WME and Link Entertainment.\n\nThe firefighter drama is the second spinoff from the Grey\u2019s flagship, joining Private Practice.", "images": ["https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-613730408_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1296&h=730&crop=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-613730408_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "https://cdn.shopify.com/s/files/1/0238/6647/products/2019_37_540x.jpg", "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/themes/vip/pmc-hollywoodreporter-2021/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=352999048212581&ev=PageView&noscript=1"], "top_img": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-613730408_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Lesley Goldberg"], "canonical_link": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-news/greys-anatomy-spinoff-enlists-rosewood-grad-jaina-lee-ortiz-1024520/", "title": "\u2018Grey\u2019s Anatomy\u2019 Spinoff Enlists Jaina Lee Ortiz", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "The 'Rosewood' grad is the first person to be cast in the firefighter-themed Shondaland series and rumored to be the lead.", "news_keywords": "Grey's Anatomy", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Lesley Goldberg", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "The Hollywood Reporter", "application-name": "The Hollywood Reporter", "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1024520, "title": "'Grey's Anatomy' Spinoff Enlists Jaina Lee Ortiz", "published_at": "2017-07-26 11:28:48", "image": "https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/07/gettyimages-613730408_-_h_2017.jpg?w=1024", "comment_count": 0, "tags": "Grey's Anatomy", "topics": "TV News", "body": "ABC's Grey's Anatomy spinoff has found its leading lady.\r\nRosewood alum Jaina Lee Ortiz has booked what is believed to be the starring role in the firefighter-focused spinoff of the Shondaland medical drama, The Hollywood Reporter has confirmed.
