Further adding, \u201cLook, I don\u2019t want to rag on Harvey but so obviously something went down there. You can\u2019t buy, \u2018Oh, well, I grew up in the \u201960s and \u201970s and so therefore \u2026\u2019 I did, too.\u201d\n\nHanks emphasized that power in Hollywood can be rather manipulative.\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s like, well, what do you want from this position of power? I know all kinds of people that just love hitting on, or making the lives of underlings some degree of miserable, because they can,\u201d the actor said.\n\n\u201cThey think their achievements entitle them,\u201d Hanks said, proceeding to reference a quote about power. \u201cSomebody great said this, either Winston Churchill, Immanuel Kant or Oprah: \u2018When you become rich and powerful, you become more of what you already are,'\u201d Hanks said.\n\nHanks agrees with the quote, saying he supports the negative backlash against the movie mogul.\n\n\u201cI would say, there\u2019s an example of how that\u2019s true. Just because you\u2019re rich and famous and powerful doesn\u2019t mean you aren\u2019t in some ways a big fat ass. Excuse me, take away \u2018fat,'\u201d Hanks said. \u201cBut I\u2019m not, you know, I\u2019m not the first person to say Harvey\u2019s a bit of an ass. Poor Harvey \u2014 I\u2019m not going to say poor Harvey, Jesus. Isn\u2019t it kind of amazing that it took this long? I\u2019m reading it and I\u2019m thinking \u2018You can\u2019t do that to Ashley Judd! Hey, I like her. Don\u2019t do that. That ain\u2019t fair. Not her, come on. Come on!\u201d\n\nHanks also commented on the sexism that continues to exist within Hollywood, referring to the show Mad Men, to which he says \u201chad absolutely no nostalgia or affection for its period.\u201d\n\nThe actor explained, \u201cThose people were screwed up and cruel and mean. And, \u2018Hey, wait, that\u2019s going on today? Shouldn\u2019t we be on this?\u2019 Is it surprising? No. Is it tragic? Yes. And can you believe it\u2019s happening? I can\u2019t quite believe that.\u201d\n\nHanks isn\u2019t the only Hollywood star to comment on the recent Weinstein allegations. The actor joins Meryl Streep, George Clooney, Patricia Arquette, Leonardo DiCaprio, Julianne Moore, Mark Ruffalo, Jennifer Lawrence and others.\n\nThe backlash against Weinstein includes him being suspended by BAFTA, fired from The Weinstein Co. and having his $5 million endowment rejected, intended for USC\u2019s School of Cinematic Arts ability to grant scholarships to female directors. The mogul\u2019s producing credit has also been pulled from TWC\u2019s television shows.
