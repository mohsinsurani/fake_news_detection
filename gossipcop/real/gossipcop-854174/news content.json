And as far as \u201cscandals\u201d go, it\u2019s downright adorable.\n\nYou see, King Willem-Alexander has been piloting KLM aircraft incognito for the last 21 years. Really. Per Sky News:\n\nThe king of the Netherlands has revealed he has been living a secret double life as a co-pilot for a commercial airline.\n\nFor 21 years, King Willem-Alexander has taken to the skies twice a month to ferry passengers around on short-haul services for the Dutch airline KLM. Although travellers may have recognised the monarch\u2019s voice as he updated them on weather conditions and their time of arrival, the royal\u2019s presence was never revealed. This is your captain (and your King) speaking\u2026\n\nThe BBC adds that, prior to ascending to the throne in 2013, it was an open secret that the then-Prince would appear as a so-called \u201cguest pilot\u201d on KLM in order to maintain his pilot\u2019s license, but:\n\nWhat was not clear was that he was co-piloting passenger flights incognito, twice a month as king, often with KLM Captain Maarten Putman. The Dutch government said last month that he had flown Fokker 70 aircraft for both the government and KLM Cityhopper service, and that the plane was being replaced this year with a 737. Cityhopper flights are aimed mainly at business travellers in dozens of European destinations, particularly in the UK, Germany and Norway.\n\nWell, if I didn\u2019t love KLM and the Netherlands enough as it is already, this is the cherry on top. How charming, thoughtful, quirky and so thoroughly Dutch of the King, and KLM, to \u201csecretly\u201d fly passengers on short hops around Europe. Best of all, few seem to have been the wiser despite his PA announcements!\n\nI\u2019ve flown with royalty before (well\u2026 Motown royalty), but never by royalty!\n\nIf you regularly fly on KLM, do you think you might have been flown by the King of the Netherlands before?", "images": ["https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/51da4e0101f5ef8a9fa8774b7d8f6d32?s=32&d=blank&r=g", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Brex-Cash-Card-3.jpg?width=182&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=105&aspect_ratio=26%3A15", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KLM-Business-Class-777-2.jpg?width=700&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=418&aspect_ratio=350%3A209", "https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/themes/omaat/src/images/comments-icon.svg", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/Qantas-First-Lounge-Departures-Board.jpg?width=182&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=105&aspect_ratio=26%3A15", "https://track.mailerlite.com/webforms/o/1954888/z8m1x5?vc25f966922c0a35ad9c2401af6506ef1", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/04/omaat-logo-main.svg?width=190&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=44&aspect_ratio=95%3A22", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/20151204_022814361_iOS-scaled.jpg?width=150&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=150&aspect_ratio=1%3A1", "https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/themes/omaat/src/images/omaat-footer-logo.svg", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Koning-willem-alexander-okt-15-s-400x600.jpg", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/06/KLM-Business-Class-787-1.jpg?width=400&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=310&aspect_ratio=40%3A31", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hero-qna_1-2021-182x105.jpg", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/05/KLM-Business-Class-A330-20.jpg?width=400&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=310&aspect_ratio=40%3A31", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Lufthansa-747-400-BOS.jpeg?width=182&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=105&aspect_ratio=26%3A15", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/themes/omaat/src/images/avatar-32.jpg", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/KLM-A330.jpeg?width=400&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=310&aspect_ratio=40%3A31", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hero-river-cliffs-2021.jpg?width=182&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=105&aspect_ratio=26%3A15", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hero-Reviews-Lounges-2021.jpg?width=182&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=105&aspect_ratio=26%3A15", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/Hero-hotel_reviews_3-2021.jpg?width=182&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=105&aspect_ratio=26%3A15", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KLM-Business-Class-777-2.jpg?width=375&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=220&aspect_ratio=75%3A44", "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/06/0EE31A90-2619-4660-B93A-BAE1F9082745.jpeg?width=150&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=150&aspect_ratio=1%3A1", "https://onemileatatime.com/wp-content/themes/omaat/src/images/airplane-bg.svg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KLM-Business-Class-777-2.jpg?width=700&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=418&aspect_ratio=350%3A209", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://onemileatatime.com/dutch-king-klm-pilot/", "title": "The Dutch King Has Been Living A Secret Double Life As An Airline Pilot", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "robots": "noindex, follow", "description": "Breaking news today implicates a famously Orange leader of a globally respected democracy in a deceitful scandal... no, not the guy you think...", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "The Dutch King Has Been Living A Secret Double Life As An Airline Pilot", "description": "Breaking news today implicates a famously Orange leader of a globally respected democracy in a deceitful scandal... no, not the guy you think...", "url": "https://onemileatatime.com/dutch-king-klm-pilot/", "site_name": "One Mile at a Time", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.onemileatatime.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/02/KLM-Business-Class-777-2.jpg?width=700&auto_optimize=low&quality=75&height=418&aspect_ratio=350%3A209", "width": 700, "height": 418}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/onemileatatime/", "published_time": "2017-05-18T11:33:24+00:00"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary", "creator": "@onemileatatime", "site": "@onemileatatime", "label1": "Written by", "data1": "Nick", "label2": "Est. reading time", "data2": "2 minutes"}, "jetpack-boost-ready": "true", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "One Mile at a Time -
