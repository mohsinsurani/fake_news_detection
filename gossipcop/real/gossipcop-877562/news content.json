Luckily, dogs are very forgiving.\n\nWhile Evans was off filming a movie, he regularly posted on Twitter about how much he missed his rescue pup, Dodger, and counted down the days until they could be together again.\n\nOver the weekend, Evans finally got to go home to Dodger and he posted an adorable video of their reunion on Twitter. It\u2019s chock-full of tail wagging, face licking and laughing, as it shows two incredibly happy friends who are so excited to be back together at last.\n\nThe actor described himself as a \u201cdog lunatic\u201d when he spoke to People back in April. He earned the title after adopting Dodger from a kennel where he was filming a scene for his recent movie Gifted. \u201cI snagged him and he\u2019s such a good dog,\u201d says Evans. \u201cHe\u2019s just such a sweetheart, he\u2019s such a good boy. He loves dogs, he loves kids, he\u2019s full of love.\u201d Seems like the feelings are mutual.\n\n[H/T Today]\n\nContact us at letters@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/madonna.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chris-evans-dog.jpg?quality=85&w=2560", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/donald-trump-joe-biden-election.jpg?quality=85&crop=0px%2C35px%2C2400px%2C1601px&resize=160%2C106&strip", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chris-evans-dog.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chris-evans-dog.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Melissa Locker"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/4927245/chris-evans-dog-reunite-video/", "title": "See Chris Evans and His Dog Have the Cutest Reunion After 10 Weeks Apart", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "Chris Evans and his dog wasted no time catching up after spending 10 weeks apart.", "og": {"title": "See Chris Evans and His Dog Have the Cutest Reunion After 10 Weeks Apart", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/4927245/chris-evans-dog-reunite-video/", "description": "The two buddies wasted no time catching up after spending 10 weeks apart", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chris-evans-dog.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/4927245/chris-evans-dog-reunite-video/", "description": "Chris Evans and his dog wasted no time catching up after spending 10 weeks apart.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chris-evans-dog.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/4927245/chris-evans-dog-reunite-video/", "title": "See Chris Evans and His Dog Have the Cutest Reunion After 10 Weeks Apart", "description": "The two buddies wasted no time catching up after spending 10 weeks apart", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/chris-evans-dog.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
