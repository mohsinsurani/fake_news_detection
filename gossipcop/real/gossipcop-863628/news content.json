In the video from her shoot, Wozniacki talks about learning to get over her insecurities about her muscles and how she stopped comparing herself to other women who aren't professional athletes. \"I grew up to really love my body and the strength that I have,\" she said. \"Now I have a strong core, I have abs, I have a butt and I have thighs, because that's what I need to run fast and be able to sustain the power out there when I play against the other women.\" The tennis pro posted her cover on Instagram, writing, \"Proud and excited for this one! Thank you #ESPNBody for the cover!!\"\n\nElliott and B\u00e1ez also posted pictures of their covers on Instagram, and Waterson and Ennis uploaded behind-the-scenes images from the shoot. \"Remember when Barbie created that cute doll with a little more curves? 5' short little thing packing a bit more in the upper and lower halves? Hi, here I am, an example. Curves and all, one leg,\" Ennis captioned her post. \"I love this body and the hell I've put it through. Thank God, I have been so blessed. I love imperfection, and I love 'imperfect' bodies \u2014 they all tell stories.\"\n\nInstagram content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nYou May Also Like: This Body-Positive Clothing Line Will Change How You Think About Wedding Dresses", "images": ["https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-header.64f3bdc15b1f321829f9f30c7853a1469f469d71.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/631a4e9622293a343f87b716/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631a4745efc57ba7e5040843/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631b36a9051a0fa69a4de64d/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/4:3/w_2560%2Cc_limit/Screen%2520Shot%25202017-06-27%2520at%252012.54.50%2520PM.png", "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png", "https://media.self.com/photos/631a18622890f87008ebfd5c/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631b99a8b10ec0652ae20aea/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631b9e4b33792837033ce487/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.self.com/verso/static/self/assets/logo-reverse.22fddcfca2f2de42711a84ec66a5157a9995d8ab.svg", "https://media.self.com/photos/631a47342890f87008ebfd6a/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://media.self.com/photos/631f4017716669cf8a0cdb0b/16:9/w_800%2Ch_450%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Andrea Park"], "canonical_link": "https://www.self.com/story/espn-body-issue-caroline-wozniacki", "title": "Caroline Wozniacki, Ezekiel Elliott, and More Strip All the Way Down for ESPN The Magazine's Body Issue", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "For the ninth Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine, elite athletes like pro tennis player Caroline Wozniacki and NFL star Ezekiel Elliott posed completely nude.", "id": "59528d150a8bee08711f81a8", "keywords": "espn the body issue,caroline wozniacki", "news_keywords": "espn the body issue,caroline wozniacki", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large", "content-type": "article", "parsely-post-id": "59528d150a8bee08711f81a8", "parsely-metadata": "{\"description\":\"For the ninth Body Issue of ESPN The Magazine, elite athletes like pro tennis player Caroline Wozniacki and NFL star Ezekiel Elliott posed completely nude.\",\"image-16-9\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/16:9/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png\",\"image-1-1\":\"https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/1:1/w_1000,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png\"}", "og": {"description": "Including Caroline Wozniacki and Ezekiel Elliott.", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png", "site_name": "SELF", "title": "Your Favorite Athletes Stripped Down for ESPN's Body Issue", "type": "article", "url": "https://www.self.com/story/espn-body-issue-caroline-wozniacki"}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false", "section": "tags", "published_time": "2017-06-27T18:35:22.634Z", "modified_time": "2017-06-27T18:35:22.634Z", "author": "Andrea Park"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "creator": "@SELFmagazine", "description": "Including Caroline Wozniacki and Ezekiel Elliott.", "domain": "https://www.self.com", "image": "https://media.self.com/photos/59528df70a8bee08711f81aa/2:1/w_1280,c_limit/Screen%20Shot%202017-06-27%20at%2012.54.50%20PM.png?mbid=social_retweet", "site": "@SELFmagazine", "title": "Your Favorite Athletes Stripped Down for ESPN's Body Issue"}, "fb": {"app_id": 169640983205651, "pages": 8908243810}}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1498588522.634, "source": "https://www.self.com", "summary": ""}
