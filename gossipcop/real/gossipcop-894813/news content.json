I\u2019ve never met anyone like you nor will I ever. I just love you love you love you more than you know! I will NEVER forget you and I hope to one day be as strong as you. Now\u2026don\u2019t slack!!!! I assume you are already working on remodeling heaven!!!!:):). Miss you buddy!!!\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u2764\ufe0f\u201d\n\nChristina, 34, also shared a photo of herself and Miller, writing, \u201cFrank since the day I met you I had the utmost respect for you. Hardworking and REAL. Always a pleasure to be around and always made me laugh. You fought your hardest!! You are so admired and respected by all who know you. God has a special place for you in Heaven. Love you and miss you\u2764\ufe0f #RIP.\u201d\n\nIn the episode of The Doctors, which aired in September, Miller said it was Tarek who noticed something was off about his health.\n\n\u201cA couple of years ago, we were filming [Flip or Flop] and my voice started to get scratchy,\u201d Miller said.\n\nTarek recalled how Miller began losing his voice and clearing his throat.\n\n\u201cIt brought back memories of what I went through, which really scared me for him, which pushed me to make sure that he got it checked out,\u201d said Tarek, 36.\n\nThe HGTV host began raising money for his friend in June, when he shared a photo of Miller from a hospital bed. The father of two donated $5,000 to Miller\u2019s GoFundMe page.\n\nFour years ago, Tarek was diagnosed with both thyroid cancer and testicular cancer, but only revealed that he was battling the former.\n\n\u201cTesticular cancer is more of a private thing,\u201d he previously told PEOPLE about why he kept it a secret.", "images":
