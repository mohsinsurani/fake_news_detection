Our client is fully cooperating with authorities on that investigation,\u201d reads the statement. \u201cHe expects to be completely vindicated once the investigation is concluded. He sends his best regards to his fans and his fellow castmates.\u201d\n\nAnd while the rest of the cast agreed that Ravenel\u2019s absence from the reunion was appropriate given the situation, his ex Kathryn Dennis declined to comment for the sake of their two children.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m not going to comment until it\u2019s resolved,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I am going to focus on is just the children and staying out of it.\u201d\n\nThe former couple shares Kensie, 4, and Saint, 2\u00bd.\n\nCharles Sykes/Bravo/NBCU\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve been trying to spend more time together in front of the children,\u201d she said. \u201cSo things are moving in the right direction the best as they can.\u201d\n\nSouth Carolina police are investigating allegations of sexual assault brought against Ravenel by \u201cnanny Dawn,\u201d who was featured on the show caring for their kids.\n\nAdditionally, real estate agent Ashley Perkins has alleged that Ravenel assaulted her mom Debbie Holloway Perkins after meeting him on Tinder in October 2015 and going on a last-minute first date.\n\nRELATED VIDEO: Southern Charm\u2019s Thomas Ravenel Accused of Sexual Assault, Allegedly Paid Accuser $200,000\n\nRavenel has denied the accusations. A source close to the network previously told PEOPLE that \u201cno decision has been made yet\u201d about firing him from the reality show.\n\nWhile the allegations were only addressed during the beginning of the show, Dennis looked noticeably uncomfortable as her castmates discussed Ravenel.\n\nKathryn Dennis/Instagran\n\n\u201cI think it\u2019s the right decision for him not to be here,\u201d said Cameran Eubanks.\n\nAnd Shep Rose noted that Ravenel has a \u201cvolatile\u201d side to his personality.\n\n\u201cI will say this, 90 percent of the time Thomas is funny, eccentric, jovial and then we\u2019ve seen there\u2019s a side of him that\u2019s not really him,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a big part of him that I really love and a little part that I don\u2019t.\u201d\n\nRavenel\u2019s girlfriend Ashley Jacobs will appear on part two of the reunion. In a preview for next week\u2019s episode, Jacobs said she expects Ravenel to be cleared of all accusations.\n\n\u201cOf course, yes,\u201d she said. \u201cHe has not be charged with anything. These are just allegations.\u201d", "images":
