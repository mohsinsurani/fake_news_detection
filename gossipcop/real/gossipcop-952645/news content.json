The New York Observer was the first to report on the sale of the four bedroom home that\u2019s located in the Flatiron District.\n\nB\u00fcndchen and Brady first listed this apartment, which has sweeping NYC views, for $17.25 million, in 2016. The couple wasn\u2019t able to find a buyer at that price, so earlier this year, they slashed the price on the condo to $13.95 million, and that seemed to do the trick. The couple had purchased the full-floor apartment back in 2014 for $11.7 million.\n\nThe new owner of their apartment can look forward to floor-to-ceiling windows, and 360 degree views of the city. Residents in the building also have access to amenities like an indoor pool, steam room, and fitness center.\n\nLast year, Brady and B\u00fcndchen reportedly purchased a nearly $30 million home at the Robert A.M. Stern Architects-designed 70 Vestry, in Tribeca. Aside from that, the couple also owns homes in Massachusetts, Montana, and Costa Rica, according to the Observer.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/fn9eoSz5EaJMjidLQmhEegAtKDU=/0x0:1050x700/1200x800/filters:focal(205x30:845x670)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/60360107/1.0.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UJJelCTQyYby54TE0Ht4K6wNL0=/0x75:1050x625/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11685779/1.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/DBcq55q3nUP8DySV1LhH39wkBbI=/0x0:4000x2667/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:4000x2667):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11685789/49A360B6_88E3_95E6_570E_12DE9ADE6185.jpg"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UJJelCTQyYby54TE0Ht4K6wNL0=/0x75:1050x625/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11685779/1.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Tanay Warerkar", "Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://ny.curbed.com/2018/7/13/17568292/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-one-madison-sold-home", "title": "Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen finally sell their One Madison pad", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Curbed NY", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/curbedny", "author": "https://www.facebook.com/curbedny/?ref=hl", "published_time": "2018-07-13T11:15:02-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-13T11:15:02-04:00"}, "author": "Tanay Warerkar", "style-tools": "https://archive.curbed.com/style/community/597/c0407fb1958b490449ac815a9642e931/tools.css", "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "description": "The full-floor condo was last on the market for $13.95 million.", "og": {"description": "The full-floor condo was last on the market for $13.95 million.", "image": {"identifier": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/5UJJelCTQyYby54TE0Ht4K6wNL0=/0x75:1050x625/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11685779/1.jpg", "height": 630, "width": 1200}, "site_name": "Curbed NY", "title": "Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen finally sell their One Madison pad", "type": "article", "url": "https://ny.curbed.com/2018/7/13/17568292/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-one-madison-sold-home"}, "fb": {"app_id": 549923288395304}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://ny.curbed.com/2018/7/13/17568292/tom-brady-gisele-bundchen-one-madison-sold-home", "title": "Tom Brady and Gisele B\u00fcndchen finally sell their One Madison pad", "description": "The full-floor condo was last on the market for $13.95 million.", "image": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/CwxBzhuldGnM7q2OX7cRSOK41Zo=/0x88:1050x613/fit-in/1200x600/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11685779/1.jpg", "site": "CurbedNY"}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/6071835/144x144.0.png", "msapplication-TileColor": "#FF604A", "outbrainsection": "celebrity-houses-real-estate"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1531436400.0, "source": "https://ny.curbed.com", "summary": ""}
