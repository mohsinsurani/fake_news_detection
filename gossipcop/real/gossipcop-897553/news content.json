Alexandra, Hilltop, Kingdom, Sanctuary, and Oceanside have all found a way to live and work together to rebuild society. But this is The Walking Dead. That peace won't last forever.\n\nWhich is why it's time to make some predictions, as we have with the past few seasons, about who is going to become zombie meat this year. For your reading pleasure, we've compiled a list of all the characters left on the show and predict whether they'll survive season eight or reach the end of the road.\n\nWe'll be updating this list with the results throughout the season as characters start dying. Here we go...AGAIN, MAJOR SPOILERS BELOW!\n\nDEAD\n\nGregory (Xander Berkeley)\n\nPrediction: Dies\n\nResult: Dead\n\nGregory was hanged by Maggie in a public execution after he plotted to have her killed.\n\nSTILL WALKING\n\nAlden (Callan McAuliffe)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nA Savior turned Hilltopper, Alden is one of the newest additions to the cast. So far, his story really seems to revolve around Maggie. Is he a possible new love interest? That's the popular fan theory at the moment. Too bad Maggie's leaving the show this season...\n\nSiddiq (Avi Nash)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nSiddiq joined Alexandria just as it said goodbye to Carl Grimes, who died in last year's midseason premiere. Now, he's an important member of the communities as a trained doctor. Avi Nash is a main cast member in season 9 and it'll be interesting to see how his story evolves in season 9. He should be relatively safe.\n\nEnid (Katelyn Nacon)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nEnid began her time on the show as a loner and has over the years become a vital part of the Hilltop. We expect to see much more of her this season.\n\nTara Chambler (Alanna Masterson)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nIt seemed that Tara was marked for death after getting his with one of Dwight's \"tainted\" arrows last season, but she didn't turn. With a fakeout last year, Tara is probably safe.\n\nJadis/Anne (Pollyanna McIntosh)\n\nPrediction: Dies\n\nJadis was left with nothing at the end of season 8 except her life. She's now given up her Heapster persona and returned to her old identity as Anne. Will she be able to co-exist with the people she once tried to kill? We say no. She won't make it to season 9.\n\nDwight (Austin Amelio)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nI'm going with what I know from the comics about Dwight. He lives on for several arcs in the book, so there's no reason for me to suspect he'll die in season 9. The only question is whether he'll return to the show this season or at all...\n\nKing Ezekiel (Khary Payton)\n\nPrediction: Dies\n\nEzekiel lost a lot in the war against Negan, including his beloved Shiva. But things are looking up for Ezekiel this year, as he rebuilds his kingdom and begins a relationship with Carol. Which is exactly why he'll die this year. We all know Carol is a bit cursed when it comes to loved ones. Ezekiel won't fare much better.\n\nPaul \"Jesus\" Rovia (Tom Payne)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nTom Payne's Paul \"Jesus\" Rovia is one of those characters we've still not seen enough of, and season 9 might finally give us more on him. I also think there's still much to do at the Hilltop now that there's been a change in leadership, and Jesus will be a key part of all of that. Jesus will probably make it to season 10.\n\nFather Gabriel Stokes (Seth Gilliam)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nLike Carol, Gabriel's really come a long way since his days as a cowardly priest in Georgia. I think Gabriel is probably safe for the time being, as long as he's still willing to fight.\n\nAaron (Ross Marquand)\n\nPrediction: Dies\n\nAaron's has had a hard time these last few seasons. He even lost Eric in the fight against Negan. Will things turn around for him in season 9? We're not sure they will...\n\nRosita Espinosa (Christian Serratos)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nRosita went through hell in season 7 and come out on the other side in season 8. The war is over and she's found peace now that Negan, who killed her beloved Abraham, is behind bars. The show has focused more on her these last two years and we expect new showrunner Angela Kang will find interesting ways to explore this character.\n\nEugene Porter (Josh McDermitt)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nWe've said it for several seasons: the mullet will never die and season 8 proved that when he survived working for Negan against Rick's coalition. A last minute plan to sabotage the Saviors saved Eugene's life. A year and a half later, Eugene might be back in the good grace's of the other communities.\n\nJudith Grimes\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nAMC IS NEVER GOING TO KILL A TODDLER. Right?\n\nCarol Peletier (Melissa McBride)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nCarol has gone through hell and back over and over. From domestic violence to losing her daughter to being exiled to baking cookies to losing her lust for blood and ditching Alexandria to going to war against the Saviors, Carol has faced it all on this show. She's survived it all and she'll survive season 9.\n\nMaggie Rhee (Lauren Cohan)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nYes, Lauren Cohan is leaving the show, but hear us out: Cohan has said that Maggie's fate will be left open-ended, which means that she won't necessarily die. We'll just have to wait and see.\n\nDaryl Dixon (Norman Reedus)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nThis badass fan favorite is never going to die. At least not this season...File this guy under immortal.\n\nMichonne (Danai Gurira)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nMichonne is as important to Alexandria as Rick, and with the Sheriff on his way out, the settlement will be looking for a new leader. It'll undoubtedly be Michonne. She's safe this year, but with Danai Gurira becoming a bigger star by the minute (we love Okoye), her time on the show may be coming to an end eventually.\n\nNegan (Jeffrey Dean Morgan)\n\nPrediction: Lives\n\nAfter making such a big deal about Rick sparing Negan at the end of season 8, there's no way the former Savior leader will die any time soon.\n\nRick (Andrew Lincoln)\n\nPrediction: Dies\n\nWe never thought we'd be saying this but this year is the end of the road for Rick Grimes. Andrew Lincoln announced his exit from the show earlier this summer, so there's no longer any doubt that he'll be killed off. The question is how?\n\nJohn Saavedra is an associate editor at Den of Geek. Read more of his work here.
