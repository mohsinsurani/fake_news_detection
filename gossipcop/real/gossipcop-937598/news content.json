In the video, the world-famous K-pop boy band joins Banks in striking poses full of personality. Clearly, they\u2019re no strangers to hamming it up for the camera.\n\nAt Sunday night\u2019s show, the popular group of seven \u2014 who are known for their singing, rapping and dancing, besides living up to Banks\u2019s standards in posing \u2014 took home the award for Top Social Artist (for the second year in a row). They also took to the stage to perform their new single \u201cFake Love\u201d off of just-released album Love Yourself: Tear, making history as the first K-pop act to perform at the BBMAs. Throughout the evening, the BTS fans in the audience and online went wild for the group, who have developed a loyal following that calls itself the \u201cArmy\u201d and has propelled them to global superstar status.\n\nBanks, meanwhile, was living it up at the show, hanging out with BTS, Lil Hank Williams (real name: Mason Ramsey) and more, and generally enjoying being a part of the audience on the night that Janet Jackson won a historic Icon Award and Christina Aguilera and Demi Lovato joined together for a duet.\n\nWrite to Raisa Bruner at raisa.bruner@time.com.", "images": ["http://time.com/img/icons/metamask.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/kelly-clarkson-billboard-music-awards-2018-medley.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas.jpg?quality=85&w=4800", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/defining-works-black-renaissance-01b.jpg?quality=85&w=160&h=106&crop=1", "http://time.com/img/loading-circle.gif", "http://time.com/img/icons/crypto-wallet.png", "http://time.com/img/icons/wallet-connect.png", "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"], "top_img": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Raisa Bruner"], "canonical_link": "https://time.com/5285984/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas/", "title": "Tyra Banks Struck a Pose with BTS and Outed Herself as a Fan", "meta_data": {"robots": "max-image-preview:large", "format-detection": "telephone=no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "description": "The 'America's Next Top Model' creator teamed up with the K-pop superstars of BTS to strike a memorable pose at the Billboard Music Awards.", "og": {"title": "Tyra Banks Struck a Pose with BTS and Outed Herself as a Fan", "type": "article", "site_name": "Time", "url": "https://time.com/5285984/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas/", "description": "Meeting the famous K-pop group is \"better than smizing,\" according to Banks", "image": {"identifier": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1", "width": 1200, "height": 628}}, "article": {"content_tier": "free", "opinion": "false"}, "pinterest": {"url": "https://time.com/5285984/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas/", "description": "The 'America's Next Top Model' creator teamed up with the K-pop superstars of BTS to strike a memorable pose at the Billboard Music Awards.", "media": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "url": "https://time.com/5285984/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas/", "title": "Tyra Banks Struck a Pose with BTS and Outed Herself as a Fan", "description": "Meeting the famous K-pop group is \"better than smizing,\" according to Banks", "site": "@TIME", "image": "https://api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/tyra-banks-bts-bbmas.jpg?quality=85&w=1200&h=628&crop=1"}, "fb": {"app_id": 53177223193, "pages": 10606591490}, "recaptcha-key": "6LfZrtgZAAAAAJ8n221oa1YgG6cVvoOPgamCm6oT"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "http://time.com", "summary": ""}
