Show your support for LGBT youth,\" he wrote in the caption.\n\n\"Scandal\" star Kerry Washington also posted her own contribution to the Spirit Day festivities on Instagram and encouraged everyone to do the same. \"Join me and go purple and take a stand against bullying for #SpiritDay. Stand up for LGBT youth and #ChooseKindness,\" she wrote in the caption.\n\nAside from the two, E! News noted that Elizabeth Banks, Steve Howey, Emilie De Ravin, Adam Lambert, Darren Criss, Hailee Steinfeld, Courtney Love, Tinashe and Celine Dion also showed their support for Spirit Day. The \"Beauty and the Beast\" singer shared a clip of herself performing \"Purple Rain\" on Facebook. \"Let it rain purple on #SpiritDay\" as we take a stand together against bullying and to support LGBTQ youth,\" Dion's post read.\n\nOn Wednesday, Love, Steinfeld, Lambert, Selena Gomez and Troye Sivan were among the celebrities who took part at GLAAD's (Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation) fundraising concert at Los Angeles' The Sayers Club. The event raised money and awareness for Spirit Day.\n\n\"When you have the president of the United States saying that the vice president wants to hang gay people, when a flier showed up on a university campus today that told gay people that they should just kill themselves, with an image of someone hanging themselves, it's bad out there and we get to come here together to celebrate the progress that we've made but also to shine a light for those that may be voiceless at this time and feel alone and isolated,\" GLAAD president Sarah Kate Ellis said during the show (via The Hollywood Reporter).\n\nJustin Tranter, the popular songwriter behind some of Gomez's, Britney Spears' and Justin Bieber's hit songs, was also present at the event. He hosted the concert and performed the top-40 singles that he has written for the other artists. Tranter raised over $100,000 for the organization during the event.\n\n\"We need to raise as much money as we can tonight to protect the kids out there that don't have the privilege of safety that I did,\" Tranter said.\n\nPhoto: Getty Images/Astrid Stawiarz", "images": ["https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/styles/embed/public/2017/10/19/spirit-day.jpg", "https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/10/19/spirit-day.jpg"], "top_img": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/10/19/spirit-day.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938/http://www.ibtimes.com/celine-dion-todd-chrisley-kerry-washington-more-show-support-spiritday-2603887", "title": "Celine Dion, Todd Chrisley, Kerry Washington And More Show Support For #SpiritDay", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1, user-scalable=no", "news_keywords": "spirit day purple, selena gomez spirit day, celine dion spirit day, celine dion facebook, todd chrisley spirit day, todd chrisley instagram, kerry washington spirit day, kerry washington instagram, justin tranter glaad concert, justin tranter songs", "fb": {"app_id": 263851690471857, "pages": 128026713884051}, "og": {"type": "article", "site_name": "International Business Times", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938/http://www.ibtimes.com/celine-dion-todd-chrisley-kerry-washington-more-show-support-spiritday-2603887", "title": "Celine Dion, Todd Chrisley, Kerry Washington And More Show Support For #SpiritDay", "description": "A number of celebrities wore purple and performed at GLAAD's fundraising event to support Spirit Day.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/10/19/spirit-day.jpg"}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/IBTimes", "section": "Entertainment", "modified_time": "2017-10-20T08:00:42-04:00", "published_time": "2017-10-20T05:21:37-04:00"}, "twitter": {"site": "@IBTimes", "card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Celine Dion, Todd Chrisley, Kerry Washington And More Show Support For #SpiritDay", "url": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938im_/http://www.ibtimes.com/celine-dion-todd-chrisley-kerry-washington-more-show-support-spiritday-2603887", "description": "A number of celebrities wore purple and performed at GLAAD's fundraising event to support Spirit Day.", "image": "https://web.archive.org/web/20171020144938im_/http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/files/2017/10/19/spirit-day.jpg"}, "msapplication-TileColor": "#000000", "msapplication-TileImage": "http://s1.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/mstile-144x144.png", "msapplication-config": "http://s2.ibtimes.com/sites/www.ibtimes.com/themes/us_ibtimes/favicons/browserconfig.xml", "com.silverpop.brandeddomains": "www.pages06.net,aidataconf.com,amp.ibtimes.co.uk,e-amp.newsweek.com,e-sns.newsweek.com,europe.newsweek.com,events.newsweek.com,ibt-dev.co.uk,ibtimes.co.uk,ibtimes.com,idigitaltimes.com,latintimes.com,medicaldaily.com,newsweek.com,player.one,sns.europe.newsweek.com,sns.ibtimes.co.uk,subscription.newsweek.com,www.ibt-dev.co.uk,www.ibtimes.co.uk,www.ibtimes.com", "description": "A number of celebrities wore purple and performed at GLAAD's fundraising event to support Spirit Day."}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1508491297.0, "source": "https://web.archive.org", "summary": ""}
