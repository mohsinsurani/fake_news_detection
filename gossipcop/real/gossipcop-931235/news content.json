But according to new reports, the royals may be about to move into bigger accommodation already.\n\nRelated Story A Day in The Life of Princess Eugenie of York\n\nIt was recently revealed that Princess Eugenie and Jack Brooksbank will live next door to Prince Harry and Meghan after their own royal wedding on October 12. While Eugenie and Jack will live in Ivy Cottage on the Kensington Palace estate, it's extremely possible that Meghan and Harry will soon be moving out of their first home together, Nottingham Cottage.\n\nBut it's unlikely that the Duke and Duchess of Sussex will move very far. Vanity Fair is reporting that while Meghan first settled into Harry's bachelor pad, she will soon be moving into a new marital home in Kensington Palace, following the extensive renovations of the apartment next door to Prince William and Kate Middleton.\n\nChris Jackson // Getty Images\n\nPer Vanity Fair, the renovations cost a jaw-dropping $1.8 million, to help make the 21-room Apartment 1 liveable. Kate and William famously live in Apartment 1A, meaning that Harry and Meghan will be directly next door to their relatives, with Vanity Fair even reporting that there are \"adjoining doors\" between the properties.\n\nHowever, the Daily Express' royal correspondent counters this report with his own intel. claims that, according to anonymous palace aides, Harry and Meghan will be staying in Nottingham Cottage \"the foreseeable future.\"\n\nThis isn't the first time that rumors have abounded regarding Harry and Meghan moving house. Back in May 2018, right before the royal wedding, House Beautiful UK reported that Harry and Meghan were set to move into Apartment 1, which the Duke and Duchess of Gloucester had recently moved out of.\n\nFor now, we'll all just have to patiently await official confirmation regarding Harry and Meghan's current residence.", "images": ["https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665062756.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.788xh;0,0.0252xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-meghan-markle-catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-news-photo-925301438-1538929294.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.680xh;0,0.0153xh&resize=1200:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/crown-prince-frederik-of-denmark-prince-vincent-of-denmark-news-photo-1664899080.jpg?crop=0.670xw:1.00xh;0.170xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/32a17ebf-adab-48ef-a723-758c53a8bea8_1524066273.file?fill=1:1&resize=80:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665149715.jpg?crop=0.803xw:1.00xh;0.0946xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/fekixdhxgaapvq7-1664823960.jpeg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.0406xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-974108668-1528993164.jpg?crop=1xw:0.69412xh;center,top&resize=300:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664895878.jpg?crop=0.527xw:1.00xh;0.237xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4m769-1664893662.jpg?crop=0.644xw:0.957xh;0.0962xw,0.0430xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/britains-catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-and-britains-prince-news-photo-898523250-1538929155.jpg?crop=1xw:0.66667xh;center,top&resize=640:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665078914.jpg?crop=0.657xw:1.00xh;0.293xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/in-this-image-released-on-may-2-prince-harry-the-duke-of-news-photo-1665174018.jpg?crop=0.655xw:1.00xh;0.287xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2k4x9br-1664984071.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.668xh;0,0.185xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664976504.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.691xh;0,0.0431xh&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1664889898.jpg?crop=0.684xw:1.00xh;0.146xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gettyimages-1665160606.jpg?crop=0.739xw:1.00xh;0.0962xw,0&resize=180:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/images/screen-shot-2019-01-16-at-1-21-54-pm-1547662931.png?crop=0.7671930128983747xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/harpersbazaar/static/images/logos/network-logo.a5366f4.svg", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-william-duke-of-cambridge-catherine-duchess-of-news-photo-995320762-1538930225.jpg?crop=1xw:1xh;center,top&resize=480:*", "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/32/1600x800/landscape-1470677477-hbz-princess-eugenie-00-index.jpg?resize=300:*"], "top_img": "https://hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/prince-harry-meghan-markle-catherine-duchess-of-cambridge-news-photo-925301438-1538929294.jpg?crop=1.00xw:0.680xh;0,0.0153xh&resize=1200:*", "keywords": [], "authors": [], "canonical_link": "https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a23629932/prince-harry-meghan-markle-neighbors-with-prince-william-kate-middleton-kensington-palace/", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Will Be Neighbors with Prince William and Kate Middleton", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "robots": "max-image-preview:large,max-snippet:-1,max-video-preview:30", "X-UA-Compatible": "IE=edge,chrom=1", "msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "title": "Prince Harry and Meghan Markle Will Be Neighbors with Prince William and Kate Middleton", "description": "Prior to their wedding on May 19, it was reported that Meghan Markle\ufeff had moved into Prince Harry's abode of Nottingham Cottage\ufeff at Kensington Palace.
