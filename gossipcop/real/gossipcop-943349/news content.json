It\u2019s a tournament where legends are born, hearts are broken, and, when all is said and done, a team is crowned the World Cup champion: the pinnacle of the world\u2019s most popular sport.\n\nAt least half the world will tune in to the competition, even if most Americans probably won\u2019t. That\u2019s in part because the US national team didn\u2019t qualify, but that\u2019s not the whole story. Ahead of the last World Cup in 2014, which featured Team USA, 87 percent of Americans said they knew little to nothing about soccer, and around 67 percent had no plans to watch.\n\nHere\u2019s my plea: Continue to watch the World Cup even without the US in it. I bet you\u2019ll start to enjoy soccer and the tournament as the rest of the world does. \u201cSoccer is the working man\u2019s ballet,\u201d Simon Kuper, co-author of Soccernomics, which was updated for this World Cup, told me. \u201cYou can see beauty and genius right away. It\u2019s hard to appreciate the genius of Einstein, but one can easily appreciate the beauty of Messi.\u201d\n\nIf you\u2019re on the fence about whether to tune in, in part because you don\u2019t know much about the World Cup, don\u2019t worry. What follows is a guide that helps answer all the most embarrassing questions you wouldn\u2019t want to ask out loud. At least, that\u2019s the goal (get it?).\n\nLet\u2019s get this ball rolling.\n\n1) What is the World Cup, and how does it work?\n\nSimply put, the World Cup is the single most beloved sporting event on the planet.\n\n\u201cThe World Cup brings together the most people on the globe,\u201d Grant Wahl, the author of Masters of Modern Soccer, told me. \u201cMore countries care about this sport and this tournament than any other event.\u201d\n\nThe first World Cup took place in Uruguay in 1930 after soccer became a popular event at the Olympics. FIFA, soccer\u2019s governing body (more on this group below), wanted to stage an international competition where professionals \u2014 instead of amateurs at the Olympics \u2014 could play and draw big crowds.\n\nIt has since turned into a global phenomenon that enthralls soccer fans every four years. It is the world\u2019s most-watched sporting event and generates billions of dollars from sponsorships, ticket and shirt sales, broadcasting licenses, and much more.\n\nHere\u2019s how the World Cup works: All the world\u2019s 207 national teams are split up into six regions. Over a roughly two-year period, they compete in regional qualifying tournaments to earn one of the 32 spots at the World Cup. The host of the tournament \u2014 in this case, Russia \u2014 receives an automatic spot, even if it doesn\u2019t have a particularly good squad. (Sorry, Putin.)\n\nFIFA gives regions with more and better national teams a greater number of spots. That\u2019s why the tournament will feature fewer teams from Asia or Africa, for example, than Europe.\n\nThe qualifying 32 teams are then put into eight groups of four \u2014 labeled Groups A through H \u2014 by a random, though seeded, draw. After the draw, the group that is deemed the hardest to win, meaning that all four teams are fairly evenly matched, is called the \u201cGroup of Death.\u201d This year, however, there is some debate as to which one deserves that title.\n\nOnce the group stage begins, the teams compete in a round-robin format, where each country plays the other three in the group just once. A win is worth 3 points; a tie, 1 point; and a loss, 0. The two teams with the highest point totals at the end of those three games move on to the knockout rounds.\n\nThat\u2019s when the World Cup gets really fun \u2014 and soccer fans\u2019 blood pressure rises to unhealthy levels. In the group stage, a team could tie a game, or even lose, but still play on. But in the knockout rounds, the losing team is eliminated from the entire tournament while the winner goes to the next round.\n\nRecall that soccer has two halves, each 45 minutes long, for a total of a 90-minute game (plus \u201cstoppage time\u201d for injuries and substitutions, at the referees\u2019 discretion). If the scores are tied at the end of those 90 minutes, the knockout game goes into a 30-minute overtime; if both sides remain tied after that, they go to penalty kicks.\n\nThe win-or-go-home nature of the knockout rounds makes every pass, every slide tackle, every save, and, yes, every goal matter even more.\n\nThere\u2019s a round of 16, which then turns into a quarterfinal, which becomes a semifinal, ultimately leading to the biggest game in all of soccerdom: the World Cup final. It\u2019s like Game 7 of the World Series and the Super Bowl all rolled into one, but the entire world cares about it.\n\nYou can tell how much winning the final means to players and fans just from Germany\u2019s celebrations after it won the last World Cup in 2014. The country held a huge party when the players returned home.\n\n(Quick note: The losers of the two semifinal games play each other before the final to determine who comes in third place. It\u2019s technically part of the tournament, but it\u2019s more about making the almost-finalists feel good, I guess.)\n\n2) Where is the 2018 World Cup?\n\nFIFA, world soccer\u2019s governing body, chooses where it will hold its quadrennial flagship tournament based on bids (and maybe some bribes) from countries. In December 2010, it made a startling decision: Russia would host the 2018 competition. (It also tapped Qatar for the 2022 tournament, but more on that later.)\n\nThat was somewhat surprising; other candidates angling for the tournament included a joint Belgium-Netherlands bid, a solo England bid, and a joint Portugal-Spain bid. At the time, those options seemed more attractive to soccer fans because, well, they have great soccer facilities and cultures \u2014 and are also not run by an autocrat like Vladimir Putin.\n\nThere were some irregularities with the vote. A member of Russia\u2019s World Cup lobbying group sent a painting to a FIFA executive, for example. And three weeks before the tally, news broke that FIFA had suspended two voting members for accepting bribes in exchange for votes. However, a commissioned FIFA report cleared Russia of any \u201cundue influence.\u201d\n\nAwarding authoritarian countries with top global sporting events is actually a trend. As my colleague Zeeshan Aleem pointed out, fewer countries now want to host the Olympics because of how costly it is. But dictatorships that don\u2019t have to worry about financial accountability to citizens remain interested in hosting big sporting competitions.\n\nThe same is true for the World Cup. \u201cThe World Cup became very overpriced,\u201d said Kuper, who is also a columnist for the Financial Times. He noted that Germany upped the ante when it hosted in 2006 by having top-of-the-line stadiums and facilities, spending roughly $4 billion to host the competition.\n\nThere were other instances of countries going all out to win the bid. In 2002, South Korea and Japan built 16 total stadiums, and refurbished four others, to host the tournament. Brazil spent around $15 billion to host the 2014 competition.\n\nThat upped the ante for hosting the 2018 World Cup. So far, it looks like Russia has reportedly spent \u2014 wait for it \u2014 $12 billion total to host the World Cup, with nearly 60 percent of that money coming from the country\u2019s federal budget.\n\nThat massive spending total includes building the Krestovsky Stadium in St. Petersburg. It cost about $1 billion, seats around 70,000 fans, and is now the second-largest stadium in the country. As you might imagine with a project like this \u2014 and because it\u2019s Russia \u2014 there was a lot of corruption surrounding the stadium\u2019s creation. One prominent example: A Russian deputy governor received around 50 million rubles, or $800,000, in kickbacks from the subcontractor who built the scoreboard.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a systemic problem. You can\u2019t build something legally, safely and sensibly in Russia without constant cost overruns, corruption, and mismanagement,\u201d Lyubov Sobol, a researcher at the anti-Putin Foundation for Fighting Corruption, told the Financial Times in 2016.\n\nBut FIFA likely won\u2019t mind. Russia (and Qatar) effectively told the organization, \u201cLook, whatever you want, we\u2019ll spend the money \u2014 we don\u2019t care because we\u2019re not accountable, really, to our population,\u201d Kuper told me. Having lavish facilities, frankly, makes the World Cup aesthetically pleasing, which in turn reflects well on Russia and FIFA.\n\nHere\u2019s one thing that might make both Russia and FIFA look bad, though: Russia\u2019s notorious hooliganism. There is currently a disturbing rise in neo-Nazi soccer fans in Russia. During a European soccer tournament in the summer of 2016, Russians attacked English fans \u2014 cutting one person\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel and lodging glass into another person\u2019s neck.\n\n\u201cIt was like nothing I\u2019ve ever seen before,\u201d a British police officer told Sky News. \u201cThe Russians came with serious intent to carry out barbaric violence. They were highly organized, very effective. We saw football hooliganism on a different level.\u201d\n\nRussian soccer fans are also known for their rampant racism. FIFA even fined Russia around $30,000 in early May for failing to stop bigoted chants from supporters during a game against France. (The French team has a lot of black players.)\n\nSo the World Cup may look aesthetically pleasing thanks to Putin\u2019s heavy spending, but the Russian fans could make the tournament look really ugly.\n\n3) What is FIFA?\n\nWe\u2019ve talked a lot already about this soccer governing body known as FIFA. What the heck is it, and why is the World Cup called the FIFA World Cup, anyway?\n\nFIFA stands for the F\u00e9d\u00e9ration Internationale de Football Association. It\u2019s the soccer organization that runs the World Cup and has a super-French name because, well, it was founded in Paris in May 1904. It runs other big tournaments worldwide too, but the World Cup is its main showpiece.\n\nIt\u2019s best to think of FIFA as the global administrative hub of soccer that aims to regulate and promote the sport worldwide. Oddly, it runs like an actual global political body. It has a president who leads the entire organization, a Congress that passes dictates for the game, and even committees that provide strategic guidance and oversight.\n\nFIFA is also made up of six semiautonomous regional bodies that help govern their respective areas. These regional bodies administrate all things soccer for their areas, including the six different qualifying tournaments for the World Cup. Soccer in the United States, for example, is governed by the the Confederation of North, Central America, and Caribbean Association Football \u2014 known more commonly as CONCACAF.\n\nLike most large international bodies, FIFA has had its share of major scandals.\n\nHere\u2019s the most recent big one: In 2015, the US Department of Justice indicted nine FIFA officials and five corporate executives for racketeering conspiracy, money laundering, and wire fraud as part of \u201ca 24-year scheme to enrich themselves through the corruption of international soccer.\u201d It\u2019s worth noting that FIFA is technically a nonprofit, even though it makes billions of dollars.\n\nTwo charged members included Alfredo Hawit, then the president of CONCACAF, and Juan \u00c1ngel Napout, formerly the South American region\u2019s chief. The scandal eventually led Sepp Blatter, then the head of FIFA, to resign.\n\nFIFA\u2019s corruption has caused some prominent soccer fans to wrestle with their love of the World Cup. Look no further than John Oliver: In 2014, he worked through his conflicting anti-FIFA and pro-World Cup feelings during the early days of his show Last Week Tonight.\n\nIt\u2019s worth your time to watch, if for no other reason than you\u2019re going to need a laugh before the next section.\n\n4) Is the USA in the World Cup 2018?\n\nIf you\u2019re not sitting down while you read this, grab a seat. It\u2019s about to get rough.\n\nHere\u2019s really all you need to know: America didn\u2019t qualify for the tournament, even though it should have. (The women\u2019s national team, it should be noted, is the best in the world and won the last Women\u2019s World Cup in 2015.)\n\nThe US, like every other country, went through regional qualifying in order to make the World Cup. The United States, because it\u2019s in North America, competes in CONCACAF.\n\nThere are multiple rounds in CONCACAF\u2019s qualifying tournament, but the fifth and final one sees the six best teams compete in what\u2019s called the \u201cHexagonal,\u201d known colloquially as \u201cthe Hex.\u201d\n\nIn that round, each team plays the others twice \u2014 home and away \u2014 for a total of 10 games. The top three teams with the highest point total automatically make it to the World Cup, while the fourth-place team has to go into a playoff with an Asian runner-up to qualify. (Again, a win gets a team 3 points; a tie earns 1 point; a loss means a team receives no points.)\n\nThe United States made it to the Hexagonal. That meant America had to place among the top four teams in a group consisting of Mexico, Costa Rica, Panama, Honduras, and Trinidad and Tobago to make it into the World Cup.\n\nAs you can tell from the results list below, the United States didn\u2019t perform well in the round. It lost its first two games against Mexico and Costa Rica, and then struggled mightily to work its way back into the fold.\n\nUltimately, the US ended up in fifth place after a disastrous 2-1 loss to Trinidad and Tobago in the final game on October 20, 2017. But had America won, the team would be at the World Cup.\n\nThat, in a nutshell, is the tragedy. Trinidad was by far the worst team in the group and hadn\u2019t won any of its previous nine matches \u2014 with the US beating Trinidad 2-0 about four months earlier.\n\nWhat\u2019s worse, Panama and Honduras had to respectively beat Costa Rica and Mexico, the two best teams in the Hexagonal, to knock out the US if it lost to Trindad. And, of course, that\u2019s exactly what happened. That meant Mexico, Costa Rica, and Panama would automatically qualify, leaving Honduras to play Australia for a World Cup spot (Australia won, knocking out Honduras).\n\nLet\u2019s be clear: The United States is by no means a world soccer power, but it is a major force within its own region alongside Mexico and Costa Rica. America had played in every World Cup since 1990, often comfortably making it into the tournament through the regional qualifier.\n\nBut now you won\u2019t see the United States in Russia because of its tragically poor performance. \u201cIt was one of the greatest failures in the history of American sports,\u201d Wahl, who also writes about soccer for Sports Illustrated, told me.\n\nThere are tons of rants from former US soccer professionals about what happened. I particularly recommend this one from Alexi Lalas, a Team USA legend who now serves as an analyst for Fox Sports 1. Let\u2019s just say he speaks for me as he goes off on how poorly the US played throughout the Hex.\n\n5) Who\u2019s favored to win the World Cup?\n\nIf you follow soccer, the tournament favorites won\u2019t surprise you: Based on soccer mathematician David Sumpter\u2019s model, they are (in order) Germany, Brazil, France, Spain, and Argentina.\n\nThat makes sense: All those teams are ridiculously stacked with talent, and each has won at least one World Cup.\n\nThere are good reasons to think those countries will perform well. Germany won the last World Cup in 2014, and many of the same players from that squad are back for 2018. Brazil has won five World Cups \u2014 the most in history \u2014 and features one of the world\u2019s best players in Neymar. Brazil is also arguably the most complete team in the tournament.\n\nFrance is a perennial world soccer power and conceivably has one of the easiest paths to the final, especially since it was placed in a relatively easy group with Peru, Denmark, and Australia. Spain won the World Cup in 2010 and is full of wily tournament veterans that know how to win.\n\nAnd Argentina remains one of the world\u2019s best teams, and its captain, Lionel Messi, is arguably the best soccer player to ever live.\n\nBut each of these teams has its problems that could keep them from glory.\n\nGermany, for example, has a new crop of young players that still don\u2019t mesh well with the older players who lifted the last trophy. Brazil underperformed in the last tournament, even though the competition took place in Brazil. The team embarrassingly crashed out with a 7-1 loss to Germany in the semifinals and now seeks redemption.\n\nFrance was riddled with personality clashes in the past and lately has failed to rise to the big occasion, Wahl told me. For example, France made it to the finals of the European championship two years ago, but lost 1-0 to an inferior Portugal side.\n\nSpain\u2019s best players \u2014 primarily midfielder Andres Iniesta \u2014 are quite old and there are questions about who, exactly, will score goals for the team. And finally, Argentina has lost four straight finals in major competitions, including falling to Germany in the last World Cup.\n\nOf course, there are still other great teams in the tournament like Belgium, Croatia, and Uruguay. With so many talented squads vying for the top prize, this could be a World Cup to remember.\n\n6) Who are the best players at the World Cup?\n\nThere\u2019s no way to do an exhaustive list here, as there are too many top players at the World Cup to count. Still, it\u2019s worth mentioning a few names.\n\nAll lists like this must start with Portugal\u2019s Cristiano Ronaldo and Argentina\u2019s Lionel Messi. One of these two players have won the Ballon d\u2019Or \u2014 the world\u2019s best player award \u2014 every year since 2008, each earning the title five times. (In 2007, Ronaldo was named the second-best player in the world, and Messi third.)\n\nCrucially, neither player has won a World Cup, hurting each man\u2019s chances of being considered the best player in soccer history. Messi came the closest after leading Argentina to a World Cup final in 2014, but ultimately lost to Germany. Ronaldo, at least, won the European championship in 2016 with Portugal.\n\nBut there are other world-class players in this tournament. Brazil\u2019s Neymar is seen as the heir apparent to Ronaldo and Messi, angling to snatch the world\u2019s best player award from them soon (he was named the world\u2019s third-best player in 2015 and 2017). France\u2019s Antoine Griezmann was 2016\u2019s third-best player and could potentially lead his country to World Cup glory.\n\nSpain\u2019s Andres Iniesta is arguably the best midfielder on the planet even at 34 years old. This will be his last World Cup, though, and he\u2019ll surely want to win a second trophy before he retires from international competition. But Belgium\u2019s Kevin De Bruyne will want to prove that he\u2019s the new creative force on the global stage.\n\nWhat\u2019s also fun is that every World Cup heralds the global discovery of relative unknowns because of how well they play. In 2014, for example, Colombia\u2019s James Rodriguez surprised global soccer by netting six goals, earning him a coveted place at the soccer giant Real Madrid after the tournament.\n\nHere\u2019s who could become this year\u2019s Rodriguez: Egypt\u2019s Mohamed Salah had a record-breaking season playing for Liverpool in England, and nearly singlehandedly led his team to the World Cup for the first time since 1990. He\u2019s arguably already an elite player. That\u2019s all the more special because he comes from the Middle East, a region that rarely produces top talent.\n\nFrance\u2019s 19-year-old Kylian Mbappe is shockingly talented for someone so young. He could use the World Cup to show that his prodigious gifts are for real and help lead his team to a title.\n\nFinally, Sweden\u2019s Emil Forsberg is a very skilled midfielder who has already made a name for himself playing in Germany. The problem is world recognition has eluded him and he has yet to become a household name. That could all change with a string of great performances if he helps his team beat expectations and go far into the knockout rounds.\n\nDon\u2019t forget the goalkeepers! No, they won\u2019t strike wonder goals, but they could stop them with miraculous, lightning-quick reflexes and acrobatic dives. Five keepers in particular stand out among the talented throng: Germany\u2019s Manuel Neuer, Spain\u2019s David De Gea, Costa Rica\u2019s Keylor Navas, France\u2019s Hugo Lloris, and Belgium\u2019s Thibaut Courtois. You can expect these goalies to make game-winning saves when it matters most.\n\n7) Is there an official World Cup song?\n\nOhhhh yeahhhh.\n\nThis year\u2019s is called \u201cLive It Up,\u201d and it\u2019s performed by Nicky Jam, Era Istrefi, and \u2014 I can\u2019t believe I\u2019m typing this \u2014 West Philadelphia-born-and-raised Will Smith. The song was produced by Diplo, the mastermind behind some major hits.\n\nTake a listen:\n\nIt\u2019s undoubtedly a catchy jam, but that hasn\u2019t stopped a controversy from brewing about a World Cup song. One of the major critiques is that the song has, as some have argued, a \u201cLatin American feel.\u201d That vibe, critics on social media say, doesn\u2019t make much sense since the 2018 World Cup takes place in Russia. That\u2019s led some to wonder why a Russian group \u2014 or at least an Eastern European musician \u2014 didn\u2019t take the lead on the anthem (though Istrefi is from Kosovo).\n\nLet\u2019s be real: A World Cup song hasn\u2019t been a perfect representation of the host country since 1994. That\u2019s when Daryl Hall (sans Oates) performed \u201cGloryland\u201d for the competition held in the US.\n\nIn 1998, FIFA gave the World Cup song, \u201cCup of Life,\u201d to Puerto Rico\u2019s Ricky Martin, even though the tournament took place in France. (I would\u2019ve preferred \u201cLivin\u2019 La Vida Loca,\u201d frankly.)\n\nAnd when South Africa held the tournament in 2010 \u2014 the first time an African country hosted the competition \u2014 the song \u201cWaka Waka (Time for Africa)\u201d was performed by ... Shakira.\n\n(There are more examples, like when Pitbull sang the song for the 2014 World Cup in Brazil \u2014 yes, really \u2014 but you get the idea.)\n\nMany people wanted an African musician to sing the 2010 tournament\u2019s official song instead of the Colombian pop star. But Kyla-Rose Smith, a member of the South African band Freshlyground, didn\u2019t think FIFA choosing Shakira was such a big deal.\n\n\u201cI think that the World Cup is a global event but it\u2019s also a business, a huge marketing exercise,\u201d she told PBS in 2010. \u201cFIFA requires a musician of a certain global reach to appeal to all the different kinds of people who are involved and witness and watch the World Cup. So I understand the choice of someone like Shakira.\u201d (Freshlyground did get to perform in the background for \u201cWaka Waka.\u201d)\n\nFIFA eventually offered some music slots to African artists, like Somali hip-hop star K\u2019naan (a personal favorite of yours truly), as part of its sponsored music content.\n\nBut it\u2019s likely the official World Cup song will stir up controversy every four years until FIFA chooses an artist that better represents that competition\u2019s host nation.\n\nYou can hear snippets of every official World Cup song since 1982 here:\n\n8) Where will the 2022 World Cup take place?\n\nQatar. Yes, you read that right: Qatar.\n\nIn 2010, FIFA awarded the 2022 World Cup to the tiny Middle Eastern nation, the first time a Mideast country will host the tournament. That\u2019s noteworthy, but the Qatar selection has become a major controversy.\n\nQatar is an extremely authoritarian country that subjugates women and others based on their sexual or gender orientations, according to Human Rights Watch. The country\u2019s human rights deficit extends into how it mistreats migrant workers who are literally building the subsequent World Cup facilities.\n\nQatar relies heavily on those laborers, which comprise about 95 percent of the total workforce, or 2 million people. Most come from places like Asia or Africa and work nearly 12 hours day and live in terrible conditions.\n\nA 2013 report from the International Trade Union Commission estimated that 4,000 migrant workers would die between 2014 and the 2022 World Cup. \u201cWhether the cause of death is labelled a work accident, heart attack (brought on by the life-threatening effects of heat stress) or diseases from squalid living conditions, the root cause is the same \u2014 working conditions,\u201d the report concluded, using data from the Indian and Nepalese embassies.\n\nPart of the problem is that the country is extremely hot and typically reaches temperatures above 100 degrees. That puts thousands of workers in life-threatening heat as they race to prepare facilities for the 2022 competition.\n\nThe Qatari summer heat is so bad that FIFA moved the World Cup to the winter, setting the final match for December 18, 2022, Qatar\u2019s National Day. That\u2019s a huge deal: All modern World Cups take place in the summer, in part so the event doesn\u2019t interfere with regular season schedules for professional soccer leagues in England, Spain, or elsewhere.\n\nThat\u2019s not all: FIFA president Gianni Infantino wants to expand the tournament to include 48 teams, 16 more than will compete in the 2018 World Cup. \u201cI firmly believe in an enlargement because I am convinced that it is good for the development of football,\u201d he told the BBC in April. That may be true, but it would certainly be good for FIFA\u2019s wallet.\n\nHaving that many teams, though, would be a problem for Qatar. After all, it\u2019s a very tiny country and is already struggling to have everything ready for 32 teams in 2022. If Qatar has to host 48 squads, it would likely exceed its capacity. That\u2019s why there\u2019s some talk of asking Kuwait to co-host the competition. Kuwait, for now, seems interested.\n\nThere\u2019s nice symbolism in having the World Cup take place in the Middle East for the first time ever. But you have to wonder: Is giving the honor to Qatar really worth it?\n\n9) Okay, so who will win World Cup 2018?\n\nSo after all that, who\u2019s going to win, you ask. Well, I obviously don\u2019t know, but I\u2019m going to choose France.\n\nHere\u2019s why: France is in an easy group (Group C), and should \u2014 should \u2014 comfortably finish in first place. That means it would meet the runner-up of Group D in the round of 16, which I believe will be Croatia. Croatia is a very solid team, but France has the firepower to get past them.\n\nIn the quarterfinals, I believe France will play either Uruguay or Portugal (if pressed, I\u2019d say Uruguay). France should dispatch either of those talented squads too. That takes the French team to the semifinals, where I think they will face off against Belgium, one of the strongest teams in the tournament. That would be quite the heavyweight fight, but I think France has a bit more experience and quality than the still-young Belgian side, as talented as it is.\n\nSome eagle-eyed readers will ask why I think France won\u2019t play Brazil, a top favorite, in the semifinals. Well, I have Brazil winning its group but losing to my projected Group F runner-up Mexico in a stunning upset. (Hey, you have to live a little with these brackets!) But if it\u2019s Brazil and France in the semifinals, France still has a good shot of pulling out a win.\n\nBeating Belgium would pit France against Germany \u2014 the reigning champions \u2014 in the final (in my bracket, at least). I think France ekes out a win there against a tiring German squad, wresting the trophy away from Berlin. Recall that France beat Germany 2-0 in the European Championship\u2019s semifinal in 2016, and it might pull off similar magic again.\n\nOf course, there\u2019s a really good chance I\u2019m wrong on a lot, or all, of the above. But you have to live dangerously sometimes, and I\u2019m doing so by picking Spain\u2019s archrival to win it all.\n\nMy mom, a die-hard Spanish citizen and fan, has probably just disowned me. (Sorry, Mom!) My sister-in-law, who loves the French squad, hopefully thinks I\u2019m cool now. Meanwhile, my wife \u2014 who already can\u2019t wait for World Cup month to be over \u2014 likely has her head deep in her hands. Still, she\u2019ll root for Germany just to spite me.\n\nI should say this: In my heart, I want Spain to win and for Iceland \u2014 the smallest nation ever to play at the World Cup that is already one of the tournament\u2019s best stories \u2014 to go deep in the competition. But I\u2019m trying to be as levelheaded as a huge soccer fan can be when thinking about the World Cup.\n\nOnce the whistle blows, all debates and subplots subside. At that point, you just have to sit back, watch, cheer, and enjoy the beautiful game.", "images": ["https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/BdpkTro2Hfh3T0HR79nvfz21WOw=/0x0:1743x1175/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1743x1175):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11516105/russian_fans_2.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/XnKmDaM3GBvCHgnJTuE-F7QnkGk=/0x0:957x757/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:957x757):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11423369/Screen_Shot_2018_05_25_at_11.09.52_AM.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/ah2Xui0R86xkGsZrqjvfGmDUO4I=/0x0:5325x2493/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5325x2493):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11516377/3_kylian_emil.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/1RmIWkfimYs8fwmGIpjH88IVWrY=/0x0:1560x990/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1560x990):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11518765/worldcup_groups.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/_MvqR4o8b9Jy7ZrQUKeK17Lbk0M=/0x0:3500x2257/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3500x2257):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11503677/germany_2014_celebration.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/dvJCU7eppwvJzqkt6Ks2zuQIyqU=/0x0:5184x3456/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5184x3456):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11504273/usa_trinidad_tobago_game.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/IVitzC5Nhm1UahD3h2F643YuuEk=/0x0:1800x1013/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:1800x1013):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11519241/bracket_board.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7h3p2kvbPGenTYJppRIn-wbkOfk=/0x0:4790x3188/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:4790x3188):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11504543/GettyImages_452113916.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/acfDCxRUazeUUS5zFxW6NiRuLxA=/0x0:3000x1846/1200x675/filters:focal(923x810:1403x1290)/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_image/image/59978995/leald.1528319527.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/-816tKxb2L2e2KTzu6Hay_7_6dQ=/0x0:3000x3711/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x3711):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11518875/1_grid_question_color_enhance_v2.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLpFGTlKM3ac5mm9-M6r1xqbtqY=/0x265:3000x1836/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11517717/leald.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/gnTVKc5vrEP-bgl_FCoadTlR6eY=/0x0:3000x1865/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:3000x1865):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11504111/lynch_fifa_indictment.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/mkM6IjSPYqSjljnG1lzSrZ8HXp4=/0x0:2972x1797/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:2972x1797):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11517297/GettyImages_518129144.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/sOFBrLyIFlU40MjFTybDCopsfRQ=/0x0:5184x3277/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5184x3277):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11517321/GettyImages_452107032.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/7W_716AgFhBbHrYyo63mYjP55s8=/0x0:5184x3347/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5184x3347):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11504003/putin_handover.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f3MFqCMtdTZRvU1hnKNiVpemKlQ=/0x0:4200x2800/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:4200x2800):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11426241/835860078.jpg.jpg", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/PCo_J4-5kfKKueI7qiPyNAnB9sU=/0x0:5325x7452/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:5325x7452):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11504691/2_grid_players.png", "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/KdrmImz0o32NeexCuP28JWab3HQ=/0x0:724x371/1200x0/filters:focal(0x0:724x371):no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11423291/Screen_Shot_2018_05_25_at_11.06.35_AM.png"], "top_img": "https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/tLpFGTlKM3ac5mm9-M6r1xqbtqY=/0x265:3000x1836/fit-in/1200x630/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/11517717/leald.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Alex Ward", "Jul"], "canonical_link": "https://www.vox.com/2018/6/12/17356780/world-cup-2018-russia-teams-schedule-tickets", "title": "The 2018 World Cup, explained", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, shrink-to-fit=no", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Vox", "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/Vox", "published_time": "2018-06-12T06:00:01-04:00", "modified_time": "2018-07-11T13:48:21-04:00"}, "author": "Alex Ward", "style-tools": "https://www.vox.com/style/community/441/ff4dfa009ef17ae1c4f5b58aee1eab98/tools.css", "p": {"domain_verify": "d4410485bd6277c2bf2ce0f277819dc6"}, "msvalidate.01": "D385D0326A3AE144205C298DB34B4E94", "ahrefs-site-verification": "1e57a609922037a3fbdc1c22efd7334113f174f15608f37e1b8538a7b4ce64c3", "description": "The World Cup starts with Russia and Saudi Arabia on June 14.
