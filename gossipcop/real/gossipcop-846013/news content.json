Authorities later revealed that she likely died of complications from stage IV cancer.\n\nBaio, 56, appeared on The Bernie & Sid Show on Monday to discuss his former Joanie Loves Chachi costar\u2019s death. \u201cFor me, you do drugs or drink, you\u2019re gonna die. I\u2019m sorry if that\u2019s cold, but God gave you a brain, gave you the will to live and thrive and you gotta take care of yourself,\u201d he said, sparking controversy on social media.\n\nThe Charles in Charge alum\u2019s comments came shortly before officials released the likely cause of death. In his Facebook post on Monday night, he explained to fans that he had been misinformed by false news reports claiming Moran had died of a heroin overdose.\n\n\u201cThis made me very upset and angry,\u201d he wrote, recalling the moment he read the incorrect headlines. \u201cThis is one of my worse fears for her, or anyone else. Especially in this business. I was on an emotional roller-coaster. I hadn\u2019t slept well since the news of her passing.\u201d\n\nMultiple media outlets picked up on Baio\u2019s controversial comments after the likely cause of death was revealed. \u201cNow it seems every news outlet & tabloid wants to paint a different picture of me and of what really happened,\u201d he wrote on Facebook. \u201cThey\u2019re stating that I\u2019m saying drugs caused her to die after it was reported stage 4 cancer. This is so wrong! Now I truly understand the meaning of \u2018Fake News.\u2019 This is crazy.\u201d\n\nDespite the controversy, Baio has continued to mourn the actress. \u201cPlease stop assuming the worst in me,\u201d he wrote. \u201cI\u2019m a compassionate person. I\u2019m very heartbroken over her passing, especially since it was cancer.\u201d", "images": ["https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/bg-subscribe.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered-green.svg", "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/672271470_scott-baio-erin-moran-happy-days-zoom-5053f28c-1e4c-4a87-a268-bfb40107279c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/shop-with-us-new.png", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/placeholders/default-usweekly-square.svg", "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/svg-icons/logo-tag-registered.svg"], "top_img": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/672271470_scott-baio-erin-moran-happy-days-zoom-5053f28c-1e4c-4a87-a268-bfb40107279c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Us Weekly Staff", "Nicholas Hautman"], "canonical_link": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scott-baio-clarifies-comments-blaming-erin-morans-death-on-drug-use-w478786/", "title": "Scott Baio Clarifies Comments Blaming Erin Moran's Death on Drug Use", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "ir-site-verification-token": "-206090124", "fo-verify": "49e6fc6a-c68d-447f-9978-70e3eac455ac", "post-format": "video", "post-cats": "Celebrity News", "theme-color": "#fff", "robots": "index, follow, max-image-preview:large, max-snippet:-1, max-video-preview:-1", "description": "Scott Baio took to Facebook to retract the comments he made that falsely connected his former 'Happy Days' costar Erin Moran's death to drug use \u2014 details", "og": {"locale": "en_US", "type": "article", "title": "Scott Baio Clarifies Comments Blaming Erin Moran's Death on Drug Use", "description": "Scott Baio took to Facebook to retract the comments he made that falsely connected his former 'Happy Days' costar Erin Moran's death to drug use \u2014 details", "url": "https://www.usmagazine.com/celebrity-news/news/scott-baio-clarifies-comments-blaming-erin-morans-death-on-drug-use-w478786/", "site_name": "Us Weekly", "updated_time": "2018-02-08T22:11:22+00:00", "image": {"identifier": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/672271470_scott-baio-erin-moran-happy-days-zoom-5053f28c-1e4c-4a87-a268-bfb40107279c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "secure_url": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/672271470_scott-baio-erin-moran-happy-days-zoom-5053f28c-1e4c-4a87-a268-bfb40107279c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "width": 1200, "height": 630}}, "article": {"publisher": "https://www.facebook.com/UsWeekly", "published_time": "2017-04-25T20:40:20+00:00", "modified_time": "2018-02-08T22:11:22+00:00"}, "author": "Us Weekly Staff", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "title": "Scott Baio Clarifies Comments Blaming Erin Moran's Death on Drug Use", "description": "Scott Baio took to Facebook to retract the comments he made that falsely connected his former 'Happy Days' costar Erin Moran's death to drug use \u2014 details", "image": "https://i0.wp.com/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/672271470_scott-baio-erin-moran-happy-days-zoom-5053f28c-1e4c-4a87-a268-bfb40107279c.jpg?crop=0px%2C0px%2C2000px%2C1050px&resize=1200%2C630&ssl=1&quality=62&strip=all", "creator": "@usweekly", "site": "@usweekly"}, "spons": "no", "tragedy": "off", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/cropped-us-logo.png?w=270&quality=86&strip=all"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493152820.0, "source": "https://www.usmagazine.com", "summary": ""}
