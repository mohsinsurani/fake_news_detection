There is still hope that we can find Madeleine.\u201d\n\nMs McCann told the BBC: \u201cI think you know we\u2019ve had so many supporters who are still with us, people that we don\u2019t know who are still there, and I guess I just want them to be reassured that there is progress being made.\u201d\n\nDuring the interview, Mr McCann, 48, acknowledged it was \u201cdevastating\u201d not to have found Madeleine but said the most important thing was holding on to hope of tracing her.\n\nKate and Gerry McCann, whose daughter Madeleine disappeared from a holiday flat in Portugal ten years ago, during an interview with the BBC's Fiona Bruce at Prestwold Hall in Loughborough (Joe Giddens/PA Wire) (PA)\n\n\u201cWe are still looking forward, I think that\u2019s the most important thing \u2013 we still hope,\u201d he said.\n\n\u2715 Madeleine McCann 10 years on: Detectives still pursuing critical leads\n\nAsked how he and his wife were coping 10 years on, Mr McCann answered: \u201cI think we\u2019re doing a new normality really, particularly over probably the last \u2013 and it seems like a long time saying it \u2013 but over the last five years.\n\n\u201cSince the Metropolitan Police actually started their investigation, it has taken a huge pressure off us, individually and as a family.\n\n\u201cAfter the initial Portuguese investigation closed, essentially, no-one, no-one else was actually doing anything proactively to try and find Madeleine.\n\n\u201cAnd I think every parent could understand that what you want \u2013 and what we have aspired to \u2013 is to have all the reasonable lines of enquiry followed to a logical conclusion.\u201d\n\nAs well as dismissing criticism of the cost of the Met\u2019s inquiry as unfair, the McCanns said they intended to continue a legal battle against former detective Goncalo Amaral, who wrote a book about their daughter\u2019s disappearance.\n\nConfirming that the couple still plan to contest a Portuguese court ruling handed down in January, Mr McCann said: \u201cWe haven\u2019t launched that yet, but it will be going to the European courts.\n\n\u201cWhat people really need to realise though is, as (Met Police) Assistant Commissioner (Mark) Rowley has said again this week, and the Portuguese have said in the final report \u2013 there\u2019s no evidence that Madeleine is dead and the prosecutor has said there\u2019s no evidence that we were involved in any crime.\u201d\n\nThe couple also commented on the impact of social media criticism of them, urging people to think twice before posting hurtful comments.\n\nMr McCann said of online abuse directed at the family: \u201cI\u2019m sure it is a very small minority of people who spend their time doing it, but it has totally inhibited what we do.\n\n\u201cPersonally, we don't use social media, although we have used it in Madeleine\u2019s campaign.\n\n\u201cBut for our twins who are growing up in an era where mobile technology is used all the time, we don\u2019t want them not to be able to use it in the same way that their peers do.\u201d\n\nMs McCann described the actions of some people online as shocking but said she preferred to focus on the support many more people had offered.\n\nThe apartments at the Ocean Club in Luz in the Algarve, Portugal, where Madeleine McCann went missing (Steve Parsons/PA Wire)\n\n\u201cActually the main thing that we have experienced is the goodness of people and the support that we have had over 10 years, which hasn\u2019t wavered in all that time,\u201d she said.\n\nAsked how the McCann \u201cfamily unit\u201d had managed to stay strong during the hunt for Madeleine, her mother said: \u201cWhat people do say is that you don\u2019t realise how strong you are until you have no option.\n\n\u201cAnd I think that\u2019s very true. Obviously massive events like this cause a lot of reaction, a lot of trauma and upset.\n\n\u201cBut ultimately you have to keep going \u2013 and especially when you have got other children involved.\n\n\u201cSome of that is subconscious I think \u2013 your mind and body just take over to a certain extent. But if you can\u2019t change something immediately, you have to go with it and do the best that you can.\u201d\n\nAdding that she had tried to ensure her now 12-year-old twins had a normal, happy and fulfilling life, Ms McCann, a former GP, said her return to work in another area of medicine had helped her re-establish as normal a life as possible.\n\n\u201cMy hope for Madeleine being out there is no less than it was almost 10 years ago,\u201d Ms McCann said.\n\nEarlier this week, Ms McCann, aged 49, said in a message on the Official Find Madeleine Campaign Facebook page: \u201cWe are bracing ourselves for the next couple of weeks.\n\n\u201cTen years \u2013 there\u2019s no easy way to say it, describe it, accept it. And now here we are... Madeleine, our Madeleine \u2013 ten years.\n\n\u201cMost days are similar to the rest \u2013 another day. May 3rd 2017 \u2013 another day. But ten years \u2013 a horrible marker of time, stolen time.\u201d\n\nPress Association", "images": ["https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg?quality=75&width=982&height=726&auto=webp"], "top_img": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Matthew Cooper"], "canonical_link": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/madeleine-mccann-parents-vow-to-find-her-kate-gerry-portugal-missing-investigation-latest-a7709591.html", "title": "Madeleine McCann\u2019s parents vow to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to find her", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0, user-scalable=no, minimum-scale=1.0, maximum-scale=1.0", "description": "\u2018It might not be as quick as we want, but there\u2019s real progress being made and I think we need to take heart from that\u2019", "theme-color": "#EC1A2E", "amp-google-client-id-api": "googleanalytics", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 235586169789578, "pages": "https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline"}, "category": "Home News", "sitename": "The Independent", "page path": "/news/uk/home-news", "page type": "Article", "adPageType": "Article Page", "og": {"locale": "en_GB", "updated_time": "2017-04-29T23:01:18.000Z", "site_name": "The Independent", "title": "Madeleine McCann\u2019s parents vow to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to find her", "url": "https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/madeleine-mccann-parents-vow-to-find-her-kate-gerry-portugal-missing-investigation-latest-a7709591.html", "type": "article", "description": "\u2018It might not be as quick as we want, but there\u2019s real progress being made and I think we need to take heart from that\u2019", "image": {"identifier": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp", "secure_url": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}}, "article": {"published_time": "2017-04-29T23:01:18.000Z", "modified_time": "2017-04-29T23:01:18.000Z", "section": "News", "subsection": "UK", "author_name": "Matthew Cooper", "content_type": "story", "word_count": 1117, "image_count": 4, "embed_count": 2, "video_count": 1, "internal_link_count": 3, "external_link_count": 0}, "date": "2017-04-29T23:01:18.000Z", "google-signin-client_id": "329250492844-uqochn2f1j5ljkshuap5gc7qphf1refj.apps.googleusercontent.com", "twitter": {"title": "Madeleine McCann\u2019s parents vow to do \u2018whatever it takes\u2019 to find her", "site": "@Independent", "card": "summary_large_image", "description": "\u2018It might not be as quick as we want, but there\u2019s real progress being made and I think we need to take heart from that\u2019", "image": "https://static.independent.co.uk/s3fs-public/thumbnails/image/2017/04/29/17/mccann-1.jpg?quality=75&width=1200&auto=webp"}, "keywords": "missing child,Portugal,Police,Internal"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1493506878.0, "source": "https://www.independent.co.uk", "summary": ""}
