To put that in perspective, that\u2019s higher than the tip of the Empire State Building and the Eiffel Tower. Though it\u2019s hard to believe anyone would let the singer do such a dangerous stunt, Banks said that no green screen or CGI effects were employed to capture the sweeping shots.\n\nThe video opens with Styles \u2014 wearing a black trench coat and leather boots over a white sweater and dark jeans \u2014 walking across a wind-swept field as the camera zooms in for close-ups on his face and hands. As the song\u2019s chorus kicks in, Styles takes off, hovering over a lake, then zooming through the tree tops.
