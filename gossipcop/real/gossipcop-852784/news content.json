{"url": "https://ftw.usatoday.com/2018/01/mtv-the-challenge-competitors-contestants-rankings-johnny-bananas-ct-wes", "text": "MTV\u2019s The Challenge has evolved into another major sport.\n\nAs time has gone on, the competitors have grown more athletic, as have the competitions. The show\u2019s stars are essentially professional athletes at this point.\n\nEvery sports fan\u2019s favorite past time is ranking their favorite athletes, and that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re here to do. Our resident Challenge fans, Charles Curtis and Steven Ruiz, have submitted their personal top-10 lists of competitors, both male and female. We\u2019ve averaged out those rankings to come up with two composite top-10s \u2026 Here they are:\n\nMen\n\n1. Johnny Bananas\n\nCharles: He has to be the greatest of all time, as host T.J. Lavin once told For The Win, and it\u2019s not just because he\u2019s one of the series\u2019 best athletes. It\u2019s the way he manipulates and adjusts to the rules of the game on the fly, which is as much a part of The Challenge as anything else.\n\nSteven: I did not have Bananas as my top Challenge competitor, even though I recognize he is widely considered the GOAT. I just couldn\u2019t put him ahead of a guy who once wore him as a backpack. That\u2019s the argument-ender for me. As far as politics go, Bananas is clearly the greatest to ever do it, but C.T.\u2019s physical advantage outweighs Banana\u2019s mental advantage in my mind.\n\n2. C.T.\n\nCharles: At the height of his best days, he pulled off what Bananas nicknamed \u201cThe Johnny Banackpack incident,\u201d which Steven mentioned above: In a The Challenge: Cutthroat elimination, he carried Bananas on his back and rammed him into a trashcan, one of the greatest feats of athleticism ever seen on the MTV show or otherwise.\n\nHe was frightening and sometimes self-destructive, but ultimately a legend.\n\nSteven: He\u2019s my No.1 guy for one simple reason: The only person who can beat C.T. is C.T. himself. It seems like the only time he loses one of these things is when he beats himself.\n\n3. Wes\n\nCharles: He\u2019s been in finals and won twice, and although I think he might be a tad too high at No. 3, he\u2019s a cunning manipulator. Beware if there\u2019s a swimming challenge, you know he\u2019ll dominate that. His Achilles heel is Bananas, which makes him kind of the Phil Mickelson to Bananas\u2019 Tiger Woods: Great, but could have been even greater if there had been no Bananas.\n\nSteven: Wes has been my personal favorite since he made his debut on Fresh Meat and carried a useless partner to the final despite being a rookie and that season\u2019s biggest target. Wes followed up the impressive debut by winning The Duel, which, in my opinion, is the most stacked season in the history of the show. He\u2019s easily the best strategist to ever appear on the show; if only he had more friends.\n\n4. Darrell\n\nCharles: A five-time winner (I\u2019m counting Champs vs. Pros here too) who is an elite athlete. I was so happy to see him come back to the series after a hiatus with Dirty 30. Should be higher on our list.\n\nSteven: You can\u2019t deny Darrell\u2019s track record. The dude won every show he appeared before finally going out in a recent season. And he, along with partner Aviv, won the second-best season in the show\u2019s history, Fresh Meat.\n\n5. Jordan\n\nCharles: Surprised to see him this high up? You shouldn\u2019t be. He\u2019s made three finals, won twice (including the super-tough Dirty 30) and he\u2019s done it all with one hand. Astounding and an inspiration.\n\nSteven: I\u2019m not really a Jordan fan, and his personality has gotten him into trouble a lot. But he\u2019s won the second-most money in the history of the show and is always a threat to make the final when he appears.\n\n6. Alton\n\nCharles: It\u2019s funny, I agree with what Steven says below \u2014 it feels like he should be higher. Maybe we\u2019re underrating him because he only appeared four times?\n\nSteven: Alton is way too low on this list. He is simply the best athlete to ever appear on the show. I had him at No. 4 on my list because he didn\u2019t really have a social game, but there\u2019s nobody that could beat this guy in a physical challenge during his prime. He is easily the greatest climber in the history of the show.\n\n7. Derrick\n\nCharles: Another vet I\u2019m pumped to see back on the series after he took a few years off. How astounding is it that he made the final of Dirty 30 after all that time away?\n\nSteven: Had Derrick been a few inches taller, he might\u2019ve landed in the top-five. But his size was always a factor and usually the biggest reason he was eliminated during his seven losses.\n\n8. Landon\n\nCharles: Three wins in four seasons. That\u2019s all you have to know. And he did it with a smile on his face, too.\n\nSteven: I\u2019m going to be honest: I forgot how good Landon was when he was regularly appearing on these shows. But the numbers don\u2019t lie: He won 75% of the seasons he appeared on. The guy was somewhat undersized but his athleticism often made the difference.\n\n9. Evan\n\nCharles: Another one of those competitors who could combine the head games with the physical games.\n\nSteven: Evan had a chance to be a top-five Challenge competitor but he, along with the next guy on this list, got into legal trouble stemming from incidents with cast member Tonya. Evan was as physically imposing as C.T., but was easily manipulated.\n\n10. Kenny\n\nCharles: He stands on his own as a solid competitor who liked to stir the pot, but here\u2019s a crazy thought: What if he and Evan were able to compete and got to support their pal Johnny Bananas a few more times? Would Bananas have even more titles to his name?\n\nSteven: Kenny was Evan\u2019s right-hand man but clearly the lesser of the two. He wasn\u2019t quite the competition beast Evan was and his mouth didn\u2019t make for good in-house politics.\n\nWomen\n\n1. Emily\n\nCharles: Four Challenge appearances (including Champs vs. Stars). Two wins, two finals. Like Steven, it\u2019s hard to see her ahead of Laurel, but the record speaks for itself.\n\nSteven: It was difficult to separate Emily and Laurel for me because both women dominated competitions, but Emily\u2019s personality is less grating, which gives her a better social game.\n\n2. Laurel\n\nCharles: If I had to choose any competitor to go into an elimination and win, it\u2019d be her. Yes, she\u2019s had her struggles in various houses, but as far as athleticism, she\u2019s got it and then some.\n\nSteven: I had Laurel as my No. 3, but she might be the most physically-imposing women to appear on the show. She has undoubtedly underachieved in part because of her inability to get along with her housemates. She should have more than one win under her belt.\n\n3. Evelyn\n\nCharles: Ev! Another athlete I wish was still participating. Three wins puts her in the GOAT conversation.\n\nSteven: Evelyn was small but made up for it with unparalleled athleticism. And despite being difficult to get along with at times, her physical abilities made her an ideal ally. There\u2019s a reason she won nearly half the seasons she appeared on.\n\n4. Jodi\n\nCharles: How easily we forget that her three appearances included a pair of wins. I say that knowing that she was lower on my list than on Steven\u2019s, but we don\u2019t know what she would have done in later seasons.\n\nSteven: Charles is severely underrating Jodi, who was my No. 1. I don\u2019t blame him, because she appeared on the show only three times and it was so long ago. But she felt unbeatable when she was on the show. And she basically was, winning two of her three appearances, including The Duel, which I\u2019ve said was the most stacked cast the show has ever seen. It was never a doubt that she\u2019d win that season.\n\n5. Camila\n\nCharles: Dirty 30 was a ridiculously tough season, one that she won. Even when her \u201cCamillinator\u201d personality comes out \u2014 sometimes with extremely negative consequences \u2014 she fights through and gets deep into seasons.\n\nSteven: Camila is overrated in my mind but no woman has ever made more money on The Challenge, so I can\u2019t drop her too low.\n\n6. Cara Maria\n\nCharles: She was always the prospect who never quite brought home the title until Battle of the Bloodlines. I\u2019d love to see her win more, but it seems like she\u2019s rubbed younger castmates the wrong way in recent years, which could be costly going forward.\n\nSteven: Cara Maria went from a layup to one of the best competitors on the show in the matter of a season or two. It was a genuinely impressive evolution, and her success on the show has been made even more impressive by the fact that she\u2019s not the most popular cast member.\n\n7. Sarah\n\nCharles: No, I didn\u2019t put her on my list because of what Bananas did to her in Rivals III (see below). It\u2019s because, like Cara Maria, she made finals left and right until she figured it all out for Battle of the Exes II. If she\u2019d come back again (I wouldn\u2019t either after what Bananas did), I\u2019d bet she\u2019d be in the running with the best of them.\n\nSteven: Sarah was good at making friends and a decent competitor. That\u2019s a good combination. She won two out of her nine appearances, but did take the biggest L in the history of The Challenge.\n\n8. Jenna\n\nCharles: Underrated!!! Her political game isn\u2019t the best, but she makes up for that with the ability to keep up with competitors who might be stronger or tougher. She\u2019s made three finals and I\u2019m certain that if she comes back from an awful Champs vs. Stars injury, she\u2019ll keep getting closer.\n\nSteven: Jenna barely cracked my top-10, to be honest. She\u2019s done a good job of making finals but that has more to do with her not being a threat than her physical or political abilities.\n\n9. Coral\n\nCharles: I actually think we\u2019ve got her right where she deserves to be \u2014 she won Battle of the Seasons with The Miz and got to the finals in three other years.\n\nSteven: I have no doubt we\u2019re overrating Coral here, but she is one of the greatest characters to ever appear on the show. That has to count for something, right?\n\n10. Rachel\n\nCharles: Two wins means she needs to be higher. What did we do wrong here, Steven? Our rankings somehow put her lower than she should be, but that\u2019s how the math worked out.\n\nSteven: Rachel should be higher on this list. She is one of the best athletes to appear on the show, male or female. Only six women made more money from the show than Rachel, who won two of her seven appearances on The Challenge.", "images":
