More info\n\nDaryl (played by Norman Reedus) is rumoured to be taking over from Rick Grimes (Andrew Lincoln) as the show\u2019s lead character once Andrew leaves the show. Despite Norman\u2019s claims otherwise, it would make sense for Daryl to take the lead because he\u2019s been around since the first season and The Walking Dead fans love his character. Furthermore, season nine\u2019s trailer teased Rick and Daryl being at odds in the upcoming season. \"Are we on the same side, Rick?\" Daryl asks in the trailer, to which Rick replies: \"Well, you tell me.\" Now, Norman has revealed at San Diego Comic-Con that Daryl and Rick will share a \u201cf**king epic\u201d scene in season nine.\n\nCould this confrontational scene be what Norman is talking about? \"Episode four of this season was one that \u2013 Andy and I had a scene that was f**king epic, but it was really well-written, and we worked on it, and we really fine-tuned it and got it to a place where it became sort of effortless,\" Norman revealed during a Comic-Con press conference. \"It could've gone in so many different directions, but I think both of us are really proud of that,\u201d he added. Daryl and Rick haven\u2019t always been on the same page, but the two characters have an awful lot of respect for one another. That said, tensions will rise in season nine after Rick\u2019s decision not to kill Negan (Jeffery Dean Morgan) when they captured him in the season eight finale.\n\nThe Walking Dead season 9 spoilers: Daryl Dixon and Rick Grimes clash revealed?\n\nRick decided to lock him up instead, a decision which will cause friction in the group and potentially lead to a leadership challenge. Daryl might be one of the people fighting to take control of the group, yet there are other names in the ring. The Walking Dead\u2019s new showrunner, Angela Kang, revealed that the show\u2019s women would play a more important part in the upcoming season. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see our women really step up,\u201d she told Entertainment Weekly. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna show a lot of stories about leadership with Maggie (Lauren Cohen), with Michonne (Danai Gurira), with Carol (Melissa McBride).\u201d\n\nThe Walking Dead season 9 spoilers: Rick Grimes and Daryl Dixon\n\nThe Walking Dead season 9 spoilers: Rick Grimes and Daryl Dixon back to back\n\nThe Walking Dead season 9
