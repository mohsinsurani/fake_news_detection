Hooker\" in the 1980s and \"Melrose Place\" in the 1990s. She was arrested after the incident in February and posted her $20,000 bail.\n\nShe had issues with substance abuse in the past and most recently entered rehab last year. She was arrested previously in 2008 on suspicion of driving under the influence. However, the charges were later dismissed.\n\nShe was sentenced at the time to three years of informal probation and ordered to pay $700 as a fine and to take a driving safety class.\n\nFox News' Leora Arnowitz contributed to this report.", "images": ["https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/26/896/500/694940094001_5740708487001_5740711136001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/meek-mill-kanye.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/09/348/196/GettyImages-1427614638.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/26/694940094001_5740708487001_5740711136001-vs.jpg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/07/348/196/tom-cruise-top-gun-press-conference.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/kathie-lee-brady-bundchen-copy.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://static.foxnews.com/static/orion/styles/img/fox-news/s/newsletter/fox-411.svg", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2018/09/640/320/78138240-Heather20Locklear_ventura20county20sheriff2.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/10/348/196/Getty_QueenElizabeth_PrinceAndrew.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "https://a57.foxnews.com/static.foxnews.com/foxnews.com/content/uploads/2022/04/348/196/Kanye_West_Kim_Kardashian.jpg?ve=1&tl=1"], "top_img": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/26/694940094001_5740708487001_5740711136001-vs.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Julius Young"], "canonical_link": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/heather-locklear-charged-for-assaulting-police-officer-and-emt-report", "title": "Heather Locklear charged for assaulting police officer and EMT: report", "meta_data": {"viewport": "width=device-width, minimum-scale=1.0, initial-scale=1.0", "description": "Heather Locklear has reportedly been hit with three new charges stemming from her arrest in which she allegedly assaulted police office and an EMT.", "prism.channel": "fnc", "prism.section": "entertainment", "prism.aggregationType": "subsection", "pagetype": "article", "content-creator": "tiger", "dc.creator": "Julius Young", "dc.title": "Heather Locklear charged for assaulting police officer and EMT: report", "dcterms.abstract": "Heather Locklear has reportedly been hit with three new charges stemming from her arrest in which she allegedly assaulted police office and an EMT.", "dc.type": "Text.Article", "dc.description": "Heather Locklear has reportedly been hit with three new charges stemming from her arrest in which she allegedly assaulted police office and an EMT.", "dc.language": "en-US", "dc.publisher": "Fox News", "dc.format": "text/html", "dc.identifier": "urn:uri:base64:fad1dc1e-9c19-50d3-8ae7-5ebfd5386a5c", "dc.source": "Fox News", "dc.date": "2018-08-30", "dcterms.created": "2018-08-30T16:23:06-04:00", "dcterms.modified": "2018-08-30T20:52:35-04:00", "og": {"title": "Heather Locklear charged for assaulting police officer and EMT: report", "description": "Heather Locklear has reportedly been hit with three new charges stemming from her arrest in which she allegedly assaulted police office and an EMT.", "type": "article", "image": "http://media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/26/694940094001_5740708487001_5740711136001-vs.jpg", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/heather-locklear-charged-for-assaulting-police-officer-and-emt-report", "site_name": "Fox News"}, "robots": "noarchive, noodp", "twitter": {"card": "summary_large_image", "site": "@foxnews", "title": "Heather Locklear charged for assaulting police officer and EMT: report", "description": "Heather Locklear has reportedly been hit with three new charges stemming from her arrest in which she allegedly assaulted police office and an EMT.", "image": "https://a57.foxnews.com/media2.foxnews.com/BrightCove/694940094001/2018/02/26/1024/512/694940094001_5740708487001_5740711136001-vs.jpg?ve=1&tl=1", "url": "https://www.foxnews.com/entertainment/heather-locklear-charged-for-assaulting-police-officer-and-emt-report"}, "fb": {"app_id": 113186182048399}, "article": {"opinion": "false"}, "classification": "/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT/GENRES/Crime,/FOX NEWS/ENTERTAINMENT", "classification-isa": "crime,entertainment", "classification-tags": "crime,entertainment"}, "movies": [], "publish_date": null, "source": "https://www.foxnews.com", "summary": ""}
