The comedy actor and comedian wrote on the Fourth Of July, \u201cHappy White People Proud Of Their Racist Ancestors Day.\u201d\n\nHappy white people proud of their racist ancestors day \u2014 Damon Wayans Yunior? (@wayansjr) July 4, 2017\n\nAround 1,100 people liked the tweet, while more than 1,200 replied to it and many users were not pleased.\n\nOne person wrote, \u201cJust another example of Hollywood talking down to Americans. They hate this country & their fans. #FabricatedRacism sadly returns @wayansjr,\u201d replied user @ViperNTheTemple.\n\nJust another example of Hollywood talking down to Americans.

(@wayansjr) July 4, 2017\n\nOne Twitter user wrote, \u201cnot illegal, but offensive and hateful.\u201d\n\nAnother person wrote, \u201cwhen I think of all the men and women who have died for our independence, laughter does not come to mind.\u201d\n\nAnd while some people only attacked the joke, others took things personally.\n\nJasonSmoonen stated, \u201cenjoy what\u2019s left of your already shitty career that your dad created for you.\u201d\n\nWayans replied, \u201cThanks, Jason \ud83d\ude42 Will do :)\u201d\n\nDamon comes from a long line of comics and actors. The 34-year-old comedian and actor is son of Damon Wayans and is the nephew of Keenen Ivory Wayans.\n\nAdvertisement\n\nThe Wayans family are considered to be one of the more fortunate families in Hollywood and are more than familiar with controversy and offensive jokes. In the stand-up world, a joke is subjective, and the person who hears it doesn\u2019t get to interpret what the comedian meant. With all that being said, do you think the joke was out of line? Or was he just having fun?
