Post has been removed or is no longer public.\n\nThese days she\u2019s focused on making music.\n\n\u201cWith regards to music, I don\u2019t want to pigeonhole myself and say I am a musician or a visual artist because I feel like it\u2019s all encompassing, and I feel like every bit of my art is related to the other,\u201d she said. \u201cSo do I want to pursue my music further and see it come to fruition and see something further and see something palpable? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nLast year Love talked about what it was like raising her daughter, whom she described as \u201cenigmatic\u201d like her father.\n\nCourtney Love on raising Frances Bean\n\n\u201cI\u2019m so proud of her,\u201d Love said. \u201cShe won\u2019t do anything until she does it on her own.
