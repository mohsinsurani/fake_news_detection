Even celebrity mothers have learned that birth doesn\u2019t always go as planned. Take Amy Poehler, who\u2019s doctor died the day before her due date. Or Kristen Bell, who had a very crazy reaction coming off her epidural. And then there\u2019s Pink and Jill (Duggar) Dillard, who discovered that sometimes, your baby has a different idea of how he wants to come into this world.\n\nHere are seven celebrity birth stories that will surprise you, make you giggle, or give you those sentimental feels.\n\nAmy Poehler | A Due Date Disaster\n\nThe SNL alum recounts her first pregnancy experience back in 2008 in her book Yes Please, gushing over her old Italian doctor saying, \u201cI was so lucky to have Dr. G as my doctor. I didn\u2019t feel neurotic or stressed. I felt like a success.\u201d\n\nThen, the day before her due date she took a break from rehearsing for SNL to confirm her OB-GYN appointment and received the shock of her life.\n\n\u201cI hung up the phone and told Jon [Hamm] and the hair and makeup people that my doctor had just DIED. And I was DUE TOMORROW.\u201d\n\nIf that\u2019s not a nightmare, we don\u2019t know what is. Luckily Poehler pulled herself together and went on to deliver a healthy baby boy (named Archibald \u201cArchie\u201d William Emerson) with the help of another doctor and a C-section.\n\nJill (Duggar) Dillard | A 70-Hour Labor\n\nIf anyone knows a thing or two about giving birth \u2014 it\u2019s the Duggars. New mom Jill, who is studying to become a midwife, was very prepared for the birth of her firstborn earlier this year. In a special birth episode of 19 Kids and Counting, we were reminded once more that giving birth doesn\u2019t always go as planned.\n\nJill had a very extensive natural birth plan. She readied two midwives in her own home and explained she would be willing to have her child naturally in a birthing tub, bath tub, or shower. Yet, when the time came for Jill to become a mom, her birth plans were thrown out the window.\n\nShe experienced 70 HOURS OF LABOR and ended up having a C-section in the hospital. During the episode, Jill gushed of her newborn son Israel David, \u201cHe\u2019s worth every contraction. Every pain that I had all this long labor. Just getting to see that little baby and hold him, everything, [was] just \u2026 well worth it.\u201d\n\nGiuliana Rancic | A Successful Surrogacy\n\nThe longtime E! News host opened up about her fertility struggles on her show Giuliana and Bill and in her book Going Off Script. She documents the shots she had to receive in her stomach each day and the pain of having her ovaries overstimulated. How she suffered a miscarriage with her first IVF, and how the second attempt didn\u2019t take.\n\nThen when preparing to go through another egg retrieval, a routine mammogram revealed that she had breast cancer. Doctors warned her it would be dangerous to try and get pregnant, so the couple moved on to surrogacy.\n\nIn describing the moment she first held her son, Edward Duke, born via a surrogate in 2012, she writes:\n\n\u201cAs I held our baby in that Denver delivery room, it was truly remarkable to think that \u2026 I had experienced the darkest days of my life and now, the brightest and most beautiful day of my life. I finally had what I wanted most, and every moment felt too precious to waste.\u201d\n\nRancic\u2019s story is a powerful and encouraging one to all of those struggling with infertility.\n\nBeyonc\u00e9 | A New Way to Get Through Labor Pains\n\nQueen Bey\u2019s little girl is known for her unique moniker, Blue Ivy Carter, but have you ever heard about Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s birthing experience? Back in 2012, it was treated with the anticipation of a royal birth, because in a way it kind of was. The singer spoke to Marie Claire about giving birth and how she found a new way to get through the pain, explaining:\n\n\u201cI felt very maternal around eight months [\u2026] and I thought I couldn\u2019t become anymore until I saw the baby. [\u2026] But it happened during my labor because I had a very strong connection with my child. I felt like when I was having contractions, I envisioned my child pushing through a very heavy door. And I imagined this tiny infant doing all the work, so I couldn\u2019t think about my own pain. [\u2026] We were talking. I know it sounds crazy, but I felt a communication.\u201d\n\nDoesn\u2019t seem that farfetched \u2014 more like a great way to get through the pain. She\u2019s the Queen for a reason, right?\n\nKate Middleton | A Speedy Birth \u2014 and Recovery\n\nThe Duchess of Cambridge carried herself so well during her pregnancies, one may not have even noticed she suffered terribly from hyperemesis gravidarum. Her recent birth of daughter, Princess Charlotte, was certainly a quick one. It is said that the royal couple arrived at the hospital around 5 AM and the baby was born a mere two-and-a-half hours later \u2014 most likely without an epidural. Go Kate go! Always the classiest, the couple toasted the birth of their daughter with champagne.\n\nYet, the part we find the craziest in this whole event is the fact that Kate was standing on the steps of the hospital waving to onlookers less than ten hours after giving birth. Talk about a quick recovery!\n\nKristen Bell | An Excellent Epidural\n\nThanks to hubby Dax Shepard, we\u2019ve all heard about Kristen Bell\u2019s C-section with daughter Delta last year, in which Shepard exclaimed, \u201c\u2018It\u2019s a girl! Your liver\u2019s out, I think! And those are definitely intestines. And she has your eyes. Oh, my God, put her back together correctly!\u201d\n\nHowever, Bell\u2019s take on the event is just as amusing.\n\nShe told Ellen DeGeneres that as she came off her epidural she started \u201cscratching her face \u2026 like a meth addict.\u201d When a nurse gave her some Benadryl to ease the transition, Bell started to feel a little wacky, commenting, \u201cDo you know what looks really good when you\u2019re on that stuff? Hand bags. Or throw pillows or rugs. I was just like, \u2018Internet shopping, woo!\u2019\u201d\n\nAfter that mind-altering experience, Bell said she\u2019s done having kids. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to be outnumbered,\u201d she explained. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna cap it at two.\u201d\n\nPink | A Natural Birth Plan That Wasn\u2019t\n\nPink and her husband Carey Hart were very excited about their natural birth plan with daughter Willow Sage back in 2011. They watched documentaries about it and took all kinds of classes to prepare. Pink told People magazine, \u201cI was really looking forward to the whole rite of passage \u2014 giving birth perfectly present, unmedicated, in the way nature intended.\u201d\n\nWell, the birth certainly didn\u2019t go as planned. The baby was in the Frank breech position and no matter what the couple did, they couldn\u2019t turn her around, so after two nights of labor she was delivered via C-section.\n\nPink explained, \u201cTurns out this little girl had other plans \u2014 she is my daughter, after all.\u201d", "images":
