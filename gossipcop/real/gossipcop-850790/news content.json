Several scenes echo moments from the original movie, including the famous cue card scene. This time around Andrew Lincoln\u2019s character queries Keira Knightley\u2019s character about his beard (she isn\u2019t a fan). Meanwhile, Hugh Grant reprises his dance moves, though now he\u2019s a little worse for wear, and Bill Nighy\u2019s character boasts he\u2019s had sex with a Kardashian, but he can\u2019t recall which one.\n\nLiam Neeson, Laura Linney, Colin Firth and Rowan Atkinson also star in the trailer and new sequel made by the original film\u2019s writer-director Richard Curtis.\n\nThe sequel first aired in the U.K. in March to coincide with its Red Nose Day.
