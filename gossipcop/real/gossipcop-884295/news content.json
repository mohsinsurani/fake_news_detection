Dimitriades confirmed Petty\u2019s death on behalf of the performer\u2019s family.\n\nHe was 66.\n\n\u201cHe suffered cardiac arrest at his home in Malibu in the early hours of this morning and was taken to UCLA Medical Center but could not be revived. He died peacefully at 8:40pm PT surrounded by family, his bandmates and friends,\u201d Dimitriades said in a statement.\n\nWith his nasally voice and chiming guitar, Petty and his longtime band, the Heartbreakers, churned out an instantly recognizable brand of sturdy, heartland rock that made them a classic-radio staple for decades. Petty, along with the band, was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 2002.\n\nThe group finished a summer tour with three performances at the Hollywood Bowl last week.\n\nPetty and the Heartbreakers first came to fame in the 1970s. It was both with that group and as a solo artist that Petty had a string of hits across the decades, including \u201cFree Fallin\u2019,\u201d \u201cAmerican Girl\u201d and \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down.\u201d\n\nTheir 1976 debut contained a minor hit, \u201cBreakdown,\u201d but it wasn\u2019t until Petty\u2019s third album, \u201cDamn the Torpedoes,\u201d that he and the band broke through to the mainstream.\n\nThat 1980 album won critical raves, went platinum and spawned the hits \u201cDon\u2019t Do Me Like That\u201d and \u201cRefugee.\u201d\n\nPetty sang with Stevie Nicks that same year on her smash hit, \u201cStop Draggin\u2019 My Heart Around.\u201d The duet kicked off a long and fruitful period of collaboration between Petty and other artists.\n\nHe recorded \u201cDon\u2019t Come Around Here No More\u201d \u2013 memorable for its trippy, Mad Hatter-themed music video \u2013 with the Eurythmics\u2019 Dave Stewart in 1985. Petty joined Bob Dylan on tour the next year, which also included dates with the Grateful Dead.\n\nHe joined fellow music legends Dylan, George Harrison, Jeff Lynne, and Roy Orbison in 1988 to form The Traveling Wilburys. They released two studio albums.\n\nRelated: \u2018Heartbroken\u2019: The music world, fans react to Tom Petty\u2019s death\n\nIt was a rich career for Petty, who was born in Gainesville, Florida and became hooked on rock and roll when \u2013 at the age of 11 \u2013 he met superstar Elvis Presley on a movie set.\n\nPetty joined his first band, The Sundowners, in high school at the age of 14.\n\nAfter getting into an argument with the band\u2019s drummer, Petty quit and moved on to join a group called The Epics, which included Tom Leadon, a brother of Eagles guitarist Bernie Leadon.\n\n\u201cWe realized Tom was the real musician of the band,\u201d their fellow band member Rick Rucker told the Orlando Sentinel in 2006.\n\nThe Epics later changed their name to Mudcrutch, and Petty traveled to Los Angeles in search of a record deal for the rock quintet.\n\nDespite landing a deal, the group soon disbanded.\n\nA new group that included Petty and two former Mudcrutch members formed in 1975, eventually becoming known as Tom Petty and the Heartbreakers.\n\nAfter pioneering the heartland rock sound, Petty went solo in 1989 before regrouping with the Heartbreakers three years later.\n\nHe also found fame as an actor. His flair for drama was on display in his music videos for songs like \u201cMary Jane\u2019s Last Dance.\u201d\n\nPetty starred with Kevin Costner in the 1997 film, \u201cThe Postman.\u201d He also had a recurring role as the voice of Elroy \u201cLucky\u201d Kleinschmidt in the animated comedy series, \u201cKing of the Hill.\u201d\n\nA 2015 biography on Petty documented a dark turn for the singer and his struggle with heroin addiction in 1997, following the collapse of his 20-year marriage and a failed album.\n\n\u201cTried to go cold turkey, and that wouldn\u2019t work,\u201d Petty said in the book. \u201cIt\u2019s an ugly f***ing thing.\u201d\n\nPetty told CNN in a 2007 interview that he loved music as much as it loved him.\n\n\u201cMusic, as far as I have seen in the world so far, is the only real magic that I know,\u201d he said. \u201cThere is something really honest and clean and pure and it touches you in your heart.\u201d", "images":
