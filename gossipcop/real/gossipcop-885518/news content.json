See the incredible before and after pic that he shared, here!\n\nAaron Carter, 29, said he was going to stay off social media until 2018 after going through some serious health issues, but he couldn\u2019t help but jump back on to share something exciting! The singer gained 30 pounds, going from 115 to 145, after two weeks in a treatment facility in Florida. He looks happy and healthy, and feels that way, too! Aaron showed off the before and after results of his weight gain (scroll down to see!) and shared an inspirational message with his fans:\n\n\u201cFrom 115 pounds to 145 In a few weeks. On the left 115 on the right 145 \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffbContinuing to focus on myself and my health. Sorry I couldn\u2019t wait to show you till 2018 \ud83e\udd37\ud83c\udffc\u200d\u2642\ufe0f#proudofmyself #StressFree I missed you all so much. Needed some time to heal and this is a direct result,\u201d Aaron captioned his Instagram photo. Isn\u2019t that amazing? It\u2019s so good to see him doing well, and even better, feeling well.\n\nAaron was struggling with body image issues after \u201cfans\u201d relentlessly asked him why he was so skinny. He revealed that he was diagnosed with a hiatal hernia when he was 19, which makes him have no appetite. Aaron said it was like having an eating disorder. Gaining weight is an incredible accomplishment! Aaron\u2019s rep announced on September 22 that Aaron would be entering a rehab facility to \u201cimprove his health and work on his overall wellness.\u201d It wasn\u2019t just about the stress of his weight. The day before the announcement, cops were called to Aaron\u2019s home after receiving a concerned call from someone worried that he could be suicidal.\n\nAaron released his own statement on Twitter. Aaron told his fans that he was \u201cgoing to get strong. And deal with my stress conditions and get better\u201d at the Florida facility. Though he\u2019s left after just two weeks due to \u201cseveral legal and personal matters,\u201d according to his rep, Aaron\u2019s still \u201cvery much committed to his wellness and will be continually working toward being the best person possible.\u201d\n\nHollywoodLifers, we\u2019re so happy that Aaron\u2019s feeling better!
