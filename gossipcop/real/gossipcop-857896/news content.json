A few were upset and kicked it.\"\n\nGardega said he created his clay and faux bronze \u201cSketchy Dog\u201d as an act of solidarity with guerilla artist Arturo Di Modica, who created Wall Street\u2019s iconic \u201cCharging Bull\u201d statue.\n\n\u201cI have a lot of empathy for the creator of the bull, Arturo. He is very upset,\u201d Gardega said.\n\nArtist Alex Gardega placed his \"sketchy dog\" statue next to \"Fearless Girl.\" Alex Gardega\n\nDi Modica finished \u201cCharging Bull\u201d after the 1987 stock market collapse, and placed it in front of the New York Stock Exchange as a symbol of American resilience. The city initially removed it, but later re-installed it in its current location near Wall Street in the Financial District.\n\nConversely, the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d statue, was commissioned by one of the world\u2019s largest banks \u2014 State Street Global Advisors \u2014 as a way to call attention to the gender pay gap and a lack of women on corporate financial sector boards, according to the company.\n\nState Street is also the creator of the Gender Diversity Index SHE, which tracks gender diversity in companies. An inscription at the feet of \u201cFearless Girl\u201d reads, \u201cKnow the Power of Leadership, SHE makes a difference.\"\n\n\u201cThat piece, [\u2018Fearless Girl\u2019] was not made by some individual artist making a statement,\u201d Gardega said. \u201cIt was made by a billion dollar financial firm trying to promote an index fund. It is advertising/promotion in the guise of art. That was my only point.\u201d\n\nBut Gardega said there is some value in the \u201cFearless Girl\u201d sculpture. He said it\u2019s clear that it makes children happy, and \u201cart is supposed to make kids happy.\u201d\n\nAfter approximately three hours, Gardega took his \u201cSketchy Dog\u201d down.\n\n\"I didn't want to leave it to be taken and certainly had no rights [sic] to bolt it to the ground,\" he said.\n\nIn response to the \"Sketchy Dog\" statue, State Street Global Advisors said it was proud of what \"Fearless Girl\" represented.\n\n\"We continue to be grateful to the countless people around the world who continue to responded so enthusiastically to what the Fearless Girl represents \u2014 the power and potential of having more women in leadership,\" a State Street spokeswoman wrote in an email to NBC News. \"Fearless Girl was created to stand as a reminder that having more women in leadership positions positively contributes to overall performance and strengthens our economy.\"\n\nGardega said that there\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with the \u201cFearless Girl,\u201d and he created \u201cSketchy Dog\u201d with a sense of humor, but he said neither piece should interfere with Di Modica\u2019s work.\n\n\u201cI'm a pretty happy person, not seething or angry and certainly not anti-feminist. My piece is not without a sense of humor but I do feel for Arturo and the integrity of his art,\u201d Gardega said. \u201cThere is plenty of room for \u2018Fearless Girl.\u2019 It just interferes with another artist's work/vision.\u201d", "images": ["https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg", "https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/MSNBC/Components/Video/201704/2017-04-13T11-50-54-533Z--1280x720.focal-760x428.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2020_04/3196356/rima-abdelkader-circle-byline-template.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_focal-60x60,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2019_29/2941436/kahlan-rosenblatt.jpg", "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_fit-760w,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg"], "top_img": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Https", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms Kahlan-Rosenblatt.Jpg", "Kalhan Rosenblatt", "Media-Cldnry.S-Nbcnews.Com Image Upload Newscms Rima-Abdelkader-Circle-Byline-Template.Jpg", "Rima Abdelkader", "Kalhan Rosenblatt Is A Reporter Covering Youth", "Internet Culture For Nbc News", "Based In New York.", "Rima Abdelkader Is A Senior Reporter For Social Newsgathering At Nbc News In New York."], "canonical_link": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/urinating-sketchy-dog-statue-appears-next-fearless-girl-n766071", "title": "Urinating 'Sketchy Dog' Statue Appears Next to 'Fearless Girl'", "meta_data": {"msapplication-config": "https://nodeassets.nbcnews.com/cdnassets/projects/ramen/favicon/nbcnews/all-other-sizes-PNG.ico/browserconfig.xml", "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "fb": {"app_id": 10150138890205613, "pages": 1508175089456029}, "og": {"site_name": "NBC News", "locale": "en_US", "url": "https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/urinating-sketchy-dog-statue-appears-next-fearless-girl-n766071", "title": "Urinating dog statue placed next to \"Fearless Girl\" as a critique", "description": "A clay and faux bronze \"Sketchy Dog\" statue, which appeared to urinate on Wall Street's \"Fearless Girl,\" was placed on Monday.", "image": {"identifier": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg", "secure_url": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg", "type": "image/jpeg", "width": 1200, "height": 630}, "type": "article"}, "twitter": {"site": "@NBCNews", "creator": "NBCNews", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1024-512,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg", "title": "Urinating dog statue placed next to \"Fearless Girl\" as a critique", "description": "A clay and faux bronze \"Sketchy Dog\" statue, which appeared to urinate on Wall Street's \"Fearless Girl,\" was placed on Monday.", "card": "summary_large_image"}, "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1, user-scalable=yes", "description": "A clay and faux bronze \"Sketchy Dog\" statue, which appeared to urinate on Wall Street's \"Fearless Girl,\" was placed on Monday.", "branch": {"deeplink": {"title": "Urinating dog statue placed next to \"Fearless Girl\" as a critique", "description": "A clay and faux bronze \"Sketchy Dog\" statue, which appeared to urinate on Wall Street's \"Fearless Girl,\" was placed on Monday.", "image": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_nbcnews-fp-1200-630,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg", "type": "article", "unibrow": "U.S. news", "authorThumbnail1": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2019_29/2941436/kahlan-rosenblatt.jpg", "authorName1": "Kalhan Rosenblatt", "authorThumbnail2": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/newscms/2020_04/3196356/rima-abdelkader-circle-byline-template.jpg", "authorName2": "Rima Abdelkader"}}, "article": {"opinion": "false", "content_tier": "free", "published": "Tue May 30 2017 19:38:02 GMT+0000 (UTC)", "modified": "Tue May 30 2017 19:38:05 GMT+0000 (UTC)"}, "thumbnail": "https://media-cldnry.s-nbcnews.com/image/upload/t_social_share_1024x768_scale,f_auto,q_auto:best/newscms/2017_22/2018046/170530-sketchy-dog-mn-0940.jpg", "next-head-count": 103}, "movies": [], "publish_date": 1496173082.0, "source": "https://www.nbcnews.com", "summary": ""}
