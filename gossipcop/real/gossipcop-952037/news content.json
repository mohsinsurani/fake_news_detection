I think Bruce never really got over the fact that I rocked the bald look better than he did,\u201d Moore joked. \u201cAfter our divorce, he said he considered the end of our marriage his biggest failure, but Bruce, don\u2019t be so hard on yourself, you\u2019ve had much bigger failures. I mean Planet Hollywood, \u2018Hudson Hawk,\u2019 \u2018Striking Distance,\u2019 campaigning for Michael Dukakis, turning down Clooney\u2019s role in \u2018Ocean\u2019s Eleven\u2019 to focus on playing the harmonica?\u201d\n\nOn a more sentimental note, the actress, who was married to Willis for 12 years, said their marriage included \u201csome of the best times of my life,\u201d praising him as \u201ceasily one of my top three husbands.\u201d After the roast, Willis told reporters her performance was \u201cterrific\u2026very surprising and very cool,\u201d and he was just as shocked as the audience about her appearance.\n\nThe roast, recorded Saturday at the Hollywood Palladium, was led by Roast Master Joseph Gordon-Levitt, along with an assorted group of roasters, including Edward Norton, Cybill Shepherd, Jeff Ross, Martha Stewart, Lil Rel Howery, Dennis Rodman, Kevin Pollak, Nikki Glaser and Dom Irrera. Although still packed with burns on Willis and jokes against Donald Trump and Harvey Weinstein, the roast was more gentle and loving than most, with essentially all of the participants speaking on what the actor has meant to them.\n\nGordon-Levitt, who played a younger version of Willis in their film \u201cLooper,\u201d told Variety that Willis asked him personally to host, and when prepping the material he \u201cworked with the writers and said yes sometimes, said no a lot more.\u201d\n\n\u201cI was like \u2018That\u2019s not funny, that\u2019s not funny, that\u2019s not funny, that\u2019s pretty funny.\u2019 We\u2019re just trying to make each other laugh, I actually think that there\u2019s something cool about being able to laugh at yourself, not take things too seriously and I think it can be sort of cathartic,\u201d Gordon-Levitt said.\n\nNorton and Shepherd walked away as the big winners of the night, with Norton\u2019s bit focusing on how his and Willis\u2019 careers have differed, questioning, \u201cYou get away with everything. Can I cock my eye and say some cryptic s\u2014 that literally not one person in the room understands and have everyone laugh their asses off? I cannot.\u201d\n\nAfter continually trying to understand Willis\u2019 success (joking it was somehow in spite of poor scripts and repeatedly doing the same type of film), Norton reflected on working with him on a recent movie, saying, \u201cI love you, or maybe I\u2019m a very good actor and I\u2019m just acting when I say that. You wouldn\u2019t know the difference, and that\u2019s the reason I love you.\u201d\n\nShepherd, who starred alongside \u201cMoonlighting\u201d with Willis and infamously fought with the actor on the project, said she hadn\u2019t spoken to him in three decades but still agreed to be a roaster.\n\n\u201cOur characters on \u2018Moonlighting\u2019 weren\u2019t much of a stretch,\u201d she said. \u201cI played a former model, which I was, and he played an a\u2013hole, which he is\u2026 I know we haven\u2019t had a conversation in 30 years but we\u2019ll always have something more important: residuals.\u201d\n\nRodman, who attempted a pro-North Korea joke, was booed on stage, and Ross, who is also a co-executive producer on the show, arrived at the event dressed as Kim Jong-Un.\n\nAfter the taping, Ross said he \u201cfelt like this was a classier roast than we normally do. I thought it was pretty classy, he\u2019s a movie star we classed it up with tuxedos and Martha Stewart.\u201d\n\nWhen it came for his time to speak on stage, Willis said, \u201cIf you\u2019re a fan of Bruce Willis movies and I know you are, then you know how this works. I get the s\u2014 beat out of me for about an hour and a half, and then at the end I come back and whip everybody\u2019s a\u2013,\u201d proceeding to roast his roasters.\n\nHe ended by clarifying why he subjected himself to be the subject of a roast, which he said was to settle something once and for all: \u201c\u2018Die Hard\u2019 is not a Christmas movie. It\u2019s a god damn Bruce Willis movie!\u201d\n\nFollowing the event, Willis teased that he \u201cthought I dislocated my jaw because I was laughing so hard.\u201d\n\nBruce Willis closes out #BruceWillisRoast with a harmonica solo pic.twitter.com/BrzPQM0dhk \u2014 Kirsten Chuba (@KirstenChuba) July 15, 2018\n\nThe \u201cComedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis\u201d airs on the network July 29 at 10 p.m.", "images": ["https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/public/lazyload-fallback.gif", "https://pixel.quantserve.com/pixel?a.1=&a.2=p-31f3D02tYU8zY", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=315552255725686&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://sb.scorecardresearch.com/p?c1=2&c2=6035310&c3=&c4=&c5=&c6=&c15=&cv=2.0&cj=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rexfeatures_9762044be_edited.jpg?w=681&h=383&crop=1", "https://www.facebook.com/tr?id=586935388485447&ev=PageView&noscript=1", "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rexfeatures_9762044be_edited.jpg?w=1000", "https://px.ads.linkedin.com/collect/?pid=1429113&fmt=gif"], "top_img": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rexfeatures_9762044be_edited.jpg?w=1000", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Kirsten Chuba"], "canonical_link": "https://variety.com/2018/scene/news/comedy-central-roast-bruce-willis-demi-moore-1202873581/", "title": "Demi Moore Appears as Surprise Guest at Bruce Willis\u2019 Comedy Central Roast", "meta_data": {"theme-color": "#fff", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0", "apple-mobile-web-app-status-bar-style": "black-translucent", "msapplication-config": "https://variety.com/wp-content/themes/pmc-variety-2020/assets/app/browserconfig.xml", "msapplication-TileImage": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/variety-favicon.png?w=128", "msapplication-TileColor": "#eff4ff", "description": "As the focus of the Comedy Central Roast, Bruce Willis was hit with repeated jabs, including the surprise appearance of ex-wife Demi Moore.", "alexaVerifyID": "4IBqfMBcohHTnitnTLanYijElhs", "fb": {"admins": 697514199, "pages": 12616252196}, "robots": "max-image-preview:large", "cXenseParse": {"pmc-lob": "variety", "pmc-page_type": "article", "articleid": 1202873581, "author": "Kirsten Chuba", "pmc-category": "News", "pmc-over_1_year": "yes", "pmc-post_type": "post", "recs": {"publishtime": "2018-07-15T08:11:23"}, "pmc-tag": "bruce willis,Comedy Central Roast of Bruce Willis,Demi Moore", "title": "Demi Moore Appears as Surprise Guest at Bruce Willis\u2019 Comedy Central Roast", "pageclass": "article", "pmc-vertical": "scene", "pmc-branded-content": "no", "pmc-evergreen": "no", "pmc-primary-category": "News", "pmc-primary-vertical": "scene", "pmc-is_vyvip_article": "no"}, "apple-itunes-app": "app-id=416179538", "generator": "WordPress 6.0.2", "author": "Kirsten Chuba", "apple-mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "mobile-web-app-capable": "yes", "apple-touch-fullscreen": "YES", "apple-mobile-web-app-title": "Variety", "application-name": "Variety", "ia": {"markup_url_dev": "https://variety.com/2018/scene/news/comedy-central-roast-bruce-willis-demi-moore-1202873581/?ia_markup=1"}, "content_type": "Article", "post_id": 1202873581, "title": "Demi Moore Appears as Surprise Guest at Bruce Willis' Comedy Central Roast", "published_at": "2018-07-15 08:11:23", "image": "https://variety.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/07/rexfeatures_9762044be_edited.jpg?w=1000", "comment_count": 9, "tags": "Demi Moore", "topics": "News", "appeared_in_print": "No", "body": "As the focus of this year's Comedy Central Roast, Bruce Willis was hit with repeated jabs about his age, his marriage, his Planet Hollywood business venture, his side music career and his recent string of less-than-spectacular films -- and most of them came from the surprise appearance of ex-wife Demi Moore.\r\n\r\nSaying that she was \"married to Bruce for the first three 'Die Hard' movies, which makes sense because the last two sucked,\" Moore served as an impromptu roaster as she recounted memories of raising their three daughters, who were also in attendance, together.\r\n\r\n\"People wonder why our marriage came to an end, and in all honesty I think it was because some jealousy started to creep in.
