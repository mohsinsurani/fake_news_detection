{"url": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/amber-tamblyn-open-letter-james-woods", "text": "Many on Twitter have responded to the allegations, some supporting Amber and making allegations of their own.\n\nJames, however, equated much of the response to his initial tweet about Armie Hammer's movie, Call Me by Your Name, to \"trolls,\" even adding that he likes Armie as an actor.\n\nTwitter content This content can also be viewed on the site it originates from.\n\nTeen Vogue received an open letter from Amber Tamblyn to James Woods, which is printed in full below. We've reached out to Woods's agent, but we haven't yet been able to connect.\n\nDear Mr. Woods,\n\nWhat you are experiencing is called a teachable moment. It is called a gift. It is called a humbling. It is called Jesus, I come to thee. It is called an awakening. It is called a growth edge. It is called hope.\n\nThe hope being that through this experience, you can change. You can redefine the man who will come after this moment and this man who came before.\n\nSince you've now called me a liar, I will now call you a silencer. I see your gaslight and now will raise you a scorched earth.\n\nMy friend Billy and I were at the Roxy on Sunset Boulevard seeing a band we loved. We decided to go to Mel's diner on Sunset Boulevard in Hollywood to get burgers after. I had just gotten my driver's license and very specifically remember my nervousness trying to park in the diner parking lot. Upon leaving the restaurant we were stopped by you and your friend, who both seemed very nice. At one point you suggested we should all go to Las Vegas together. \"It's such a great place, have you ever been?\" You tried to make it sound innocent. This is something predatory men like to do, I've noticed. Make it sound innocent. Just a dollop of insinuation. Just a hair of persuasion. Just a pinch of suggestion. \"It will be so much fun, I promise you. Nothing has to happen, we will just have a good time together.\" I told you my age, kindly and with no judgment or aggression. I told you my age because I thought you would be immediately horrified and take back your offer. You laughed and said, \"Even better. We'll have so much fun, I promise.\"", "images": ["https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59b941b961993376b0288953/16:9/w_2560%2Cc_limit/GettyImages-693284854.jpg", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo.ba28e9df68104824291913727893bf4aaf22e564.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/5e7d1322f69afe0008eedbaf/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://www.teenvogue.com/verso/static/teen-vogue/assets/logo-reverse.c9fd2ea81f6f84a7d604882e3d5f7ab119aeee5a.svg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/632b156ece237db3b0cd8c48/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633c62275c918c75bc64733e/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63360d6c55284445707e12b5/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/63403a02741d4e9d391116dc/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/633f1aa2038a40336b350a05/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59b941d8a9c19825187553cb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amberfbfbf.jpg", "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/630e56cfba7149ed91c70a32/1:1/w_350%2Ch_350%2Cc_limit/undefined"], "top_img": "https://assets.teenvogue.com/photos/59b941d8a9c19825187553cb/16:9/w_1280,c_limit/amberfbfbf.jpg", "keywords": [], "authors": ["Cond\u00e9 Nast", "Teen Vogue Staff"], "canonical_link": "https://www.teenvogue.com/story/amber-tamblyn-open-letter-james-woods", "title": "Amber Tamblyn Pens Open Letter to James Woods", "meta_data": {"msapplication-tap-highlight": "no", "viewport": "width=device-width, initial-scale=1", "referrer": "no-referrer-when-downgrade", "author": "Cond\u00e9 Nast", "copyright": "Copyright (c) Cond\u00e9 Nast 2022", "description": "Amber Tamblyn alleges James Woods tried to pick her up and invite her to Vegas at age 16, an accusation that Woods called a lie.
